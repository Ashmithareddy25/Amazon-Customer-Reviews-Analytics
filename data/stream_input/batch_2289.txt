B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Did not finish movie - could not understand the scene settings - choppy story - horrible!!! Would recommend you save your money!
B004SBX112|5.0|I think the inventors of the Angry Birds series should be prosecuted for selling an addictive product (smile).  These games have been great tension relievers. I used to laugh at adults who wasted time playing video games. Now that I'm one of them, I don't care what others think.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have never watched a 007 movie before but my son wanted to watch it so I watched it with him. I really liked it! I loved the song in the beginning of the move too :)
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I use this app almost every day and night, i use this app as i go to sleep. The timer function is great. The only thing i would like to be added for the sound clips to be longer and more deversis.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|The movie is entertaining and all of my kids liked it from 4 to 13. What more do you need in a movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This seems the most authetic NDE I've read about. As a neurosergeon the technical side  is fascinating. Also the conclusion that at the heart of science re: the' Big Bang' Iis Love is iin line with the best of religious beliefs.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Is a great comic book and now it's a great movie it was redone very well the animation is great very frank Miller Esque
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am glad that i got a chance to download this  game its good and i really enjoyed it, almost missed my stop this morning coming to work bcuz i was so caught up playing this game... this is a must av
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run it is the best app I have ever gotten in my whole life!I have never played anything better than temple run 2.If you have never played it. before you will love it now.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This trilogy will debated til the end of time and there isn't a breath left in peoples' lungs. My opinion is as follows...The Matrix, the highlight of the three, the ABSOLUTELY groundbreaking and revolutionary movie that was ahead of it's time in 1999. Blew the door of any standards and raised the bar to ridiculously high levels. The Matrix Reloaded, lots of fun with crazy and evolutionary set-pieces and fights. Along with providing a look deeper into the Matrix and the human world of Zion. The Matrix Revolutions, delving further into the Matrix, Zion and the fight against the machines. It's clear the path that was laid our for Neo was....SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT!!!!!! Okay, as I was saying, the path laid our for Neo was that of Jesus Christ...Matrix(the birth) Reloaded(the life) Revolutions(the death). !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILERS END NOW!!!!!!The Matrix could have gone down in history as a stand alone movie, this is the truth. And yes, both movies STILL seem to live in it's shadow, but honestly, this is a hell of a sci-fi story and one that should be experienced. The addition of the excellent Animatrix just supports the trilogy as a whole and gives a deeper insight into the films...period. Lots of different styles and great fun to watch. The special features are EXTENSIVE and will give you as much behind the scenes info on all three films as you could ever want. This IS the definitive Matrix package. All 3 films look and sound FANTASTIC, no worries there. All in all, this really is something all fans of movies should check out...atleast once. Highly recommended.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app works gr<br />great for me.  purchased it and have used it almost everyday for a few weeks now.  I like using the filters.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love d.v. im only 10 and I play it so much! I recommend it to anyone who gets bored on their free time.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|this book did exactly what books should do transported me into a different reality.  Yes it was dysfunctional.  I still loved the characters and their \\"Titanic-like\\" direction...excellent read...
B008GVSOCQ|5.0|This movie is really well done by /Academy Award winning director Ang Li. Great visuals, The key scenes are handled with just the right amount of drama to convey the essence of the story line which is that some relationships have a great sensibility about them  but may not be the ones that make the most sense. It all works its way out through the movie. Well done.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Have not been a fan of Nicholas sparks in the past, but since I saw the movie, I thought I would give the book a try. I was pleasantly surprised. His writing style seems to have improved from earlier works and the character development was good. I liked how he got inside the mind of the abusive husband and the reader is able to see how he justifies his actions. The ending is a little unbelievable and fairy tale-like, but overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a good beach read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show gets better every year. It is very real, and one relates to the characters even though this is set a century ago.The house is magnificent. I got to see it in person last year. The show uses the same furnishings that have been in the house for centuries. This season had some surprises which I was not expecting and was very upset about. I knew things couldn't go on as they were forever, but it was still upsetting. I cannot wait for next year to get here. I am dying to know what happens next.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've watched in a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good drama and doesn't mind gore.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game is really fun. I love the challenge of finding all of the objects. great game. Keep them coming.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever!!! I have already read it and it amazed me again. If you are ever looking for an action-packed, exciting adventure look no further.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Breaks down the '5 love language' to an understandable level.  Good insight into relationships and how they 'work' and how to make them better!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|This movie should be watched when you're not depressed.  It's filmed in a gloomy area of the country about a sad subject but acting is great.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|This was an entertaining movie. I liked to see all the old video games I used to play long ago.
0446343129|5.0|This book will open your eyes.  It is an easy read.  Even though it was writtten many years ago, it is still applicable to today's food world...maybe even more so.
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|I loved this movie. My kids loved it too. It goes to show everyone that just because you think things are bad is not always right.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. My problem is with the person who cast Jack Black in this movie. He just doesn't fit.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter is completely into Monster High. This was a great addition to her collection. She can't wait for the next release. Thank you.
B008220C38|1.0|I did not care for this movie at all. Not what I was expecting. The movie style is not for me.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Well acted and a great story about how life can go up and down inside and out.  Attitude prevails.  Word.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This wasn't the movie for me. It wasn't just darker than I imagined, the comedy wasn't quite funny. I didn't finish the movie so maybe it got better in the end.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action, flow, and continuation of the Bourne story. It's an easy way to spend a few hours on a snowy day.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie is not what I expected and I couldn't help feeling I'd seen it all before. I felt like the ending kind of cheated and there were too many unresolved plot points. Still not sure what Theron's role in all of this was supposed to be. The special effects were good enough, but the plot didn't hold up its end.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|This works great with my kindle fire.  Prints photo, word docs, excel docs, etc.  Wish it would print out web page or emails though. would recommend
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I kept hearing the movie was funny and I did find moments of laugh out loud humor. I grew up watching the original Flash Gordon movie, so the Sam Jones cameo was awesome. I liked the pop culture references throughout too.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|I love that this came with iTunes and VuDu digital formats too. Great movie. I'm a true twi-hard fan. The extended scenes were good - just wish there were MORE!!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|It is a different story and I enjoyed it. Not sure why the full frontal was necessary for Hunt, but the movie is effective in portraying the struggle to find one's sexual voice.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|This book was hilarious. I loved the characters, and I loved the dialog. I loved the sweet love story of Anna and Etienne.
034580404X|5.0|You want a good book series i would definitly choose this one.  You will never be able to stop reading it!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. The ending was unexpected and wonderful. I was crying hard at the end. The movie is good but enjoyed the book more.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great movie...kids loved it!  We watched it twice in the same day because we enjoyed it that much.  Good for 6 year olds and up.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I laughed and also cried a little reading Charlie's letters. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The acting and directing were top notch! Intense, brilliant, and without a doubt one of the best movies of 2012!
B003I55BIA|3.0|Slightly predictable but a fun romance book. I didn't like the  strange use of Spanish and random slang in the story. If you look past that, it's a pretty good story.
B00BLGZDVS|4.0|Fantastic film, but the quality of the HD stream through my PS3 app was a bit off (switched between HD to standard frequently). Could have been my connection. Not sure renting the HD version of films is worth the extra $1.
142311339X|5.0|The book The Lost Hero is one of the five book in the series of witch two haven't come out yet.This book is a must read book about a boy who finds himself on an incredible journey of greek mythology. I would reccommend this book for 9-14 year olds as it is long and has difficult words throughout the book.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Umusable; repeatedly tried, un able to start up/ real disappointment / I'll be very sad to have to delete it?<br />NO STAR AT ALL
B00514HDNW|3.0|Quick read-Love end of the world fiction.Just not into this particular genre(vampires) as much as zombies and other EOtW scenarios.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got this for my wife for her new Kindle Fire HD and she said it is great. It stands the Kindle as the product description says it does unlike some other cases out there. She recommends this case highly!
B009YU9J0E|5.0|I love Crystal Castles. Fantastic album from a unique musical perspective. Seamless download. This one gets a lot of airplay.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I haven't stopped listening to this since it arrived - my family is ready to  pull the plug on my CD player!  I can close my eyes and see the movie play over and over...
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have used this application so many times for so many things I would be lost without it. I have used it to read my textbooks for school, and I have used it to keep and maintain my husband's documents for his entire span of treatment for Pancreatic Cancer. This has been truly a wonderful app and it is so easy to use!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a great way to push your brain and the challenges that you have to be on the game. It is
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The EBAY App for my Kindle works perfectly and is much easier to read and maneuver than the standard site I had been accustom to using.
B00846REIS|4.0|Easy to follow and fun to read. Hard to set this book down once you start it. Would definitely read another by Sylvia Day
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Is it just me? The game becomes unresponsive and choppy at the very beginning,  it cannot be played at all, my husband has it on his iphone and I like the game but in my kindle fire it doesn't  work.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Does this blu ray DVD come in the orange slip case?<br />Looks very cool from the trailers. Want the slip case though.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Me and my wife both highly enjoyed this movie. Had no idea it even existed, but after watching the trailer, we were intrigued. Great acting, great story and very entertaining. Quite fascinating to be honest as its a true story. Highly recommended.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Other than my old ears straining to deal with the strong accents of the characters, the movie was visually and audibly stunning.  Special effects are taken to a new level here.  Instead of car chases, monsters and destruction...well you will see.<br /><br />A twisted tale that is well worth the price of admission.
1455523550|5.0|I love this book!  I couldn't put it down and read it all at once.  Excellent cover and fantastic book.  Exactly as described.  Thank you!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This is a very ok to good game needs more levels but over all this is a pretty darn good game.
030758836X|5.0|You are drawn in from the first page. The writing is amazing, I couldn't put it down 'till I finished!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The GOOD:<br /><br />I've seen both the Broadway play and this movie.  I think they did a very good job in both.  Crowe's Javert is obviously a man of control; one who doesn't show emotion unlike the Broadway character.  I'm okay with that since he's consistent throughout the movie (doesn't have sudden bursts of fit).  I love how they brought in Colm Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter plays a bad guy so well in any movie!  I thought Eponine did an amazing job!<br /><br />The BAD:<br /><br />MY PROBLEM IS THE SUBTITLES!!!  I've seen this problem in other movies, but it only shows the first half of any sentence or phrase the character says!!!  Because I've seen and listened and performed the songs, I know most of what is said, but my mom or anyone else who's never seen this will have trouble making out some of the phrasing.  I know it's hard to do subtitles for a musical, especially with multiple people singing parts at the same time, but it happens through the entire movie!  I'm really annoyed!!!
0061353248|5.0|My daughter bought this book for school, and has become a real fan of Dan Ariely. She has gotten my son and husband to read this  book and others of his since.They all loved it. I'm just waiting for my turn at it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been a Pinterest fan for quite a while, but was happy to know I can now check everything out on my Kindle Fire.  Very convenient.<br /><br />I recommend it because it offers so many categories to enjoy, pin, comment, etc.<br /><br />I gave it a 5 star rating, because it is a fabulous, educational, informative site, and has something for everyone.  No disappointment in any shape, form or fashion here.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Modern day remake of movie with newer kids, revised love story, modern set, Faster paced music Still like the original 80's cast better with Kevin Bacon and John Lithcow
1451675046|4.0|Dawkins didn't disappoint in his latest book, \\"The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True\\".  It is a very accessible book, with chapters such as \\"What are things made of?\\" and \\"Who was the first person?\\".  Dawkins explains the concepts in this extremely well, so that anyone can understand what he's talking about.  He also adds a few myths in most of the chapters, about the topic of that chapter.  Highly recommended to anyone wanting to know more about the scientific themes discussed.
B005KMX866|4.0|I love this set and am so glad that I noticed there was a 2 CD set. Chris's voice is as great as ever and his band is the best. If you ever get a chance to see Chris Isaak live, don't let the chance pass you by. They put on a great show! Thanks for the great music!
B001G060V6|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie.  It's frantic at points, sentimental at others, and has amazing characters, dialogue and costumes.  Fances McDormand plays a buttoned up reverends daughter/nanny thrown into the less-than-conventional lifestyle of actress/singer (Amy Adams)  for a whirlwind 24 hours of juggling men, parties and career ambitions.  Takes place in London pre-WWII, and has a great deal of heart.
B008VBYN80|4.0|More playablity than other games where you build kingdoms.  I like the fact that you get to invade and also build armies.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I DO LOVE THIS GAME.  SHOWED IT TO MY SISTER AND SHE WANTS TO CHECK INTO IT FOR HER GRAND DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE LOVES TO DRAWER.  WELL DRAWING ISN'T TOO GOOD WITH THIS GAME, BUT IT IS FUN TO SEE THE STICKMAN JUMP INTO THE BOOK.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the big manision! I love the games where you have to look for things and its cool you have to do it with a flashlight or scrambled words sometimes.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is really fun. its 3D which makes it even funner!  and its free so get it. la la la la la
B009GX69RK|3.0|Even if you like this show, you have to admit it's pretty digusting. The characters have glimmers of real humanity and sometimes there are good scenes but those are always quickly nullified by a sex joke. Like the first season, the characters are oddly inconsistent and really flipping shallow. You can't help but like most of them for some reason or another, but at the same time, you kind of want to punch them for being so stupid.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I know of no one who compares to the mental, physical, and the emotional toughness of Adam Brown and anyone who can qualify as a Navy Seal.  Move over wimps!  Quit whining! Read this book and gain strength in everything you do in your life.<br /><br />Charge on for what's good, what's right, and what makes a difference in the lives of others.<br /><br />Absolutely anyone and everyone should read this book.  There is a good amount of spiritual reference, and thank heaven, there's also no apologizing for it!
B00002SWEM|5.0|The product arrived through the mail system ahead of the expected date.  Having been to Cuba two times before the film gave a great perspective of their music and its roots as well as a wonderful perspective of local activity in the streets. The video put us back there on vacation for a while.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|No hay mucho q decir de esta pieza de arte. I love it! Un clasico necesario en la lobreria de peliculas de todos los tiempos
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Richard Thompson always rocks but I was supposed to have the MP3 version automatically sent and it hasn't been to my wireless devices.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The title is a complement, because you know a game is awesome when egos are on the line and people take it way to seriously.  Catan is usually the go to board game me and my friends go to when we need something to pass the time.  Every game is a worthwhile experience!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Based on my personal preference alone I gave this book three stars because it focused more on the stories and experiences of the armed forces rather than civilian stories. It was well written and I could follow the writing easily. Some points in the book really had me excitedly imagining what these people looked like and the setting the writer was depicting. Pretty good book!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|spent days buying animals and houses to put them in. lost it all. deleting this app.. what a collosal waste of time.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Bought this CD mostly on reputation and how I enjoyed his previous two solo albums and his performance of Mirrors on SNL.<br /><br />To say this album is different is a vast understatement.  It is not your typical pop music CD.  Songs are very long, around 7-8 minutes.  This is an album that I would play in the background.  Outside of Mirrors and Suit and Tie, I do not see a major radio success.<br /><br />That being said, it is clear Justin was going for something else with this CD.  It is clear he has great passion for music and wanting to stay true to himself and not give in and make a pure pop album.<br /><br />I like this album but it clearly isn't for everyone
B008QMMEOE|3.0|I let my kids play with the free version, I forgot to use the freetime app and they upgraded it.
B009EANE3M|5.0|Listened to the whole CD multiple times already and I have had this CD for about 1 week.<br /><br />When I first got their first album I couldn't stop playing it and I still think it is a great album.  Their second effort while good did not have the same effect on me.  I am glad to say that this album is closer to the first album than the first.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone that has enjoyed The Script's previous albums
B00321GTJU|5.0|Until David Attenborough and the BBC have a new version, this show replaced his older version as the best nature show. My kids can watch the bears or the sharks jumping, time after time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really cool its like the best app ever. keeps me entertained when ever I'm bored I love horses so any one who really likes horses will love it
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This was a free app of the day, and the first one in a while I keep playing.<br /> Its just hard enough to keep me trying to get to the next level, but surprisingly easy at<br />unexpected levels . I am almost finished, which is bittersweet, like a good book.
0525953728|4.0|Well written story, liked it.  wasn't political just facts of war and training about what it takes to protect our country,  too bad more aren't like him.
B0001I561E|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies!!  Robin Williams out does himself as the Genie!  He makes the movie!  Love it!!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Me ha gustado mucho la edición, aunque esté en inglés es mucho mejor edición que la de aquí en españa, es una edición magnífica.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The kids just love this movie!!  Highly recommend it!  The music is fun we have watched it over and over!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This game will get your brain working. My daughter and I like to play it.<br />Needs a little variety though.
B00942X8PY|3.0|There's nothing WRONG with this game. It works fine, though the graphics are unappealing. The game itself is okay, but once you've beat the first 35 levels, you're kind of over it. And the &#34;TRY OUR OTHER GAMES&#34; splash on startup is annoying, especially for a paid app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome app I thought it was very addictive app. I just played the original and this is so much better!!!!!!!!!
B001G70M6S|5.0|Without these films the greatest of camera inventions of the 19th century will be permanently doomed to sit unused and dusting in display cases. Thanks Fuji!
B00785P2QC|5.0|So awesome great game dis game is like one of da best virtual city games I played ever n its so cool
B00017LSK8|5.0|Great product for all Polaroid lovers and users! Hate that great camera invention of the 19th century go extinct!. Keep the product running and rolling....
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app... Very addictive. one could spend the whole day playing it. It's very well planned.nsometimes a bit slow; but great nonetheless.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We thoroughly enjoyed the continuing story of Downton Abbey and all of the interwoven lives it includes.  The only reason that I didn't assign the maximum 5 stars was the lack of closed captioning.  Due to hearing impairment, I rely heavily on the use of captioning and lacking it, I missed many of the nuances of the dialog.  Can't this be made available?
8132023579|5.0|The disregard of a dying woman's bequest, a girl's attempt to help an impoverished clerk, and the marriage of an idealist and a materialist -- all intersect at an estate called Howards End.<br /><br />The fate of this country home symbolizes the future of England in an exploration of social, economic, and philosophical trends during the post-Victorian era.<br /><br />And ... there may or may not be any doves or sunflowers there. Despite the cover art. But still worth a read.
B007I1QUHG|1.0|Could not  VIEW the product as it was FOREIGN formatted.<br />I had waited 3 mos. to watch film...when I discovered THIS discrepancy. I notified<br />MOVIE MARS.....&#34;THEY&#34; state this item cannot be returned to them because<br />of the time element.  It would have made NO difference when I tried to view<br />this item.....IT COULD NOT WORK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.<br /><br />BEWARE of dealing with these &#34;people&#34;.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is better than the old button calculator I had in college. Easier to read, functional and simple to use.
B003BZXI6E|5.0|I recall the stir she created in the early '60's. I recall the 'gift'  of her talented voice through the decades.  But until recently, the only Streisand music I  bought was the sheet music to Second Hand Rose( in 1964). This production is quite a departure for Streisand,  mostly because of it's small jazz ensemble venue.  Barbara delivers a very sensitive, pensive performance, with top flight jazz musicians. I recommend it to musicians and non-musicians alike.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This novel is rich and complex, full of twists and surprises, and extremely well written. I loved reading every chapter. Each one moved the story forward. Each one was interesting and made you want to read the next one. Highly recommended!
B004G600A4|5.0|This is the best movie in the history of movies.  The characters, the magic, the laughter the tears, just beautiful.  Fun for kids. Fun for A-dullts.  The folks who made this movie really know their stuff.<br /><br />Greatness!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Awesome series. watched it when it was originally on, and enjoying going thru series again and catching some of the finer details I missed the first time around
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|said i needed yo update my flash player when it already  was. never got to watch it had to go out and rent at redbox
1439156816|5.0|This was the first book I ever read by Stephen King.  I loved it.  It caused me to go read others, and it felt like I had the inside secrets of those because I had read this one.  I know this is going to sound totally weird, but there was a zen-like quality to this book that just made me happy.  King described the craft from the inside and he made me understand his perspective on writing.  He made me want to be a writer.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|The game is fun but for some reason it will not load for me and more after days of trying I gave up. The bad part is that I thought the game was fun but its really frustrating when I spent so much time trying to save money to buy things for my park.

B0044IABFS|4.0|At this point the show takes a dip in quality (5 stars for first three seasons). Perhaps it deserves 3? but the success from before lifts it up. I still enjoyed it, still kept me on the edge of my seat. Constant suspense and drama!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is all I could ask for in a free calculator.  My only constructive criticism is that It takes a surprising amount of time to load on my kindle fire hd (still only ten seconds or so)and it can only be used in portrait mode and not landscape.  When I am multitasking, sometimes it would be nice not to turn my device on its stand.  Still five stars, great app.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|There should be no surprises for anyone who watches this film, we all know what happens in the end. According to Zero Dark Thirty one woman single handedly caught Bin Laden. Movie was not realistic and should have focused more on Navy Seals. It's worth a Redbox rental but not a purchase.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really liked this one....it held your interest through the entire book....I would recommend highly to everyone that likes a mystery/thriller
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a GREAT game. It is challenging with money and is just super awesome. Great app-- You should get it!
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I have been able to play all but two of the movies I tried to watch on my Kindle.  The quality and ease of use are good.  The controls all pop up from the margin, and are not always consistent in their touch response.  The only frustration has been that it requires several operations to close fully.  That is a minor distraction, however.  The player has performed well and I continue to use it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I heard about &#34;The Secret&#34; a few years ago. It was nice to read something in print. Very interesting and motivating!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I got a Kindle with USB issues, but Amazon wouldn't help because the Kindle could be used with some computers, just not many.  So I reluctantly tried this App, and was amazed at how fast and easy to use it was.  This app is as fast as connecting via USB, and does all the things I wanted to do via direct connection.  I am very happy with the performance of this App.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|This is one in the 6 sets that we have from the angry birds collection.  Great game, better for the eyes than the ipad.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Best parts of the movie were shared during previews...watch the preview, laugh and save 2 hours of your day to watch a better movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Almost finished reading it....hard to put my tablet down!!  Love reading while sitting on the beach!  Great way to store books without taking up shelf space!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amaxing anyone who isnt sure should so get it. You can buy so many characters and once you buy them all theyll still be more you can buy because theres always a diffrent season you never now whats next. Right now its rome the vop is dressed like an esterbunny. Lol
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Received in plenty of time for Easter...great since it's a basket gift!  I know my grandson will love it!  Great price and never had to visit the local department store!
B002ZG98LO|1.0|worse than avp requiem.... wtf.... barely anything happens. adrian brody is not an action star. the only character remotely interesting is fishburne. p.o.s.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Just another game that resembles all other games like this. It was free when I downloaded it so I didn't waste my money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun! My high score is like, unbeatable. All of my friends try to beat it, but fail. This is probably the best game I've discovered for mobile.
B008CT2CV6|5.0|I bought both this movie and Clash of The Titans. It just brought me back to when movies were just a pleasure to watch, without the cursing and nudity.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Good story, We enjoyed it despite the fact that there was no graphic violence or nudity. Recommended for the entire family.
B003RV23KE|5.0|I bought both this movie and Wrath of the Titans. It just brought me back to when movies were just a pleasure to watch, without the cursing and nudity.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode keeps me on the hook. It has characters I really like and some that I can't stand. I like how the characters have evolved due to the stresses of different situations. I would recommend going back to the first season to start if your just getting into the series.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|So romantic and fun to watch. Almost felt what each girl went through. I never thought Jude Law was attractive, but I do now.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This story, centering around perceptions of who to trust when you have no memories was really well plotted. Like mysteries written 50 years ago, you will find yourself vacillating between theories during the whole time you are reading it.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I don't like this game for I don't understand it. When I play it and move to the next level it alway ask for money.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|this is the best movie i have seen out of ten bob swagger is a serious B.A. great story and great action the whole movie is a ten out of ten
B004ZNACA6|2.0|I'm a huge Floyd fan; have all of their vinyl LP releases, have seen them live 3 times and most recently Roger Waters doing The Wall in 2012.  In several cases, I have multiple LP pressings and CDs from different re-masters and / or production houses.  These include the legendary MFSL vinyl editions, Japanese produced vinyl, original vinyl imports, domestic vinyl, MFSL CDs and Japanese imported CDs.  I picked up the Discovery boxed set shortly after it came out, primarily so I could have the earlier stuff on CD in (supposedly) high-quality re-mastered audio.  While more convenient than the LPs, I've been consistently disappointed in the sound quality of this set compared to earlier CDs and especially compared to the vinyl.  I run a Dynavector XX2 Mk II, Graham Phantom Supreme, Sota Sapphire, McIntosh MVP881BR, McIntosh C50, McIntosh MC302 and Rogers Studio 1s for my 2 channel, so the weak audio quality is definitely in the media, not the gear.  As a box set it's convenient, but as an enjoyable audio experience, it falls far short.  Keep that in mind if you choose to purchase.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I got this game primarily for my 6 year old daughter. It is a little bit difficult for her to play however.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It is awful, everytime i try to get on it says network error.  I have no way of going to my facebook page.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book so much I went and bought other books by Gillian Flynn! It is a riveting story, that changes your mind about the people within it as you read. These characters are so real I found myself wanting to hold themand help coach them through the entire book. I could not put it down and I am currently trying to get everyone I know to read it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun game but this is the third time I installed it on my kindle fire. after I get. most of the abilities and upgrades it crashes and wont open any more
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Having never seen the movie I was not prepared for this wild story. The twists and chases kept my heart pounding all the way through! Dennis Lehane is an amazing storyteller and this is an absolute must read!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great cop show and show much more! Keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat! There is no doubt this is one of the best shows I've seen
B004O3YGMC|5.0|At an IT Professional I have used remote connectivity apps for many years. This tool is great and I use it tons. It allows me to just take may Tablet to meetings and be able to connect back to my desktop if needed. I also use it to connect back to my home desktop for many different reasons including if being able to put files on my google drive to  retrieve at work if needed. I also installed the streamer on my mother-in-laws PC to be able to provide remote support for her PC when she breaks it.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Clint Eastwood does it again i another wonderful movie. Really touches the soul. Full of great actors. Definately recommend to anyone.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great addition to my Kindle.  It makes it very convenient to be able to get me email on my Kindle.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like this. time passes so quick and it is for all ages. Team work is involved too especially once you get to the higher levels. making connections and patterns are key to this app. Enjoy!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Obviously very silly, good 'animation'.  Many anti-semantic slurs.<br /><br />Don't recommend highly.  Definately not for kids or serious people to watch.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This brought a new perspective to my routines and daily habits that I hadn't previously thought of. It was a great read and brought a lot of topics for future conversations.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I haven't been playing long, but it seems like something I will enjoy.  I'll try to say more when I've been playing longer.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|Replaced a Linksys product that required reset at least once a day.<br />The multiple SSID's is a nice feature.<br />Range is good too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great read!<br />All my friends loved it too!<br />Highly recommend it!<br />Happy reading and enjoy the series! Emo in PA
B004SDEP38|2.0|people want to actroly use the apps they get. Now this comes along and I am going to depute this because it does not even work.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|I read a lot of reviews saying that the speaker for the Dead was very different from Ender's Game. And it is. But the style and genius of Orson Scott Card is there.<br />It´s a beautiful book about human nature.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Downton Abbey is a 5 star series. No subtitles,<br />slow streaming glitches via Comcast and the lack of Dolby Digital sound resulted in a lower rating.<br />Although the picture quality is good in HD, it does not compare to the picture quality and sound of blu-ray.
0345525558|5.0|I loved the main character in this book, and how through her painful childhood she was still able to finally find love .  I was glad the author did not have her accepting the kindness of others before she did as I feel that the pain and lack of love she experienced in her childhood would have not allowed her to trust anyone for a very long time, if ever.  I also loved the flower's meanings and what they convey..some were quite surprising to me.
B00A2Y9O4W|5.0|It was so good to receive a perfect copy of this, to me, iconic film, of a younger Daniel Day Lewis<br />as a gay young man who was a rebel and became the lover and supporter of his Pakistan friend<br />who wanted to give their part of London a modern beautiful launderette, against all odds.  Very<br />inspiring!
B009O2XY12|2.0|I got to level 70 and became absolutely stuck. I didn't have enough gems to 'buy' the directional arrow so I uninstalled with the idea that now I won't need those extra power tools but when I reinstalled it brought me back to level 70! Bummer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love smart and authentic (to the period) period films??  You'll LOVE this one - excellent series centered around a single noble family and their trials and tribulations (yes, even the rich have trials).<br /><br />Enjoy!
0425263916|5.0|I think most any woman would give nearly anything for this type of relationship.  Okay, so maybe some could only handle a taste of it and get back to a 'normal' relationship, because this is pure obsessive, controlling and anxiety ridden romance at it's best!  I've had a relationship like this (only not with so much jealousy and control issues) and it was off the charts.  It's a must read, if you want to add some sizzle, heat and passion into your life... if only temporarily through Eve and Gideon.  Or spice up your own relationship with some of the heat you acquired by reading this book!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Jeremy Renner does an excellent job with this movie. The stunts are amazing and somewhat believable. Interesting concept with the medication needed for survival.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Never having played a Slender Man game I did not know what to expect. Simple concept, easy to learn, fun to play what more can you ask for. Just make sure you are ready to get a chill down your spine... :)
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I liked the characters and thought the use of amination was great. It is a good theme but may be a little too scary for younger viewers.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|So many sounds to choose from and capability to add others. Although I haven't figured out how to do so, you should be able to mix sounds.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|You are wondering why I give this 5 stars & then complain \\"Enough already!\\"? This has become an exercise in milking the cow until there is no more milk. As good as \\"Rumours\\" is, it is with the possible exceptions of Springsteen's \\"Born To Run\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" & \\"The Wall\\" & The Eagles' \\"Hotel California\\" THE MOST OVEREXPOSED album of all time. How many more times can Fleetwood Mac & Warner Bros. records mine for gold by continually re-releasing & remastering this album?! It's approaching the insanity levels RCA inflicts on Elvis Presley's catalog! As a long time Fleetwood Mac fan I am just weary of the endless adulation & attention this one album amongst nearly forty gets day in & day out! It has totally rendered the rest of their catalog as forgotten to all but their most ardent fans & you never hear any of their other material with the exception of the singles from the first & previous Buckingham-Nicks album (\\"Fleetwood Mac\\") on commercial & independent radio stations anymore. The treatment of the entire Fleetwood Mac catalog minus this album & it's predecessor is a crime. There are actually music \\"fans\\" who believe this is the only album Fleetwood Mac ever released thanks to \\"classic rock\\" radio stations! The last multi-disc repackaging (& remastering) of \\"Rumours\\" was more than enough, but yet here is another multi-disc compilation composed of material, most of which is already available on the last repackaging! This is record companies ripping off unsuspecting fans & it's wrong. Especially so when Fleetwood Mac's early releases from the late '60s & early '70s need serious remastering. Fleetwood Mac are so much more than just the phenomenon known as \\"Rumours\\" & it's a shame their record label & possibly the current incarnation of the band itself (not positive about this one way or the other) are giving such short shrift to their remaining releases, especially the early ones to keep fans shelling out for endless repackagings of this one, played to death album. Fleetwood Mac fans who are not familiar with their catalog other than the Buckingham-Nicks releases, do yourselves a favor. DO NOT shell out the almost twenty bucks for this & go back & check out the pre-Buckingham-Nicks releases instead, especially from the blues-based Peter Green-led incarnations, the first & only rockabilly/blues release made after Peter Green's departure (\\"Kiln House\\"), & the first two releases (\\"Future Games\\" & \\"Bare Trees\\") & last release (\\"Heroes Are Hard To Find\\") by the Bob Welch led incarnations. \\"Penguin\\" & \\"Mystery To Me\\" are not bad, but do not measure up as well as the other three albums listed above from the Bob Welch era. You are missing out on a lot of great, forgotten music on those early albums. There is something called \\"too much of a good thing\\" & the endless \\"Rumours\\" hype & repackaging has become just that! \\"Rumours\\" is a great album, but then so is the rest of their catalog great. It's long past time Warner Bros. records & Fleetwood Mac treated their entire catalog as such. Lastly, would everyone PLEASE forget & stop bringing up the soap opera type atmosphere \\"Rumours\\" was conceived in. That's been repeated to death almost as much as the album itself! There is nothing cool or good about divorce & relationships breaking up! The music made \\"Rumours\\" great, not the circumstances under which it was produced. Warner Bros. & Fleetwood Mac: STOP repackaging \\"Rumours\\" & remaster the early albums to the better sound quality they deserve! Rant over!
B0058W74UY|1.0|Can't use the app  on Kindle Fire or my Aluratek tablet  .In fact, can't open it. I can't figured out why GooglePlay says it  is compatible with the devices.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|Nice actoral work done by Russell Crowe.  He does a very good job as the desperate husband that takes such  high risks to see his family together, after the flase murder accusation of his wife.
B000I8HIR2|2.0|I tried to buy this movie on the watch it now but couldnt watch the movie its self due to Amazon problems. Amazon says lack of payment but I was unable to buy it in the first place.<br /><br />Good movie though
B000MYFILK|5.0|Great movie! I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory were a great pair together.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Saga very interesting if you like Blue Bloods and history<br />and extreme wealth.  You may learn a bit on how they lived.<br />or get hooked on the &#34;love - hate&#34; story
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a very good book. I enjoyed it very much, Nicholas Sparks is the best.  I can't wait to see the movie I wanted to read the book first they say it is always better than the movie.
0790729369|3.0|I had never seen this until now, but had heard it was wonderful. I did not find it so, as there was not much chemistry between the two actors. I love Meryl Streep, but was not convinced enough of her being italian. And I could not for the life of me figure out why she was a doormat with her own children. Really? She had raised them, how could she not have instilled the warm regard and respect for a mother in them? Hard to identify with a character who casually commits adultery with a man she has just met.  Because I wasn't convinced of the attraction. Clint just seemed not that into her and just this guy looking for free sex. Fooey.
1616550414|5.0|I ordered this book for my son, who collects Zelda items.  It arrived in excellent condition and he was very happy at what he received.  I would recommend this book for all Zelda fans out there.
0345803485|2.0|I didn't love this book - I got a little bored halfway through realizing the sex scenes were very repetitive.  He whips her, he beats her, he spanks her, then he whips her again.  Could have done with more of a story.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of fun great game really enjoy playing all the time. Stay up half the night playing this game and on it all day
B005B19UPE|4.0|This book was great but very sad.  The story stared in Paris and then took you all over the world and ended up in America in the present day.  A very moving tale about the Holocaust and this little girl hiding throughout the war and discovering Sarah's story changes the life of the writer.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|I am happy with the watch, is my first one &#34;big case watch&#34; but looks great on my hand.  Only thing is that..I do not like too much the band.
B00A4B9A1U|5.0|This book is an unfailingly honest look at American history from the presidency of Woodrow Wilson to the present.  It lays bare all of the superpower's complicity in supporting dictatorships to subvert peace and democracy whenever possible.  The chapters dealing with Kennedy's presidency, as well as more recent times are especially detailed and informative.  I commend this book to anyone who is beginning an interest in international relations or twentieth century history.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|GOOGLE HAS IMPROVED THE WORLD .......... HE THOSE BE PERIODS  FOR THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING AT THE GLASS HALF EMPTY REMEMBER YOUR PERCEPTION REFLECTS YOUR POSITION.
B00005M1Y2|1.0|I bought this movie for my daughter. She was so excited. After getting we had a movie night and when i put it in, it wouldn't play. I checked the box and it said it played english, dutch, and french. i checked the country where the distributer was from and it was USA in NC. So, it should have been an American format. The disk wouldn't read because the region code was different from any other &#34;AMERICAN&#34; disk. I ended up having to purchase another copy from Best Buy. REGION CODE!!!!!!!
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I think that many kids and adults will like this book. It is a great book for clubs or gatherings or just bed time reading. But you will have to read it to find out if you like it.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I love both of these artists.  And they have a history, too.  Carole King has written a lot of great songs for others, as well as herself.  And of course, James Taylor is a genuine classic.  This CD/DVD set is a great addition to any collection, but if you don't have any of their albums, this will surely trigger your musical lust for more of their talent.<br /><br />I've never seen Carole or James live, but sure wish I could.  This DVD kind of makes up for that.  It was filmed in a nice, relaxed setting of the Troubadour.  They talk about the old days and how the songs were written.  If you're into that sort of history, you can't go wrong purchasing this.  Either of these disks would be fine if purchased alone, but together they are a near perfect combination.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is one of my favorite games but it usually freezes up on me.You should defiantly try this game out.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is a great young band. Great soul in their music.  Had seen them on Austin City Limits, so that drove me to want more.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />Supplier is great.  Fast response, as advertised.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|After all the publicity I had to read this book. My expectations where exceeded with character depth, wit, and humour!<br />I became lost in the story and found hours passing me by without notice!
B000MD9UJC|3.0|A nice conversion device to go from the regular Mini Mag bulb to a very bright LED bulb. The only thing I don't like about this product is that the tail cap doesn't work if it's screwed all the way down tight. Not sure why this is.This leads me to believe that it will not be water tight if taken out in the rain. Kind of an annoying, but it does work and it much brighter than the stick bulb.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|On to the next book. Kind of worried. Hopefully I don't go through it so fast. But when it's good why stall?
B00BFTV09K|5.0|I'm a conscious eater and down here in the netherlands we dont have this on an american scale. Still, obesity is a hot topic here as well. I know there are two sides to it all, but I really think everyone should read this. Makes you feel like cattle or labrats. Everybody knows commercials are BS, but after you've read this, you will see that it goes beyond that. Its maffia, only much more money is made. Gives you an insight about how the world works and where real power lays. If you didnt have a clue yet. Especially the Philip Morris background made me angry.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Entertaining and masterfully written, great story. Personally love the fact that a Bengal Tiger is a main part of the book, it is my favorite animal. At the end of the book I also doubt parts of the narrative but left me thinking.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show and have had no problems at all watching the episodes on Amazon. The episodes are available pretty quickly after the show airs and the streaming quality is great.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica re-energized! Rick Rubin has captured the true sound and attitude of the Masters of Metal! I truly love this CD!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am like accticted to this game my bf has to grave my kindal just for me to stop playing and to spend time with him
B000001ESJ|5.0|This came out right when I was promoted to Sergeant E-5. My Squad and I celebrated the occasion with tall glasses of strong German beer and endless shots of Jagermeister. Man, what a hangover! At least we had great music to listen to!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game has great graphics and is fun to play. Glad they put it on kindle. A great hidden object game.
B0000024YL|5.0|Hits! All Hits, all of the time! This takes me back to a simpler less complicated time in my life. When I listen to this; the memories rush over me like a tidal wave! What a Masterpiece!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is the best book ever to be published. I would without a heartbeat recommend this book to you
B005COO1X6|5.0|good story and the author rocks! Stephen King is the best. aliens and weird stories are wha tree i like to read.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|The game stopped responding after two days of infrequent play.  No longer reacts to the movement of the Kindle while other motion sensitive games work fine.  Free is free.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This would be a great action movie, even without the Bond name. That it is a Bond movie, with the franchise's history, and the prior two Daniel Craig films as lead-ins, makes it all the better. And this one is better than the last two. I saw it in theaters and knew I had to own it. A definite multiple watch.
B004ZJZQH4|2.0|Great movie.  The Blu-Ray transfer is great as well.  Only complaint is that the digital copy code is already expired.  If they sold it as Blu-Ray/DVD Combo I wouldn't complain, but don't advertise the digital copy if it won't work.  The code on mine expired on 12/31/12.  Now if I could just figure out how to contact Amazon to see if they can fix it...
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I didn't enjoy this movie, but only because of the intense gore.  If gore doesn't bother you, I imagine you would like this movie.  Before I turned it off, it did seem to have a good story and I liked the gritty feel of the megacities.  I've made it through some violent movies, but this one was a little over-the-top.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|The CD is everything I wanted. Nice package and flawless CD. I would use this vendor again. Thanks for the quick service.
0525953728|5.0|A lot of filler material before the raid, but a good read. There is no way of knowing how accurate it is, but one comes away with the feeling it is accurate.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a sweet book, I dont feel that it changed my world view and Im skeptical about some parts but overall very nice.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Good acting, good story, good everything. A British production at their best. More of a woman's series than a man's, but still very enjoyable.
B007KB48WI|4.0|After hearing &#34;Sirens&#34; on the air (WGBH/Boston), I searched for and found this album. I'm not a student of classical music, but I did enjoy this album thoroughly. I enjoy most pieces by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Banks' music reminded me of that, which is what drove me to make the purchase.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|You should should watch this just for the CGI work but the story is quite good as well... Direction... perfect.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom Selleck plays Jesse Stone again in Night Passage. He is still the hard drinking ex-LA detective and police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts a quite water front small town.  He finds a money laundering and murder that leads him to some of the town's leading citizens as suspects for these crimes. His quiet but effect techniques do not make him the most popular chief of police with the town council as he continues to drink and spiral downward into depression. The film has an element of suspense that keeps the audience guessing as he puts the pieces of his puzzle together in solving this crime. Our family loved this film as they have the rest of the series.  We look forward to more Jesse Stone stories in the future, as Tom Selleck looks great in this role of the rough and ready police chief and plays the character to perfection.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Meryl Streep is wonderful in this movie.  I worked for Candy Spelling so this brought back a bunch of memories.  Some not so good but I think I would have dealt with it longer if she was Meryl Streep.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I'd like to archive books I've finished but have yet to figure out how to do this. It's OK I guess.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I love all the James Bond pics and this was right up there with the others.  Action and Adventure... and incredible scenery.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is good for religious readers and for others. I say it's interesting for the fact that it's interesting especially towards the end. If anyone doesn't know what to read next this is a good choice.
1401937519|5.0|This author shares her own experience in her soul journey. She is so careful not to generalize but to give her own understanding of it all. She is thought provoking and touched on questions that I had had for years. I never knew where to find even a conversation about them let alone hear the answer. I loved every minute of it. I did not want the book to end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. Can't stop playing it. But I think u should add Redstone stuff buckets of water and multiplayer. Then nothing could top it!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. Interesting twist of a love story along with murder and mystery.  Very good!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book. I have read it twice.  I like that I know the area where these stories are staged.  I love NC Coast line.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like the book because it gave lots of interesting information.  It was a very good book for me to enjoy.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was awesome. I wonder how the next book will be. I think you would like this book if you watch pretty little liars. I give the book a 5 star rating. Read the book you will like it.<br />If Alison is dead who is A?
0751530492|5.0|I am enjoying the entire twenty Scarpetta books in the series and learning continually about morticians, autopsies, crime scenes and investigations.  Very enjoyable.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I am using this as an alternative to Google Reader.  I'm still getting used to it and generally like it, but the mobile/Kindle version is difficult to navigate.
0394527771|4.0|Excellent treatment but could have included many other similar instances throughout history such as the first World War, the Crimean war and the Anglo-Boer war
B005K17RU0|1.0|i used to love this app, as it was both informative &amp; beautiful. the latest upgrade makes it one of the ugliest. the information offered looks crude at best &amp; the tiny type size is much harder to read.<br /> i'd give anything to go back to the previous version. i even tried deleting it &amp; reinstalling it from my cloud. sadly, it didn't help.<br /><br />btw, to the person who was complaining about it running all the time: just turn off notifications.<br /><br />before this upgrade, i'd have given this app 4-5 stars.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This is quietly entertaining mind popcorn.  The nicest thing about it is that it shows that McConaughey is willing to take some risks with his image and career.  Instead of close-ups of his 6-pack abs, there are close-ups of every line and wrinkle on his face. Wow. In the wrong light, even the beautiful look lousy.<br /><br />It's an interesting plot, nice supporting characters but nothing that I won't forget by next week.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary is one of the best remakes of the Holmes classic that I have seen in a TV series.  It is updated and relocated, which with the two leading stars works well.  It does not have the high level of tensions and excitement of the other two recent Sherlock remakes, but it more than makes up for that with the casting, dialog, and superb twist and turns to the modern mysteries it unravels in exquisite fashion.
0425180638|5.0|I am enjoying the entire twenty Scarpetta books in the series and learning continually about morticians, autopsies, crime scenes and investigations.  Very enjoyable.
B00BGI076M|4.0|NO SPOILERS:<br /><br />This show works best when one can suspend that nagging thought re: how a serial killer, while behind bars could have built up such an extensive network of recruits via seemingly unlimited visitors and unfettered Internet access (being escorted by the same guard/convert).<br /><br />The production values are good, the actual \\"followers\\" are sufficiently creepy and there are suspenseful moments.  However, this may be one of the weakest network TV seasons in memory.  I don't believe that \\"The Followers\\" would rate *4 1/2 in a more superior network TV environment.  Truth be told, if I included cable programming, \\"The Followers\\" wouldn't crack the top 25.

0307352153|5.0|Man of contemplation? Man of action? Reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain, I discovered that I am both.<br /><br />I expected to learn more about my introvert side, and discovered that I was more extroverted than I expected. The book deals with the high introvert often by contrasting it with the high extrovert, and the benefit for me was learning how each is at work in my own life as well as the lives of those I associate with on a regular basis.<br /><br />Quiet explained my love for reading and why it is so energizing, or why I like to stay on the sides of parties and not in the middle, or how I am able to overcome stage fright by focusing on areas of passion when speaking/teaching. Quiet also showed I had more of an extrovert side than I expected, how it is easier to meet a couple people at a time than a crowd, and how I do love to communicate.<br /><br />Quiet also explained how to leverage meetings when seeking to be creative, how to involve the introvert and channel the extrovert.<br /><br />Susan Cain is part of the 1/3 of people in this world who would be defined as an introvert. Her passion to learn more what made her tick is a great read for discovering how each one of us function at our best in this world.<br /><br />The challenge in American society is we have swapped the Culture of Character for the Culture of Personality, and the Culture of Personality favors the life of the extrovert. So in an extrovert world introverts are wrongly pushed to be pseudo-extroverts.<br /><br />That's why I loved Quiet, it helped me to see how to leverage the parts of my life that draw on my introvert side and even those parts of my life that flow out of my extrovert approach.<br /><br />The Extra Libris section of the book (what I call the \\"bonus section\\") provides specific tips for leveraging one's introversion tendencies as well as guides for parents and teachers in leveraging children's introversion.<br /><br />I give Quiet 5 out of 5 stars. Well-researched, even more well-written, and best of all, Quiet provided direct application to my life. My thanks to BloggingforBooks for providing a free copy to review. I wasn't required to give a positive review just an honest one.Quiet 5 out of 5 stars. Well-researched, even more well-written, and best of all, Quiet provided direct application to my life.

B006L9B6TI|5.0|One of most transformative books I've read. It's well written and laid out in a daily practice that only takes a few minutes but will change your life. It's hard to say that without sounding cliche but its true! Irrespective of your background, where you are in life, your religion, etc. this book with have a profound and lasting impact.
B0055MBQOM|2.0|I tried three different times, one using the simple and the other two using the advanced options. For the advanced I tried one with and one without using the dynamic light setting. But one of my monitors always ended up cold and very bright the other warm and medium bright.<br />Admittedly these were two different LCD monitors from two different manufacturers (Samsung 2343BWX and an ASUS VH236H). But it was precisely because they were so different that I had hoped having an objective tool to calibrate them would help me. It's annoying, when working with photographs in PSE or ACDSEE Pro, to have the image look fine on one screen and terrible on the other. If you have two identical monitors maybe this would not be such a challenge but for my situation the Xrite CMUNDIS ColorMunki Display was not able to satisfy my needs.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|If you enjoy movies with superpowers, a clear story/plot, some suspense, interesting characters, fantasy-like creatures, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.<br />One of the reasons I didn't give this a five star is because I would have liked to see a little bit &#34;more&#34;. The title &#34;I am number four&#34; might make you think you'll get to see at least four &#34;unique&#34; people in the movie, which you don't...<br />(I don't mean to spoil anything, so I can't be more specific than that) :)<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie.
034580404X|5.0|So far, a great read.  I finished the first book and am now on the second.  It really is a great story to go along with the sensousness contained in the book.
B00021HBGS|4.0|My 3.5 y.o. has never been much of a bath guy, so I was curious to see whether this set of vehicles (which he adores) would get him in the tub and keep him there long enough to get shampooed and thoroughly washed from toes to crown.  Yep!!  These fun toys would keep him in the tub for hours, creating roads and stories and bus stops and reading the signs (which have also helped him recognize the real-world versions of the same words!  Whoa!), and having a great time -- if only his mean mom didn't let the water out of the tub after 20 minutes.  My one criticism is that the vinyl (?) facing of the pieces, that is, the \\"painted\\" part, seems to be bubbling a little and possibly headed to cracking before too long, so I'm keeping an eye on their durability.  But for creative fun, these are definitely 5 stars.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Being a super-hero fan and especially a Superman fan, I didn't expect much from this show.  I never saw this show until recently.  Thinking it was a show for teenagers, I avoided it altogether during it`s entire run.<br /><br />I purchased season 10 and expected to be let down and have a couple of laughs.  Watching Tom Welling as the title character, I was quite surprised that he came off as sincere and genuine.  I just hope his fame in this decade long story doesn't go to his head and spoil his performance in any future projects.  He should have been The Man of Steel in the new film.  Why he or the producers didn't choose him, I don't know.  Perhaps he fears typecasting.  Tom has a sensitivity and humanity that I haven't seen in any of the recent actors.  The actor in Bryan Singer's film and the new one for Zack Snyder's  adaptation look very pale in comparison.<br /><br />I was impressed with the array of super characters in the show. If it wasn't for the \\"meteor freaks\\" there wouldn't be much in the way of adversaries for Superman to battle.  I did miss the presence of Lex Luthor in this season up until we see him in the series finale.  If there is a Smallville movie; the actor who plays Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum, has to be part of it.  If  you a fan of Superman, you've got to check this out.  It's because of this season, I am ordering the remaining nine seasons to watch.  It's a keeper! It's the kind of show that rewards the viewer with multiple viewings.  The episodes are well crafted and written with the comic book fans in mind.  There are all types of obscure references to Superman mythology that only the fans will pick up.  And that makes the show all the more better!

B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was so much more than I had expected when a friend recommended it.  It isn't just another well done teenagers coming of age movie. It is full of poignant angles and characterizations much deeper than I expected, and is a story of  the power of friendship and of weakness becoming strength, and strength becoming weakness. It was a film with layers to the characters and their stories, absolutely beautifully told and acted. Highly recommended
B00AEFY08O|5.0|This has been one my favorite movies ever made. It's a movie where you watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. This will always remain a classic.
B00A8KJN14|2.0|This film is disturbing and morbid.  It should have been rated PG-13.  My 16-year-old walked out on it after 30+ minutes.  Definitely not for little kids, not even for sensitive adults.<br /><br />If you can look past the above, which I personally could not, the film is beautifully animated.  It definitely pushes the limits of what is possible with stop-motion technology.  The voices are superb, the sound is great.  The art, the characters are all admirable.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton is a dark man.  I expect dark films from him.  I saw The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, liked them both.  Frankenweenie, however, crossed the line for me.

B00BHMETKC|2.0|Very slow movie. The only somewhat exciting part of the movie was the last 10 minutes.  Not worthy of the best picture Oscar for sure.
B00947N6D8|5.0|When my family first heard about this movie, we were a little skeptical.  After seeing Dreamworks progress from pop-culture-laden parody flicks (such as the \\"Shrek\\" films, \\"Shark Tale,\\" and \\"Bee Movie\\") to well-done story-and-character driven films that could hold their own against Pixar's empire (\\"How To Train Your Dragon,\\" \\"Kung Fu Panda,\\" and \\"Megamind\\"), this somehow seemed a step backward.  Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy?  Somehow that failed to appeal to me.<br /><br />On a recommendation from a friend, however, I brought the movie home from our library.  And our entire family was blown away.  This wasn't a fluffy kid's flick -- it was an epic fantasy with a boldly realized world and characters.<br /><br />Based on William Joyce's \\"Guardians of Childhood\\" books, the world of this film is watched over by the Guardians -- immortal beings who protect and watch over the children of the world, fueled by their belief and in turn preserving the hope, wonder, dreams, and memories of childhood.  Said Guardians -- Nicholas St. North (Santa Claus), Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny), the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman -- are less than thrilled when their governing entity, the Man in the Moon, appoints a fifth Guardian... Jack Frost, a young trickster with no memory and no desire to be roped into a new responsibility.  But when a sinister threat rises to spread fear and darkness over the world -- Pitch Black, the Boogeyman -- it just may fall on the newest Guardian to stop him, help his new friends, and quite possibly save the world.<br /><br />This film is one of the most visually impressive Dreamworks films yet.  The worlds of the various Guardians are imaginative and lushly depicted, with vibrant colors and memorable, dreamlike visuals.  And the characters themselves have been re-imagined quite well -- instead of fitting to the commercialized looks most people know, they've been modeled to fit right into this new fantasy world.  North is more reminiscent of an Old World Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy wears an elaborate hummingbird-like ensemble, and Bunnymund looks more like a creature out of \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" than a fluffy pastel-colored bunny, which is a good thing.<br /><br />The re-imagining of the characters isn't just in their physical appearances -- they're each given their own unique personality, and they play well off of each other.  Jack, while mischievous and  frequently at odds with the others, is unexpectedly vulnerable at times, and is quite protective of those more helpless than he is.  North is an enthusiastic warrior, still jolly but also quite willing to deliver a smackdown when needed.  The Tooth Fairy is quite eccentric but well-meaning, and has an almost maternal attitude toward her comrades and charges.  The Sandman, mute but friendly, mostly plays straight man to the others, while Bunnymund is a gruff snarker with a well-guarded softer side.  (On a side note, Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, officially making him the most awesome incarnation of the Easter Bunny EVER.)  Only Pitch is somewhat one-dimensional, though he's an effectively creepy villain and it's quite obvious that Jude Law thoroughly enjoyed voicing him.<br /><br />Above all, though, I loved the concept of this movie -- that these familiar childhood icons not only make children happy, but protect them from the malevolent forces of the world.  It takes these icons and makes them into something epic, re-weaving the folklore into something worthy of mythology.  It may not do this perfectly, but it does it admirably and imaginatively, and I for one appreciate seeing a new side to some of the most beloved childhood figures in the world.<br /><br />In short, this is what a Rankin-Bass holiday special would look like if directed by Joss Whedon and Hayao Miyazaki.  It's epic and badass, but still retains a sense of wonder and fun, and sets it in a uniquely beautiful, imaginatively designed world.  Probably a little too scary for young children (Pitch can be quite terrifying to the little ones -- I'd say age 7 and up), but even adults will find something to love and admire in this film.r young children (Pitch can be quite terrifying to the little ones -- I'd say age 7 and up), but even adults will find something to love and admire in this film.

B000NMW6J8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. My friend told me to watch it and I thought it was thrilling, especially for an older flick. Worth the buy!

B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I've been enjoying Cirque du Soleil for some years.  The performances have always been excellent.  The material has grown in depth and presentation.  This effort employs recent developments in digital cinematography to good effect in tying the various acts together into a unity that I find enchanting. In this piece, the stage setting of previous works has been replaced by a unified dream in which the performers explore the emotional effect of a circus accident on an impressionable member of the audience.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fast moving game with lots of fun shooting not a lot of start overs really like the game. The game is also very stable

B00886XQO0|5.0|Bought these to replace a pair of P11's. The initial setup of this headset can be quite cumbersome to most people. Aside from plugging in all the cords, the numerous presets/bluetooth/etc takes a little time to setup. For the average/casual gamer, this would probably be an annoyance. But, once setup properly, these are very nice headsets. I think they're overpriced but I got mine on clearance at Best Buy so it's all good.<br /><br />The sound is very nice on these and the surround sound makes a great difference during gameplay. I play COD mostly so I'm able to hear pretty much anything now with these headsets. Aside from the steep price tag and initial setup time, this is a great headset. Assuming you take care of them, these should be a great investment for your gaming needs.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Excellent inexpensive headphones which are good for jogging or other activities where earbuds may fall out, etc.  Would certainly buy these again.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|This was a gentle and amusing piece.  It tells the story of a group of people who are dealing with end-of-life issues in quirky ways that intersect with the efforts of an Indian boy growing into manhood in the shadow of his older brother.  My wife and I, both in our late 70s, found the movie well worth watching.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This movie is cute.Id say it leans towards adults and older children though.All the characters are edgier than in other stories surrounding them.Easter Bunny is a tough guy with a mouth,Santa is a tad strange,and Jack Frost is a misunderstood kid with a bad additude who doesnt remember who he is.Then,add in the BoogeyMan who wants to bring FEAR to every childs heart and destroy these Guardians of goodwil and its a little much for a toddler to watch.We had to turn it off and wait until my Granddaughter fell asleep to finish it.It was cute,just not a little kids movie.
B002KKCVVO|5.0|Fast delivery, I bought my first pair of Teva sandals two years ago, and live in them in the summer! Great for Kayaking too.  This is my husbands first pair.

B0000DYMRO|5.0|my freind could not find this any where so i looked it up here and got it for her thanxz
B002BU0DPE|4.0|My P11's broke so I decided to give these a try. Overall, pretty good headset. Fit is pretty snug, the P11's felt a bit oversized in comparison. Sound is pretty good on these despite being stereo headsets. I wound up returning these simply due to the fact I found a pair of Black Ops 2 Tangos on sale. Two issues I had with these headsets is;<br /><br />1. the hissing noise on these were irritating. If you use the \\"surround\\" sound on these then the hiss becomes greater. Not a huge thing but it is noticeable.<br /><br />2. The control module is pretty awkward. It sits pretty close to the headset so I had numerous instances where I'd accidentally move the knobs on the module whenever I moved around. Clipping it on to your shirt sorta alleviates this problem however it feels awkward. The P11's didn't have this issue since the control module was further down the cord.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, pretty good headset.

The characters are all likable and easy to understand, it's easy to follow for kids and the action, eye-catching graphics, and adventure will keep the kids fully engrossed the duration of the movie.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|There is no preaching, no emotional tantrums. This book made me feel like I was just able to see for the first time, and I never thought that I was blind before. The narrative is smooth and the hard truth is presented simply, and yet with all its ramifications, helping you to connect the dots. I had watched Food Inc. and pretty much every other documentary dealing with the food industry. I had read my share of Michael Pollan books. However no other piece of work made me understand what eating other animals (and wearing them and using them in any other way) meant. And this book helped my brain get there. And once you get something, it is difficult if not impossible to brush it off and continue living as if you had never found out. You can't unlearn to read, and you can't unlearn what exploiting other animals means.<br />Read Eating Animals: you won't regret being a smarter person.

A real bummer too because so many people said it was amazing!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it is so interesting I can't wait to read the next book I want to read it now
B00005JNS0|1.0|Yes, I said it: The movie is sexist.<br /><br />First off, no girls are racing, no girls are in the pit crew and every female other than Sally and Flow are nothing but sweet little docile things that are obedient to their husbands. Even with the cows, they are weak and easily spooked and Frank, the bull, is outraged and fearsome. The other females are the &#34;twins&#34; who are idiotic little groupies and then the models for Dinoco who are there for nothing other than being pretty.<br /><br />And Mater's Tales are even worse. Every female in that show is nothing but a sex symbol, someone seductive and unimportant. This is a terrible portrayal of females. Sure, you might say, &#34;But there are very few female racers in Nascar.&#34; but what is at all realistic about this movie? They could have put a female racer in to equal the balance but I am under the impression that the creator of Cars thinks very little of the female gender. If you have daughters, steer clear of this movie, and if you have sons you might want to consider making sure they are not picking up those ways of thinking.

Any time you 're-shuffle you get an ad and the only way to leave the ad is to go completely out of the game and then go back in. It gets really annoying after a few times.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This was a really good effort at showing the dichotomy between man and beast.  It makes you think about life and what you would do in a similar situation.  Of course, sharing a boat with a Bengal Tiger is pure theatre (you wouldn't last a millisecond).  The movie was technically a winner.  I did not find any fault with the action scenes.  You really thought Richard Parker was only a few feet away.  Also, I liked that Ang Li did not go after any excessive bloody scenes that you would see in other productions.  I recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand.  Finally, I'm considering reading the book.  I would say this is very high praise.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game I've ever played it's so awesome and addiciting and I just love it so much!
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Rarely does a book come from such a fresh angle and make you want to read everything the author has written.  This accomplishes this and more.
B001NLL93W|5.0|These books are great full of fantasy and wonder and it just makes you wish the world were a little different... They are all page turners!!! LOVED IT!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Nice movie.  Denzel Washington, Goodman, as well as all the others, did a fine job.<br />Recommend it highly to others.
0793563836|4.0|My sis is learning Bass and I got it for her. She is loving the book. I lot of good knowledge and trechnique.<br />I would recommend it
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a great puzzle game! It's based on swap and match strategies, and the levels get increasingly harder as you move along. Graphics are top notch! Way to go Big Fish! I'll be back for more!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This one had me from page one - you simply have to find out whether he did or didn't!  The dad's love for his son shadows the reality of the dire situation.  Mom's a bit more spot on, but you have to wonder throughout about the son's guilt or innocence.  I guarantee you've got to read this stunner to the bitter end!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game. I've always wanted a horse but have never been able to get one.<br />This was a great alternative.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I've read the whole set and they are all great page turners, full of action and fantasy with a little bit of a love story... but not your everyday run of the mill sappy love story! GREAT BOOK!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|When the amazon appstore first opened, this was the first app I purchased and paid for.  And I even bought the Mighty Eagle last week,  which works as directed. But now,  even though I though i was paying for the 'ad-free' version, I'm now getting notifications pushed to my device about the latest toon (which I had already seen). And trying to close the notification opens the app.<br /><br />False advertising and a load of bull. I paid for the supposedly 'ad-free' version, and I'm getting push ads, the worst kind.<br /><br />Do Not Download. And Do Not Buy. I paid for this version,  and it's not even worth the price of free...
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this game is a large improvement over the first. having multiple characters makes for more interesting tries at levels. still seems to have a few of the bugs from the first that cause game locks though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is very fun and if you keep updating it; you ccan see different places which is cool. however; you shouldn't play this game 24/7 or it will get a bit boring. awesome game though!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Acting is fair, writers seem to go way overboard on chronic use of foul language, constant f-bombs, etc. distracting one's attention from the story line; frequently an indication of weak imagination.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just starting but like it --my daughter got me started--she's on it all the time--cooks and makes neat things.<br />A positive site.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|ITs a little younger of a read but these books are great if you like fantasy and I def do.. You know its a good book when you can read it in 5 hours... and its not short! :-)
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Takes me back to when it was first out. Like the download proses it is quick and easy to do.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|this app has all the features you could need, if only it had cloud syncing to Dropbox or Google drive.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book & in this case was ordering it for a friend's baby shower. The book arrived in perfect condition & in a timely manner! Thank You!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Awesome movie. Tom Hardy (Bane) has big shoes to fill--Heath Ledger and all that. The focus on the psychological hardships endured by our hero really adds to the plot and creates a second villain, of sorts (that being Wane's inability to value his life/not fearing death/couldn't get over Rachel which resulted in suicidal tendencies/what have you).  I do with Alfred was in the entire movie, though. As we all know, Alfred is a BAMF.<br />Also, this movie taught me to never trust women because they will all betray you at some point.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|It is such a shame this show only went into 5 seasons. The characters were developing so well, story lines were awesome, Dr. McKay was by far the best character, (love to hate him, he's so arrogant but funny). I could have easily seen this show go 8 or 9 seasons, maybe more. It was the better of all the Stagate shows in the franchise. If you have'nt seen them start at season one and don't stop watching.
B003UESJFG|4.0|This is one of those animated features that got overshadowed by Kung Fu Panda. Mega Mind holds it's own with the best of the Dreamworks and Pixar movies. Very funny. Great humor for children and plenty for adults in this twist on the classic heroes versus villains stories. Will Feral, David Cross, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and Tiny Faye provide the voices for a beautiful array of characters. Smart, funny and a very entertaining original story.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|it was amazing i loved that there are three sons of neptune and i love the romance between hank and the girl
B0060MYM3S|5.0|probably the best series on tv.....cant wait until next season keeps you on the edge of your seats at all times.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I have hay allergies and cant have a real horse. this is the next best thing. plus, I can compete in competitions without the expensive travel. I totally reccommend this app!
B002FOQXZK|5.0|Lots of very strong tracks on the CD. Every song has a different sound to it. Very nice debut album.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|An interesting, balanced look at education that argues that cognitive skills aren't the only, or even the most important predictor of success in school.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I am addicted to HOG's like this which tell a good story and have challenging puzzles as well. If you like hidden object games with puzzles that make you think, then you'll love this game :)
B00BI745AA|4.0|This was a really well-done musical.  With that said, it's a true musical - not a bunch of dialogue with some good songs here and there, but near-constant singing.  Prepare yourself.  Casting was very good, costuming and production quality excellent, and Anne Hathaway's rendition of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; will make you cry.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is another tender Nicholas Sparks story but with a surprising twist!  I thorougly enjoyed it.  His characters are believable and they draw you into their lives.
B00846WWVM|4.0|It is a fun little game, gets challenging pretty quickly, worth playing but it is not really addictive for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one is good, has plenty of levels, easier ones can be done very quickly, only need a few seconds perhaps to finish each level, but it also has more complex levels that may stump you for days even... Once you get the hang of it, it may lose its appeal, and it probably is only good for a single pass of all the levels to hold your attention, but it is worth it for that at least.  And it makes you think a little--which I like.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|If these actors had been on Broadway, this might have been great- but it seemed very awkward combining continuous singing with a very long CGI laden-film.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Grisham has created a rather endearing character in Theo, and a good role model for young readers. More a character study than a story, although the murder mystery is interesting and to be carried on in subsequent books. Recommended!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie, very interesting to know the story behind the story.<br />Gave me a new respect for Ben Affleck.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I grew up with this book, never thinking I would see the day a live action film would be made. Here it is. Enjoy.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Relaxed game, interesting concept, I enjoy it and spent a good time playing it.  Still pick it up every once in a while, but it didn't become a go to game for me.
B005LAIISU|5.0|This one is another great movie with all the classic characters and a decent story.  It may not be quite as good as some of the previous installments, but it is still wholly entertaining.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Need I say more.  An excellent CD of an excellent group that everyone from that era will enjoy.  A must have!
B005USZML4|4.0|Theo is wise for his age, with common sense and good values and specific ambitions, but he's a kid and he makes mistakes and realizes he doesn't always have all the answers--this all makes this series a terrific read for kids. Also enjoyable for old folks, at least for this one. Grisham's storytelling is matchless, and this book is no exception.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great acting, action, drama.  The tension in the main character was so palpable, you wanted him to overcome (and not take the next drink).<br />Great movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing! A must read.. Has more twists and turns than Lombard st. I read this nonstop for two days. Such a page turner.....
B0001ARCFA|3.0|I owned a pair of these AKG headphones in the eighties, which were made in Austria, and they were great in every respect.  Now made in China they are bulkier, cheaper looking and not as comfortable.  I returned them to Amazon and will not bother with the AKG brand anymore.  Sorry to see yet another use to be quality company turn over their manufacturing to the Chinese only to have them dumb it down ...
B005HSL626|4.0|This app is enjoyable, but it seems there is really little skill, or need to improve your hand-eye coordination with the way the game works, just run your finger over the screen as quickly as possible and you can easily slice everything thrown your way.  One part of the game has bombs which you don't want to slice that make it somewhat of a challenge, but all the other game options seem to not require any real effort to goo good slicing vs just swiping in mad-dash form.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is really fun to play, but lately there have been more ads which randomly interrupt the game. overall a great game!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|It's always been hard for me to put a Grisham book down, and this book--actually the whole series--is no different. Alas, I don't have a young teen, but if I did I'd recommend he or she read these stories. Theo's fine values, and his decisions and actions that spring from them, are in my estimation good examples for kids. Fun yarn, too.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie itself is very good but I had problems with the audio throughout the movie. The picutre quality was very good. However, at times the video would continue without an audio track. At other times the audio would slow down to being only noise while the video continued at the regular speed. Through the middle of the movie the audio ran in sync with the video for several minutes but then the audio would slow down. On numerous times, I would stop the movie, then resume and the audio would be in sync for about 1 to 2 minutes, then slow down. Twice the movie stopped to continue loading. With all the stops and starts, I barely finished the movie before time expired. I still didn't get to watch and listen to all the movie and understand all that happened. I have watched other movies from Amazon without ever having this problem. But if the future movies have this trouble I'll stop watching on Amazon and use another service or I'll go to a theater to see it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great new app! It has so many more features the first one. The graphics are also fantastic. It is a lot different then the first one and I recommend you get this app. It is also so addictive!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Very good game soothing sounds and music that looks great also I highly recommend to anyone to give this a try as it is worth every penny
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Action packed movie. The quality of the movie was excellent. Part 111 was a little better movie though. Really enjoyed this one though.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|Robert Plant does a good job on the first song,butthe rest of the CD was just ok.I might not recommend.
B004K00NEO|4.0|I bought Robots because I like the look and feel of it. The flowy and interesting action scenes were fun to watch too. The slapstick humor is funny to me but maybe not for everyone.<br />It keeps my 2-yr-old's attention for 10-15 minutes. He really prefers Rio. Now that is a 1-eyed baby sitter! Ha.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This I  one of the most mind capturing books I have ever read and just could not put it down.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loved this game. The gameplay is simplicity itself, but it takes some skill and some doing to get a good score. The 'leveling' mechanic uses missions like 'ride XXX meters on the teleporter' to keep the game fresh, as well as dozens of unlockables.<br />For the low low price of $0.00, this game is a must buy.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Not a big fan of the game would not recommend I like other Mobility games but this just did not make my favorite list.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I found the story unique and the flawed character a nice change to most books. I am anxiously waiting to finish this series. You feel for the character,want him to succeed even though you know he's not suppose to. I hope there is a good ending
B000056K04|4.0|Dave Matthews does a great job of mixing good songs throughout the CD.I would recommend this CD to anyone.Great job.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Well Donald Fagen does it again i bought this cd the day after it was released. I had only heard the one song (Not The Same Without You) i was gonna buy the cd reguardless. I will get my only beef out of the way first i am very anal about my cd collection and i cant stand these cheap looking digipak cd's does anyone else feel the same??? im hoping down the road they will release this in a jewel case. Anyway the next morning when i woke up i put the cd on right away i played it all the way through. I liked what i heard but yet was expecting more i should have realized that Donald Fagen solo/Steely Dan music is like a drug and it gets better with repeated listenings. I kept this cd in my three disc changer for a long time. Donald Fagen & Steely Dan are in my top five of favorite bands of all time i never grow tire of their music their songs are timeless and have worn the years well. Donald still sings very well at the age 65 i believe. I cant really pick a stand out track to me personally all of the songs are equal. As usual Donald writes about quirky topics i wonder if Slinky Thing is a follow up to Hey Nineteen. Out Of The Ghetto is hilarious same with Weather In My Head. I guess if i had to pick some favorites they would be The Good Stuff & Miss Marlene (song about bowling???). Donald Fagen now has four solo albums and they are all excellent and very catchy. I think the reviews speak for itself on this one pick it up you wont be disapointed. Sunken Condos is my favorite 2012 album release.
B00003CX8U|4.0|Saw this movie in the 70's and decided to get an update.<br />Not one of my favorites but nevertheless and enjoyable<br />film.
B005K17RU0|4.0|So far so good - I've not used it a lot but it is providing some good weather information.  I travel a lot, so knowing forecasts and alerts in particular areas is a huge plus.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome read. Very fast paced. Kept my attention the entire time.  If you liked hunger games, you must read the 2nd book.  Can't wait to read the 3rd book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app. It's so fun!! There are a lot of different things you can do. Recommend this for everyone.
B000660UN0|5.0|This is Clapton at his best.His ability to play Robert Johnson is creative and to the point.I would recommend this CD to anyone.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Restaurant story is a very enjoyable app and I love it. I just wish they'd do something about all the pop-ups when you start to play. Other than that it really is an AWESOME game for all ages!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Worth buying. Not one of Johnny Depps best but enjoyable and<br />a typical stylized movie by Tim Burton. Pretty cool.
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you enjoyed Seth McFarland hosting the academy awards than you will love this movie!  It is a lough out loud riot!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Plays well, but is very hard to beat.  Other games I win about half the time.  This one about 1 in 10.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Game of Thrones!  It is packaged beautifully and has extra footage that wasn't available on HBO.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Red hot Chili Peppers does a great job on this CD.I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very informative and interesting. It opens your eyes to the culture of cell research and about how important Henrietta Lacks was.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This album is great from start to finish. Mumford & Sons has a raw earthy voice with exceptional lyrics and a great sound.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I ordered every sound track to twilight  when they came out so I ordered it. I liked it but that's just me.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|This ranked up there on the stinks alarm with the movie starring Tom Hanks on the island.  Total waste of time and money!
B006LSZECO|5.0|So fantastically written, I literally devoured this book! Such a page turner full of wit & suspense, I would recommend it to anyone.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|No wonder the movie is a hit. The tiger in the lifeboat was a lark instead of a tragedy of losing all that was normal to him
0743289692|3.0|This story is very sad and miraculous at the same time. No one would really ever know what a women endures in living in another country unless it is told
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|I especially love that it centers around a slightly dark comedic plot line that happens to involve zombies rather than the alternative. After viewing the movie (for the first time a few years ago), I felt better prepared to deal with the inevitable zombie apocalypse. This movie coupled with a few seasons of The Walking Dead and those zombies better watch out! But beware, this movie is not for kids (like there is a zombie movie for kids?)...based solely on the use of the f-word throughout the movie. If you're on the fence and not easily offended, give it try!
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend for Christmas because he liked it and so now he can watch it whenever in blue ray so its nice
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just when you think things can't get any rougher or more drama filled, they do.  I love post-apocalyptic stuff and this is a great show.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|One of the best novel-film adaptations I've ever seen. Both visually & emotionally stunning! Kudos to Ang Lee! Simply breathtaking.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|when I updated this game, it took one of the familes that was a big deal. on their site they said they were dealing with it....weeks ago still nothing...
B0098R6M1M|5.0|Excellent! I used the first 15-20 min to teach my 5th grade students how the pope is chosen in Rome. The rest is a truly moving story of a man who has no use for the power and prestige of the papacy ans would rather (much like John Paul II) spend his time on the stage. The ending will sit with you. A timely choice for an important time in Church History,
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love the new show! exciting from the start and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait to watch more!
B0072OFM28|5.0|Ordered this season for my boyfriend for Christmas because we are big Spartacus fans and its great so good buy
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I probably don't know how to use it properly but it wasn't very user friendly....that would translate as dummy friendly in my case.
B000OHZL1W|1.0|I did not know that I needed a HD DVD player in order to play it. So, now I have to give it away.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I have always always wanted to read this book. With the help of kindle and audio books, I have finally done it. Great intrigue in the beginning, suspenseful in the end.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this wonderful story.  Will order more books by this author.<br />wish all these books be uninstalled from my system
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Have read very few fantasy's.  Really enjoyed this book, i got hooked and have since read the other 4 books.  The 4th book was the least interesting.  Almost looks like G. Martin is struggling to figure out where all this is going.  Hope he comes up with an ending in my lifetime that is commensurate with at least the quality of book 1 and 3
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like it but it does not give you enought time to do what you are doing.LOL<br /> it's cool enought
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love John Corey.  He is my kind of guy.  I laugh at how he talks.  Can not decide who I like best.  Corey,Paul Brenner or Mitch Rapp !  I hope Nelson DeMille is working hard on a new book!
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Great service from the vendor.  Product was as advertised.  This is one of my favorite story lines.  It will be watched repeatedly.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|Phenomenal acting performances by this all-star cast. I wasn't ever really a fan of Matt Damon until watching this movie. Awesome & creepy at the same time... definitely a must see.
B0053TMP24|4.0|This series os like Harry Potter it keeps your interest. I would recommend this for all ages. Be sure to start with book one.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|If you like Dan Brown you will love this book.  Wish I hadn't read it so I could read it again.  Hard to but down.
B008NC1LJ6|2.0|The only reason I even watched this film was because Anthony Hopkins is in it.A big disappointment.It put me to sleep.
B00BYOEZTI|1.0|I spent the extra $1 to watch the Hobbit in HD.  The only other time I rented HD, the movie was presented beautifully.  I am not sure what went on--could have been my internet connection.  The movie ran smoothly enough, but the quality was horrible.  Very digitalized.  It almost looked like 3-D without the glasses. I wish I had my money back.
0767020308|5.0|The DVD plays well.  Good service from vendor.  Would definitely utilize this vendor again.  Love the story line.  This will be watched repeatedly at my home.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Get this game it is so fun you collect coins to get new horses. So get this app right now
B008TW1N4S|5.0|The UK copy of Electric Ladyland is a must have for any Jimi Hendrix collector. The cover art is totally didderent from the American issue
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far the best book by Nicholas Sparks.  I loved loved loved this book.  While I do love Mr. Sparks, his books are usually a tad too emotional for me to give them 5 stars.  Safe Haven however, is my exception.  This book had my nerves a wreck and my emotions all over the place.  It was so nice to read about grown-up love, not just college or teenage lust.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Well I thought that it would help with my relationship with my husband, I learn a lot. The book was very enjoyable
B004P1JDJO|2.0|Biased , redundant and simplistic. I was disappointed in his toolkit and did not find it helpful.<br />You can get the basics o f his argument from reading an Amazon review.
B0019N95IK|5.0|I have the complete series on DVD, which will show as near HD quality on a BluRay player. Is it worth the $65 to purchase the HD version?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|And who needs to read a review anymore of anything so popular. \\"Angry Birds\\" is cat-nip for kids and a fun way for aggressive adults to relieve their frustrations while wasting time that might be spent completing more tedious chores. Besides you're helping those sweet birds protect their nests from those smug, snorting, nasty piggies.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is my first review on Amazon, suffice it to say I am thrilled to bits. The Martian takes you by the gut on page 1 and keeps at you till the very end. Its not a perfect book, its not even perfect sci fi. But it is a perfect cocktail of science, thrill and blockbuster. It makes for a great one sitting read, time flies by. I will not be surprised to learn that this has been optioned by Hollywood. Without spoilers - The scientific details are great, I am not sure how much of it is right/plausible, but I certainly kept reading without rolling my eyes or raising an eyebrow. Mark, the protagonist is a fun guy - the smart, brave, lovable, renegade - who is an astronaut for Christ sake !...and you love that more than 70% of the book is him talking to you in first person - which is a tremendous achievement. In the end, what works best, are the surprises, they keep spilling from each page. I will be reading the author's next for sure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show can't wait to watch season 3!  Love the history and the way things were done in the past.
B00993G41S|5.0|Look at the cast,how could it be bad?Very funny movie.Have fun with it.Keven ,Jamie and Eric are a hoot.Wanda did a good job too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Never know what to wear in the morning when I arise.  The weather where I live, constantly changes throughout the day and I have to dress in layers.  So this really helps me a lot.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Watch for the amazing animation. Has some really good humor. Might scare the bejesus out of kids younger than 9, maybe?
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This a very moving and intriguing story. I loved reading it and look forward to seeing the movie now. Love Sparks all the way around.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though this book is written for the young adult audience, it is a great read for anyone who likes distopian fantasy, an interesting plot and good character development.  Ms. Collins' writing style has improved since her &#34;Gregor The Overlander&#34; series (which is also worth reading).<br />&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is fast-paced and engrossing, with a strong female protagonist.  The world Katniss inhabits is complex and believable.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|If you have seen the stage play, do yourself a really big favor and do not watch this movie.  The music in the movie sucks. The well known actors are just that, actors.  I watched the movie and I was extremely disappointed.  Not a good movie at all.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I have no problem with musicals, but this one is seriously overrated.  I preferred this movie without music and with Liam instead of wolverine as the star.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|I really loved this book and will be reading more of Hemingway. Have several Hemingway books on my wish list.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey has creating an intriguing post-apocalyptic tale.  Good characters - both the heros and villains - and a (nearly) believable environment.  The story moves along at a rapid pace.  While I thought there were some inconsistencies, it is a great first effort.  Can't wait to see what Mr Howey writes next!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This a great game to play again and again with progressive difficulty and challanges. Just when you think it is intuitive altogether, you hit a bump. I love it alot!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Recommended by a friend, i had no idea what to expect and was captured from the first page. I'm not a fast reader but this was 'gone' in a weekend. Enjoy.
140120841X|5.0|This book so far, haven't read it all the way through, is stellar. I'd recommend it in a heart beat to any graphic novel fan.<br /><br />Mr. Moore does state in the opening pages that he didn't put altered versions in the book and I appreciate that, the book has the original manuscript and artwork, and it shows the growth of the author. That being said the story is very good and most anyone could appreciate it (I refuse to spoil anything)<br /><br />That being said, the seller shipped the my order, which was two copies, very quickly. I ordered it at 3:00 pm last Thursday and it was on my porch by 1:00 pm the next day!! (I used two day shipping and basically got next day air)<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend both the seller and the book. 5 stars!!
B009POCG2C|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, but I must say that I genuinely enjoyed it.  There is some nice character development, a killer performance by Amy Adams and some nicely toned dialog that keeps the film freely moving, even in parts that could otherwise drag.  I will say; it does feel long.  By the time the draft picks are made I really thought the film would be over, but it wasn't.  That being said, it's an enjoyable film with some heart.<br /><br />Eastwood does Eastwood well and Timberlake continues to prove himself the next Matthew McConaughey (you know, charisma without the ability to do something special with a performance), but Adams is the real reason to see this.  I have never considered her a true leading lady, but she knocked this one out of the park with a genuinely heartfelt turn as an ambitious lawyer concerned with the welfare of her aging father.  Gus is a scout for the Braves, but his stubborn demeanor and seeming lack of success have his superiors questioning his relevance.  He's sent to tail a prospective #1 pick, but his failing eyesight is a concern and his daughter Mickey gets roped into tagging along to help him out.  While on the road they both strike up a friendship with a scout for the Red Sox and they begin to find out things about themselves they've been shielding for a long time.<br /><br />I'll say that there are some very predictable turns of events here, and there are also some segments that make no sense (especially the film's resolve) but at the end of the day it was charming and had nice flow and Adams really makes up for a lot of the film's faults.  As a friend of mine was quoting saying soon after he saw this; I ain't got no problem with those curves.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I found this book hard to get into. it was all too deep and meaningful for me. The story line was good but all the intellectual stuff dragged it on I thought.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints, very interesting from beginning to end.  Had me up til 4am I didnt want to go to bed, its a page turner and you dont want to put it down.
0525478817|5.0|When you think about a book about teenagers dying of cancer, you are likely to assume it's not going to be a big pick-me-up.  But this beautiful, funny, heart-wrenching novel was one of the most visceral and up-lifting books I have read in years.  It's on my personal list of classics and one I would recommend to anyone looking for something to read with real depth and insight.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show. The historical piece is so genuine and the characters are to love or hate or both depending on the episode. Excellent plot twists and ethical challenges. Can't wait for the new season.
B00884GR0W|4.0|it is stun game u can make cars.  but it needs an update it has every vehicle but an airplane that's what I think should be in the next update
B00AFEXRME|2.0|Thought movie would be able plane crash.  However, it was more about lying, drugs and decent. Did not enjoy even though I like Denzel Washington.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I hesitated to read this book since I have no interest in race car driving, but decided to give it a try since it had such great reviews. I'm so glad I did! It is a wonderful story of devotion, dedication, persistence, and unconditional love. Love between humans, love between dogs and humans. How blessed we are to share this earth with such amazing creatures who teach us things about ourselves we otherwise wouldn't know.<br />An extremely well written book! I will be recommending this to my dog loving family & friends.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very good reading, and its touching we sometimes forget about the people who are suffering or dying with diseases but in the midst of their suffering and their last days they can find things to smile about as they transcend to the other side.

0425252868|5.0|This is a wonderful book about the depth of humanity.<br />it will give you a new insight into the morality of the German air force pilots and their code of behavior during WW II.<br />this true story will also give you insight into the mentality of American pilots and the difficulties they endured flying the<br />Super fortresses over Germany.

0345505387|2.0|I love the Outlander series, and have read the books 2-3 times. I was hoping this graphic novel would fill in some blanks from Jaimes past.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I watched LOP two weeks ago; so I've had a chance to think about how I felt about the movie.<br /><br />I normally choose to watch only those movies that are given high marks, so as to not waste time. It didn't matter to me that this movie was nominated for an academy award for best picture. I found myself having low expectations. I find that whenever I have low expectations for a movie, the movie surprises me and I enjoy it. Somehow, this felt different.<br /><br />I think it's because LOP is easily was one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />Maybe it's because the movie didn't have any mystery? Granted, I knew what to expect from the plot, but I'm the type of guy who eats the same food over and over, and re-reads books and re-watches movies, so mystery isn't necessarily why I do anything.<br /><br />I preferred the version of the story in the book.  There are some noticeable differences. Studying theology, the reporter is a female, Pi's marriage, etc.<br /><br />It felt like... the movie's version of the story was told in a rushed way. IMO, best lines of the movie were taken directly from the book. So, The movie didn't suspend disbelief the way the book did. Examples: this should come as no surprise, but the book goes into far more detail about the 'taming' of RP; the floating island was move alive and even more of a curiosity in the book than the treatment it had in the movie; etc. Those details were lost and neglected in the translation.<br /><br />BL: I'll read the book again for pleasure, but you couldn't pay me to watch the movie again, it's not worth the time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Don't have anything else to compare it with except the free My Alarm Clock...I have to say my experience so far has been great. Never miss an alarm, love the ability to download my own music to for the alarm, weather feature is something I didn't  place together with an alarm clock, but have used My Alarm Clock a lot just to check the weather and the nightstand (ability to keep open and on) has to one of my favorite uses as it has been a great night light when in a new surroundings. I suffer from vertigo and lose my bearing s in the dark (just remember to plug in the charger as it will drain your battery). ~A happy customer!!!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I simply loved the movie.  It was every bit as good as the book.  I can't wait for the next one!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Kept giving me some error code. My son was so dissappointed. Looked like a fun game that refused to function! If I actually paid for it I would be FURIOUS.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|So far I like it. I'm also learning how to use this product. Hopefully I can take this with me when I'm taking notes without having to take my laptop. We'll see. I'll keep you posted if you want. Thanks,
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I love syfy movies. I did not think I was going to love it but surprisingly I did.  I was entertained throughout the whole movie and I can't wait for part 2. I am assuming there is going to be a part 2.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I do like this game, however to me it seems somewhat confusing at times, I am not sure how to properly utilize all of what is going on.  I just wanted a simple game to play Bingo on.  It's a good game, I just am not sure how to use all of it's functions.  There is alot going on with this game.  I don't use the facebook feature, so that maybe part of my problem.  Not sure on this one.
B005K17RU0|3.0|...than the old version.  I dislike the bright white of the new interface, and with the old version, I had updates for all of my family/friends locations at my fingertips able to switch out with ease.  It might still be there, I just cannot find it.  The main view with the buttons at the bottom for switching out views are gone also.  It gives a rather cluttered feel.<br /><br />If they had a way to downgrade the version, I would as I liked the simpler interface.<br /><br />Just not the same for me, but most of you will like it.
B000YHB7TC|4.0|This movie was ok very interesting I guess my wife enjoyed more than I did if u like this kind of thing then go for it
B00BF123WG|5.0|I know people will come down on both sides of this controversial movie, but I considered it a balanced treatment of conflict in the 21st century.  I am a Vietnam veteran and have witnessed how a bias in documentation will lend to a distorted historical perspective.  The blank screen with the voices of doomed individuals at the time of the 9-11 attacks gave a basis for consideration for what follows in the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I had a little trouble with the sound, (instant video) but we viewed it again with captions and it was all clear.<br />This may have been more a problem of my hearing than with the video!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I lift weights and do yoga, so when I saw this I picked it up! It works amazing. I love it. I love how it kicked my butt a bit. I love the feeling of a good work out. I did not like how it is 30 days. I do it every 2-3 days. I will weight lift and do yoga more than this video, only because it is strenuous, but you need to give your muscles a break. This work out is perfect. If you feel like you cannot do a lot, then don't. Just build up the muscles and then go for it. I made the video last 3 months instead of 30 days. I love this so much though! VERY SATISFIED!
B0079KGAOY|5.0|People may or may not have different feeling toward Mel Gibson.  But he is always great in the Lethal Weapon Collection.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great. It is fun to compete and fun to groom and take care of your horses.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I absolutely love this game. It's so much fun to play but I'm thinking about deleting it because of being bombarded with ads after I have reached level 10. I can't get through anything without an ad coming up. If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know! Otherwise, I may be deleting this game.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Because I found the story difficult to follow,  The plot jumped from pillar to post.  The dialogue was inarticulate in many instances

0374275637|4.0|This is a reliable practical product in line with the price I paid for it. It is possible to pay 40 times as much for a product that although constructed to tighter tolerances still performs the same function with only slightly better accuracy. I have mislaid my first version of this watch which also gave good service and so it was not a difficult decision to replace it with another 8926A.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Nothing to say other than this movie was incredibly inspiring, there is still great people out there.<br />you must see this movie! you will like it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holy. Moly. I think I just went on a sick twisted roller coaster that I was terrified to ride but wanna do it again.<br /><br />This book was so emotional and intense and scary and plot twisting and just words cannot describe this book. I was sucked in from the beginning. To be honest, I didn't really like Sky. I couldn't understand her attitude towards the world or why she acted the way she did... but once Holder came in... damn did things change! I started to want to know more... and I read it in two days. I was beyond blown away with all the plot changes and the emotional disasters that came along with it.<br /><br />Holder. I honestly thought he was crazy. Bipolar. SOMETHING! He went from gentle to intense. I'd like to call him over passionate. Seriously though!! He was amazingly gentle and beautiful with his words and his physical behaviors but then he would have moments where you just read his behavior and was like wtf just happened. You learn to love him. A LOT if I do say so myself.<br /><br />The plot twists and roller coasters I went on during this story was INTENSE. One thing happens, things get flipped upside down, more things happen, something SERIOUSLY scary happens, and I'm just sitting here like OMG did that just happen? I have to keep reading to make sure I'm not dreaming... then another thing. IT WAS CRAZY. It... I... no words. If you like shocking things and things constantly changing, shocking you emotionally, then you will honestly love this story!<br /><br />But can I say... seriously, I'm sure most people see it's a love story. Holder and Sky. Literally... there love is so beautiful. I'm sure I say this about most romance stories but this one... this one I honestly think is one of my top beautiful love stories. In MY OPINION... I would say it's similar to Travis Maddox and Abby in Beautiful Disaster. It's intense... it's constantly change, surprising you, but it's a beautiful thing. They love each other through thick and thin, through literally ANYTHING. Their love is strong, passionate. It just makes you &#34;feel&#34;. I couldn't have asked for a better pair to read this story through. Absolutely beautiful to read. THIS made the story what it is. Not the crazy events and the heart breaking moments. Their love is just beautifully written.<br /><br />This was a beautiful story about a girl who falls hopelessly in love with a boy as their lives LITERALLY flip upside down. Absolutely a beautiful story. Wonderful. Intense. Passionate. &#60;3y ANYTHING. Their love is strong, passionate. It just makes you &#34;feel&#34;. I couldn't have asked for a better pair to read this story through. Absolutely beautiful to read. THIS made the story what it is. Not the crazy events and the heart breaking moments. Their love is just beautifully written.<br /><br />This was a beautiful story about a girl who falls hopelessly in love with a boy as their lives LITERALLY flip upside down. Absolutely a beautiful story. Wonderful. Intense. Passionate. &#60;3
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A beautifully written and heartfelt book.  Enjoyable to read.  Leaving one with a deeper sense of angels around us. Nicholas has the way of holding back the mystery of the begotten love and providing such a touching end that you never forget it.
B002ZG9940|5.0|To me, this movie is terrific,  but I understand the negative reviews. The movie is not for everyone. It's deliberately paced to put it mildly,  but I was entranced the whole time and found the retro style of filmmaking refreshing. The final moments of this film are haunting. Clooney is terrific, and the European locales are awesome. I love Bourne style frenetic action as much has anyone,  but this is just a different sort of film that is just as good.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|A lot of HP fans don't really care for the way the book series ended. The end of this movie also wasn't my favorite but it was because of the plot not because of the choices they made while filming. I actually think they did a good job interpreting what was really not a great ending to the adventure.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|I have been a clutch fan since 1995 and love pretty much every album this album is really good it is definitely better than strange cousins from the West in my opinion. this album has quite a bit of swag to it there are hard rock riffs there are some blues the riffs and kind of a compilation of all of their albums combined into 1

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The Blue Ray in 3 D is technically brilliant.  No question about the production values.<br />As a story there are many plot holes and confusions.  Also the character development<br />and their respective motivations are not clear and unfulfilled.  However, I like the genre<br />and it is a fun ride. I wish there had been more thoughtful attention paid to character<br />and script.  It's a common problem with many big budget motion pictures.  The effects<br />and \\"star\\" package end up getting more attention than the script and scriptwriter.  I guess<br />we are forced to get what we can get and enjoy it for what it is and not for what it should<br />be.  We can only hope for stronger scripts in future.  GM
B005LZW8FO|4.0|A sci-fi drama about two individuals that cross lives due to an accident. Also there is a discovery of a parallel Earth. Slow paced, soundtrack varies from techno, folk to classical. The blonde lady Brit Marling wrote this story. You might also like 'Journey to the other side of the sun' 'Angels & Airwaves present LOVE' 'Contact' 'Donnie Darko' 'S.Darko' 'Southland Tales' plenty of discussions about this film that you might want to read once you've watched the film. My fave scene was where the scientists establishes contact. The actor that played Ethan from 'LOST' is in it. Worth a look.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I was looking for too much in this book I think. It did explain about the virus, the kill order. But Mark for me seemed almost like a roadrunner how he was running around kicking and fighting and falling out of helicopters and well, just being a really dufus fighter. I realize he is a teenager and all but this string of action events just didn't ring true. For example once he used both feet to kick someone and went into the river/water with him. Really? Of course! That is what happens when you use both feet, you go with the attackee. He had put forth a lot of effort, for sure, and I did like all the characters. But really, when you see a bunch of bad guys who outnumber you, do you A)Ask why they took a little girl? B) Run into the crowd of bad guys to rescue your friend or C) Hang back, realizing you are outnumbered and maybe make a plan with your friends for rescue?<br />C. you say? Wrong! Mark chose A. and B.<br />Oh those impulsive teenagers!<br />But fortunately he had an older guy to hold him back from making a terrible mistake, at least on the rushing out there part.<br />I love James Dashner's books and I will still read anything he writes but this one was a bit of a letdown after the wonderful Maze Runner trilogy. Perhaps unnecessary.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I purchased all 3 seasons.  They were wonderful.  We are Downton followers now and are awaiting season four.  The scenery is beautiful, the plot great and the character actors very believable.  Everyone should see this.  I loaned it to my Son & family and they enjoyed it as well.  Hurry season 4.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|Daniel Craig aka Jake wakes up in the middle of a desert with a strange gadget on his arm and he has no memory. Harrison Ford aka Dollarhyde is a badass. Olivia Wilde aka Alice is hot. You might also like Westworld, The Warrior's Way, Wild Wild West, There are some great action scenes. A must see for any sci-fi fan.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A very interesting book about our special forces and how important they are to the security of our country. Chris is a very confident and caring person. He seems like he was able to adjust back to civilian life without too many problems. I  have great respect for the men and women who put their life on the line to protect us from evil. Anyone who enjoys nonfiction adventure will enjoy this book.
B000FA675C|3.0|Well written novel, with plenty of mystery and suspense....my big problem is that this book is being sold as if it is based entirely on truth...which it is not !  Read this book like you would any other fictional novel, and assume just that...that it is fiction.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Truly an excellent book with wonderful character development and a fantastic dystopian world. I could say quite a bit, but I will just say: Wow!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Riveting. Couldn't put it down. Love all Kate Morton's books. She puts out quality not quantity. Love the way she weaves historical facts into an edge of your seat story. Fluid writing style.

B0034G4OZE|3.0|A coming of age tale about a teenage boy dealing depression is placed in hospital, there he meets a varied bunch of characters. Good dialogue, nice montage scenes. If you like Scrubs then this is for you. Zach G (Alan from Hangover) is brilliant. Emma Roberts looked good. Respect to the star Gilchrist. Does contain scenes of stress vomiting.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|no problems, as described and great service. i cant say anything bad about this product, would suggest it to anyone i know.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|The album is a classic. It should be in everyones playlist. Every song is a great and Prince is timeless.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This movie was a great date night for myself and my wife. We wanted something entertaining, but not &#34;loud and obnoxious&#34;.  I'm a huge Rachel McAdams fan, and my we are both Harrison Ford fans. We found a delightful, funny, yet thoughtful movie in Morning Glory.

B00APUQH0W|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. What I don't understand is why all the really good movies have to have swearing in them. Are these people not educated. And if they are then they should know, that swear words do not make a person look smart.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I let time go by, just as I did with the \\"shades\\" trilogy that even the newscasters talked about. I can only give thanks for free library reading. This book is vulgar and disgusting in every possible way. I feel certain I will not ever read another best seller.

I do feel, however, that it was very uncool that we couldn't read the short story of Alex if we purchased the Kindle version.  Some of us only read on the Kindle.

B006OOHYIC|1.0|I really do not enjoy pushing around sex symbols and trying to \\"mate\\" the male and female in order to complete a puzzle.  It gets a whole lot creepier when you have to start manipulating male / male hookups in order to solve a puzzle.  Please don't use Amazon apps as a platform to share your views concerning heterosexuality / homosexuality.
B008Y73940|4.0|Its was worth watching. Interesting plot contortions manage to successfully walk the line between believable and contrived for the most part. Its attempt to elevate the ambulance chaser to slime ball +1 status almost succeeds.
B000FC146C|5.0|A beautiful book.  There are a few places that it goes into unnecessary detailing, and made me lose interest  best for a bit.  Aside from that, I loved this book.  Very emotionally gripping.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I believe this was director Andrew Stanton's third Pixar film. His first directorial effort, I think, was Monster's Inc (which I couldn't really connect with). His second was 'Finding Nemo'- which is at the very top of my list as a Pixar favorite - and now here is his third film 'Wall-E'.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Wall-E. At the beginning of the movie as we see the robot on Earth I was completely taken in by the imagery and the cinematography: the lighting of the outdoor scenes looked fabulous! It didn't look like CGI and yet it wasn't completely real. I don't really quite understand why, but it just looked perfect. The two robots Wall-E and Eve, their personalities, through sound effects and animated pantomime, both seemed the most fully realized and remarkable creations yet by the Pixar people at the time it was released (2008).<br /><br />The overall story is excellent but the movie, however, feels longer than its 97 minutes. It seems like the film loses its focus somewhat when too much time is spent on the humans and their problems aboard that ship. It seemed as if there were a number of ideas left over and they decided to use them all, and that made it felt like the focus on the two main characters was diminished for a period of time. It felt a bit over-padded, dragging the film somewhat towards the end (however, it probably will not be any major quibble to other viewers). Thomas Newman's arresting musical score really elevates the quality of the film and enhances the drawing power of the film's romance between the two robots: the sequence of the rocket ballet between the two robots in space is sheer poetry.<br /><br />Wall-E goes on the very top of my animation 3D shelf with `Finding Nemo',`the Incredibles',`How to Train a Dragon', and Disney's `Tangled'.

B00BF11STU|5.0|I watched the movie yesterday night. It is one of the best movies on the war on terror I've seen in the last five years. If you are looking for a movie that condemns CIA procedures, this is not the movie. I believe it's a quite balance account that leaves to the viewer the opinion what to thinK about CIA tactics to obtain information about terrorists. A must-see movie for all of those interested in the subject.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|I bought the cd and dvd combo plus the daily devotional. The dvd and cd are just wonderful. The songs will leave you feeling happy and joyful. I also use the daily devotional and it is wonderful. Darlene has done a wonderful job with this and I highly recommend.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Its a bit more complicated to get it to work just right.  Needs to be an easier way to cut bottles.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|There were parts that we were in tears from laughing so hard!  Actual singing parts kept the movie going. There were times it would go to a serious side a little too quick for my taste, but all-in-all a good movie and worth watching.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I liked to book.  I was very similar to reading a long article from Fortune magazine.  Lack details on traditional publishing.
B009XWD02G|5.0|Makes buying music easier and less clutter in the house. You don't need music CDs around the house and you still own the music. Quite wonderful really. Give it a try and see what you think. I think you'll like it!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|broken vibrate switch when it came in and didn't fit just right....  got an otter box.  (4 more words required  :)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It shows well on both the tv and the computer in hd so I was able to catch up on the episodes I missed.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|My wife and I both thought disk one was great, but for us, disk two was mostly stuff we had never heard of.  Overall, the quality of the recordings was good.
B000002AGN|4.0|i enjoyed the dave brubeck quartet  a long time ago enjoyed them more now. i seen him  when i was in the service .good and enjoying to listen to.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I know he's made some bad movies but this wasn't one of them. It's not one of his greatest, either, but it's a comfortable movie for a slow and wintry Saturday afternoon.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|These movies have always been a favorite, and in Blu-ray they are just amazing! Better sound, better clarity, better experience overall!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This is a good read. The plot, mysteries, twists and turns kept me coming back for more. I would recommend this to any puzzle lover.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|normally i don't care for kid movies but this was seriously entertaining.good animation, good humor, good acting-story has some holes in it but you're willing to let those slide
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I am grateful that the makers give you the option  to reset the puzzles.  I have been though this game several times & still enjoy it very much.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|I was really enjoying the game. Very challenging and fun. Got to 3-1, and the screen is messed up. Lep falls to his death as soon as it starts. Can't play any more.  Wish you could fix it so I can continue to play
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I have been looking for a good sourse for note taking and recoording appointments etc. This is easy to pill up and use
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blokus is a ton of fun in a short game. It's smart and great for any age. We're in our late 20's and think this game is great.
B0054VVRBQ|2.0|I speed tested the product and it is very fast reading at over 70MB/s on my 64Gb Lexar Professional 400x card. After a week of use my laptop started to exhibit really strange bootup issues. It would not even get to the BIOS screen. I started removing everything from my laptop and figured out that it is actually the card reader that is causing this issue. If I try to hot plug the card reader into the laptop it locks up hard and I have to hold down the power button for 10sec to force power cycle my laptop. I have contacted Transcend directly and will report back on their responsiveness.
6305428042|5.0|I am not a fan of Halloween and I don't like Halloween movies, but I LOVE this movie! It is a classic! Too funny!! And a fabulous musical number!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have waited 3 months to get a proper charger for my kindle. This one works great. I received it very fast after placing my order.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I had originally bought this on a regular DVD, but then went back out and bought it on Blu-Ray.  I love the costumes, the scenery, the house with all of its fabulous treasures and Blu-Ray really does it justice.<br /><br />The second series revolves around WWI and Matthew Crawley, the heir to the estate of Downton, goes off to war and finds himself a fiance...sadly, not Mary.  Everyone both upstairs and downstairs must deal with the rapid changes that come with the war, including Downton itself.  Nothing will ever be the same and even Robert, the Earl of Downton, says that the world they knew before seemed like a dream.<br /><br />This is the series where I really felt sorry for Thomas as he struggles with his choices and with his choices of affections.  While the push-pull between Mary and Matthew comes to a head in a heartwrenchingly wonderful way.  Sad and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />The Christmas show is absolutely wonderful.  I get a thrill everytime I see the scene where they light the tree.  I won't spoil anything more, but just when the war is finally over...it seems tragedy is still looming.  If you know history, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Maggie Smith as Lady Grantham is as pithy and sharp as ever and her continuing antagonistic relationship with Matthew's mother is ever amusing.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but you really should watch the first season before jumping into this one.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I gave it a 5 star ONLY because I like the packaging style and the prompt service. However, there is someone out there who received or WILL receive this box set and it will contain 2 Wrath of Khan  , as I have 2 Search for Spock!!!  Disappointing and a pain in the but to have to deal with. So I say, to those packing these items....GET WITH IT!
0525953728|5.0|Great story, amazing story of seal Team 6. I Couldn't put the book down once I started. I highly recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so good&middot; I finally found a great game that I enjoy if you read this it's worth 7 dollars
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Not bad. Does what it should.  Simple interface.  I may try the paid version so i  an wake to music.  not harsh like some alarms.
B008L1F91A|3.0|I do like this. first the colors are bright and overall it is very well made. What i don't care for as much is his face. Not sure exactly but he looks a little off though the resemblance to the back picture on DC's new 52 justice league is similar.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so happy that I can now read the greatest book ever written on my I phone as well as my kindle hd, I can read this every day at any time and any where I go as well as being able to just listen to it when I need my hands free. I am just so happy about having this app it is the best one I have ever gotten.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I am a Tom Cruise fan and I also live in Pittsburgh, PA where it was made.<br />Wonderful movie. Buy it, you will love it.
B00AVXSOSG|4.0|This story has been adapted in many more recent and popular stories as well as in films. Jane Austin describes emotions & situations that are evergreen
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|what can i say about biggie that already wasnt said? one of the best albums ever by one of the best ever. buy it and love it. all those 1 star reviews are by trolls, kids, or grumpy old men. dont listen to them this album is awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly superior.  I have loved it since the moment I played it.  I encourage Kiloo games to keep making different editions of Subwaysurfers. It would be my honor to play them.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|I just love this cd.  Even though I don't understand all the lyrics Andre Bocelli's renditions of ALL the songs are mesmerizing!  His duets are catchy too.  When I don't play the cd, the songs are playing in my head!!!
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|It works perfectly on my kindle fire HD. The game has the usual glitch factor of free roaming rpgs, but is so beautiful to play that you hardly notice. The story and game are short but sweet, I played through twice this weekend and had a ball!<br />  Aralon is quite a bit deeper with better,and more thought out game mechanics / personality, but the graphics and detail are better on Ravensword. 10 hours to finnish Ravensword, 20hours for Aralon. If you like Oblivion, or Skyrim, you can't help but like these two. These developers are truly getting close to&quot;Skyrim&quot; on a tablet....here's hoping they pull out all the stops and go for it!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Five star movie from my past. Any one over 40 would remember and truly enjoy.  Music is wonderful.  You will love it.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing. I immediately fell in love with it when i first got it. The art in this book is amazing, the timeline is good and even the manga was perfect. Ive had this book for a month now and i sometimes still read the pages I have already read. 5 Stars no doubt goodjob Dark Horse Books and Nintendo!!!
B007MJT1K2|5.0|My 6 and 9 year old boys loved this movie from start to finish...  It was filled with action to keep them interested.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series, loved the variety of vocabulary.  It is nice having to pull out my dictionary from time to time.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|We enjoy all of the Harry Potter Movies (and the books). We misplaced our original so ordered this as a replacement. A little confused about all the different versions - I thought we were getting the Blu-ray/DVD combo but received the Blu-ray with extra material. Not complaining, if we'd really been unhappy Amazon would have changed it out for us, think we actually made out and got a more expensive version. Just be aware.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|I'm going to assume that we are all already at least tangentially aware that Nick Cave is a very awesome dude.<br /><br />But this new album is freakin' mind-blowing. I'm just saying. Every single track is a masterpiece. It's signature Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, but also something entirely new.<br /><br />The album &#34;Push The Sky Away&#34; exists in a place of gray skies, cold tides, gritty downtown streets, unmade beds, tall trees, and sporadic data. In a world where women are alternately sexual objects and untouchable, almost mythical, creatures. In a space that straddles between the likes of Bukowski (esp. on &#34;Jubilee Street&#34;) and TS Eliot's &#34;Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock&#34; (esp. on &#34;Mermaids&#34;). In that crevice of your chest, where every emotion is sweeping, where the sounds are all sonically on-point, where you process the seemingly random missed connections and injustices and nonsensicalites and bits of infortmation that contemporary existence offers. In an almost transitional period, where you are your own judge, and you walk the sidewalks alone.<br /><br />It's hard to pick just one track to recommend. The single &#34;Jubilee Street&#34; is flawless, and is in a very Nick Cave-y place. Lyrics such as &#34;I've got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain&#34; will stick to your gut. The other single &#34;We No Who U R&#34; can be alternately sad or uplifting, depending where you're at in life.<br /><br />I think that &#34;Higgs Boson Blues&#34; is a good track for familiarizing yourself with the album's &#34;flavor.&#34; I personally have a soft spot for &#34;Mermaids.&#34; But, really, you should put on your best headphones, sit down, and take in the whole album.<br /><br />Note: The &#34;deluxe edition&#34; is a copy in fancy book binding (with cool-looking lyric pages and band photos), with a bonus DVD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app for any horse lover.  Take care of the horse, do competitions and see you horsewin
B003L77G10|5.0|The only problem with this is that I can't ever turn it off. I flew threw the second season! This show is the best, I hope they never cancel it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best game ever! New features like ziplines and minecarts and more! Beautiful graphics and interesting power ups! I highly recommend the game
B00BSBY38A|5.0|That says it all!  Not a religious movie at all, but more of a philosophical one, and then only about 20% of the time.
B0060AY85C|3.0|The ending snuck right up on me. Great writing though, and the story was compelling. Am still glad I read it.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|The end of SG-1 brought us Atlantis, a new team, a new galaxy and updated character profiles. Season 5 was the final season for this particular branch of the Stargate franchise. SG-1 set an impressive milestone at 10 seasons and became the longest running and most successful sci-fi series in the history of television. Atlantis, though it tried admirably, only made it to 5 seasons.<br /><br />This 5th and final season culminates with a few great battle scenes (definitely impressive for a television series) and the city ultimately returning to earth, it's home a million years earlier.<br /><br />Something you may or may not have noticed about the Stargate series. Just about every mythical god or object in our own real world got some sort of play in the Stargate series, from the evil system lords (named after infamous Egyptian and Asian rulers/pharoahs) to the Lost City of Atlantis in this series. As a result, every time I watch Ancient Aliens on H2, I see a group of strange individuals who obviously watched the Stargate franchise from beginning to end. Every single one of their Ancient Alien beliefs seems to stem from this series.<br /><br />So, the Stargate franchise had a profound effect on the sci-fi genre. I would label the Ancient Aliens series on H2 as an indirect spin-off from the Stargate franchise, only these people seem to want some sort of credibility established for their theories. Good luck with that!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game cant put it down did every thing I can do cant do no more have to wait for the person who built the game to add some more been waiting now for about 3mounths still not a thing so now its birding bout time to take it off my kindle and make room for another game that is fun
B0083DJWGO|1.0|Fooled by Randomness and Black Swan were interesting.  Antifragile is a series of made-up or esoteric words that Taleb strings together and rambles on about.  His comments about Stiglitz are especially noisome.  I'm pleased that, as I read more books by more talented and less egomaniac authors, Taleb's book is ratcheting down and will disappear onto the back  pages of my kindle.
1885167776|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo12X07O09UV6OR]]I never found a goal setting system that worked for me. The One Thing helped me focus my attention on the things that matter. For me focus = success. Buy The One Thing and experience amazing results.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|my grandson loves all of these- a great distraction.  I think it must be the illustration and the comedy- because the story seems to be a bit old for him.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is the definitive modernization of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  Captures the essence of the characters from the original books and drops them into modern England.  The humanity and flaws are part of the story and not exploited for some political point of the moment.  Worth the time to watch.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Morals and life lessons it's fun to read every time. Classic novel classic author. I love it and the movies
B0015DROBO|5.0|We're all poorer for the fact that three novels are all we get from this unique voice. Buy this book.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The total nudity in the first 5 minutes could have been eliminated and not have changed the the point of the movie at all.  Other than that and a few F bombs that could have been eliminated it was awesome!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I thought it would be funnier. Not worth 3.99. I thought it was a poor storyline.Dont  Hope you dont mind lots of pot smoking.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 continues the definitive modernization of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  The characters are more developed and the chemistry between Sherlock and Dr. Watson develops into a working partnership transcending a period of history but not devolving into a &#34;buddy&#34; movie.  Sherlock grows as a person as the series continues.  Worth the time to watch.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It is very good , but to long ,sometimes very boring ,the end could have been better , did not like all the articles,<br />It is for the adventures, thanks,
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well-written, complex, and utterly entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Curious how the movie adaptation will be. Highly recommend this book.
B000IY03IM|5.0|The live in Montreal concert has been issued by many different labels over the years and I can honestly say that this edition is THE one to have.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent and is definitely from the master.<br /><br />The sound quality is also excellent and in 5.1 surround sound as well.<br /><br />The audio has definitely been remastered and is very loud and clear throughout.<br /><br />Jaco fans don't miss this one!<br /><br />All-star lineup of Jaco, Mintzer, Randy Brecker, Othello, Don Alias and Peter Erskine!!
1455523550|5.0|What can I say, I am a Nicholas Sparks fan.  I don't think I have ever read a book of his I haven't liked/loved.  This one is no different.  A friend wanted to see this movie in the theater but I wanted to read the book first (books are always better then the movie).  I picked it up and had it finished in less then 24 hours.  Now I cannot wait to see the movie.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Actors good; plots good; interesting characters.  I'm midway through Season 1 and hoping all the other episodes as good as the first ones were
0439023521|5.0|What a compelling book. You're right in there from the very start with a scary life or death scenario that doesn't let up.  Definite echoes of that classic 'the Running Man',<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend it for read but only if you can tolerate a degree of gore and violence, I guess also this is also a young adult story but hey I'm young at heart!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|his book has great insight and is very informative. It is not just for<br />people struggling in their marriage, but will also be very helpful to those<br />with a good marriage that want to make it even better.
B008J34466|5.0|There are angry love songs, sad love songs, all of it is good. Not one bad song on this CD.
030758836X|3.0|The book started out a little slow but quickly picked up speed.  By the time I was in the middle of the book I could not put it down and stayed up late to finish it.  I must say the ending was a big disappointment.  This is the first novel I have read from Gillian Flynn and will commit to reading one more of her books before I say I do or do not like her writing style.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I'm still trying to choke the books down.  They are ok, and I'm glad they have a story line, gets a little slow in the middle.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|This book is awesome!<br />I really liked all of the hunters and the hunted<br />I think this book should get 5 stars
B005OK721G|4.0|DVD was in good shape and the movie was great. the movie reminds me of the count of monte cristo.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|First off, it doesn't drain my battery like the other &#34;FREE&#34; apps do.. i.e. weather.com.<br /><br />Yes, this is a paid app and I didn't mind paying for it!  If I could ask for an improvement it would be for something that ALL weather apps seem to ignore....  what was the HIGH for the day, and what was the LOW for the day!!!  I don't care that the current temp is the LOW/HIGH...  but I would love to know what the actual HIGH and/or the LOW of the day really was.  When I get off of work in the evenings, I want to know if it's the hottest/coldest time of the day or what.  Also, it would be nice to see the averages for said day of the year...  I know that it's raining/sunny as I'm ALIVE and don't really need an app for that but it would be nice to know if our current weather is normal, below normal, or above normal...  This info is what ALL weather apps lack.  Also, are we above or below precipitation norms?  Come on weather app developers! If all I want is the &#34;current&#34; conditions, I can either stick my head out of the window or use my weather rock. It's pretty accurate..  If it's cold, it's a good chance it's cold outside.  If it's hot, it's a pretty good chance it's hot outside. If it's wet, its a pretty good chance it's raining... get the picture?  The obvious is not what we want out of a weather app.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|I usually like stories with anti-hero heroes, but this was a little too dark and sordid for my taste. Without trying to give away too much, the undercurrent of sexual brutality was a little too extreme for my tastes, but after reading all 3 of the &#34;Dragon Girl&#34; books, I can understand why. However, this movie version was a little too disjointed, too many things going on simultaneously. That's a little unavoidable with any complex story line, but I think the movie could have done a much better job of fleshing out more of the important scenes and themes while keeping the story coherent, and still convey the brutality of the story in less deliberately graphic ways.
B000NY12CI|4.0|An English teacher thought the sentence structure was lacking, but it is her second language.  I found it very informative.  I am much more aware of the Muslin religion.
B0094K1JPC|4.0|THIS WAS A VERY CUTE MOVIE. NOT EXCEPTIONAL BUT ENTERTAINING. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. IT WAS PREDICTABLE BUT ARENT ALL MOVIES OF THIS TYPE?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use Kindle and KOBO and NOOK apps, all on my Android tablet.  Using multiple apps, rather than a dedicated device like the Kindle HD 8.9, allows me to purchase the books that I want at the lowest price from whichever source has it on sale - just like shopping in the real world!  Who'd have thunk it!<br /><br />Love the app.  Wife says it works just like her Kindle, so that's good enough for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Yup....if you love the grandeur of the Victorian Era...if you love English accents....if you love a fast-moving,<br />unpredictable storyline, you'll love this.
B00A757EFW|3.0|The floating the pac-man makes it hard to play. Ghost pac hovers in the way and you  can't see where you're going.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Allows you to open and read, even fill in forms, on PDF documents on your android tablet or phone. Overall, meets my expectations and requirements!
0062127241|5.0|My husband and I are fans of e British group, The Who and this book was the perfect Christmas gift for my husband.
1606995359|5.0|Like other books in this series the nostalgia is great, the paper quality very good, and the coloring fantastic.  The stories are good and even as a kid living eons ago I hated the Beagle Boys and pulled for Scrooge, Donald, and the nephews.  Who can help but enjoy a character who has a bin that holds three cubic acres of money, who likes to dive in it like a porpoise, who likes to burrow through it like a gopher, and who likes to through it in the air and hit him on the head?  Buy the book and enjoy every second of reading it. (I really did hate the Beagle Boys.)
B004N6369Y|4.0|Good Story but a little too long.  Could have written the book and gotten the same message across in a shorter version.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire and have had a lot of fun playing it. Some of the puzzles are harder than others and it seems to get progressively more difficult (with frozen or chained pieces that you need to release).
1607053551|5.0|Excellent tips and tutorials and practical help. Lots of great information and well written.  Author knowledgable and I give it Five Stars!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A movie about believing in God and maintaining your faith no matter the circumstances. This movie has the best special effects I have ever seen and we don't even own a 3D T.V. It's a sad story of losing much like life and how you must cope since that's all you can do, but how you survive yourself. Life comes full circle with a happy ending to those who successfully navigate through the tumult life brings.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This has been one of my favorite animated films in quite a long time. I will be honest and admit that I don't have any children, nor do I have any younger siblings. My roommate and I went to see this movie a couple of times in the theater, just because we liked it that much. As goofy as it sounds, it reminded me of the stuff I used to believe in as a child, and that it really never hurts to continue believing in stuff (within reason, of course). Either way, the movie is good, it's funny, it's emotional. It's a good family movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was comparable to Fifty Shades of Grey in that it was exciting and sexual, but it was a better written novel.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is an easy read that helps explain the power of habits and how we develop - and then change them.

0439023513|4.0|I want to premise this review with a few things. First, Hunger Games is one of my favorite books. Catching Fire was just as good, if not better! Finally, Suzanne Collins must have made some kind of Faustian deal to be such an amazing writer, or at least have some special powers. When the third and final installment was released on Tuesday, I was thrilled! I have been waiting for this book for over a year! But when it came to actually reading the book, I knew something was wrong. Earlier in the week I had reread the first two books and found them just as captivating and engrossing as the first time I had read them. But Mockingjay? I kept putting it down! I had no problem setting it aside to do something else... This didn't bode well.<br /><br />Mockingjay picks up shortly after Catching Fire left off with the rebels from District 13 saving Katniss, Finnick, and Beetee from the arena in the 75th Hunger Games. Her family and Gale and his family have gotten out of District 12 with a handful of other refugees, but most of the people and all of the district (except Victor's Village) has been bombed and burned to the ground. Now Katniss is living with the other refugees and District 13 in their underground facilities that are basically a subterranean city. But Katniss isn't really \\"living\\" in the the realest sense. Mostly she hides, shirks her duties, and avoids all contact with people if possible.<br /><br />When President Coin, the leader of District 13, wants Katniss to agree to be the Mockingjay, a symbol of freedom and courage for the rebel movement against the Capitol, Katniss refuses at first. When she sees Peeta, who was captured by the Capitol, on TV and he has clearly been beaten and tortured, she agrees to be the Mockingjay with a few conditions- one being the immunity of all Hunger Games victors, including Peeta. District 13 then primps and preens Katniss into the Mockingjay and parades her through multiple propaganda videos (called propos) to keep the war effort motivated. Of course, this involves keeping her mostly out of danger, with the exception of a few surprise attacks by the Capitol.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />Once the Districts have been won over by the rebels, however, the Capitol is the final battle to be won. Coin creates a group of \\"Celebrity\\" soldiers that includes Katniss, Finnick, Gale, and Peeta, among others, and she sends them off to the Capitol. The carefully planned mission, however, goes horribly awry when the \\"pods\\" (easily triggered defensive weapons that carry everything from black tar waves, to shrapnel bombs, to tracker jackers) are too numerous to avoid. As the Capitol bombs their previous hiding place and assumes they are all dead, the group makes its way to President Snow's mansion on an assassination mission. It doesn't go as planned, however, and Katniss's greatest fears are quickly becoming realities.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book so much. In fact, it wouldn't have taken much for me to absolutely love it as much as the first two books in the series, but for some reason it fell short for me. It wasn't a huge disappointment, just not as amazing as the first two books were. I would love to hear how others felt about it, because I am worried maybe my own expectations negatively affected my opinion. The truth is I hated Katniss in this book. She was weak and damaged. Ok, I can accept that. But she was also whiny, petulant, and refused to take responsibility for the revolution she played a part in. I wanted so much more out of this older, more mature, and wiser Katniss. I didn't want her to hide in laundry rooms and broom closets for naps throughout the whole book. Even when she gets Peeta back (in bad shape, but away from the Capitol at least), she is still moping about. She does go on about killing Snow, but it almost seems like an afterthought.<br /><br />Another complaint was the rushed feeling of the deaths of major characters. I will admit, I was reading quickly at some points, but I would read a paragraph and a character would be gone with very little explanation or time to process. Just GONE! Now, I read quite a few apocalyptic stories and dystopias, and I am not surprised when important characters are killed. That is, after all, the nature of the genre. But why wouldn't you give those characters the respect they are due?<br /><br />I did like the guilt Katniss displayed at how many lives were at stake because of the revolution she was involved in. Every rebel life, every innocent civilian life, and every district that was affected by the war is like one more thing peeling away at Katniss's sanity. I know she was a reluctant face of this war, but is important to see her pain for each and every death her involvement is even loosely responsible for. This humility was one of the most endearing qualities in Katniss, from her first time in the arena with the loss of Rue and even Thresh, all the way to the loss of her friends, like Cinna, and the people of her district. Unfortunately, this guilt seemed to overwhelm the determined Katniss we saw in the first two books- the Katniss who grieved for those losses but it didn't make her stop surviving the most hopeless of situations.<br /><br />On a whole, this was a decent ending to the series. It isn't what I expected, but that is a good quality in a book. There were some things I didn't like, but they didn't ruin the whole thing for me. I loved this series as a whole, and can't wait to give it to my new students this school year. I am interested to hear what others though, though!, but I would read a paragraph and a character would be gone with very little explanation or time to process. Just GONE!

B009CPJHY4|5.0|When I first saw the promo for this movie in the theater, I thought I wouldn't like it, so never went to see it. Recently, on vacation where I had no TV at night to fall asleep to, I deceided to give this a try. Loved it so much I watched it twice. Really a great move!

B008220D5K|3.0|This has got to be one of the most uncomfortable films I've watched in a long time.  Which in many ways is good, especially with a Judd Apatow movie.<br /><br />It's uncomfortable because characters stand by as spectators of their own demise; uncomfortable because people behave horribly to one another; and uncomfortable because, while they say awful, albeit true things to one another, they rarely have the wherewithal to say anything equally cutting toward themselves.<br /><br />Serving as a sequel for two of the supporting characters of Apatow's blockbuster hit [[ASIN:B008P94WPW Knocked Up [HD]]], \\"This Is 40\\" begins with a revelatory comment made by husband Pete (Paul Rudd) to his wife Debbie (Leslie Mann) one day during sex: he believes the great sex they are having is due to his having taken Viagra.  Debbie, enraged that he should feel that the drug was necessary - and in addition sensing it as a bitter link to her 40th birthday two weeks from then - storms off, and a fortnight of running arguments ensue.<br /><br />As one might guess by the title, the conceit of the story is that life has hit a rut.  In addition, money is running tight: Pete's record label/music club is losing money, and Debbie's clothing store is missing $12,000, most likely from embezzlement.  Pete has been lending money to his father at an alarming rates, his record label has been losing money, they've missed a mortgage payment, and the rent on the business location has not been paid - it's no surprise tensions are high.<br /><br />What makes all of this worse is that each of the character refuses to deal with their life in any intelligent manner: Debbie refuses to acknowledge her approaching birthday, and Pete will neither own up to his financial woes nor the fact that his idealistic faithfulness to signing unpopular bands like Graham Parker and the Rumors is driving him to ruin.<br /><br />Rudd and Mann are terrific as the troubled couple, and one wonders how much of the story is autobiographical, at least in theme, as Apatow continues to use his own family to portray his on-screen family: as in \\"Knocked Up\\" not only is Mann his real-life wife, but daughters Maude and Iris Apatow play onscreen daughters Sadie and Charlotte.  All are quite capable in their roles.<br /><br />The problem with \\"This Is 40\\" is not the uncomfortable nature of the subject matter - more on this in a moment - but rather the fact that the movie rambles on, losing its focus at times.  There are characters who could be much better saved for a later film, where they could have focus and clarity.  A case in point is Debbie's father Oliver (John Lithgow), who has been missing from her life so long that he has to be introduced to her husband and her children.  Though he is one of the few characters who achieves some kind of resolution by the story's end, he feels thrown in to the mix for balance simply because Pete's free-loading father Larry (Albert Brooks) gets a good deal of screen time.  I never felt the character was given the life the others were...nothing in Debbie's demeanor really seemed to command the feeling she had had this particular father, or the absence of him.  He just felt, well...invented.<br /><br />And while no magic genie has to make every character wrap up his or her story at the movie's end, I just felt there was a dearth of resolution...of course, there will be those who say that's life, but I felt \\"Knocked Up\\" did it better.<br /><br />One reason: there are just too many characters begging for time: Annie Mumalo, who plays Debbie's friend Barb, is hilarious in the couple of spots in which she appears, but so much attention is split here and there between the glut of characters that she is unfortunately shorted.<br /><br />Luckily, this is not true of everybody: scene-chewing Melissa McCarthy is spot on as always, playing the mother of a boy who bullied Pete and Debbie's daughter Sadie (Maude Apatow) on her Facebook page.  It would ruin the scene to tell youanything about it, but let it suffice to say you should watch the credits for more of her antics.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this movie...and many times due precisely to my feelings of discomfort. I only felt it didn't do enough with what it had, precisely because it was trying to do too much.anything about it, but let it suffice to say you should watch the credits for more of her antics.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this movie...and many times due precisely to my feelings of discomfort.

Also, a very fascinating look into how the film was made, and some very interesting historic information about the real tragedy in 1912.<br /><br />If you're a Titanic addict like me, this is a must have.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this book. Gave me a totally new insight into communicating with my dog! Its a real tear jerker, but worth all the tears (I'm not normally someone who likes those types of books). The story is very humorous and a real &#34;feel good&#34; kind of book.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Fast paced, exciting, a movie that I will watch over and over. As a confirmed trekkie I was sceptical at first to watch this because I didnt see Chris Pine filling the role of James T Kirk. However the story line and the supporting cast soon mitigated those feelings.  Highly recommend this flick!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this book, or the series, but I love it! Actually, &#34;love&#34; isn't a strong enough word. I can't get enough of these books. I can't put 'em down.

1423140605|5.0|I believe the greatest determiner of a child's success in  school is a love of reading. It seems difficult these days to capture the interest of super active young boys especially, with all the flashy multi-media activities and outdoor adventuring to be done. Although my 4th grade grandson still loved to be read to, he detested reading himself. This year, his wonderful teacher introduced him to this author. In a few short months, he has read every book this man has written. He can hardly put them down and can't wait for the next one to arrive. His interest in learning more about mythology has broadened his horizons to other authors' work as well. Oh, and he's on the honor roll --woo hoo!!
1476712042|3.0|ok more like 3 and 3/4 star. I suppose I expected more from all the BUZZ and reviews about this book. This reads like a mature YA book. Did I like the story: YES!!!!!!!!!! and I adore the characters, Abby is great and Travis, well he's delicious. Now saying that...these are college aged characters, yes there was language and the sexual innuendo was there, but REALLY WTH??<br />Travis Maddox is supposed to be this super sexed guy, whose banging everything that walks, and is envied by all his frat buddies...REALLY!!! Even though Abby was a virgin, I would have been pi***** off! Come on No foreplay at all, I don't need all the intimate details but come on....this guy is some sexual GOD and he takes her in what 10 seconds???? I felt like the author wrote this: and they had sex..THE END!!! I wanted to poke out my eyes, I was so infuriated, and even the 2nd time, no foreplay, no loving touches, it was just WAM BAM THANK YOU MAM. Frankly Travis would have to be more then a pretty face, all of the girls he was with, had to be drunk, and they \\"thought\\" they had great sex. This book was good, I just expected more....I guess I kind of hoped for WAIT FOR ME, set in college, really smoking hot guy, however they actually had good sex, and we actually got to read it!! This should have been YA with a caution due to language.

B00BEFL5Q8|4.0|Sounds like they never missed a beat. More of a sequel to &#34;Coming Up&#34; than &#34;New Morning.&#34;<br />Nice melodies throughout and enough musical depth to make for solid listening pleasure.<br />Subject matter,  well that's another story.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this puzzled game.  However, my girlfriend has blue/green and red/orange color blindness.  She can't tell the colors of the dots apart.  I would recommend changing the shapes of the color dots from all circles to circles for one color, triangles for the second, squares for the third, then pentagons, hexagons, five point stars, six point stars etc.  Doing so would make the puzzles more accessible--if that is the right word--to those who suffer from color blindness; but, for those of us who can easily tell the colors apart, these puzzles are challenging and intriguing.  The timed puzzles are an especially challenging aspect of the game.

B00AFROVQC|3.0|As others have said, things happen way too fast, but the main problem for me was that everything was just too easy for the main character.  He is an absolute paragon of good, perfect at everything, without a single flaw.  Everything he attempts to do gets resolved successfully in just a few pages.

0552562521|5.0|I was astonished to uncover a book like no other, which contrary to epic fantasy creations contains solid scientific fact amid a contemporary feel. As a huge fan of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series, I was already familiar with Nicholas Flamel who had created the Philosopher's stone (the elixir of life) and so secrets to immortality had already been discovered. What I did not expect to find was a totally original creation with exciting characters, which took me on the most thrilling journey and otherworldly adventure. The two `meddling' twins reminded me of Fred and George Weasley's distinct personalities, as they brought such vibrancy and energy to the gripping narrative. Cleverly combining folklore with mythology, this is a series (that although targeted towards the younger reader), will appeal to JRR Tolkien fans and those who enjoy spellbinding fantasy in the vein of Harry Potter or His Dark Materials.<br /><br />The Alchemist is the first installment within a five book series that focuses on Nicholas Flamel the seven hundred year old Alchemyst. Born in Paris on 28 September 1330, Flamel is known as one of the greatest Alchemyst of all-time, with his discovery of the secret to eternal life being a noteworthy achievement. Within the book of Abraham the Mage lies this powerful secret, and so in the wrong hands it could ultimately destroy the world...this element reminded me of Torchwood: Miracle Day, when no one dies!<br />...modern day - Dr. John Dee plans to steal the book. A prophecy states that two youngsters, Sophie and Josh Newman are the only ones with the power to prevent this from happening. As Sophie and Josh find themselves in the middle of a perilous quest to save mankind from extinction, they also realize the magnitude of this when at the heart of one of the greatest legends of all-time...<br /><br />Plunging into a dazzlingly dangerous world filled with immortals and extraordinary creatures, distant lands and vast realms was simply breathtaking. As an avid reader and individual whose mind spends one hundred percent of its time in a fantasy land (whether that be Hogwarts or Middle-Earth), I was utterly awestruck by the inspired vision and scope of this novel. I cannot enthuse enough about this remarkable series which was pure joy to read, addictive and profoundly absorbing as to render me unable to put the book down. If I could give more than a five star rating I would, hence I cannot wait to delve into book 2 `the Magician'.<br /><br />...What would you do if you held the secret which could end the world?<br /><br />*I won a paperback copy of \\"Book 1: the secrets of the immortal Nicholas Flamel, The Alchemyst\\" by Michael Scott, from a Goodreads (first-read) giveaway.

B001ANSS5K|5.0|The characters in this book are more real than many because of the journey they go through imagining each other complexly. The fullness of these personalities is so infiltrating they may make you realize some wrong imaginations you've been making about people around you. This makes everyone more real than they had been to you before...<br />Witty Dialogue: These kids play Metaphysical I-Spy, where in what you spy can not actually be seen, enough said...<br />Recommendation: Everyone who has to coexist with other people.

B0009U55SI|5.0|This recording, made in 1958, is a remarkable technical and musical achievement in this newly remastered format. Musically it is one of the, if not the absolute, best performances I have ever heard of this symphony. Technically it stands comparison with Blu-ray productions such as those by Abbado and Gergiev in so far as every last detail that Reiner brings out is faithfully and clearly reproduced by the recording. What a fabulous orchestra the CSO was under Reiner!<br /><br />The performance itself radiates a sunny atmosphere with Reiner keeping a light hand on the myriad textures that Mahler develops. The larger moments certainly fully rise to the occasion with plenty of weight - those towards the end of the first movement and the big climax of the slow movement especially. Otherwise this comes over as very much a joyful symphony with a pastoral flavour and very much Bohemian countryside. The solo violin is correctly kept within the texture of the orchestra so does not become dominant like a concerto soloist and so the proportions are retained as Mahler surely envisioned. Lisa Della Casa proves to be the perfect choice of singer for the last movement, perfectly matching Reiner's vision - and vision it is.<br /><br />I would suggest that this is a very important musical document and fully deserving of serious consideration from anyone interested in this symphony. For those wondering if the latest remastering would justify replacing earlier copies, the answer on this occasion is, in my opinion, a very clear 'yes.'<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />You are so right!<br />- BTW not only did Stravinsky call the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Reiner the greatest orchestra on the planet, but to think how beautifully Lewis Layton, his engineer layed down this score more than a half-century so ago, now with an assist from Soundmirror to an SACD, is nothing short of miraculous! I hope Mahler fans will hear this. Thanks for your review...  (US review comment)ar this. Thanks for your review...  (US review comment)

B0006PV5VC|5.0|This disc, compiled of recordings made as long ago as 1956 (Stravinsky) and 1960 (Rimsky), is a further example of the remarkable early stereo recordings made by RCA and which stand up to comparison with many of the latest digital issues.<br /><br />For many collectors, the main attraction of this disc will lie with the Rimsky Korsakov. This very showy piece seems to be ideal as a display piece for the combined talents of this very talented orchestra. The whole piece was recorded in one day, two movements before lunch and the last two movements recorded after lunch. The last movement was recorded in pone take without any splicing. That is a remarkable end to a day's end when one would have expected fatigue to be a factor. Quite the contrary, as the playing carries all before it and to a conclusion capable of putting many others to shame. The piece is not all virtuosic display though as the third movement clearly shows with a sumptuous understanding of Rimsky's portrayal of the gentler side of these oriental tales. Of all the performances I have heard or have owned of this work, this one by Reiner stands clear of the rest.<br /><br />The Stravinsky seems a curious choice of a coupling. Apart from the oriental setting, there is little else in common between the two works. The Nightingale is a spikier Stravinsky than any of the three earlier ballets - Firebird, Petrushka and the Rite. Melodic or lyrical inspiration takes a second place to scenic situations that are portrayed with some aggression and irony with the limitations of the mechanical nightingale clearly exposed musically. One supposes that Stravinsky did not like this featured Emperor any more than Rimsky liked the Emperor in his own Golden Cockerel opera story. Regardless, Reiner once more delivers a very fine performance of this short ballet score.<br /><br />In conclusion I would suggest that this performance and recording of the Rimsky piece is of such quality as makes it deserving of very serious consideration from all potential purchasers. In addition it includes a very fine Stravinsky performance as an interesting if somewhat unusual choice of coupling. I would also suggest that this would be a very good upgrade option for those interested in replacing an earlier edition of this disc as the recording has been markedly improved in tonal range, depth of aural field and dynamics in line with the best of this series of remastered recordings.ration from all potential purchasers.

6300214184|5.0|If it was'nt for Flashdance, there probably would've never been a Dirty Dancing movie. This was out in theaters WAY before Patrick Swayze became famous for his role. Jennifer Beals is ssssmokin' HOT in this movie both on and off the stage. If you like your dancing hot and sexy, this is one of the original movies to show you just that.
B008645YEE|4.0|I selected this album for creating mood for some of my magic I do for schools, charities, and birthday parties
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Really was a great read.  The book hooks you right away and leaves you thinking about the ideas for a long time after. I felt like Wool 5 was a little rushed, but I would highly recommend this book and have already done so with a lot of people.  I'm going to buy the next installment right away.
B003XE3G0Q|5.0|The issues with my feet are many...I've bunions and hammertoes on one foot which limits what I can wear.<br />A nurse (who was wearing a pair) told me to try them and I can't tell you what a difference they make.<br />I walk every morning and wear them all day long.  It feels as though I'm walking on air.  Shayna has a high<br />toe box which is what I need.  They were delivered in a timely manner and I will order them over and over again.<br />If you're on the fence don't hesitate...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm obsessed with downton abby, wish there were more shows like this on TV, so you could watch quality programs together as a family!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I recommend this one to all millitary, active, retired, and vets. Most of us have stories that involve  little twists of fate, none are nearly as remarkable as the lives Franz and Charlie lived.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I laughed through the entire movie! It was hilarious and the cast was just perfect! Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are amazing together, and the Apatow girls are hilarious. I'm definitely buying this movie to own.
0345529057|5.0|bought it for my son and he is loving it - i think my husband will be reading it also
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun easy read. Love all the bluegrass books so far! Can't wait for the next! I would recommend for anyone looking for a feel good read!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Our family LOVES this show!  Every one loves it!  Watch this show!  You won't be sorry!  Everyone in the family will like it!
B0092YO8C6|3.0|We received and downloaded the song fine. I am not a fan but my child is so it would be a child recommendation but not an adult one.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|My husband and I had rather low expectations for this show, as we couldn't wrap our heads around Watson being a woman (let alone Lucy Liu), but the dynamic between Sherlock and Watson works pretty well and the plot-lines are dynamic and interesting.  I like how the director via the camera views lets the ordinary viewer make their own deductions as the show proceeds, which is one of my favorite things to do while watching mystery shows.  We would definitely recommend this.
1476734941|5.0|We have received and are into the first week of this plan.  It looks like<br />it will work for us.

B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is the best Backgammon app I have and it works perfectly<br />on my Galaxy Tablet 7&#34;.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see is the ability to add a name for high score.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the idea of having an alarm clock on the Kindle Fire HD even though I rarely use it, and the times that I did, I woke up prior to it going off... I just use it as a backup alarm when I need one, this one looks nice.
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|This album is wonderful, the combinations of textures, guitars, synths, wavy hiccupy lyrical delivery, makes this album feel very authentic and innovative.

0385349947|5.0|As a man, I read this book because I have a daughter who is beginning college in the fall and she will be majoring in business. I want her to be as informed as she can be so that she will be as equipped as she can be to handle any potential barriers or gender-based expectations in her future career. After reading \\"Lean In,\\" I gave the book to my daughter and strongly urged her to read it soon. She realized how enthusiastic I was about \\"Lean In\\" and has already begun reading it. What a treasure for women and young ladies everywhere!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I watch it to time. excellent. very good story. and good acting. good action. and good love story. mel  Gibson is the best.in braveheart.

0307352153|5.0|I've felt guilty for being an introvert all my 70+ years -- and for having a son who is an introvert by nature.  This book provides vindication.  (Introversion also is a blessing for someone who has chronic illness & must spend most time alone.)
B007REV4YI|4.0|Best Daniel Craig, James Bond yet. Judy Dench is a wonderful actress and I want the storyline to be that she didn't really die just ran off with Albert Finney after recovering from her gun shot wound.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Did anyone else notice that some of the items were crisp while others were horribly pixelated? I am under no illusions that it takes an art team to make a game and not a single artist.... but can't the art lead ask their team to stick to a specific pixel aspect ratio? The art style wasn't cohesive at all.<br /><br />Another bother was the irrational placement of objects. I know the rooms are supposed to look \\"messy\\" but there were objects floating in midair!<br /><br />I've played many different types of search puzzles where the objective is to find \\"100 drawn stars\\" or \\"spot all the fairies\\" knowing I'm not going to just be looking at the sky... but with the premise that these places could actually exist (a hotel, a town, etc.), I'm forced to try to make sense of objects caught in a space vacuum. Besides that, it all looks very thrown together- graphics as well as storyline.<br /><br />The search on the first level was challenging... but only because it made no sense. She asks you specifically to \\"find her spectacles\\", and while you do that for awhile you realize she actually meant \\"Find my glasses AFTER you first find my lamp, mask, statue, pillow, etcetera, etcetera\\". I don't remember having been told to ignore the story and look at the left side of the screen for outlines of the objects I was supposed to be finding instead?! I mean, was that ever indicated before you start the first level? Later she asks for you to find all the keys in the room, and I was elated. The story matched the mission and I didn't have to guess what they wanted me to do next.<br /><br />What's frustrating to me is how close this game came to being really good and fell short on such an important feature as cohesiveness. If the creators took back their game and resized all of their objects, people and background to an equal level of detail... I'd pay full price for the game and give it 4stars. I'd even forgive that the storyline was almost completely erroneous to your missions and just label it \\"whimsical fun\\"! Otherwise, I'm going to tell people the truth: this game wasn't worth your hard earned money, and go look up \\"where's waldo\\" for some REAL fun.el it \\"whimsical fun\\"! Otherwise, I'm going to tell people the truth: this game wasn't worth your hard earned money, and go look up \\"where's waldo\\" for some REAL fun.
1476734941|2.0|My sponser got me this book.  They tell us not to fix each other but I guess she thought I was fat cause this is like the 4th diet book she has given me.  And i say how am i supposed to eat organic and  vegetables when it is cheaper to have a macaroni and cheese for three or four meals.  So she said this book is the answer.  Just don;t eat.  All my life I've been trying to get thinner - be better - get out from under.  When I was a girl my mother got tossed out of town - she was having relations with the minister and he was supoosed to be a good man but he wasn't  - and so that's when i started to eat too much - and later after I got with a man who treated me like a pile of nothin for so long - and told me that he liked bigger ladies and then he'd get high on paint thinner and call me names while he ate and ate - well I got free of all of that mess- and i got free of drugs and alcohol and now methadone too - althohgh that was the hardest which don;t seem right cause it is supposed to cure you not get you all addicted again.  Now I work part time at a job and try to make ends meet - i walk to the bus and i try to do a little exercise every now and them.  But used to they called this diet jsut being poor - not having enough to eat.  And i been through that enough.  Coming home and finding the grocery moeny gone so Carl could buy his tar.  Well now he is in prison getting fed three square a day and I am struggling to make ends meet on disability and  part time cash job.  So i guess i will try this diet - cause it fits into my budget.  But once I make some money - I am gonna eat every day.  And just be ok with being a big person.
B00BF11STU|1.0|my expectations were sky high coming into this movie that it would have alot of tension and suspense, sadly the film has none of that this is so boring and useless and shouldn't see it unless you're 80 years old i don't know how 93% of critics liked it and 81% of users liked it.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The movie was everything I wanted. Brilliant casting everyone deserves praise for putting the movies together.<br />Hugh jackman was the perfect jean valjean.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|Movie was so slow.  Feel sorry for the parents of this Christopher McCandless.  Not something I would recommend to anyone.  Seemed like a waste of time.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|Pictures are faded and very poor quality.  I was really happy to see film available for my polaroid camera and then totally disappointed in the pictures.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|I first heard this band back in 1972 while in England and immediately fell in love with the catchy melodies and sweet as syrup harmonic vocals.  Having heard the group in England, it led me to believe that this group was English (which of course they weren't).  During that era, there were many non American groups that were influenced by Americana/Southern and The Old West roots music.  To name a few..........Matthew's Southern Comfort and (of course) The Band.<br /><br />When a band has been around as long as The Eagles, it would be impossible to accurately and completely document them.  There is some validity to the claims of wives and lovers and all of the \\"dirt\\" being left out, perhaps more of \\" this\\" and more of \\"that\\" should have been included to round out and make a more \\"honest\\" account of the band.<br /><br />But I think that it's the MUSIC that should be and IS center stage and the DVD(s) capture this very well.<br /><br />Just my opinion (and your money) but I think $250 is CRaaaaaaaaaaaaaaZY to spend and if you HAVE TO HAVE THIS DVD, ok......$30 is not too bad an amount.<br /><br />I found this 3 hour history of The Eagles to be informative as well as entertaining.<br /><br />However in the end.........I think the owner will place this DVD in their library along with other groups of that era such as The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Hendrix, Woodstock etc. and play it every so often.<br /><br />It helps to be a fan of the Eagles and for that reason...I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  But for the rest of you out there.....perhaps only 3 out of 5 stars.  After the novelty wears off......how often will you play it?  For that matter..........how often do you play the other 60-70s DVDs of the other rock groups in your collection?<br /><br />I thought so.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|The ensemble group seems to work well together and it shows in the acting.<br />The acting and writing continues to be good.
B003730LRY|4.0|Actually was not interested in this but my husband was an Addams Family fan from childhood.  Movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  Some good laughs and just an easy movie to watch.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I love it when I first saw it. So I was happy to get a chance to purchase it. Cheers
B008220DIC|5.0|I saw this movie at the beginning of the Summer last year. I've been waiting for this item ever since I saw it. The Master is primarily a charcter-driven film with the highest quality performances of the year. The screenplay leaves one to interpret the story in many ways. Beautiful cinematography and direction make the Blu-ray a necessity. Universal themes make this movie a timeless masterpiece.
B0086A40AW|5.0|No black humor blacker, no stark horror more unsettling.  Lynch's masterpiece.<br />The box is marked &#34;region B&#34; which is supposed to mean it won't play on U.S. hardware, but it plays just fine.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is a fun and additive game in the beginning. Then as you go along you can't find the items you need unless you buy diamonds. It gets very expensive fast. Have had connectivity issues and slow game.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Upgrade us NOT synonymous with improvement in this case.  It runs more slowly, Stops and starts, loses animals, rewards are few and too far between, it has become a slower,less entertaining game,over all.  :-(
B0063GORYU|2.0|Directions are not very clear.  I found it difficult to understand the instructions.  I do not play this game on my Kindle.
0979019710|5.0|I read and listen to about 3-5 books per week. I am NOT a morning person so when I saw the word morning in the title I was a little bit afraid it would not apply to me or I would not be able to do it. If I go to bed early I still sometimes have a hard time getting out of bed!<br /><br />I figured maybe I need a better system because we always hear how very successful people get up early so with best of intentions I read the book.<br /><br />This book does not disappoint as it actually helped give me a proven framework for not just waking up early but what would get me EXCITE to wake up early and what I actually DO when I wake up early.<br /><br />Often with books I have to read between the lines and try to put together a system from the topic because it is not explicit.  Hal did a WONderful job detailing out step by step what he does so I can just follow the system.<br /><br />Thank you for making it so easy. Also the stories he tells are truly amazing and memorable so I can definitely see myself remembering a lot of the tactics he mentions for the long haul.<br /><br />Highly recommend getting the book.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|From my point of view, the description passages in this book exceeded the action moments, so sometimes I caught myself wishing eagerly for at least some dialogues to ease the reading. But I must admit that even those &#34;dense&#34; descriptions added a lot to the story, and that this book left me intrigued and wishing for the next book to be published, so I can keep following the Game of Thrones :)
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Most was great. CGI was not great but made it easier to bare sad scenes. Just a one time flick.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like it because its so simple to use.the update the weather so often it is just a great app.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I can review this before it arrives because I have seen the movie.  If you're one who has amassed the rest of this series, it's a must have.  Though slightly drawn out, it's well done and I can't wait for the next movie that is slated to come out in November 2013, and the final, in November 2014.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy and fast read.  A good story for a vacation or a weekend jaunt.  I would recommend this one to my friends.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|well written, evocative.  I had to do a little reading to be sure but no one knows the source of the painting.  Chevalier has painted a believable story.  The characters and plot COULD have been real.  I enjoyed evrey page.
B002VHI8J0|2.0|This book pushed me beyond reasonable limits.  I persevered because I am in a book club and didn't want to quit, but I did.  The first story was far to gruesome and violent; the language was torturous.  There were too many sudden changes with the introduction of each new story.  Just as I settled into one, it abruptly stopped and forced me into a totally new realm.  I despised the ongoing cumbersome language.  The thread connecting each story seemed to be humanity's power-hunger, greed and avarice coupled with a compelling desire for justice and the right to exist. But it was too 'all over the place' for me.  Try as I might, I just cannot recommend this book.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Love this game. Challenging and oh so beautiful. The music enhances the whole game experience.  A must have on quiet evenings at home.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|THERE REALLY IS NO STORY BEING TOLD.  NOT EVEN MOTIVATED TO READ #3 IN THE SERIES. THE FIRST ONE WAS O.K. AND ENDING MADE WE WANT TO READ THE 2ND BOOK BUT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoyed this book immensely.  The fact that much of it took place in Virginia helped me to connect, as Virginia is my home state.  Dr. Alexander does well to give precise, descriptive word pictures to his journey, as well as medical science evidence to his condition.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This is laggy on my kindle, love this game but it lags so much that I won't play it as much as I want to.

B005NNUKF4|4.0|I love Pink Floyd and this albumn is quite good with many of their songs I particularly like.  However, some of the cuts seemed to end prematurely which diminidhed the listening experience.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I just wish I could use it as a screen save when I am not using my kindle, it would be great to open and see the time.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it ...it was a different take on a typical teen love story..to find such a love as true as that of hazel and Gus would be...extraordinary
B00BQBNK04|2.0|While the soundtrack does include some songs that are not on the highlights. It does not have the entire song. Who ever edited this did a terrible job. There are parts where one song ends on another track. not worth it if you got the highlights just get the songs you are missing.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best Bond movie yet until they blew up the DB5, sacrilage.  Still like Roger Moore's Bond for sheer charm and witt.
B007F7QG0Y|5.0|Since I am not a fan of Keith Richards' notorious drug and alcohol abuse I had no plan to read this book, and when it was suggested to me by a friend I refused to consider it.  After hearing good reviews of the book, and high praise from my reading  friend (who is also a blues guitarist), I decided to give it a shot.<br />I was in for a very pleasant surprise.  Mr. Richards has written a very detailed and well constructed biography that begins with his early youth and ends in about 2009.  In that time period he gives a candid account of how he developed his bad boy persona (multiple beatings at school, bullying from peers, poverty, drugs and alcohol), the early years of his own musical education and experimentation, the first meetings and jams with Mick Jagger, and then the development and growth of the current line up known as the \\"Rolling Stones\\".  Interspersed with his first person account are many excerpts from other friends and musicians with whom he shared experiences over 60+ years.  There are photographs, from a school boy portrait of an unhappy looking Richards of about 10 years old, to a very early black and white of the Rolling Stones wearing silly, matching, early 60's costumes (their manager at the time was trying to fit them into the Beatles mold), to concert photos, intimate family pictures, and finally the haggard appearing Richards that we are familiar with today.  I came to the conclusion that I had greatly underestimated this man, his contributions to the music world, and his defining role in making the Rolling Stones the great band that they are.  My least favorite aspects of the book is his obvious sexism and disdain for women, and the recounting of his serious on-going alcohol abuse (which he does NOT acknowledge as a problem). To his credit, Richards does repeatedly warn the reader of the dangers of using Heroin.  But the detailed musical history of his musical influences, his own work and collaborations and that of other bands and musicians of the time are well worth the read and very informative.  I also enjoyed his obvious wit and entertaining writing style.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves music.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great no glare on screen and it bookmarks my spot even if I don't do it myself. Amazon app store kindle app. This is my frist reveiw
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is Great to play...Love the scenery.  Fun for kids and adults.  I would recommend to anyone who likes driving games.
0385349947|5.0|Glad to see that someone with the kind of success and personal platform has stepped up and asked women to take responsibility for their own success and ambition, instead of whining about gender biases. Too many women drop out of the workforce just when - in middle age - their resumes develop enough substance to do more. Then, they go off and raise children for a couple of decades, and in their fifties, end up having massive identity crisis.<br /><br />What's the point of this sacrifice of identity? What's the point of this sacrifice of talent and potential?<br /><br />These are important questions that need to be asked. Glad Sheryl has revived the feminist movement, and in a way that doesn't feel masculine.<br /><br />Feminism of our generation needs to be a feminine feminism.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I ordered this because my daughter bought one just like this in Florida and she paid more for the same thing.  I really liked the fact that this one is waterproof.  I plan to use this one for a long time.
0061122416|5.0|I had to buy this book for my college English class, but it is not one of those dreadful books to read. It has a great story to it where you can compare Santiago's experiences with your own today. I really enjoy reading this book and I would suggest anyone of any age to read it.
B006RJTEIC|2.0|I wouldnt watch this movie again; it was just told old. maybe if you like movies from the 70's you might like it.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|I love this movie...had a break in and they stole a lot of my DVD's so had to replace it
1455502758|5.0|Just a great way to wrap up the ending of such a great man.  This book is easy to read and leads you to the end of Hitchens' life.  Hard to read, but a great way to say good-bye to one of our times best essayists and contrarians.  Cheers.
1616550414|4.0|The book is huge. Awesome art work, the little snippet of trivia on each page is a nice touch. A little disappointed that the other Zelda game didn't get as much attention as skyward sword. A definite buy for and fan.
B008JFUNQO|5.0|I was more interested in seeing Olympus Has Fallen but opted to stick with my mom and my niece. Having only seen one preview I wasn't sure what to expect. That being said I was very impressed with the movie. My niece is six and she loved it as did my mom and I. I laughed a lot especially at the baby. The animation is beautiful definitely the best I've ever seen. All in all The Croods is a great movie and I'm definitely getting it on Blu Ray when it comes out.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|I love this movie...had a break in and they stole a lot of my DVD's so had to replace it
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazing movie!! MUST see  with family kids 11 and up  !!! That kid , Suraj  Sharma is amazing as a first timer  . We watched two times...special effects are very excellent. Overall we all love this movie. I really want to give 5 stars.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Since I had heard both negative and positive reviews before watching, I went into this with no expectations of it adhering closely to the book, nor did I have any intentions of comparing the Hobbit to the LOTR trilogy. That being said, all throughout, there seemed to be a needless theme of Peter Jackson making those comparisons for us - The Hobbit is meant to be a more lighthearted tale, but time and again extra scenes were included that made the attempt to resemble LOTR both visually and with the theme of darkness and oppression. Even that I would have forgiven had the pacing not been so torturous. From the first fifteen minutes onward, even during those few instances when this movie remained true to the spirit of the book, scenes were constructed in such a way as to fatally cripple the pace - in other words, due to poor directing, lively scenes were made to drag. This pacing problem continued throughout, moving from congealed treacle slow to so rapid they literally spend nearly two consecutive hours of the movie being chased, mostly by Orcs.<br /><br />The actual length was three hours fifty minutes. I ended up watching this in three increments, because it was impossible to sit through a movie that was mired in a sea of CGI, and where even many of the action sequences were dull due to the inclusion of too many of such. I honestly think a spectacular movie could have been made if many of the scenes therein were simply abridged. About an hour into the movie was approximately 1/3 into the book, and while I am not making comparisons, per se, it does go to show just how much extraneous material was thrown in.<br /><br />There was entirely too much effort poured into the CGI - to be honest, I am not a fan of computer imagery unless it serves to enhance the storyline instead of being used to carry it entirely. It was all too obvious that the energy was focused on creating dazzling visuals in lieu of focusing on character depth - except, perhaps, for Thorin - and dialogue that served to move things forward. While much was going on, little was actually happening, if that makes sense. Had I not read the book, if someone were to ask me what the first movie was about, my answer would be hazy. We learn tidbits about Thorin, Gandalf and Bilbo, yet all the other dwarves merely serve as extras and even then, the development of the former three left much to be desired.<br /><br />Overall, I could not say this was an enjoyable movie. It did have it's good moments. Some excellent ones, even. But for a movie of this length, those were just too sparse. Nor was Martin Freeman's portrayal enough to salvage this train wreck of pacing and tedious overuse of special effects. My main gripe is not even that The Hobbit quite often bore little resemblance to Toliken's work, but that this movie reeked of pure Hollywood. A dumbed down action extravaganza with a ton of style and absolutely no substance. As a fan of BBC's 'Sherlock', I was excited about Cumberbatch's voicing of Smaug, though I am not certain if I have enough of a masochistic streak to sit through a second or third installment of this boring, puerile nonsense.that served to move things forward.

B00280LYIC|5.0|EVERYONE must come to read this book. This book gave me feelings I cannot describe. If you like Greek mythology or The GOD of WAR series... READ THIS BOOK!
B001QB9H10|5.0|I love this movie...had a break in and they stole a lot of my DVD's so had to replace it
0525953590|5.0|Carroll provides a visual and stimulating dialog on not just the history behind the search for the Higgs Boson, but the future it can lead to. Very enjoyable read for anyone from any background.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great graphics, fun game, I can't stop playing it. I supposedly downloaded a wallpaper for it but who knows where it went - it never showed up in the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game. I have a lot of fun playing it and my family love s the game their self.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I love this movie...had a break in and they stole a lot of my DVD's so had to replace it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. lots to do if you're bored. I personally enjoy it for winding down at the end of the day before bed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only difference between this book and pornographic material is that it takes longer than 7 minutes between each sexual encounter! The writing is juvenile. It's enough to hear about sexual deviancy, but to call it &#34;literature&#34; because it's popular means the joke's on us. Get yourself a similar type of book for less at your local adult bookstore.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|As a Matlab user, the similar name of the calculator software provider was a bit confusing. Otherwise, this calculator uses in graphing applications, higher mathematics, and engineering was superior.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Love this music. makes me move....but each song is distorted at the end.<br />Couldn't find any way to let Amazon know this before but now....<br />his may not be what they meant by a &#34;review&#34;.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This was a quick read but really not indicative of the expat experience from what I understand. It was just okay.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have watched Les Mis on public tv for 20 years and finally it all makes sense. I saw in in a movie theater and had to have it for my DVD collection. I loved the songs as a musical and didn't know how it would translate to a movie. I was stunned and impressed with the performances of Jackman and Hathaway. Ann's rendition of I Had a Dream will make you cry. If you like movies that grab you buy this DVD.
0756655730|5.0|It is a great graphical encyclopedia of the history of life. Beautiful pictures and detailed context make it a book to be used as an encyclopedia and also every day reading.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|Singing wise I still prefer the 10th anniversery edition but for translating a musical to a movie I thought they did a great job!
B00571F26Y|5.0|As a nutritionist and weight loss coach along with just wanting to lead a better, healthier and longer life...I would recommend that EVERYONE read this book!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This novel is full of conjurers and magic. Great fun. Page turner. Would make a great movie. I did feel the ending was a little weak.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I wish they would make another dictionary with even more words and pages I love this book to death I love it so much I want to tell all my friends everything about it but it's to much that's all I catch say bye bye
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Just OK for Bond movie.  Sorry to see &#34;M&#34; fading from the picture.  How long will it be before the next character gets the 007 job?
B00BHMEALA|4.0|I watched this the other night and it kept my attention. I had not read the reviews but rather bought it as it made the awards. Never knowing what the movie was really abought. Surprised me very much and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great acting and directing by Ben!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I love the fact that we get to hear a perspective of the arial battle during WWII from the German side and also just a great story.
B003CTFEAC|5.0|As with all Schleich figures, expect the highest quality soft vinyl-like plastic and beautiful hand paintin.  This unicorn has a lovely flower and vine motif on the haunches and soft sparkly details in the main and tail.  It is quite lovely and one of my daughter's favorites from this series (Bayala).<br /><br />Really a beautiful display or play figure horse.  Note that this is a foal - baby horse.  So he's smaller than the other unicorns in the series.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|as a youth leader.  a outdoorsman.  and a disabled  retiree!  I find this app useful in those cases where you can't  have every thing with you.  DON'T  WAIT TILL YOU REALLY NEED IT.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very enjoyable retro shooter. Graphics are classic yet modern in a way. Lots of fun, and as a FAOTD it was a steal.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|A continuation of a great series with more characters and storylines. Can't wait for the 3rd season to come along.
B0031FNYGS|5.0|The Schleich fantasy series of animals typically have special details.  For this Schleich Pegasus (the mother of a family that includes a foal and rearing father), she has gold hand painted details throughout.  There is a gold sun on her back and also on her neck.  Glittery gold and silver details are tastefully placed in her mane, hocks, tail, and wings.<br /><br />The one I received was pure white - did not have the green and blues.  So there may be a newer version than pictured (I like the one I received better).
B002UQIH20|5.0|Not exactly your typical beck record, but that doesn't really matter.  this record is a thing of beauty.  I need to add this sentence to make the minimum review length.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I will rate this book. 5 out of 5 because I love dairy of a wimpy kid  and I love funny book
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I fell in love with this show from the first episode of season one, and I've been watching it all the way through. Worth every penny.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|As with all Schleich figures, expect the highest quality soft vinyl-like plastic and beautiful hand paintin. This unicorn has a lovely flower and vine motif on the haunches and soft sparkly details in the main and tail. It is quite lovely and one of my daughter's favorites from this series (Bayala).<br /><br />Really a beautiful display or play figure horse.  Note that there is a family you can buy - a rearing father and foal in addition to this mother unicorn.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Absolutely beautiful historical novel of survival and destruction of the human spirit.  Very interesting in lieu of the current events.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|This is a great book, love it. But the second book won't be available til nov 2013. And the third?? For this reason I won't read the series out of principle. it's inexcusable to release a series at this rate.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is one of the easiest ways of eating I have found, two days of hungar is sure better then a whole week of some diet that always leaves you hungry, I have been on this for 3 wks and have lost 14 lbs
B000QELMF2|4.0|Eyela fits in perfectly with the Bayala series of schleich fantasy figures. She is well painted, high quality, vinyl-like plastic. She was purchased to use with the Summergreen Elf House and goes perfectly there. My 9 year old loves her.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As a medical professional, I liked the scholarly approach to Near Death Experiences, but was disappointed not to hear about  the God of the Bible in this author's account. The god he mentions is a Near Eastern style one he calls Om, which is not a new concept. Otherwise, fairly well constructed treatise of the way the NDE changed his life.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is really fun to play but it seems like you have to spend real money to advance.<br /><br />But overall the graphics are decent and its a great time killer.
B007XNAOPI|3.0|Love this album, but do not believe the Amazon listing describing it as &#34;vinyl LP edition in hardbound book packaging&#34;.  It's just a simple double LP.  The colored vinyl and 180g editions were very limited.  The only reason I didn't give it one star for being totally misleading is that it's truly a great album, and at the end of they day, you can't go wrong regardless of the format.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I did enjoy the book.  I found it hard to put down.  However, I found it slightly predictable.  Some good twists that leave you satisfied.  But overall, wasn't everything that I had hoped.  (Keep in mind, I did know that going in after reading some of the other reviews, but I hoped still.)
B0030SZ2D4|1.0|The most corny low budget pathetic action film I have ever seen in a long time. Chronicles of Riddick was a decent solid movie this was atrocious.
0446547573|4.0|When I read I have to be interested from page one and this book did it.  Wasn't sure what to pick for easy reading and my daughter said all her friends were reading this.  First time with Nicholas Sparks and would by another.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Worth owing and watching many times over. This is an inspirational movie with such a great message and i always learn something new each time.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|I just wired an entire 5.1 speaker system for my son.  I'm using CLR cable which is very thick so on each plug, I had to trim off a few strands to get the banana plug to screw closed.<br /><br />For those of you who have never used banana plugs, they're a way of wiring your speakers to your amplifier by installing plugs at eac end of the wires.  To install a plug, you strip off the coating on the end of the wire.  The stripped wire is inserted into the disassembled banana plug and you bend it back to hold it in place.  Reassemble the plug and give the wire a good tug to make sure it's secure.<br /><br />All of this assumes that your amplifier and speaker are banana plug compatible.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reminiscent of recent case in California, so kept reader engaged. Although predictable, it was still engaging and worth the effort.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|the movie is a must see...great for the whole family to see...my daughter loves this movie and the movie is safe for her ears.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|These seasons are very addicting. I watched all three seasons in one week. Once you start watchimg, you cant stop!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Awfully funny.  Dumb concept but they made it work.  I'd recommend it for a night you are open to being entertained.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love the series.  It brings back memories of stories my grandmother used to tell about her days when she was very young. She was a 17 year old school teacher in a very small village and always remained very &#34;proper&#34; throughout her life.  Lark Rise to Candleford gives me a real insight as to what life was really like back then.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|What a woeful effort.<br />When I heard Where Are We Now I thought Bowie was back on track and we were in for something like the brilliant Hunky Dory.<br />What we get is hammered, loudness (again) which Bowie must think makes him relevent and \\"modern\\". So sad.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love the easy to see designs and pleasant appearance.  Great for adults and  kids alike.  Great value.  Definitely worth the purchase.  We'll be using this one frequently.
1449410243|5.0|My wife and I sat there reading this in front of our cat laughing and pointing at our cat.  I think she knows that we are on to her now.
B007SGM084|5.0|E L James has exuberantly out did herself with these books. I'm in love with the characters. I'm only on the second book but ooh... I'm loving it. I'm very happy :)!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Nothing tops the original but this one sure comes close! If you like your action non-stop, this movie is for you!!!  And if you want more movie reviews,  &#34;I&#34;ll be back&#34;  don &#34;the movie man&#34;
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Love this app. Fun to play piano, but can be a little difficult to do on the Kindle Fire because of how far apart the keys are spread. Would like it even better if there were more songs to choose from!
B00BG08FKK|4.0|If you, like me, bought the Hightlights album and found it lacking and disappointing, then this should make up for that. This is the version that should have been released at first, with many of the songs that make Les Miserables such a powerful production. This version has reprises, additional songs, and a few more moments of fighting. It's wonderful...except, it's STILL not complete. Poor Eponine. Several of her songs are missing. Yes, we finally get \\"Little Fall of Rain,\\" which is wonderful, but not included are some of the smaller character moments. Oh well, maybe one day we will get the Deluxe Deluxe Edition, which will fill in the blanks.<br />Still, this is much improved over the last release and for that, I highly recommend getting this release.
0385537816|5.0|When i first heard about the \\"fifty shades of grey\\" books, I really was not interested in reading another book about sex. But as I was forced to \\"start\\" reading it.....I FELL TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THE CHARACTERS OF ANASTASIA & CHRISTIAN.I MEAN THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER IS TOTALLY INTENSE. YES MAYBE A LITTLE OVERBEARING ON CHRISTIAN'S PART, BUT HE LOVES HER SO MUCH. AND HER LOVE FOR HIM IS EQUALLY AS \\"EXASPERATING\\"... BUT IN THE END IT ALL WORKED OUT. THE REVELATIONS ANA HAS IN THE FIRST BOOK....AMAZING. THE TWISTS & TURNS IS FIFTY SHADES DARKER..AWESOME. AND THE FINALE IN FIFTY SHADES FREED....BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVE THE WAY THIS BOOK STARTED & ENDED. I WISH I COULD FIND A LOVE LIKE THAT. THANK YOU E L JAMES!!!!
B0037NVM1I|4.0|Fast paced and thoroughly entertaining movie.  Only gets 4 stars because nothing can top  the original Terminator.  Arnold said he would be back, and he is .  (returning to Hollywood!)
B007MU85D0|5.0|I love this album. The songs are all upbeat and quirky. Very different and unique sound from anyone else. Definitely recommend this one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is funny, last night I, my wife, and my daughter were playing the gave on three different devices at the same time!!!
B008ODZNLG|4.0|The movie is a must see for anyone with a love of sushi. The man and family described here are considered among the best of the best - and in Japan no less. I had to stop about half way through because I was so ravenously hungry. After satisfying my pressing need to eat I was able to resume the film. The film explores a great deal of the family life and society that helped shape his exacting and demanding career. The photography is intimate and beautiful (hence my pangs of hunger). The film seems a bit too long but perhaps that reflects my failure to completely absorb the &#34;zen spirit&#34; of the project. I would however highly recommend watching it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|a fitting ending to a great series.  enjoyed immensely. recommend to young and old!!  you are never too old to be a kid!
6300248550|3.0|Powerful, moving performances by all here but Dalton towers over his lead actress to the point where you wonder- is she 4 feet tall or is he 7 feet tall?  Strange casting with these two I thought as the lead actress sometimes looks like a small child next to Timothy Dalton.  The best part is the last thirty minutes!  All the mean, cruelty displayed for 2 hours finally melts away and the viewer can enjoy some fruits of the spirit between these two characters.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|It is clear that everyone wants to give their \\"review\\", fact is this cd is really great. Yes there are some sounds that bring back the 80'S when music was fun, real and artist used \\"their\\" voice showing the talent they were Blessed with. Now simply go to the MP3 version listen yourself, I own the cd and it is uplifting makes you want to dance alone or with that special someone....it's a nice pick me up. Funny if something is really bad and I mean bad I too, would say don't buy this item but not tearing it up as if I could do any better myself. What is true is, what my eyes and ears see and hear may be way different from others however this sound is great and a nice change. I would say that is why they did it. No one had an issue with Move like Jagger but because this has the sounds of the 80's when music was real they \\"attemp\\" to tear it down. Open your hears to \\"all\\" sounds, listne to Europe artist and artist from all around the world. Then maybe those who were so \\"strong\\" in their put down would really no the sound of music. Thank You for reading, Blessings..
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I am a little late in starting to watch The Good Wife. I have heard how good it is, and I have not been disappointed! It has humor, competition, drama, and mystery. There are aspects of each character that are both endearing and unlikeable. Therefore, the audience can relate more easily to the characters, creating a deeper connection to the show in general.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I thought it was a little too technical in some areas, but the author was describing his experience from<br />his viewpoint and medical experience.  I hope to read another out-of-body experience in the near future.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Good for all ages. We all liked it from 2 years old to my 90 year old grandma. Funny and good meaning.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love  being able to have the Bible on my Kindle Fire.  I love that you can have it read to you as well.  The only thing which is minor is the voice of the person who reads it seems a little over the top but that is not a big deal.  It's nice to have the option to read it yourself or have it read to you.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|My son likes this games but it's a little hard once you get towards the end.  Like the sensor doesn't pick up the switches when pushed.  If not for loving trains this game would not be one to purchase.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Keeps you engaged. Great for anyone experiencing a loss or illness. It resonated with me and know it will touch your soul.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Although this novel was excellent, I would definitely recommend seeing the film.  The film ties all of the main events together in a better manner and explores the characters better.  The book is a quick read that leaves you needing more.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Wife wanted to watch it so we did, much better than i expected. A lot of references to older movies, games and jokes that made it so much funnier for me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's really awesome it does have adds but once you start playing the adds just go away it's really fun I love it it's good
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Love the movie. The value of pre ordering it online was definitely worth it. Way cheaper than picking up from a local movie retailer.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's even better than Temple Run 2.  I'm looking forward to the new land to be added.  The graphics come straight from the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best mobile game for phones and kindle s ,it is AWESOME ,cool,crazy and lots of FUN
0307592731|2.0|The author of this book is so self absorbed it was very irritating.  I expected to hear more about her adventure and less about her ridiculous self absorbtion....I enjoyed very little about this book and would not have read it if it weren't my book clubs selection of the month.<br />I don't recomment this book.<br />lucia M.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out pretty easy but works up to ones that make you think!  We have a good time playing this game. Try it out!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I wish EA would make a simcity app. This satisfies my craving. Just started but hooked. Played their other app and already beat all the levels so this one should entertain me longer.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I never know what is going to happen and anything can! Great show and love to see my fairytale friends come to life.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is awesome. I really LOVE to play it. If I was to pick my top ten it would be in my top five favorite games.
0307346617|3.0|Very interesting book at first but then really drags on and becomes mundane.  I actually am looking forward to the movie adaptation as the previews look quite entertaining.  The book lacks a main character or any character for that matter to lead the story.  The book often becomes difficult to read as it's one story after another of the same type of content.
B00APJLX8E|1.0|I love Adam Sandler and grew up on his movies.  I love his humor, but this movie was terrible.  It barely kept my attention and my kids didn't really like it either.  Too bad.  I was thinking I'd like it, but it was awful.  :/
B003UNK27U|5.0|really great book, so pleased I got it, very helpful and informative. I have only been following these principles properly for a couple of months and already can see great benefits
0399229191|5.0|Given as a Christmas present to my twin grandsons. Have had the story read to them over and over.  Love the durability of the board book.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a pretty good musical comedy . It's even better the second and third time when you can sing along.
B00338QENI|4.0|This thoroughly researched and documented book, about the life the Lacks family and what happened (and is still happening) to the cancerous tissue taken from one Henrietta Lacks 50 years ago, is eye-opening. It reads easily, not like a textbook; although the writer specializes in scientific articles. I found this book to be fascinating.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Well, if you're a KISS fan you better have thick skin cause Peter's version will upset some fans! I actually liked it and at the same time was alittle disapointed. I felt like I peeked behind the wizard's curtain and instead of heros I saw people. And not always nice ones either!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have fallen in love with all the characters in this book, whether its because I truly love them or just love to hate them! I can't wait for the next book to see where the story continues!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|At first I was skeptical that maybe it was a bootleg copy.  But they were the actual dvd's got them in less time then the time promised and they were all in great condition.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was a good story. I just thought at times the narrator was a bit mentally challenged. The story was interesting. I finished it in 2 days. I just thought it took too long to reveal what happened to him but I understand it needed to happen when the character was going through his whole breakdown/remembering what happened. It was good.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I thought the movie was good. But, after reading the book.....well it's alot better! Loved the fact we got to learn more of the main person in the story!
B004RE29PO|5.0|So is this copy of it! It must have been made after the release of \\"Prometheus\\" because the title menu interface reflects a lot of the \\"Waylon Corporation\\" stuff from the movie. Really awesome and gives a more modern approach to the 25 year old movie. The features are great, allowing the commentary to be toggled on and off during certain parts of the movie. Would recommend to anyone wanting a copy of the movie.
0307949486|5.0|This is not a particularly ground-breaking book in most ways, but it held my attention strongly. The characterization was fairly good in general, I thought. The plot was nicely elaborate, and while there was a hint of a deus-ex-machina at one point, it was played down and the described events were reasonably plausible, if not the way to bet.<br /><br />Our Hero does some fairly stupid things... but people do. He is also rather caqtnip for the ladies, but i do not find that nearly as annoying here as i do in, say Peter King's \\"Gourmet Detective\\" series, where the guy is a sexist, lecherous ass; here, I can see his attraction. He really does respect women, not leer at them reflexively.<br /><br />The real break-through part, though, is the Lisbeth character.  I have never encountered anyone much like her in fiction. She's likely somewhat autistic, and also brilliant (with things, not people) and very, very practical. I'll be reading the other books to find out more about her.<br /><br />I'd read a lot about the violence, and I think the fuss is exaggerated. I've read a lot more violent thrillers, and that's generally not even my taste! Lisbeth's strength is that she does not think of herself as a \\"victim\\"... but that's mostly due to her unique psychology, and her pragmatic turn of mind. Note that if one is not brilliant in many ways, one would be best-served to ask for help from carefully-chosen society rather than go it alone.<br /><br />Well worth reading, especially for Lisbeth.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The characters come off as whiny and immature. I had a hard time paying attention because there wasn't anything about the movie that captivated my interest. I would not watch it again and definitely wouldn't recommend it to others.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|this product is awesome, so real. would be better with comes with kamehameha power together. but i like it. Now i need Vegetta and goku SS3
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|How can you not love this series?  Great characters, stories and dialogue, not to mention a dynamite cast. What more do you need?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent read! Hard to put it down. Finished in three days. Nice conclusion to the series. Grabbed me after the first page.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Keep up with what's going on in your friends and families lives without intruding on their busy timetable. It is kind of like day time soaps. Tune in when you have time and catch up on what's happening.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app totally suggest it if you are a gamer or a minecraft fan.<br />Even though the computer and xbox versions are better this is still a great app.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is a pleasure to zone out in the world of cute dragon babies and design your own world. With the game being free it is hard to argue with the price.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I really like this CD and I do NOT wish to say  anything negative about him but on the songs he wrote they  sort of sound alike, but<br />&#34;The Moon's  a Harsh Mistress&#34; is worth the price of the CD my itself  The man can do no wrong but I wish he would redo some of the older love songs because I heard him say he likes sad songs and so do I.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|i love this game is it off the change i wish all the bubble games were like this awesome game
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|was a surprisingly good read.  Very relaxing and the characters surprised me.  I would recommend for an enjoyable read. kj
B00127RAJY|5.0|I highly recommend this for any mom who cannot make it to the gym. In fact if I had the option of the gym and this... I would choose this. I just had my second baby and never got back in shape after the first. It is hard making to the gym long enough to get a good work out in when you are a mom. I heard all the rave about the 30 day shred through instagram and decided what the heck, why not? I am soo impressed. I have knee injuries and this work out kicks my butt (in a good way) without KILLING my knees. Yet i have seen amazing results. I am so happy with this product. After about two weeks of this and already seeing results I had to order her butt and thighs dvd. Jillian delivers amazing results. I feel so great! LOVE LVOE LOVE IT! After 2 weeks I am already back to my pre-pregnancy weight and I am keeping on it. Not to mention I am breastfeeding and cannot &#34;food&#34; diet. I obviously don't binge eat but eat normal and healthy.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This movie is one of those movies that you watch and say wow I just watched that movie now I can do something else
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds is the best show to watch. I especially like the actors. They bring the toughness in the agent characters in each season. I don't mind Jeanne Tripplhorn. As long as they keep the other acters.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I love it  its eye and mind game kept you on your game.I would like to see more games like this
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I dont like it because you have to buy the bingo cards it is not free why is that can someone explain
B0055PMURG|4.0|This movie is one of those movies that you watch and say wow I just watched that movie now I can do something else
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another fantastic book. Once you start you can't put it down. I hope there are really detectives like Harry. His dedication is amazing.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Gerald Butler rocks in this one!  He kicks butt at least until he dies!  Nice spin of a true historic event.  There have been more than a few movies about this battle, but this one is the best of all.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie but found it very engaging. It was a good way to spend a rainy afternoon.
B000ID37KO|4.0|This movie is one of those movies that you watch and say wow I just watched that movie now I can do something else
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is the best reader for me. I've downloaded several books, magazines, etc for my bible studies. I'm able to make all kinds of notes, highlight, underline, etc for my personal use.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I never see the movie first cause I prefer reading true emotion. Having said that, I feel Mr. Sparks was thinking about the movie more the the book due to lack of details. Still a very enjoyable read but not his best.
B008645YEE|5.0|I swear I could not even think of a title for this review, so I just titled it for how it makes me feel. This review is mainly about the last movie, but is about all the masterpieces. Somewhere in between tdk and tdkr, I happen to stumble apon the soundtrack for tdk, and was astounded. I thought it was the greatest thing I had EVER heard. So went and also got the bb soundtrack and was a slave to both. Now I'm waiting for the new movie and soundtrack to be released. The soundtrack is released week before the movie. I absolutly fall in love with it. I love the way he has a mix of the old stuff in there, and this is NOT because he got lazy and wanted to just rehash old music. This is an expansion on the other stuff because all of it is interelated. Hans will take one sound from a tdk track and make a whole song from it. Love it. So epic and dynamic it is like they were TRYING to do with the movie. But that's a whole nother review. I think the soundtrack completly overshadows the movie, and brings us in deeper to Nolans Batman. At the same time its very real and resonates with the hero inside all of us. I freakin love it. I never get tired of hearing it. I feel sorry for people who can't have the patience and quiet themselves long enough to listen and<br />understand this beautiful arrangement of<br />melodies. It will awaken something in every one<br /> who opens their mind. Even though the movie was a dissapointment for me on some levels, this soundtrack saves it. I swear y'all, it made me want to be Batman.

B008K6HN8I|4.0|I'm glad I got this for my Kindle Fire. I can see all my files in one place and see what I want and don't want.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this show but it is starting to loose me.  Ever since they killed of Shane and Lori, it isn't the same.  I feel like they all need to move locations again.  The prison and governor's town is getting boring.  The acting is great which keeps me watching and I am a die hard fan so I am going to watch it either way but it just isn't as good as the first two season.  It is starting to feel like the comic book it was fashioned after instead of drama.
B000HSKUBE|2.0|This English version is much the same storyline as the new Netflicks version. The Netflicks version has better, more current writing. Also the English political dialog does not transport well across the pond.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie is one of those movies that you watch and say wow I just watched that movie now I can do something else
B005FISC52|5.0|Love this series and although i haven't had time to read this i am sure it will be great missed the last show so had to buy the season
B002A9VJ40|5.0|this is a bruckheimer film so it is by far one of the greatest flicks in the history of film!!

B008XG1X18|5.0|enjoy pinning and making folders of things of interest and like being able to share with my friends and familyl.
B005H9B44A|5.0|thor was one of my faves growing up. he's by far one of the most powerful beings in the marvel universe. this movie rally did him justice.
B0093LFGMO|4.0|Finally he's back to the music I fell in love with. The past few CD's I wasn't too keen on. However, this one made up for those. The songs are a lot of fun and enjoyable. I can listen to this many times without getting tired of it. I would have rated this 5 of 5 but the reason why is because of the bad language in some of the songs. I felt it ruined those song. I just never understood why one has to use the &#34;F&#34; word in a song or any other cuss word for that matter. I can't listen to those songs so I just skip them. That's the world nowadays I guess. Other than that, great CD.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|It was a fast paced novel. A few gruesome images, but necessary to develope the characters. One of his better novels in the series so far.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy playing while waiting and even my grandchilden can play - would recommend for all ages. Its on my iphone and works great
0307463745|4.0|Good book with good tips. However, the end will sneak up on you faster then a creepy guy on a girl at the bar.
B003B02PEU|5.0|What a wonderful picture of small town America! Great character development, funny, scary, poignant and very hard to put down. Touching - I'm sorry it's over.
B004YXE438|4.0|I downloaded this app on my new Kindle Fire HD and found it to be both fun and absorbing. I like the different levels of complexity.
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|This dvd is a well put together  for ages 5 and up.My grandson who is 5 years old enjoys watching it as he loves Dinosaurs. I would recommend this for kids of all ages
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Though the game appears to be quite simple, there are several times I had to pause<br />to think about correct paths.  It can be quite addicting and time consuming.  The game<br />was recommended by a friend who's children love to play it.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I need the pretty bow at the end of my books. That's just me.....while I loved the read, I was left wanting...that is something I hate when I love a series and I love the characters....if an author needs to end a book with vague details, there needs to be another.....remember, this is my opinion.....I need the happily ever after....I'm not saying this didn't have that....I'm just saying I needed more. Actually, I needed a lot more dang it!!
B00BI5IXL4|1.0|Like an idiot, I saw the high ratings and ASSUMED it was another retelling of one my favorite stories ever.  I can't stand musicals and this was barely watchable for me.  So if you like musicals, it probably is ok, otherwise be aware that this is a MUSICAL.  Nothing but singing from opening to closing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was an excellent read.  I couldn't put it down.  It was a very creative and emotional story that<br />reveals how too much power can be corrupting.  It also attests to the strength of the human spirit.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Was apprehensive at first, figured it'd be just another BBC pbs type show but it's really well done.  Characters are great and have a lot of depth as well as the actors are a really engaging.<br /><br />Highly recommend it to anyone.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|I really enjoy a good lawyer flick and this one is no exception. There are so many twists and turns to keep you moving in your seat..
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I really liked remembering the story and playing through the levels. A fun game though it would have been better if I could have gotten some information on how to succeed getting past blocks.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|Normally I shy away from getting a CD and instead just upoad a song or two. A friend suggested getting the CD due to a lot of good songs. This was the case, I enjoyed almost all the songs on this CD. Kept me company while on a road trip.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I worked at Microsoft in the 80's. I prefer to avoid their products and Google is to big for their britches. I use products that work well and support under dogs.
B00BF11STU|4.0|a bit long but engaging<br /> some real good acting by the woman in the main role. I would recommended to see
B00AHHODH2|5.0|I enjoyed this book from the beginning, but once I was about half-way through, I couldn't click my Kindle fast enough. I was hooked! The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club is a complex satire that intermingles mystery, drama and dark humor into a multiple plot thriller that kept me riveted until the end. Perhaps I enjoyed it even more because I am from the south and have been to Savannah, GA where the story takes place many times. Mr. Whitehead's description of the old historic district in Savannah was spot-on and as the town's wealthy cling to the illusion of southern gentility, it becomes the perfect setting for his tale of how secrets can entangle people's lives like the Spanish moss hanging in chain-like fashion from the old oak trees.<br /><br />This story doesn't stay in Savannah, but whether Mr. Whitehead is taking us to Argentina or Paris, the descriptions of the locations are just as lush, just as vivid, as are the characters. One of the things I thought was so extraordinary about how this author handled his unusual assortment of characters was that no matter how flawed they were, they were presented to us without judgment and with a surprising amount of humanity. Considering how disingenuous everyone is, this was quite a feat! There were several revelations about who these characters really were, underneath their carefully crafted lies, that were stunning and revealed by the author with razor-sharp timing.<br /><br />I won't tell you anything about the characters or the plot because I don't want to spoil this wonderful read for you. But, when you want to sit down, forget your problems and allow a writer to take you into another world, treat yourself to The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, an easy read, but a real page-turner!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is fun cool and its cool that you made a Rome one so it's not the original and its so cool I put my Facebook on there and I'm vs my friends
B007MB5OCE|5.0|From the beginning this book sucked me in. The author has a way of making me laugh. I just wish he had more books available in English.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This album is fantastic. The booklet inside the case is worth the price all by itself.  The new songs, some of which have singing by other artists, makes it seem as if Hendrix did not pass away by then.  This is a must have for all real Hendrix fans.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|love this game...i play it every single day and will be sad whenit is over...bring on the next game as soon as possible
B00002N9ER|4.0|Great Idea and I am glad that I found them. Good buy and good buy and good buy and good buy & good bye.
0425252868|5.0|In this day when ethics and honor are so rare, it is hopeful to read about men who had those qualities in their very cores.  I found it a &#34;can't put it down&#34; story that makes me proud to be of the generation that was children of the war.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has great graphics and the horse looks so real!  I love this game!!!!!if you have not Gotten this app yet&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;you should
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Clint Eastwood never fails to impress.  Once again, a stellar performance in a well written movie.  Though not full of action, this movie was liked by my entire family.
B003U51EE8|5.0|Can't get enough!!  I am at Season 5, episode 18.  I will be disappointed when I complete the next season.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I'll keep this review short and simple.  They never should have split this up into three movies and am glad I never paid to see it in the theater, renting was the right choice. Two is probably fine, but three is probably just dragging it out.  We'll have to see the others to know for sure.<br /><br />The story is on an epic scale with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but has a younger audience in mind.  The humor in the story is a bit &#34;tweenish&#34; but the movie has a more adult undertone and has some fairly uneventful/story-less scenes that provides little content (think about the extended versions of the originals that provided little additional content).  I almost put it on par with Star Wars Episode 1, you can't help be left a bit disappointed when comparing it to the LOTR trilogy.  The special effects in areas also do not feel up to par with the original series (but are still very good).  At almost 3 hours, it was just too long for what the story accomplished in the first part.<br /><br />It's not bad, but it's not great either, it's just, okay.
B003QTNFHW|4.0|Very good movie. Johnny always does a great job. Great effects. The queen of hearts was great as well.Not a fan of Ann Hathaway
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a nice quick read and a very well written and adorable story, but not the happiest book ever, that much you can figure out in one page. Worth a read though.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Best movie ever!<br />I love musical and this is an amazing film.<br />I really recomend it, although I don't speak english very well, with subtitles it worked perfectly
B007N6NGYG|5.0|easy to difficault play the way it should be. Fun great graphics and sound appereance<br />great for adults and kids to play
B0058W74UY|1.0|This is not a flash browser. I don't understand why silk does not have a flash player. Don't download this app.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|**Spoiler Alert**<br />I think this is probably a fairly accurate character study of an abused woman trying to move on, being guilt ridden, etc. And I liked the healing story of her moving on. But the ghost thing at the end. Could have doen without that.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The Life of Pi explores the depths of the human soul and spirit and exemplifies the metamorphisis that occurs when people of faith are pushed to their weekest points.Sound heavy right? Not completely! The film was laced with the perfect amount of whimsy and humor to make for an uplifting experience. This is the kind of movie that leaves you with many questions, in a good way.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Just like amazon online, easy as ever to use. I prefer amazon over ebay any day of the week. I'm an amazon prime member too so I LOVE it for sure!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|You can not complet the marvel series without all three of the spiderman dvd. They just get better each time.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I didn't really care for the writing style, but the plot was okay. Kind of winding and confusing, but it wraps up nicely in the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is exceptional. I find it very addictive, but a great amount of fun at the same time. I do recommend it, and believe that you will find complete satisfaction with this app as well. The animation in this app is also exceptional, and there are no places that I have found so far where the images are too terribly blurry. Trust me,you will not be disappointed with this app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love evernote, the problem is that I forget to use it :) Every I need to jot down a quick note it's my favorite tool, mostly because I like to record an audio note that I can reference later.
B00620OANU|5.0|I got a late start on the Grey's Anatomy craze and I LOVE being an Amazon Prime member because I get all of the old seasons on instant video as part of my benefits. There is nothing quite like watching Grey's without commercials!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Same Birds, Different backgrounds, new puzzles. Nothing really special but still fun to play. It's ok if you have finished the first one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Sure to play game because it's true game!!!!  Yes believe that!!! Absolutely cool<br />Applications too !!! love  this game !!!
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I love Skitch, it's fast and easy to use on any device. It would be perfect if you could determine image measurements for cropping like 640x480 etc
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I have the vhs versions of 12 Wasted Years and Maiden England been waiting for DVD versions since the format came out. There is an import version of 12WY buy the transfer is terrible and the menu and subtitles are in spanish. I can say that the concert is great, a must have. 12 WY is an interesting doc with cool footage from Maiden's club days and the first time i ever saw (and heard) \\"Women in Uniform\\" back when it came out. I really love the \\" History of...\\" packages as everything is remastered to the highest quality and the documentaries are interesting and informative, even for a Maiden freak like me who already knows most of the history. So buy, put in the dvd player, and enjoy. SO IT SHALL BE WRITTEN. SO IT SHALL BE DONE. UP THE IRONS!!!!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have already spent way too much time playing this time waster. Highly recommended game! It's a total hoot, even for us &#34;Middle Aged&#34; folks. I am still laughing about  &#34;Scuba Snack&#34;!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have a kindle fire and this game probably works the best. You need WiFi to open the game. ( a hint is to not spend your gems till a lot later in the game. )
B0060CXAHC|5.0|The movie is a classic of the original of Lilo and Stitch series that came later.  A great script and a nice variety of Elvis songs make the hold story come true...
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|scenes in battle repetitive. Special effects excelent. Of course the actors are top of the heap. Story left unfinished I guese for a sequal.
B005FUTBV4|5.0|Absolutely great movie! Not at all a typical kevin Smith Movie, but one of his best! Great story and characters!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|A good partner book with &#34;Publish on Amazon Kindle&#34;.  Just good basic stuff.  When you are given enough, what more is needed?
B008SOS63S|5.0|Love anything that Joey B. does!!! This one not quite as good as &#34;Albert Hall&#34; but still pretty darn good..has Beth Hall & Paul Rodgers
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Really good slash action with excellent graphics. I only started and I am already hooked! You need to get used to the game play since it is with your finger and not a Google or joystick. But will decimate look out for other games from them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my children enjoy it as much as me just wish I had more coins without paying but I wait for them
B004GHNIRK|5.0|it goes without saying that this is a timeless classic.... and certainly one of my favorite books ever written. I don't think I can ever get enough of this story.
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|As a new parent, this book title really caught my eye as I'm sure new parents would agree that we all want to give our kids the best opportunities right from the start.<br /><br />The research and studies made for some very interesting reading and I don't doubt the findings.  However, as an expat living in Hong Kong and seeing how kids are competitive right from pre-nursery I would have liked to see if there are correlations in behavioral patterns across other countries and cultures.<br /><br />A good read nonetheless.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|It was fun for the first few times but got old fast. I deleted it because of that, plus i was deleting all the programs i rarely used and this was one of them.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|As I was reading this text, I was reminded of a mature teen romance, but the mystery kept my adult mind reading!  There are some interesting twists!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game in between the serious business. Challenging and arcade fun. I really like the shake and the ability to buy more coins using the prizes.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|What I especially love about this app. is that I have a multitude of choices for sounds and sound combinations.  My favorite right now combines the river, night sounds and flute - all at different sound levels.  I also love that I can set a timer - so I set it for 2 hours and go to bed - it has definitely helped with the getting to sleep issues.
B008602KQI|2.0|I'm going to keep it simple. The film does not work because of the main character Katniss Everdeen, or more specificially how the producers and director chose to portray her.<br /><br />The book was from the first person perspective of Katniss, she was the narrator, the reader read what she was thinking, we got to know Katniss, we grew to like her and her hilariously cynical personality.<br /><br />Now there's a lot of things you can complain about a adaptation. Certainly some things have to be cut for time, some things to get a PG-13 and not a R rating. Those are justifiable things.<br /><br />I feel like Katniss narration is not one of those justifiable changes. This is a fundamental part of the book that should've been incorporated into the book better. Maybe a more narration from Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, it was crucial that we heard Katniss's inner voice. This is why the reader sympathized with and rooted for her in the book. In the movie she just seems like a cold, distant girl. The movie is simply the book with the soul ripped away.<br /><br />They spare no-expense when making the costumes, designing the set, casting but they leave out one of the fundamental elements of the book: Katniss' narration.<br /><br />Imagine if they made a Catcher in the Rye movie and they didn't have any narration from Holden Caulfield. You're not watching a movie with this thoughful, cynical, funny but ultimatley good hearted kid. You're just seeing this imbalanced kid, walking all around NYC, randomly chatting with nuns, hiring hookers, and dancing with middle aged ladies for no concievable reason.<br /><br />It's the same with this movie. At best you can see it as a multimedia add-on to the book. You read the book, then you watch this as an added treat. I have no idea why anyone would like this movie otherwise. By itself it's a jumbled mess with all the charm of the book missing.<br /><br />I feel it's a shame that for a lot of people who haven't read the book but watched the movie they will be completley confused as to why the book commands such a devout following.e movie they will be completley confused as to why the book commands such a devout following.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|The game itself is fine but having to buy or pay for other items needed for the games like this is just a rip off.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the film, sort of.  Radagast is Peter Jackson's Jar Jar Binks.  The facial makeup for the dwarves is over the top and distracting.  The movie feels very much like it should have been one or at most two films, NOT three.  Martin Freeman is great, as usual.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|SUPERB  Had seen the movie at the theatre and wanted a copy of my own.  I had had an interested in the movie since a friend of mine had seen the London production on stage.  This purchase will give me great pkeasure for a long time to come
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie was beautifully made. The story was great. Everyone from the older children and up really liked it. I would recommend the movie for a pleasurable, entertaining time.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Singing and dancing is great- sometimes I have to get past the political double speak- but I can' stay away from the singing voices.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|Not quite what I was expecting.  I found this movie to be a tad on the dark side per the characters protrayed and the deals made through our anemic legal system, but in the end the bad guy does get his just reward.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Saw this at the cinema and just had to hae a copy formyself.  Sometimes at the cinema one may miss a line of two, with one on hand one can thoroughly take everything in.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you for the wonderful read. I will will be another fan waiting to more great stories from Mr. Howey. I can't recommend enough the fine prose and great price. Word for word the best deal I have had since I can remember.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Wow another hit season from this group of writers and actors- the plot never gets stale. All the characters have depth. Love the mystery that still surrounds the characters after 4 seasons
0385535147|4.0|For years I've loved his books and buy them not long after they are released.  I don't think this one was one of his best but, hey, it's Grisham, and still a good read.  Buy it if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan, if not, maybe buy some of his other books.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|I personally don't think that you can ever go wrong with Eric Carlie. The games were pretty simple and it of course had the classic look to it, which i loved. I highly recommend this.
B00AEFXEZE|5.0|Expensive suits/&quot;the&quot; Gere walk/hanging upside down are worth the whole movie.  Julian - the consummate, professional escort.  What woman wouldn't want to be on his arm tho she's paying for it?  I digress - movie has the expected happy ending + he gets the girl.  Lauren Hutton is strikingly classy w/an unforeseeable reaction to Gere.  Hector, as usual, owns his role.  Julian's &quot;lone wolf&quot; attitude makes him no friends.  &quot;We&quot; would be his friend - the females in the group!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Wow what a lot of truns and twists in this plot! And Kevin Bacon has really developed his character. It's fun to watch because yo never know where the next cult member is going to come from!
B005FISBTO|5.0|My sister told me about Dexter a few years ago and since then I have purchased all six seasons.  It's a great show but not for the faint-hearted.  I loved the cliff-hanger at the end of the last episode (no spoiler here!) and can't wait for season seven.  My only concern about the show is &#34;how will the series end?&#34;  I think we Dexter-ites (Dexter-philes?) would hate to see him go to jail, or even get caught, but we know it's going to have to end, sometime, somehow.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Another great movie of Hayao Miyazaki, I watched this when I was a kid and remarkably love it even more as an adult. And I love the new dubbing, as it is much closer to lip movements and explains the plot a little better I think. And how can you go wrong with Patrick Stewart. Also, the added scenes are fantastic!
B004GXHOGK|5.0|This is adorable and has a lot of detail for such a small figurine. I have this sitting on my altar so I can channel fox energy into my life. Super cute!
B008518MOW|5.0|the movies was very entertaining,  it had some of the old part put into a new version where josh bolin played k when he was younger and how they went back in time to save life
B0053O89WY|5.0|Not surprised to see in the news that this is one of the most popular shows on TV these days.  I knew it was funny in season one and I started buying the DVDs as soon as they came out.  After I watch them I lend them to my next-door neighbor who actually is a PhD physicist and he thinks they're great!  (BTW, he isn't a geek but he is a little &#34;different&#34;; I wonder if he sees any of himself in the characters in the show?).  Buy them, and the other seasons, when the price becomes reasonable (i.e., not when they are first released).  You won't regret it.
0553328255|4.0|I love Sherlock, and was excited to get such a quantity for the price. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is that the words are so tightly printed on the page, you have to hold it very open to read it, because they printed so close to the binding. It's a great set though!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is a great product and makes a great gift for those who are fans of Doctor Who or David Tennant.
B004LWZWC4|3.0|the movie was funny ,but just not as funny as I would thought for the person that were in the movies,still it was somewhat enjoyable and had some fun part in the movie
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a movie of two people.  Two people from opposite sides of the street.<br /><br />On one side you have the rich quadriplegic Phillipe and on the other you have Driss, a street wise (and very wise) man who refuses to show pity to the man who initially employs him.<br /><br />This film is a warm and moving story based on truth.  This will easily be the best film you will see for some time.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|It's not as funny as I thought. All the good parts were shown in the previews; the rest of the movie was blah and it seemed to drag out.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book because it was so inspirational and I related to Charlie in a way I've only related to one other person before!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Another wonderful story. I absolutely love Diana Gabaldon's telling of the love shared between Jamie and Claire. This story was no exception. There were times I was so excited to know what was about to happen that I found myself skimming parts. I was so happy that Brianna and Roger were able to go back in time and meet Jamie and reunite with Claire.<br />This is a truly remarkable series. I only wish I could read faster. I am going to get started on the next one right now!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Graphics are really cool. Some levels are a little tricky. Can't wait for more levels
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Works great! Fits perfect and is very useful to use with the go pro camera. It had also the case bac covers
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game! It is worth the money!<br />Every Challenging and creative, good game<br /><br />I would give it 900000000000 Stars, but I cant
B00BHMF578|4.0|This is a very well done and captivating movie.  I remember this time in our history, but had no idea about this group of people.  Enjoyed the movie very much.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Bright lamp, with 360 degree light.  Great for when you lose electricity.  Only issue is with closing the battery compartment.  Takes some patience.
0425264386|2.0|I recently started reading jack reacher. I read killing floor, one shot and running blind and loved them. I read die trying but did not like it like the others. It started off well but the second half became very boring. Had to force myself to finish it.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Super fun game. Only app I use on my kindle<br />Only thing I don't like is how addictive it is!
0307592731|5.0|This book is great. It's about a young woman's physical and emotional journey after much turmoil in her life. I have recommended it to many friends, both young and old. Read this book! You'll be very glad you did! Book arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion. I would recommend this seller.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This is probably the best FAOTD in a while. Nice graphics, great classical music and awesome gameplay. I agree with Nashew on all accounts, and admittedly it IS a bit disappointing that there is no plane customization menu. although, I suppose the multiplayer function compensates a bit for that.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This one is about Harry Bosch's childhood and how he became who he is.  While on administrative leave he solves his mother's thirty year-old murder case and comes to a better understanding of who he is as a person.  The plot, and especially the character development, is really intriguing.  We learn a lot more about Bosch and why he is the way he is.  Like Sherlock Holmes, Bosch is not entirely likeable.  I'm not quite sure I would want him as a close friend.  Nevertheless he is someone whose principles and fundamental morality (he doesn't hesitate to skirt the rules when it serves his purposes) I admire.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a fun game! But the fact that you have to buy peanuts is not pleasing.. I give it four stars because I really enjoy it even though you have to buy peanuts.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I'm not much of a Grisham reader, but this book was highly recommended by a friend and I found it hard to set it down, once I started reading.  Great book, you'll enjoy it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Just what I need to read my Adobe documents on my Kindle Fire. No more unfortunate tappings. Will reccomend anytime.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you are a fan of their You tube videos, then you will love this album. Each song evokes a memory.. Enjoy this out loud or quietly - either way, you will enjoy it
B00ADGSIRS|3.0|Karl Bartos releases his personal musical ideas and archives in the form of \\"Off The Record\\", an album that pretty much couldn't exist without the accompanying notes that explain each track. Notice I said \\"track\\", and not \\"song.\\" Hardore fans of Bartos and Kraftwerk will love the behind-the-scenes info as he gives specific years and names. Anyone that buys the album as a series of MP3 downloads will probably be disappointed, as \\"Off The Record\\" doesn't sound like a 2013 release, but there are some good songs I'm glad saw the light of day.
