B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I heard from a friend that this movie was hilarious and decided to take a chance. My husband and I watched it together and were cracking up throughout the movie. It was really funny but definitely not for young teens. There were a lot of curse words in it, mostly the &#34;F&#34; word and also the fact that the movie is about a drug smuggling and a drug dealer. I rented it on Amazon instant video but it is a movie that I would have paid full price at the movies. It really just had us laughing the whole time. I would highly recommend seeing this movie.

0062073494|5.0|I enjoy all kind of mysteries.  Agatha Christie is one of my favorite writers of mystery and suspense.  highly recommend this to any one who likes mysteries.
B005LN5UOC|3.0|As a PS3 owner and long-time gamer I've got more than a few Bluetooth headsets that I've used with my console. I started out with using a Motorola BT headset that I primarily used with my Motorola RAZR (that's how far back I've been using my PS3... whoa!). Graduated to a dedicated Logitech Wireless Vantage headset and finally settled on a wired Turtle Beach PX-21 most recently. I've also had experience in using Jabra, Plantronics, and Sony's official PS3 BT headset.<br /><br />--------------------<br />SETUP:<br /><br />Anyone who has ever paired a BT headset knows the routine - turn on your device you wish to pair to (PS3), go to Settings &#62; Devices &#62; BT devices &#62; Scan. Then turn on the Gioteck EX03 and the device will appear as 'found' on-screen. Select the device, enter the pin: 0000 and the devices will pair. If you have any other audio input devices paired with your PS3 be sure to select the EX03 as you active input and output device. In simpler terms setup is as easy as any other BT device that I've used.<br /><br />--------------------<br />DESIGN:<br /><br />The EX03 looks like an adolescents BT headset. I don't mean that as a snipe or a bad thing, the device has a type of cool factor, though I wouldn't wear this on my ear in public. The EX03 is quite a bit larger than standard BT headsets that have tried to somewhat become as small as feasibly possible. The size can be attributed to both the ear look, the mic boom, and the actual earpiece/receiver. The design as I interpret it is more function over form.<br /><br />The design of an over the ear loop and adjustable boom in my experience make this headset a bit more comfortable than traditional BT headsets, particularly those that don't have any type of over the ear support. This is particularly important during long gaming sessions. The boom is designed to adjust though within a very small tolerance. This is still important to anyone with a smaller or larger than average head. Additionally Gioteck includes a number of in-ear pieces so there options for comfort there as well.<br /><br />Personally I found the headset to be comfortable for about an two hours before my ear really started to ache and bother me.<br /><br />--------------------<br />USE:<br /><br />In-game audio quality is a mixed bag. For certain this is a mono headset which is fine for communication with other players online, however, I found the audio quality sounded quite muffled. Especially compared to my PX-21 headset but even compared to my Plantronics BT headset that I primarily use with my smartphone.<br /><br />Friends that I played with online had no complaints about my voice, background noise, or static.<br /><br />--------------------<br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />This is a decent entry level headset. I'm hesitant to slam or praise this product as it does perform just not impressively so. If you can spare about ten more dollars I would recommend Sony's own PlayStation branded BT headset that in my opinion performs considerably better.<br /><br />Notes:<br />There seems to be some confusion over what this headset will and won't let you hear. This is a headset for in-game communication with other players when playing online with your PS3. This headset cannot play back in-game audio or sound-effects.includes a number of in-ear pieces so there options for comfort there as well.<br /><br />Personally I found the headset to be comfortable for about an two hours before my ear really started to ache and bother me.<br /><br />--------------------<br />USE:<br /><br />In-game audio quality is a mixed bag.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Great family or kid game for lego lovers.  The levels make it playable for both my sons ages 4 and 7
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|Violent?  Is there blood in this game. Can a little kid play it or is it too much for them
B004I2K4E8|5.0|It's Les Mis, what else can I say.  The anniversary presentation at the end was mesmerizing.  Often brings some moisture to my eyes.  Guess i'm a softy.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This cd is amazing.  I love every single song on this cd.  I've listened to it a thousand times already since I purchased it.  It's my new favorite holiday cd.  I recommend to everyone.. IL VOLO fans or not, you have to have to have this cd in your collection.
B00CEQ1HOQ|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Monster High series. I don't feel the love and don't think they're all appropriate for young girls. That being said, my daughter has wanted one for awhile and found this to be a good compromise doll. She's cute and doesn't scream MONSTER. Everything came nicely packaged and my daughter will be very happy on XMAS!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Cool game but I finished one of the achievements and I didn't get my reward .please fix this . Other then that cool. My account megasnazzyspice I'm 14
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great Calculator and it's free. It does come with ads but they are on a small, narrow band at the top of the screen and easy to ignore
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This is a great app for putting in your schedule. You can do more than one event in a day!
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|The genius of Fast 6 and it's predecessor, Fast 5, is that these are films that know what they are and how to deliver. In short, the plot is a testosterone drenched excuse for car chases to ensue with a rag tag group of racers who will never cease to remind you that they are 'family' and that's the most important thing. Unless you need to step up and help defeat an international terrorist.<br /><br />The film is just pure entertainment. No big stories or moral lessons at the end. But a damn fine excuse for vehicular mayhem. It doesn't need to be anything more than that, and it knows it. However, it does try a bit, and I can't fault it for wanting just a bit more.<br /><br />Fast Six is a lot of fun, if you have at all enjoyed the franchise I'm not speaking to you, if you haven't seen the previous films or are unsure, go in with the mindset that you're about to be taken on a thrill ride. Buckle up, try and have fun, and don't ask too many questions, and you're sure to have a blast.
0307476464|5.0|Great book! Not done with it yet but so far fantastic and cant wait to get more works by this author.
B00GMONG90|5.0|These guys push acapella into uncharted waters, and it sounds fantastic!  First album I've purchased in a long time.  The Daft Punk medley is my favorite.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|Update: After using this for a while, I found it did not work well with my Western Digital Passport Drive, which otherwise works on the computer. I'm not sure why it didn't work but otherwise, all my other drives work well and transfer rates are fast. I want to give kudos to Anker support who are very responsive. Also, I found that the jacks for the cables are a little tight and can be awkward to get the cable in. Overall, good for the price.<br /><br />Original: Worked for me just as advertised. I have two external drives connected to it and occasionally add a third for backups. One drive has its own power supply but the other two draw power through USB. They all copied between each other without any noticeable reduction in speed. Cord from this device is rather short, just right for a laptop I think, but I can see it being a problem from a desktop as others complained. However I think that is an appropriate design as it makes it portable and most devices of this type seem to have the same cord.

0415524415|5.0|This book seeks to challenge a traditional thesis that has not only seemed unquestionable throughout Western legal and political thought but more importantly a view that has been entrenched in society for centuries. The binary opposition of justice and injustice has almost exclusively been regarded as undoubted. The former being regarded as conceptually prior to the latter while the latter being regarded as nothing more than the negation, the absence of the former. And even though, as Heinze, suggests this view may `do the trick' in many customary context, the position that he seeks to put forward is rather groundbreaking. In denying the binary form of injustice and justice, Heinze sets out to examine the concept of injustice not as mutually exclusive to that of justice but rather as a product of conditions and mechanisms that purport to achieve justice.<br /><br />Following this aim, Heinze draws from a multitude of thinkers, from Plato and Aristotle to Locke and Rousseau; from Aquinas and Dante to Hegel and Mill, a vast philosophical tradition that has approved of and built on that binary relationship between justice and injustice. Discussion of ideas from these philosophers takes up the first part of the book, the classical understanding. Specific mention should be made to the extensive discussion on Plato and Aristotle (taking up a good part of the first part of the book) as this is rather astounding and further forms the basis upon which works of other thinkers are discussed. Nonetheless, the second part of the book is in no way less interesting as it draws from post-classical literature, predominantly from Shakespeare and Corneille, to argue against the binary model of justice and injustice.<br /><br />Even though the bibliography may seem overwhelming and despite the fact that one may regard the book as difficult to read or follow, perhaps intimidated but the extensive literature summoned, I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the study oflegal and political theory. Heinze in trying to support his unconventional view of injustice as the constant product of even the most just regimes, offers an array of arguments. Even if you are not wholly convinced by all of them, or if you find the implication that legal and political systems which we would like to conceive as purely just in fact produce injustice rather frightening, the book is certain to shake up and perhaps cast some doubt on the traditional view of injustice.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|It's like the old times when platinum was gold and tin was copper. I also like that there are unicorns and useless stuff that was in the game that is fun.
B00846REIS|5.0|this is great book couldn't put it down there was nothing that should have been changed will tell everyone I know to read this book
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! my dad recommended it and I loved it when I started. the problem is it must freeze. easy turn off or kindle. hold the power button for. 30 sec. then press it again and wait till it turns on then continue. ios people don't delete it and redownload it. all it does is make start over. but you have to to keep playing.
0375842209|5.0|Love this book.  We ordered it for my son for required reading for his War Fiction class and I ended up reading it after he was done.  It is a great book and I understand why they are making a movie out of it now.
B00BATKPBE|2.0|As I’ve written in other reviews, a good autobiography should do two things:  One, tell the reader something or she doesn't already know and two tell that something in an interesting manner.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is best known as the author of best-selling book “The Selfish Gene.”  However, few readers would know anything else about him.  Anything he tells the reader in his memoir would likely be something the reader doesn't know already.  So Dawkins succeeds in telling the reader something new.  However, in trying to tell his story in an interesting manner Dawkins fails miserably.<br /><br />The poor storytelling begins in the first chapter.  Dawkins naturally starts with his ancestry, but quickly digresses into how a cousin failed a test for to be bus driver.  Then, in another point in the first chapter, he includes five stanzas of poem regarding a child who swallows a fruit pit.<br /><br />The new few chapters regarding his early years growing up in Africa are fairly interesting, but with some editing, could have been made it more readable, if not dramatic.<br /><br />The next chapters cover his upbringing in England.  But again, there is a lack of focus.  While Dawkins was educated at boarding school, he felt it necessary to include a poem written by one of his father’s employees on the family farm.  The poem was completely extraneous to the main storyline.  Later, to illustrate the importance of critical thinking over learning by rote, Dawkins tells a long story about a classmate being asked by a visitor to the classroom what kind animal eats a certain of plant.  However, the student and the teacher don’t know the answer and there is a discussion of how the answer could be obtained.  However, if the student (or teacher) had simply memorized what animal ate a particular plant, they would have had their answer.  This was one circumstance where rote learning (what eats what) -- not critical thinking --  was needed.<br /><br />The writing does not improve with Dawkins’ adult and professional life.  He mentions how met his first wife, but his second wife is mentioned only in the briefest of passing.  Of course, Dawkins is entitled to a measure of privacy, but in a memoir there is an expectation that some personal life will be revealed.<br /><br />Dawkins however writes at length about his doctoral dissertation.  A dissertation which included  how the counting of hen pecks was achieved -- not exactly an exciting subject.  Then, in one of the latter chapters he writes how he went about writing The Selfish Gene.  Unless the circumstances are extremely unique, reading a book about how the author wrote another book is downright boring.<br /><br />One final flaw, a flaw common to autobiographies, Dawkins engages in excessive “name dropping.”  However, the practice is even worse here because the “name dropping” involved the names of other scientists, names, that with few exceptions, are meaningless to most readers.<br /><br />Between the name dropping, extraneous poetry and recitation of the dreary aspects of data collection An Appetite for Wonder has little to offer the general reader.  An Appetite for Wonder merits a very generous two star rating.prove with Dawkins’ adult and professional life.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Its a wonderful family movie and the kids always love it! Good quality time well spent for the holidays and a great message along with it.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Excellent read, fast moving, lots of historical info to understand Japanese way of life. Great story, detailed descriptions put you in the picture
B00G70WLJA|3.0|The movie was 80's cheesy. Jackman did a great job of acting like he always does, but everything else was just cheesy. We seen it all before bad guys or bad gals, with the slow sarcastic talking attitude. Then you will see ninjas flying around on motor bikes jumping off of snow covered rooftops, oh brother. The plot is semi slow and somewhat boring. I actually couldn't even finish watching this one.  This might be entertaining with enough beers or if you are half asleep, or a simple minded public educated CNN watching zombie, but to an intelligent awake person this movie is a waste of time..
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|the app took a bit to down load but works well now.  nice graphics and story line.  not too hard but keeps your brain moving.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Not every one has face book so I can't sea trade or ANYTHING ducking change that other than that it's AWESOME
B00GO95TAC|5.0|My guess is that someone made typeos for the prices and corrected them.  $2.99 seems really low for this.  Like I told my kids, &#34;We are all getting to see it for the price of less than one movie ticket.&#34;  And besides, I hate 3D.  I'm sorry other people felt the price was too high, but the episode itself was great.  And the curator...oh how I miss him. &#60;3
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was very excited to see the story of Danny Torrance continued. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Great book. Hope a movie is made from this story.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|A great thinking show for me. Glad I rented it. Always need to keep the brains spans working. Will continue to rent from Amazon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I just wish it was longer.  It was challenging but not too  difficult like some of the other games I've played.  I finished it in a little over an hour.  It would be nice to end up OUTSIDE of the building when you've escaped the last level!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging.  Not super hard, but intriguing enough to keep playing. Wish it would save all my moves. I m looking forward to more rooms.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|i have read 12 lee child/jack reacher books & loved them all; this was certainly one of his best; i heard different views on the movie jack reacher but i have to get it to watch how they portray tom cruise as jack reacher; i cannot think of an actor who would appear less like reacher than crusie (that may be a bit of a stretch); i have pre-ordered the latest child book & will re-look & see if i missed any reacher novels by him, if i have, i will download them as well; if you like child, you should love this; get it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story has the allure of a Harry Potter, introducing characters you like and dislike... that the reader can relate to and emphasize with. The violence is downplayed and the moral dilemmas brought up as choices we all make to lesser degree. Destroying the competition in daily life is present for everyone. Will Katniss choose love over triumph? Will Peeta die to protect his childhood love or sacrifice her to save himself? Will Haymitch ever sober up?<br />Love. Excitement. Friendship. Even a gentle humor. This is a start to a story you want to keep reading.
B00EYTDVWM|5.0|This is still a classic after so many years, and so much better than any of the &#34;re-imaginings&#34; done in modern settings.
B004C03TK2|1.0|The DVD did arrive on time as promised, however, it will not play on a regular DVD player. It is coded 2 which I found out after I received it means it requires a special type of DVD player. It must be coded 0 to play on all DVD players. This information would have been helpful BEFORE I purchased it and paid to have it shipped from Germany. Pay close attention to the code on a DVD when ordering from a company outside of the United States!

B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. It was an unusual read, as most of it is told through a 5 year old`s eye. It is interesting to see how this child sees the world since he was held captive since his birth and how differently his Mother sees it having been taken at 19 years old.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|One of the best movies which about vampires. Must watch if you like vampire themed movies. Cast and at is really exceptional.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game very much. I was so glad when it came to kindle fire. I can't wait until they get pet rescue saga.  Fun to play and  I think everyone will like it. The graphics are great.
0399157573|3.0|Well...I waited months for this book, but find it was a let down. I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I have read and own all of Cornwell's published novels. I have always enjoyed her writing, and have become involved in the lives of the main characters of the Scarpetta series. But this book...I just can't put my finger on what disappoints me. I found my mind wandering as I was reading it. This hasn't happened to me with any other Scarpetta novel. Normally I am so involved  that I don't hear or see anything around me, and I have to finish the book in one sitting. Dust has taken me over a week to read. Its just not grabbing me. I find the storyline/plot to be the &#34;same old...same old&#34;. It took ages to get into it. There was none of the gripping excitement of previous Scarpettea novels. The characters seem stagnant. Its as if we know all there is to know about them, and they are not moving on. When we finally get to the climax of the story...pfft. A fizzle, not a bang. Am I becoming cynical in my old age ? Maybe. Will I be waiting for the next Cornwell novel ? of course I will. I just hope it returns to the gripping excitement that all Scarpetta fans know and love.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I own the third season!  I can watch it whenever I like.  I get to fill in the blank episodes I missed.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I have been a Malcolm Gladwell fan since we read &#34;Outliers&#34;.  I was not disappointed with &#34;David and Goliath&#34;.  What I love about it the most is that my husband and I read it together and he gets his insights from a business point of view and I get mine from a mother-of-three point of view and both are very relevant.  Gladwell has some fascinating interviews throughout this book and it is definitely worth the read!
B00DBTAPDY|5.0|Everything about this performance is enjoyable. The libretto is charming in English. The acting and singing should be enough to bring a new generation to opera.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|It's exiting, unpredictable, interesting, funny, sad and romantic and it's excellent at keeping you in suspense. I look forward to seeing the next episodes.
B00GO95BUU|1.0|Not at that price Amazon,even itunes had it cheaper No thank you This really is price gouging will do with out
B00GJ8IY28|5.0|Brilliant! Love the collaborations and the mix of classics with new material. This is a great album and I highly recommend it.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|The Day of the Doctor was worth the wait. This is the game-changing episode that will present new opportunities for the next incarnation.<br />I agree with other reviewers who wrote that it was wonderful to see the curator.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I love it!!  It is the answer to my problem, I can now open my videos on my kindle fire!!!
B002LBKDYE|2.0|Food comes from gulags for animals. Even plant life does not escape scrutiny.<br /><br />The thing that I did not expect was the push to tell you that the FDA has no teeth in the matter. It is defiantly a different FDA that I dealt with in the medical device industry; they carried guns and badges.<br /><br />A lot of the film was tearjerker stories. Deaths and poor people eating while driving. We get to watch animals getting dispatched.<br /><br />Not sure where they are going with the small section in the center of the film about Wal-Mart going organic. There is a Monsanto police story catching farmers saving seeds; it is sort of a mini McCarthy film.<br /><br />The rest of the film is an updated version of the Russian film \\"Earth\\" (1930) where the nasty government made the proletariat use tractors to pull their plows.<br /><br />Bottom line is everyone has a choice. Expos&eacute;s only sell films. There is nothing revolutionary to justify wasting the time viewing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001QUO1PS Soylent Green]]

B005FVNIW6|3.0|Apparently the book's target group is teenage kids. For adults the story seems flat and onedimensional. Especially the end feels rushed and full of quick fixes.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I gave this book a four star rating. While it was a good story , the ending was very abrupt. Hopefully the author is writing another book to this series. It definitely keeps your attention.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth had been one of my favorite bands in the early 90s when I was a kid. I listened to the hell out of 'Rust In Peace' and 'Countdown To Extinction', and now over 20 years later I'm back into these guys, hardcore. I was looking for something similar to the 'Rust In Peace' sound, then stumbled onto this album, 'United Abominations', and boy this album is amazing.<br />I thought those early days of Megadeths sound were over, I was wrong. United Abomination is metal defined. With powerful lyrics with real life meaning, loud and uplifting, and being the bands most politically charged album yet. With each song carrying three to sometimes seven guitar solos by Dave Mustaine and new replacement guitarist Chris Broderick. The sound is hard and fast, much like 'Rust In Peace', as if Mustaine and company went into the studio with an intense vigor and just jammed the hell out of the set and seeing what happens. And what happened was pure metal brilliance, putting this album alongside the metal elite.<br /><br />Key Tracks<br /><br />- Sleepwalker<br />- Gears Of War<br />- Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms<br />- Washington Is Next!<br />- Blessed Are The Dead<br />- A Tout le Monde<br />- Your Dead<br />- Play For Blood

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|There were many reasons to like this book.  It is a metaphor for the journey through life's trials and complications and lost opportunities.  The slow pace of the writing mirrored Harold's steps as he seeks redemption from the shame of actions not taken and from the pain of loss.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have seen the play a few times, but I love the movie and music much more, so much detail and easy to understand.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|This is exactly what it says.  The only problem with my new &#34;dream&#34; computer is that it only has 2 USB ports, and considering 1 is taken up by the mouse & keyboard USB stick, that leaves only one port.  This makes my computer with a critical design flaw into the awesome beast that I knew it could be!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome!!!!! So much suspense.<br />If you read this book......be as are because once you start it, you cannot put  it down!
0394800192|4.0|funny!  Make certain that you use different and funny voices when reading it to children.  A favorite of my children
0307476073|5.0|Amazing.<br />This book was a great book that gave very vivid details of life on the Pacific Crest Trail. I didn't want the book to end but it was well worth the read. It has a background story to it as well, so if your not one who likes books about the outdoors, this book can still spark an interest!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It's epic. Nothing more need to be said.<br />The way George tells stories takes a bit of reading to get used to but once you are in, you enjoy the ride.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|it was pretty awesome the ending was a little strangevut since there are a lot more books i guess it works out
B008K8VDPU|3.0|The app was good before the update but now, it's so confusing and I have to pay money for tons of songs. The earlier one was so much better. I wish I didn't get the update
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had no particular idea what this book was about other than hoping it wasn't sappy love story.  it turns out to be a wonderful romp through the fairly normal yet remarkable lives of some marvelous characters from Down Under.  Their love & fears & tragedy so unique at yet so common. I recommend it.
B007AL48UK|3.0|Got it for my wife and not sure she has used it yet, I am not a player so it is hard to comment.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|works well and as described.  problem with headphone tip in the port cannot be fixed without destroying the unit or taking it apart.
0486274268|5.0|I love the way this book presents the art of drawing animals. First of all, there is a variety of animals (including baby animals) to choose from. The step-by-step- process is easy to follow. The author also describes why learning the anatomy of these animals is important. If you are looking for a book that helps you draw movement, then this one is perfect. IT also teqches you how to draw different styles (Cartoon, caricature, etc.).
B006GWO5NE|1.0|My problem was that I couldn't get my Kindle Fire to charge. I bought both the powerfast adapter and the USB cable. I still have difficulty getting it to charge. I have to wiggle it and just about stand on my head to get it to charge. I can't just plug it in and go. I usually have to put something under the cable to keep it up in order for it to charge. I really would like more feedback on this. What else can Amazon do for me to rectify this situation? This is the second set of cables and adapter I have bought and I only have had my kindle for less than two years.
1609611543|3.0|Started to read it yet am staying away from this stuff in general anyway, not sure I will actually read the whole thing, sure it makes sense though.
1571200851|2.0|Not that useful.  Other books covering the same subject are much better. Just didn't have anything that great for my needs.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|This clearly proves how hard Beyoncé works. She deserves all the success in the world and then some. The Revel show was amazing.
B005R9U5EA|3.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some very quick thoughts on this psychological thriller...<br /><br />Session 9 (2001) is a psychological thriller/semi horror movie that stars David Caruso.  I found this movie to be somewhat boring, but had some decent moments.  This is one of those modern movies that tries to be hip and cool, with the characters constantly swearing, etc.  For me, this has a negative effect, as it made me not care about the characters at all.  I didn't care what happened to them throughout the movie, as their behavior robbed me of any concern I might have for them.  This movie's atmosphere is somewhat creepy at times, but not anywhere near the creepiness of countless other far superior movies that fall into the psychological thriller category.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only as a rental.  2 1/2 stars, rounded up to 3.
1401923127|5.0|There is much to say on this subject and i would highly advise reading this book in addition to others on the subject.

B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I've been a loyal RR3 racer. So far this has it beat. Great graphics and realistic handling.  Not sure I'll bother with RR 3.
0804137501|5.0|The book would be really valuable for (and is aimed at) people looking to start working remotely. Having 10 years of remote working experience (8+ years since the last time I worked in an office) I completely agree with everything they say in the book and would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about making a move to remote employment. And even if you think it is not for you, I'd still recommend you to look at the book to better understand remote employees in your current or your future teams.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|My ten year old is nuts about the Titanic so this was a great choice and he really enjoyed it.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|If you pass this up because it has the word Zombie and you've had enough of them you should reconsider.  Great action flick.  More like &#34;Outbreak&#34; on steriods.  Well told and the action scenes are wild.  I heard a lot of negative reviews of this film but I truly liked it.  Recommended.
B002MFWLXK|5.0|PROBABLY THE BEST DOCUMENTARY ON THE ASSINATION EXCEPT THEY LEFT OUT THE PART WHERE THE ACTUAL FINAL SHOT CAME FROM ..... THE SEWER DRAIN UNDER THE CURB BY THE GRASSY KNOLL AND THEY ALSO LEFT OUT THE PHOTO TAKEN BY SATURDAY EVENING POST OF OSWALD STANDING IN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE BOOK DEOSITORY BLDG AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING  WHEN ALL THE CARS HAD COME TO A STOP. OTHER THAN THAT IS IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND I BELIEVE PRETTY MUCH FACTUAL.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This app sucks!! It takes forever to download and when you try to open it, it's just a black screen.....complete waste of my time!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I could hardly put this book down.  I will send a email out recommending this story.<br />You will laugh and she'd a tear reading the book.
1476727651|5.0|Classic Stephen King.  The Torrance Boy grows up.  A visit to the past with a fresh look.  As someone who is a &#34;friend of Bill&#34; I found the AA references real enough to feel like I was at a meeting while reading the book!  I Loved 11/22/63 as well but this is King doing his thing.<br />NOW...if we can just catch up with Mark Petrie and Fr. Callahan from &#34;Salem's Lot&#34;......
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|i love this game by far the best game on the kindle it is boring at first but after you get the hang of it it is addicting
B00BD99JMW|5.0|OMG! probably some of the actions on this book were expected, some were clearly not. But now, you will understand the why behind several things you read before. Loved it
1596590688|2.0|The speaking style of this reader is really, really challenging to get tuned into. It's laborious to listen to it.<br /><br />However, I have picked up a couple of ideas for my team so that's good.
B00CX7TOTQ|3.0|The film trys to tell a story of morality and redemption around what is supposed to be an action flick.  The actors are of course good (although I can't quite buy Travolta as a Serb even though he tries hard) but I wasn't sure if the story was a condemnation of War or a celebration of the spirit of man trying to rise above his past bad acts.  Not as good as I'd hoped but ok.
B00902AKK4|4.0|This game is perfect for people who just need to waste time...I normally play when I have nothing to do in class and it not too hard and not too easy its just right
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I didn't have high hopes, but this turned out to be a great little hidden objects game. Nice puzzles and challenges. Not terribly difficult, but still a pleasant way to pass time. Two reasons for losing one star: first, it's short and doesn't have much replay value. Second, some of the hidden objects are tiny and tap as you may, its just a bit harder to hit where your aiming.
006202406X|2.0|I wish I were giving this book 5 stars, which would mean that the series I loved was not forever changed for me with this book. I felt as though Divergent and most of Insurgent were such breaths of fresh air. A wonderful plot, a brave and engaging heroine, and wonderful and dynamic supporting characters.<br /><br />When I began Allegiant, something felt off. The writing was a bit different and Tobias's voice was not how I expected (though that is no fault of the author) and weirdly similar to Tris' voice (that is a fault of the author, as sometimes I forgot whose chapter I was reading midway through). This book just didn't feel like Divergent, and one could claim that this is because this book was one of taking the characters out of the shielded world that Divergent took place in....but even still, this book just didn't have that sparkle and intrigue that the first two books had. Also, it might have just been me, but I felt like the author spent a lot of the book trying to &#34;make a point&#34; and preach to the audience about an underlying meaning to the book.<br /><br />*Spoilers ahead*<br /><br />I actually LOVED, and I mean LOVED the theme about sacrifice as it is something that every human being must understand and appreciate (though of course, not as extremely because our lives are not so action packed). It made my eyes water, in a good way, when Tris took Caleb's place in the vault. That was very much in character for her and it made me love her character even more. However....killing off the main character/heroine that we have grown to love and learn about for 3 books? No, I'm sorry, I know its the author's book/her world/her choice, but that was ridiculous. The ultimate sacrifice would have been Caleb coming back and taking the bullet or something. I am not someone who needs a perfect and joyful ending but killing off the main character? There were less severe sacrifices that could have happened that would have had any justice to them (paralysis, Caleb's redemption and thus his death, etc). I felt as though the author took a beloved character (much too quickly, mind you...I literally had to go back and re-read her death because it was quick and confusing and felt unecessary), and then left us behind with characters like a still cowardly Caleb, a murderer David, Evelyn who was able to be redeemed, etc. And for real?! Poor Tobias. I mean...I can't even explain my frustration with the end of this novel. The author took our main character and then didn't even bother to take the time and explain how her sacrifice benefited the world.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound bitter or childish but I once thought this would be a book series I re-read at least a couple of times, and a books series that I look forward to see a movie adpatation of...but now...I do not think I want to re-read these books. Why read about a happy Tris, a growing Tris, a maturing Tris, a Tris who is in love, a Tris and Tobias who continue to love despite differences, a Tris who is loved by her friends, a Tris who is the BEST sister in the world....if she is just going to die anyway. It would feel pretty pointless to re-read these books knowing about her death not to mention, the unexplained/unsatisfying ending that the author leaves us with.<br /><br />Again, an author can write whatever she or he likes. It was Roth's world that she created and she had every right to do with it as she pleases. I just think its probably VERY clear to her by now that most of her reader's did not think this last book (as a whole, not even talking about the death) was up to the standards of her first two Divergent novels.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was okay - I know a lot of people who really like this but I found it just okay.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very nice. Graphics are good, and the progressive challenges keep it interesting.  The ability to upgrade weapons is also good.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|This game isn't even close to a real pinball experience.  Lame graphics and sound .  Ball movement is horrible.  I was totally bored within 5 minutes.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Definitely a good read for Pendergast fans!  This book would make an excellent movie..  Finally we get to learn more about Corrie Swanson.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like lawyer and trial stories and this is fantastic.  About 3/4 through the book can't wait for the ending.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent! Subtly and nuanced acting are the hallmarks of this series. I'd suggest that young people view this to experience acting at a sophisticated, well-schooled level;  in contrast to standard television fare. When I say sophisticated, I do not mean because the plot line centers around a upper class family. IT IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE ACTING PERFORMANCES. Television can do so much better that &#34;The Housewives of ...........&#34;. It is one thing to argue this case and  quite another thing to experience the differences. Indeed, if you've never experienced excellence, then junk can pass as good.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This movie scared the beejeezus out of me. A child's game is turned into something so sinister; three keys played on a cranky old piano become a taunt; a wardrobe left behind leads to spooky secrets. The acting is great and the blending of the two family's stories (the Warren's and the Perron's) is compelling. If you liked to be spooked, but in a smart way, this is a movie for you.
1781162646|5.0|First, I am a big Stephen King fan. This is a little different offering from him but still fantastic! Great read! Even if you think you don't like Stephen King you will like this book!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is fun cause you make the plays and chose from many armors and cant wait to get th igoor it seems op though
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno has been a game of matching wits just to see if you can get rid of your cards before your opponent. Great fun for every one!
B004LWZW24|3.0|I got this movie at the same time I got &#34;The Conjuring&#34; and was really excited by what I heard about this and its sequel. But I was disappointed. I think it felt too far fetched. I think if someone likes a Hellraiser type of movie where reality must be suspended, they would really like this. But it was not for me. I will say there were some very creepy moments that made me jump. And the ending is good. But my test of a scary movie is whether or not I have to hide my eyes and for how long. By about half way through this, I was watching, eyes wide open and just got disinterested.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Very thought provoking movie.  Just when you think Denzel Washington's character can't get any more immoral, he does the right thing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it. Fun for  the whole family! My daughter's hand eye coordination is tested and improved through play! We play it all the time!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator, very user friendly.  I use the percentage key a lot, makes calculating tip amounts easy.
B00FN3HRG4|1.0|I saw the show in San Jose and I admit, seeing her live is overwhelming. But this recording, although I get the nostalgia for Brooklyn and the whole point of the tour; is a horrible recording. Even the cover photo looks like some unauthorized bootleg covrer., and the YouTube video's of all the shows on the tour are better than this audio recording. I don't even want to watch the DVD, it's just heartbreaking. I can't believe she would allow such a disappointing recording to be the documentation of a otherwise brilliant tour.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics and lots of fun. No ads.  It has very Smooth gameplay.  Lots of guns and upgrades to choose from.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sometimes one just needs a little youth literature to get through the week.  This book was an easy read, entertaining, and intensely emotional.  I very much enjoyed it, and look forward to the movie.
B00GINENG0|1.0|Couldn't get this app to work.  I had a cat's arm sticking out of a box, waving.  I never heard Tom talk.  So I deleted it.
B00GIXWXEO|1.0|A very dull predictable story.  The kids even hated it...  I expected more from Dreamworks!  CG animation doesn't carry a story.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Just what I needed to resolve my adapter connection issues between my Mac and AV equipment. A solid and high-quality connector.
B00AEFYCL4|2.0|I wanted to jump through my TV and punch this kid in the face as I was watching this movie.  I am very sorry this kid died and wouldn't wish that on anyone.  I am even sadder for his family who he completely, selfishly ignored while he was on his &#34;adventure.&#34;  The selfishness of Chris was almost too much for me.  So you had bad parents.  Lots of people do.  Get over it.  To not contact them or even send a postcard to let them know where you are is unacceptable and shows a lack of common human decency.  If he was mad at his parents, why not at least contact his sister?  I am shocked that people have romanticized his story.  To me, Chris thought he was deep and thoughtful and above society but he was really shallow, immature, and selfish.  The movie itself was just okay.  It dragged on a bit.  The scenery was pretty and I liked Hal Holbrook.  Overall, this was a plodding movie with an infuriating main character.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Im removing one star just because it still does not stream local content, but as per google news this little monster will do it.<br />You can go wrong with this dongle just be sure to know what can do and what cannot do.<br />Pros:<br />-Small and it fits any HDMI port, it comes with an extender in case that you HDMI is in a complicated location.<br />-Streams Youtube, Netflix, Google Music and Video without any problems.<br />-Easy Setup.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Still does not have local media support for streaming.<br /><br />For $35 you convert any regular TV into an Smart one!
155927557X|5.0|One of the best books I've listened to.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy long road trips. ;-)  Lawrence Pressman does a great read...
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|It was awesome! A little crazy at the end. I did not expect it the ending. Great graphics and storyline
B007NG93CK|2.0|Reich's books are getting too predictable. A good read if you have not read all the other Tempe tales. If you have, this one adds nothing new.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like when you wanna stop you can't oh my goodness sooooooooooooooooooooooo fun I love it super good game you should totally buy it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply one of the best books I`ve read in my life. Thanks to John Green for such a piece of art.
0316228583|3.0|I was definitely hooked, and I didn't even realize it until I was half way through.  I did like it. A lot. Even though the characters were a bit difficult I was able to keep them organized in my mind after a short while.<br />So why three stars?  The end. To me, it was so anti-climactic.  If I had to guess an easy and convenient way to end this story that required little thought, it would have been this exact one.  I was very interested in the depth of each character, and she did them no justice by leaving their issues unresolved.  I mean, in a way they were, but not really.  Like, it wasn't a well- written ending or maybe I just missed something.  I was left hoping there'd be a sequel.  If there is then, I'd definitely read it.  I'm still hooked on these characters because I feel like their problems are still fresh in my mind.  Even the major plot point, The Fields, kinda got sloughed off in the end.  I dunno, I guess I was just expecting... More.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game is fun and all but it get's very annoying. The app has WAY too expensive items. There is things that are over 100,000 coins(well in this case kibble). I still enjoy this app but I wish the prices went down!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I would have liked to had a  little more to the story after the case was settled.  Would have been nice to find out what happened with the main charactors.
B0001907DA|5.0|The whole family likes the Police Academy series and have watched it numerous times. It remains entertaining no matter how many times it's viewed. It arrived quickly and was exactly as described.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun game it is fun for all ages and there are lots of things you can do its fun
B00AEFY3MC|4.0|This is a fun movie that hasn't lost its appeal in the years since it was made. It's as much a loving homage to &#34;Star Trek,&#34; et al, as it is a parody. There are some solid - and very funny - performances here, but Enrico Colantoni really stands out as the alien leader. Not only is he hilarious, he also pulls off the most touching moment in the film - and makes it believable. Very well done.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Awesome book!!!  Simple, clear and love the writer's style.  Great e-book for taking anywhere on the go.  Nice to read right before bed.
6305428042|3.0|This is a great classic Halloween movie and I was happy to get it at such a steal. However, it comes in a highly distorted full-screen view only, and the film quality just wasn't that good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a frustrating challenge in a very good way. I am determined to conquer each level no matter how much sleep I lose!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Lots of good ideas in a classic game concept.  First bunch of levels are great but you eventually have to buy power ups to win which are crazy expensive.  I wouldn't buy them if they were crazy cheap anyway. seems like cheating to me.  still there lord of levels you can win if you try hard enough.
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|Awesome
B00BDSRISA|2.0|This sounds nothing like their album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (which I LOVED). It was an overall disappointment. I listened to it maybe three or four times and just couldn't get into it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this game it is so addictive but I hate waiting for life I recommend this game to all the folks out there .this game always keeps me thinking. It is one  of the best games ever made!I hope every one enjoys candycrushsaga! I rate this game very high I rate it 4and a half stars to 5stars I promise you won't regret playing this game
B008FRFN7A|5.0|this a great app I would recommended to anyone. I has different settings  where one can set up their printer to their liking. thanks
067144901X|5.0|This is one of my nephew's favorites. He learned the sounds of cows and sheep from this story and used to sing along the &#34;la la la&#34; part too :)
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Rick Hall's contribution to American music are like the contributions of Thomas Edison in invention in that Rick Hall never gave up on what he believed in. He didn't allow Jerry Wexler and Atlantic Records shut him down. He went forward.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is fun to play with friends n kids. It's addictive to play. The kids love this game n ask to play it all the time.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I seem to have the same problem as a lot of other Kindle users.  I am prompted to update the app and it takes me to screen where you would normally update but my only button option is play.  If I click play I am prompted to update and am caught in this endless loop.
0671449028|5.0|One of my nephew's favorites! We really enjoyed reading this together before bedtime and he giggled at the how silly the story goes :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great, I didn't even tried to root it, because it really does what I need: stream fro youtube and cas my tabs! Well what about local content? I suspect that soon, particularly in December we will see a bunch of apps for it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a USB to Micro-USB cable.  Kinda wish I did not have to purchase this seperately.  But is works fine.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I give this book only 1 star as this was supposed to be book 3 of the trilogy and for whatever reason (prob $$$$$) it was decided to extend the series to 4 books. The release of this book was pushed back several times as well.<br /><br />Let's not take the readers for fools now!<br /><br />I was expecting and ending to the series, not dragging it along in order to make more money.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best free puzzle app I've come across so far. It's flexible in the size of puzzle you can solve; whether or not you want rotated prices; and the ability to solve corners first if you choose. The pictures are lovely and you get quite a few for free. Of course there is also the in-game option to purchase more puzzle packs, but the free ones are pretty varied, with art,  nature, animals, and more.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for puzzle fans.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I am so heartbroken with this ending. I can't even imagine reading the series ever again because the ending. It was unnecessary an  I'm very very upset. I've been crying and depressed for hours.
B0053B347M|4.0|As the title says - not much else to it. Wound up having to use clear packing tape instead, but works as intended.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has done it again. Could not put it down, from start to finish I was enthralled with the story.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I Love it, great job AFI, the layered music and sounds and the lyrics are amazing. I am in love with this album, and them playing live is just great.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book from beginning to end.  I started to cry after everything goes downhill for Gus.  If you choose to read this book, keep tissues nearby for the ending.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Vintage Bond.  The story, cinematography, and overall feel was of a classic Bond movie.  I very much enjoyed it. The best bond movie in years.
0671449028|5.0|So cute! I love Sandra Boynton books; this may be my favorite! Cute bedtime story for my 10 month old. Recommended!
B003477DVK|4.0|An oldie but goodie.  Probably not a movie everyone would like but I'm a pushover for stories and movies about kids and their pets. It didn't cost a dime and was worth taking a look.  Of course I ended up watching the whole movie.  You don't find them like this anymore.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Interesting use of flowers to communicate but thought main character was too convinced that she would fail to make good choices.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great product,  Not as good as the original trilogy but it is still a very good movie.  The next movie in the series looks amazing.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The pictures are great and very colorful. With the various levels, all ages will enjoy. This is one of my favorite apps. You can also get more puzzles with little out of pocket expenses.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is game is awesome.Its nice to play it it may slow down but it will work good game a lot. AWESOME GAME
B009NNG202|4.0|Controversial and thought provoking. There are many times where I was purely disgusted, and others as equally intrigued and perhaps even enchanted.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LLLLOOOOVVVEEE this game. It is so awesome. Anyone who wants this game should get it. Anyone, young or old will love it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I wasn't interested in the Good Wife at first but years later, I find myself watching it every day.  I can't get enough of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH. I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME WHEN I AM BORED. I AM CLOSE TO UNLOCKING ALL THE CHARACTERS. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR EVERYONE.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Definitely recommend!<br />Quick moving plot with awesome characters that you either hate or love whole-heartily. I'm so glad it was free!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got myself hooked and my husband hooked.so when we get stuck we just trade tablets and help each other out. The only problem I have is the offers on Facebook for free candy crush stuff I like and share but nothing ever happens but awesome game nonetheless.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Great group and great music. I am new to country and buying used I was able to get a couple more favorites!
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I AM PILGRIM is screenwriter Terry Hayes' debut novel, which I would not have picked without knowing the background up front. Obviously written with a keen visual sense, the novel doesn't read like a screen treatment or a movie script. This is a good old fashioned, seat of the pants, keep you up way past your bedtime, spy thriller.<br /><br />A lengthy book, which when reading in ebook format, didn't even enter my mind. It was only when I noticed a paperback copy on the shelves of a bookshop that it suddenly dawned on me that this is a doorstopper of a thing. Which is even greater testament to just how good it is. At no stage did the length become noticeable. There wasn't even the suspicion of padding.<br /><br />Reminiscent of the very best of the Cold War spy thrillers, this story moves through a vast and varied landscape from deep in the Hindu Kush, through Turkey, New York and Saudi Arabia, whilst taking the reader on a journey mostly via the narrator's viewpoint. Man of action, retired spy specialist, ghost author of a book on his own exploits and expertise, cleverly he is both hero and questionable. Perhaps an unreliable narrator. Whilst guessing about Pilgrim's motivations there is no doubting the threat that he is attempting to stop - genocide on a massive basis, aimed directly at the United States. And so very cleverly executed that when the methodology is finally revealed, well it was breathtakingly believable.<br /><br />Along the way there are alternative viewpoints explored. This gives the author a chance to expand on events, exploiting the possibility of questionable motives in the main character, pulling the all action hero back into a more human, flawed man who may not prevail. Giving the action, the possible outcomes an edge which was beautifully done.<br /><br />There have been rather a lot of fundamentalist religious storylines explored in thrillers that I've been asked to look at recently. In a lot of cases the black and whiteness of the villainsand the heroes is too emphatic, way too simplistic. There have also been a number of examples that have tried, overly hard perhaps, to be fair to all sides of the argument. I AM PILGRIM is the first book in a long time that I've read that actually spells out a realistic scenario that this reader, probably naively, could accept. Even with the magnitude of the threat, there's the facility for some understanding of the motivation - if you're of a mind. If not, the inevitability of the toll for stopping the threat is equally open for exploration. It's up to the reader to decide, and that was such a refreshing experience when reading a thriller it stood out. It was not afraid to do that with a dash of James Bond and George Smiley woven together to make the whole thing a fabulous yarn into the bargain.<br /><br />[...]
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Because of who he was and what he did for family, God and Country.  Why can't more men and or women like him rise to the surface.  I understand his lifestyle was extremely difficult, but he was strong and was able to have it all.  It took a lot of work and a lot of love - but he managed to do it.  Lots of love and understanding from his love and family.  God bless and keep you always.<br /><br />It has been a long time since a have read a book that brings out so much emotion in such a short time.  Everything from sadness, being happy and laughing out loud, he had a comical wit and could really make you laugh, there were times that I felt like crying because of his emotions that was put into print.  He made you feel his hurt, joy, anticipation, all the time knowing that the man was doing his job for his country.  It sounds like he loved deeply, had a strong core value and was a truly good man.  Too bad we don't have more like him.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|My son who loves superman lost interest half way through the film. I had to push to finish the movie myself.
0316055433|5.0|I loved this book.  The story wrapped up on a philosophical note that was respectful to the story and matched the serious tone.  I felt privileged to have found this book.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|There is no fluff. This book was to the point and helpful to anyone wanting to publish their first e-book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read for anyone who loves a wonderfully written plot. Also very thought provoking. Any married person needs to have this book.
B000FC0O7M|4.0|Excellent book. Well written about the inner circle at ground control. Only minus is the lack of pictures. In a biography it is usually nice to break up the story with some pictures from the life of the man in question. Other than that, this is a book I would recommend to anyone interested in the origin of manned space exploration. Gene Kranz did not fail in this book either.
0060594896|5.0|This book is EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  Wonderful practical advice on how to be successful.  I have read the book all the way through once and now am going back through to go through the detailed steps.  I recommend this book to all my friends and have purchased the teen addition for my high school sons.  Wish I had this advice 20 years ago!  MUST read for anyone who wants to make their life better in every aspect.  A++++++++

B007NWPB4S|5.0|GREAT JOB
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My son loves superhero movies and this was a great movie with all the great characters!  The story wasn't hard for him to follow along since he is a bit younger.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but is not one that I would keep in my bookshelf to read again. Glad that I could get it from the library as an e-book
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Tried multiple times to download and install the game and it never would download. Wasted my time on this app.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is the last book of the series and since I've loved every other one in the series I'm not surprised that I love this one as well.  I had it loaded on my kindle just like the past 200 books I've bought so its super convenient, fast and worth every penny.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Amazing film. Such a great piece of cinema history and a masterwork of Mr. Kurasawa. I love the extras too!!

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I have never been a devoted Lady Gaga fan, but this CD changed my perspective of her.  She is a brilliant, innovative singer, which are hard to come by nowadays.  This is one has to be one of her best pieces of work, you can tell she really put a lot of creativity into this album.  This album is similar to Fame with a mix the Fame Monster.  If you like dance/ pop music this is a major influence on this album, including Jewels n' Drugs where is goes into a R&B/rap feel.  Yet, we are able to witness that she is not biased or loyal toward one genre type of music. She is a truly universal artist which makes her an icon, despite what others say gaga is here to stay!
0761174192|3.0|Hi, I have been purchasing the Page-A-Day Gallery Cat calendar for years and years.  I gave it only 3 stars because today, Monday, November 25, 2013 there was no picture?  What?  I have 22nd, 23rd/24th, no 25th, then I have the 26th, etc.  What happened.  Can anyone tell show me a picture of today's Page-A-Day cat, please.  I am distraught!
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I know the cover looks like some lame book but the book itself is cool. Am a diary of a wimpy kid fun and you will also enjoy this book if you are a diary of a wimpy kid fun or not.
B00GO95BUU|2.0|As a 50th anniversary episode this was really a let down. It felt much more like a good cliff hanger/season opening story than a celebration of an amazing series reaching it's semi-centennial. In a never again opportunity Moffat ignored chance to use the modern technology and  historic footage to create a dazzling crossover of the 13 Doctors in what could be, arguably perhaps, the greatest Doctor Who story ever told, but rather opted for flashy effects and story that does not reach any further back into the shows history than what has occurred in the scant 8 years since the events in &#34;Rose&#34;. Aside from it's return there was no other time in the recent Who was Russell Davis needed to giver respect to show and it's history.<br /><br />If you like flashy effects and care little to not at all about the people involved over the last 50 yrs that kept the show if not always going, but never forgotten then by all means this is a fine episode. I think anyone at the BBC that worked on it should be ashamed they allowed it to be given the title of anniversary.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I think this game is a good idea to get a good idea of the most popular game in the world.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Warning, SPOILERS!!!!! A good read overall. The deaths of several characters were glossed over and the appearance of the sharans without being ever mentioned before were like a dues ex machina - too convenient. The battle scenes were too drawn out. The ending left many questions unanswered.
B0031RG846|5.0|Beautiful! Used it as a cake decoration and it was a hit. And my daughter can keep it and display it for life.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My son wanted this movie so bad and I had a hard time finding it anywhere else. He really enjoys watching this and its a great change from American made cartoons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|K I mean I LOVE this game but I think it is just as good maybe just a hair better than temple run .
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My son loves his legos and this is just a great new piece. He was so excited when he saw the Back to the Future car and couldn't wait to play with it. It was sold out everywhere else at the time I purchased it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so hooked on this game thank you for putting it on kindle fire.I play it all the time.
B00FY2N81W|5.0|Awesome movie! Can't wait for the 7th one! The story is so compelling. It's sad at the ending though, but still great.

1476727651|5.0|This is the continuation of the boy in &#34;The Shining&#34;., the book has such graphic detail and really gives you the shivers at times..........
B00BT70IWS|5.0|Kaufman's personal and studied interpretations of Verdi arias, some not all that well known. Fitting partner to his Wagner album.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|This album precursors their dips into the many different genre styles that ghost will later experiment more with in their next album. I was ecstatic when it came in the mail and listened to it almost constantly for a solid week. From the songs &#34;Elizabeth&#34; to &#34;Ritual&#34; and Genesis, this band is able to mesh satanic themes with various styles of other music genres in an almost frighteningly addictive way. If you are a fan of the metal genre in any way you will more than likely be very pleased with this album as well. I highly recommend this album as well as this band.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is such a cool book written from a great perspective. Now I'm always wondering what my dogs are thinking about me.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|I'm giving the SHOW 5 stars because that is what we should be rating.  Loved it.<br /><br />As for the price.<br /><br />While I do think the price is a little high the price needs to be taken into perspective.<br /><br />First.  This is 1 hour and 20 minutes, no commercials.  Most other shows on TV are going to be about 45 minutes after commercials are removed.<br /><br />So if you calculate the cost per minute most shows are .066 a minute while this is .099.  So its about 50% more not really double.  Still higher than average but not all shows cost the same on Amazon.<br /><br />Second, if you go on over to Itunes where people are saying they will buy it now its the same price.  Google has it for $5.99 but I'm not sure if thats HD or not.  I have never bought from Google, just a reference.<br /><br />Third, related one and two.  Amazon, Itunes, etc. do not have complete freedom in setting prices.  The content owner does have some say in what things cost.  Part of the price increase COULD be from BBCA not Amazon.  I'm not saying this is the case, just a possibility.<br /><br />So if you want, go buy from Apple or somewhere else in protest, but you are currently paying the same price, at least on Apple now.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little gadget is a jewel. I use it to watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, Pandora and Youtube videos from my iPad or iPhone. You can also stream any tab directly from Google Chrome. Other apps are been added to the compatibility list. Hopefully, we will see more soon (HBOGO is the newest one, but I still have not tried it).
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I had a very hard time trying to get my Picasa photos transferred to my Kindle Fire. Apparently, there is no such thing as Picasa for the Kindle.  This pFolio app worked.  I uploaded the photos and the next thing I knew, there they were on the Kindle.  I am still working with pFolio so don't know the complete app yet.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|I expected serious historical fiction based on Ian Flemings life.  Instead, it was a prequel to the double-naught spy movies.  Initially, I suspended dis-belief despite obvious bloopers and lack of proof-reading, but the storyline eventually was overwhelmed to the point of silliness.  Writing level toward the end declined to middle-school level to suit the plot.  I cannot conceive how something so historically inaccurate, so technologically anachronistic, and so sophomoric (to be generous), could have received so many glowing reviews.  Have those folks never read a real book? Try Cornwell, Igullden, or Shaara.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a horrible way to end the series!  The way the book actually ends is only a small part of the disappointment I felt when I put the book down.  First of all the two points of view are confusing.  Both main characters narrative are so similar you forget who's point of view you're reading from half way through a chapter; not to mention Natalie's diary reading exactly like the other two.  Very poorly written, where was her editor on this one???  Four also takes a turn for the worse in this.  He goes from being a strong, powerful leader who balances Tris out in all the right ways to a whiny, weak, cowering baby!  Horrible book throughout, horrible ending, all the wrong people live.
B0015DROBO|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read? Could not put it down. Shared this book with my family and now can't wait to see the movie.
0525952926|5.0|Follet has a way of drawing a reader into his novels that is unique. This Century Trilogy is proving to be no exception.Can't wait for the third book in this series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a phenomenal love story!! I read the book in less than a day. The story made me laugh and cry. If you want a good read this is definitely it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of scenes and challenges. Gives different options, talisman and changing hunts. Provides ongoing progressively harder challenges and puzzles. Highly recommend.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This series is AMAZING.  If you love action, adventure & lots of intrigue, you love these!  I would highly recommend them.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Great story that can only increase your appreciation of the sacrifices of the men and families of U.S. Navy SEALs. However, in my opinion, the book would have been better without the repeated finger pointing at &#34;liberals&#34; who get the blame for what went wrong on this mission. The writer suggest that if it wasn't for the liberal media, the team's decision about how to deal with the goat herders who discovered the team events would have been different and the mission might have ended differently. It's a great story and testimony to the SEALs but if you, like the author, think George W. Bush was a great president, you'll like this book even more.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book, well wriiten, but mostly, the information is invaluable to all who are in a relationship or those who desire to one day have a strong marriage. Read it, it will change the way you look at every relationship, even with your kids, coworkers and stangers.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|While I think the action sequences were a little stilted and confusing I think that the movie had a lot of heart that more than made up for it.<br /><br />All five stars go to the flash-backs, particularly the scenes between Clark and Jonathan.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Even more fun than the first!. Love the new levels, and it's always fun to play the dark side lol
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should watch this! This will open up your eyes.. As a European, the constant talk about how all food should be organic used to make me roll my eyes since in Europe pretty much most things are... but boy was this an eye opener. Now my whole family only eats organic and local.

B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Babel-Gentlemen of the Road Edition,  Mumford and sons. This edition contains the CD, Babel, the CD of their performance at Red Rocks and the DVD of the same event. It is a great deal. I am not a youngster so when I accidentally saw some of the Red Rocks show on HBO, I was interested. I don't easily get pulled into new music. This is an exception.<br />The DVD is astounding, the energy and the wonderful sound.... great. Listen to them on Utube and then get this edition.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I love this series! They start off really good and turn into great books! The last three were hard to put down. I hate that I don't have the next one. I found them looking for a replacement for Vince Flynn series of Mitch, now I don't know what to read! Waaaaa, please hurry and write the next one!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so disappointed in how this trilogy ended! I loved Divergent! I finished reading it and started it, again, just because I could not get enough! Insurgent was good, but left me wanting more! Finally, when Allegiant came out, I could not wait to see what happened to these characters I had grown to love..... well, it was the biggest let down! Ever! I did not care for how she split the point of view between Tris and Tobias. I feel like I could not connect with the characters like I had in the previous books. The ending, was terrible. Just terrible.
B000VH4OCW|4.0|I love this cd - it played perfectly - looking for the actual album now. But this is good to listen to on the go.

6304362498|5.0|A harrowing film that captures the dystopian and oppressive hopelessness of the Orwell book.  Excellent performances by John Hurt, Sir Richard Burton (in his final film role, R.i.P.) and sexy Suzanna Hamilton.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Excellent movie and historical film for the history bluffs. Highly recommended and worth the time to watch.  Not recommended for kids unless an adult is president very graffic and true to the German Invasion and incampent during WW2.

0307477479|5.0|\\"To map a linked collection is like waiting for the echo swelling up from a deep well.  It is always like being transported to the charged and confusing times of youth, drugs, sorrow, impossible situations, and failures. The author should assume it the reader's job to find the echo and to place the echo gently alongside its distant match.  That, that is what makes the reading great.\\"<br />--Sabrina Crockett, November 24, 2013 on talking about linked collections and series while eating pie.<br /><br />Jennifer Egan constructs a bleeding out--like dying silk scarves--narrative in *A Visit from the Goon Squad* that allows readers access to multiple decades the vast list of chaos-seeking characters meander through, music as their apparent backdrop. Kleptomaniac Sasha worked for Bennie, a past punk rocker who found success in seeking out \\"hit-it-big\\" bands.  Bennie's middle-aged and high school narratives and friends entangle with Sasha's middle-aged and adolescent narratives (when she worked for him) which inform a lot of \\"flipping back\\" and changes in narration, setting, and chronology--readability. Egan invites readers to open a dialogue of inquiry and see if they can't make out where paths cross/crossed and why, contemplating their own paths of when they've struggled most and posing the question of mortality.<br />There is a mess of teens infatuated with the next higher on the \\"food chain\\" of coolness in both generations that do not end up with their loves or career goals, but end with themes such as \\"almost famous\\", parenthood, and settling on another friend. These themes ask readers to contemplate and piece narrative together based on personal experience. During the final fifty pages Sasha's daughter, Alison, tells her piece in a PowerPoint.  It's as if Egan is asking for participation, to work alongside Alison's mapping of her parents' potential reasons for being who they are/how they got there. Egan leaves readers with this construction-of-self through-PowerPointas a writing exercise.  This book is mentally intoxicating and teaches to the craft of scene and dialogue.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I cannot state how much I hated this book.  I thought the second book was not as well-written as the first, but Allegiant was worse in that aspect & I did not like killing Tris.  Life is full of sadness, I read to be entertained.  I hope Veronica takes more time with her next books - felt like this third book was rushed……. If I could give 0 stars, I would

B005LAIH2M|5.0|If you were expecting &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; you need to get over it and you WiLL be disappointed.  This is just a great, fun, escapist movie meant to entertain. No hidden meaning, no intense dialogue, no Pulitzer Prize winning author, no best selling novel, no major director.  Just a 90 minute movie of pure, adrenaline pumping fun with Jeremy Renner who makes the film so worth it to watch. Sometimes it is just great to watch a movie which is just meant to entertain and amuse...and H&G:WH does all that.  Yes, one does feel guilty for the shear pleasure, but that makes it even more worthwhile. So, to those who gave this move a one-or-two star all I can say...you either missed the point or you were expecting to see &#34;Gone with the Wind.&#34;
B000KUD2G4|4.0|Does what it says it will do, at a great price. I use it with my keyboard/computer/amplifier rig to get rid of hum.

1608872750|3.0|So much potential....but falls short.<br />Tony Stark the high tech gadget guru yet this book has fallen into the trap of the fake Post - it notes throughout and sometimes over interesting info.  The main reason for me was to see some good quality pics of the suit variations - yet most were quite small with only a couple that you could actually see detail in them.  I would have liked alot more focus on the suits themselves and all the technical data to supprt them instead of bits of loose paper sticking all through the book.  One day they will work outwhat the public wants...

1402210086|5.0|This is all-time FAVORITE Georgette Heyer, though I love so many of her books. I love Freddy most of all, and the subtle romance that you have to pay close attention to. It's so romantic without employing any cheapness at all, unlike modern romances.
B00GTZJLAK|5.0|Very cute movie for the whole family to see.  If your family liked Cars, you will like the spirit of this movie as well.  Great message for all of the children and some fun for the whole family.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|This was an interesting idea and this very long novel started out fine, but it gets bogged down about two- thirds of the way through and I couldn't finish it because it had become boring.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|i'd like to preface this review by saying that if I had read the book first, I probably would have given it one more star. However, I saw the series first, and it is exceptional--and probably skewed what I was expecting out of the book. That's not the book's fault, but it would have had flaws all on its own.<br /><br />&#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; chronicles Piper Kerman's year in a woman's prison in Danbury, Connecticut after she pleads guilty to a drug-related offense that occurred ten years prior, when she was young and looking for adventure and thoughtless of consequences. Even though she was sent to prison, she was deeply lucky, as she admits--she had a supportive family and fiance, a top-notch attorney, and a job waiting for her upon her release.<br /><br />That doesn't take away from her experiences in prison, but I felt overall that the writing was a bit flat and flavorless--it was a dry recounting of anecdotes, rather than an emotional memoir that pulled me into her life. In fact, other than the MCC where she stays a short time, Danbury doesn't come off as seeming that bad--it never really seems like Piper feels afraid, or worried, or anything other than bored and frustrated with petty rules. She details yoga, and parties, and her various friendships with the women in prison with her, and much of it is very interesting--but there are so many characters you don't get a good feel for the personalities or hardships of any of them.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't as put off by her slightly superior attitude, but I will admit that bias is there. It's definitely an interesting read, and I'm glad I read it, but if others asked me to recommend it I can think of memoirs I found a lot more compelling.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Relaxing music while I use every brain cell I have solving TH&Eacute; puzzle.  Sometimes  it just comes to me and other days  I really  need the clues,  even that the clues teaches stratigy
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|At least it did not read like a movie script. The flow was a little slow and it did not grab me and demand to be read.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Enjoy the music so much. Love Hugh and Drew. Must admit it's about worn out. Music and Lyrics is great to relax by.

0385340540|5.0|I always love Grisham books.  They're a fun, quick read.  The plot moves the reader along at a pace that is hard to put down.  He also doesn't have an excessive number of characters to keep track.  Always a good read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham weaves a wonderful tale and the courtroom scenes bounce all over the map. Read it and you will be glad you took the time.
B005LLX582|4.0|This movie notoriously divides movie-lovers. I myself was pleasantly surprised by this movie, the first Malick-movie I saw. Indeed I do have reservations. Two long sequences contrasting and supplementing the main story feel poorly proportioned: too long, and too obvious.<br /><br />It was quite a contrast to me:<br />On one side there is the main story taking place in the fifties, seen from the current-day perspective of the Sean Penn-character; a poetic stream of impressions, well edited (fast, suggestive), with good acting (quite natural), and supposedly superb directing.<br />This surely justifies seeing the whole movie! I think the main story (18 + 80 minutes) is unparallelled.<br />On the other side there is this long evolution-sequence (in the first third of the movie) and the final sequence (the resolution): here the feeling surfaces that scenes are (not off the mark in themselves but) too long, and the suggested happenings/messages are too obvious.<br />Maybe it is because Malick wanted `to make a point' (with the evolution-sequence) and because the final sequences supposedly were very personal and emotional/therapeutic for him, that he lost his otherwise good sense of proportion.<br /><br />The whispered voice-overs did not disturb me; I found it interesting and mostly well-done.<br />Unfortanetely, the music was sometimes really over the top.<br /><br />Themes:<br />mourning, wavering faith, and existential ambivalence about two basic attitudes in life:<br />an attitude of control and self-determination, and an attitude of acceptance and (self)sacrifice.<br />(bringing along with it the subthemes of alienation and love/redemption.)<br /><br />The good and beautiful things in this movie certainly are stronger, to me, than the weaker things are weak.<br />One poster on the internet described it very aptly:<br />This is \\"an interesting film with significant strengths alongside some fairly significant weaknesses.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00ET7EON4|5.0|This is a great album from beginning to end. A little more polished than their earlier albums, but great nonetheless.
B00G722T22|5.0|Great CD.<br />Listen to it all the time.<br />Self titled, unusual for a veteran artist<br />I recommend, must buy it.
B008JFUO36|4.0|An Excellent Story with astounding special effects, especially towards the end. Think: Mission Impossible, but as it would be in the future...

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've always loved Star Trek. This early look at the relationship between Captian Kirk and Spock is delightful.  No serious Star Trek Fan should ignore this book.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this when writing an email or on Facebook and I need a quick reference!  Quite handy and convenient.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|I deleted this game after playing it once. Every other screen was an ad, or request to go on facebook, or something else. It was very irritating. The game itself added nothing new to the match type games. I wouldn't bother to download this one.
0446401307|4.0|As always the Harry Bosch series is a very good read.  In this case I listened to it on CD and the reader does an excellent job.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the unabridged CD was only 5 discs.  That is unusual as 5 generally means abridged.  Connelly told a very good story straight and to the point - no filler.  In this case he investigates a murder of a Dr. that suddenly becomes a homeland security issue as the Dr.'s wife has been tied up and a picture of her in that situation sent to the Dr. with directions for him to get all the radio-active cancer fighting materials locked up in the hospital and deliver it or his wife would be killed.  The Dept of Homeland Security is worried that someone is making a dirty bomb.  They take over Harry's case from that angle but he pursues it as a murder and looks for a murderer rather than the radio active material.  In the end, he solves the case and in the process may be losing his new partner who is not sure Harry is someone they care to work with and also hooks up with a past flame who is an FBI agent.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Well written, great plot, I really enjoyed it. I bought the next two and have read them and just bought the fourth one.

B004ADH1RI|5.0|Perfect 80's movie.  Adventure, comedy, mystery.  Fun.  The end though, I wouldn't have let one eye willy go with that ship of gold!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|The best Bond ever!!  This ties the last 50 years together beautifully!  Judy Densch is a phenomenal actor, love her in everything she does!
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This is Susan's second Christmas album and maintains the standard of the first. It contains mostly songs that her fans will be familiar with, and which are always popular at Christmas time. I love those songs, but because I listen to a lot of Christmas music, I like to see at least something different. The last three tracks cater for that desire, being The Christmas waltz (an old song from the thirties or forties that is rarely recorded these days, although it's not that difficult to find on collections of Christmas oldies), In the bleak midwinter (also not that difficult to find, but not among the most-recorded Christmas songs either) and for the climax, Miracle hymn, which I've never heard before and might be an original song, though I'm not sure if it is.<br /><br />Another feature of the album is Susan's duets with Elvis Presley (on O come all ye faithful) and Johnny Mathis (on When a child is born). Personally, I think they would have sounded better as solo tracks, though they work quite well as they are. The original recordings by the two men are fantastic. There is at least one comparable precedent for Elvis's voice being posthumously overdubbed, in the album Christmas Duets. As I said in my review of that album, I enjoyed it but still preferred the original Elvis recordings, even though I'm a fan of some of the singers who contributed their voices. So it is here - the duets sound great, but duets work better if the two singers are in the studio singing together. Johnny Mathis recorded his parts for \\"When a child is born\\" in America, while Susan recorded her parts in Scotland.<br /><br />Despite my minor quibble over the duets, this is a fine album that should please Susan's fans.
B009A9EYUO|3.0|Vinyl pressing is bad.  Amazing album but the 180gm reissue vinyl I received was full of pops and clicks.  Requested a replacement but I didn't return the first copy until I had a chance to compare it with the new one.  The pops and surface noise was in the exact same places on both albums.  Definitely a problem with the pressing.  Too bad, I really wanted a vinyl copy of the album.  Oh well, maybe the 30th anniversary pressing will be good.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|The TV show is a better fit than the books for me. The humor and character interaction makes the story more entertaining than the book was.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is the best. A kind of despicable me version of temple run. Play this over temple run any day
B00FDX9C9E|4.0|The album Message personnel (1973) has been remastered and yes you can hear that: the instruments, the voice, all sounds better. It's a pity that the gifted Michel Berger wrote just two songs for mrs. Hardy but the coöperation with the late George Moustaki on another two songs also worked well. The second CD gives a remastered version of the powerfull Je suis moi (also by Michel Berger) and three songs translated in English. I think that the English version of Première rencontre is very special. Listen to the orchestration. The five instrumentals, the two songs in German, the duets with Christophe and Michel Berger are curiosities. It's not a masterpiece, like her most recent CD L'Amour fou, but it's good, very good.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|.<br /><br />Although this was hardly a thriller, it was a fascinating trip through several generations of history in the South. Well written and a fun read.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This is one of those games that you need to either spend a lot of money or be extremely patient. I don't mind spending a little time, but I am not really making much progress in the game. If you want a fast game this is probably not the game for you, unless you don't mind spending money on games that is. That said it is a cute game with nice graphics and I do enjoy playing each day.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very fun. My son and I both play and love it. It's challenging and has great grafics. Can't be beat!
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Amazing episode and unlike all the 1 star reviews, $7.99 is nothing when you watch the episode in HD.<br />The episode is longer than all other Doctor Who episodes and is well worth the higher price point.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This is an awesome James Bond movie!  I bought and streamed this movie instantly from Prime Instant Video on my PS3...great quality!
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|As a new artist out there, Lorde has some great selections. It is easy to listen to track after track and find yourself loving each one!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Great action-packed movie.  I never was a huge fan of the other Bourne movies...they were ok, but I didn't love them.  This one is awesome though!
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Awesome for people who love techno, trance, or dance music! Reminds me a bit of Tiesto. Can't wait to see what he has next!
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|Like the way the puzzles increase with progress. And the  investigating gets harder with the progression of the game. Great game even for younger people.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm thinking Veronica Roth doesn't want to have this third book turned into a movie... I mean, what on earth was she thinking when she wrote this? completely dull, boring, and *SPOILER ALERT* killing the protagonist? WTF? I'd give it zero stars but that's imposible, thank you miss Roth, you ruined the entire series for me!
031603973X|4.0|I purchased this to enjoy with my 8.5-year-old daughter, who loves pop-up books, especially those by Robert Sabuda (we own several of his works). Although it is beautifully-made and has some interesting and unique features, I took one star off because not all of the pop-ups open smoothly and some need extra care to be tucked back in - which makes me wonder about its durability. We are very careful with books in my family, but even then, some of these pop-ups may not bear up to repeated reading/browsing.<br /><br />The story itself is contained in five little booklets which also contain interesting information and trivia about Dickens with lots of archival photographs of the period etc. but the font is too tiny to make for comfortable reading and certainly does not hold up to reading with young children, which is a pity because this is a story meant to be read with the young and I almost wish they had come up with an abridged version of the story.<br /><br />The pop-ups are beautiful and engaging - depicting highlights from the story, focusing mainly on Scrooge's encounter with the Spirit of Christmas past, present, and future. The last pop-up is especially striking and had my daughter oohing and aahing in delight. I think this makes a nice addition to anyone's Christmas book collection, but it could have done with some improvements.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Now I can use my tablet as a remote. Still can't figure out how to play movies from my computer without freezing or moving to slowly. The idea is great but would like more selections of things to watch on it. It's cheaper than cable so I am saving money. Sometimes I have to unplug it and restart it more than I would like to. The idea is great but I wish there were more entertainment available besides Youtube, which has great movies but are sometimes blurred. Netflix movies show well, but selection is poor.

B008Y6M3KW|5.0|Dear Movie Appreciators,<br /><br />I've seen THE DARK CRYSTAL several times over the last thirty years or so (wow, am I really that old?) but it has been several years since my last viewing  I pulled out my trusty old VHS copy that had been recorded from HBO in about 1984, hoping to interest my son in something from my childhood, and was amazed at the terrible sound and picture quality - we could only watch about 30 min. or so before giving up - I should have known though.  I guess this is one I had just never taken the time to upgrade - funny to think that people might still be popping in old tapes from the 80's…but it was fun skipping all the technological advances over the years and jumping from 80's home recording right to Amazon HD quality with the flexibility to play the movie across so many devices, including our TV.<br /><br />The movie look great and sounds great in HD.  It's nice to now be able to match the idealized memories in my head with the reality of seeing the movie again 30 years after it came out.<br /><br />After reading Jim Henson's biography I felt like I had a better appreciation for the significance of this film both in the context of its release date, and many years later.  There's a quote from someone in the book saying something about how the movie will likely always have historical importance as it is and always will be the only big budget feature length motion picture where everything we see on the screen is hand made.<br /><br />Henson's biographer (Brian Jay Jones) also explored the theme of Jim Henson often being more concerned with how a movie looked visually than the story and characters, and would build movies beginning with a visual concept rather than with a story.  This proves true in The Dark Crystal, where the story and characters may have some weak spots but the whole movie is still exciting and interesting to look at, even after all this time.<br /><br />I've also been interested to learn that Henson originally had the Skeksis and The Mystics speaking their own language without subtitles, but decided to add English dialogue later after negative reactions in test screenings.  It would be fascinating to see the film as he originally intended, and had Jim Henson lived into the age of the DVD and Blue Ray I'm sure he would have had lots of bonus features to give us.  Nothing extra with this particular version - perhaps other DVD or Blue Ray versions?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Viewereksis and The Mystics speaking their own language without subtitles, but decided to add English dialogue later after negative reactions in test screenings.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's addictive very fun simple controls I can c myself playing it a lot.I'm glad I downloaded it .... good times
B005OZE9SA|2.0|It was OKAY at best until eventually it just stopped working. The audio would cut out and would become distorted and there was a five second delay. The feedback was awful and the price is ridiculous. I'm now looking for a replacement for this product and something far more cost efficient.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Outstanding ! Very informative, objective and without agenda or bias.<br /><br />A must read for any US Senator and Congressman who read from Bible &#34;direct instructions&#34; on what our foreign policy in the 21st Century should be
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My whole family loves to play games and this is just one game of many I have purchased to have fum playing.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|One of my favorite traditional Christmas movies from an era when I was a child.  I like it much better than more recent remakes.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Very good concept - great logic puzzle.  I sometimes find it difficult to tell the uncovered hexagons from the covered ones, but overall really enjoy playing this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thrilling. Exciting. Can't wait to see how it all turns out. Love the strength and courage of this brave girl
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|Immediately bought the not-free version because the number of puzzles is limited in the free version, but well worth the money.  My grandson, who just turned two, loves the puzzles which are loaded on my 10&#34; pad.  He was frustrated the first time he attempted them, but with some help from me he quickly was doing them on his own.  They get progressively harder, which is good.  The vehicles make noise when captured for moving to the puzzle, and there's applause and balloons to pop when the puzzle is complete.  Definitely recommend.  Four stars because the review is for the free version, and it is limited.  Would be five stars otherwise.
0440246016|4.0|Good Jack Reacher story, with the usual twist and turns. You can defiantly see the progression of Child's writing style.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Was not a fan of Will Ferrell movies, but I love this one.  Silly, yes, but fun and heartwarming.  It's part of our annual repertoire of Christmas movies.
0345803507|5.0|All of the books were more than the hype.  There was good story behind the covers and who doesn't love a happily ever after.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The book starts out slow but stick with it. Pretty soon the reader won't be able to put it down.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Pretty fun, but there needs to be a better explanation of how alliances work and how to share weapons. Overall great time waster.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. That's all I can really say about it. Just awesome. Wonderful animation and always gives you something to play for
1476727651|5.0|I pretty much love anything Stephen King has ever written, but I really like it when he brings back previous characters, feels like an old friend.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|I played a few hours, and then quit. When I came back, I had lost the last couple hours of progress.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this game finally became available on my kindle!!! Waited forever!! Had been addicted for almost a year !!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|It is clear how so many movies have become a waste of time--not sure I why I would want to waste my time watching a movie about drugs and prostitutes, so this movie did not last long on my screen.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed the game, the  graphics and story line are great. I didn't have a problem with glitches or freeze frames. I hope there is a sequel.
B00FHATBGW|1.0|does not work, will not let object to move. I think this game only good on pc.will not order hidden objects for table
0764137433|5.0|I highly recommend buying this verb book especially if you are a beginner student of Russian. Even in my 3rd year of college Russian I still find this book useful. I understand how to conjugate verbs without it in most cases but, it is a quick way to look up verbs when I am writing an essay and it is useful for the occasional irregular verb.<br />*If you are serious about learning Russian buy this verb book and Katzner's Russian-English dictionary.<br />Удачи!
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|This review originally appeared at: [...]<br /><br />George: Pixar’s been on a winning streak since Toy Story. Critics and fans alike question how long Pixar can keep cranking out the hits. Monsters’ Inc has always been a favorite in our house, because it’s been the film that seemed to elevate Pixar character animation to the next step. There was a believability and honesty with the characters that we hadn’t seen before. When I first heard about a Monsters prequel, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Would Monsters University live up to the hype?<br /><br />Jeff: Monsters Inc is definitely in my top two Pixar films, so like George, hearing they were making a prequel made me a little uneasy. Prequels are always tricky ground and don’t always turn out well (coughStarWarscough). Though, I was still excited to see it. Unfortunately, Monsters University came out the same time that I moved cross country, so I missed it while it was in theaters.<br /><br />George: (Hangs head in shame.) We missed it in the theaters, too, so I was excited to get the review copy. We watched it the first weekend and I’ve spent the rest of the week watching the extras. I enjoyed the film and thought it was a great Pixar film and a good addition to the Monsters universe. The characters were still incredibly well-defined and even when Pixar brought in more of a stereotype character, it still fit into the film extremely well. I did miss Boo but seeing the development of friendships and rivalries kept the story going and kept us cheering for Mike.<br /><br />Jeff: I really like how the story itself focuses on Mike, from how he initially grew up wanting to be a Scarer, and how his friendship with Sulley formed. I found the film to be extremely charming and it had quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Like George said, it really felt perfect for the Monster’s universe, and it made sense, filling in the blanks before Monsters Inc.<br /><br />George: What’s funny is I didn’t know there were blanks until I saw this film! To me, Pixar really did a great job of using the college experience as a character. Most everyone is going to be able to relate to the film whether they went to college of have seen the many films about college life (Animal House, anyone?). Jeff and I are always concerned about the special features when there’s a blu-ray release. We’ve seen a dearth of special features on recent releases and hoped for the best with Monsters University. We’re both happy to say that there’s good news.<br /><br />Jeff: I have to say, the amount of special features, and the depth that they go, was a pleasant surprise for this disc. I was concerned at first, after viewing the film, and seeing that the only special feature on the disc was audio commentary. It then took me a moment to realize that there was a whole other, second disc, devoted completely to special features. The inner film nerd in me cried out in joy. Every single featurette in the special features was fantastic to watch. My personal favorite was “Campus Life,” a day in the life of making the film.<br /><br />George: Watching Campus Life made me mad! I want breakfast, lunch and dinner provided at my workplace everyday. Of course, most Pixar employees work through their lunch breaks. I did enjoy the features and like Jeff, was a little confused when I noticed the special features weren’t on the main disc. But a whole disc dedicated just to the features is A-OK in my book (but not my Book of the Week). Here’s a list of the special features: Campus Life, Story School, Scare Games, Welcome to MU, Music Appreciation, Scare Tactics, Color and Light, Paths to Pixar – MU Edition, Furry Monsters: A Technical Retrospective, Deleted Scenes, and “The Blue Umbrella”<br /><br />Jeff: Overall, this is definitely a disc worth picking up. I loved the movie, I loved the special features, and I loved everything about it. Your entire family will love this film. Trust us. You won’t be disappointed in it!ire family will love this film. Trust us. You won’t be disappointed in it!
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|bought as a gift, can't wait to give it.  saw the characters from the movie, shipped fast, great gift.  looking for another character from the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game in the world<br />Minecraft is a game ware you build and kill creepers and more stuff there is tnt<br />And diamond and gold and more cool stuff and you can get diamond swords<br />And gold swords and you can go mineing and cut trees and more
B00G32OMF8|2.0|I have watched the entire series now. I liked the first one the most when their lives were full of hope. The woman is absolutely unbearable, especially in this movie. She would suck the life out of anyone and anything. Bleech.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game and always have.  It keeps my mind active and alert.  Card games are one of my favorites.  Thanks!
B006RXQ62U|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have been disapointed in many movie productions of Broadway shows. Too often, the cast is selected for their acting abilities, but their musical talent misses the mark.  I was skeptical of this, but it's actually one of my favorites. This cast can do it all! Try it. You'll be pleasantly surprised!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|No breakthrough stuff here, but if you're a Bond fan you will enjoy this movie.  And you'll likely enjoy it even if  you are not a Bond fan!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Very good movie.  It held my interest all the way through,  Denzel Washington is a great actor.  He can play all types of characters,
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Wonderful!<br />I loved seeing old faces again.  I loved the resolution that was devised for the people of Gallifrey and especially the Curator!  I cried when I saw him!  I've already watched it twice and I'm seeing it tomorrow on the big screen.  Fantastic
1476727651|5.0|cant believe its been over twenty years since the shining. this book is awesome cover to cover. if they make a movie they better not mess it up. verrrrrry scary
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for adults and children alike. Lots of play and challenging game time. Good for hand eye coordination and building prediction skills
B00EQUP3Q6|4.0|Loved most of the tracks on this album, took me back to their more electronic days. This is one of my favorite bands, and I'd reccomend this to any fan.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This is the perfect ending to the series! Loved it! Must read! Only bad part is now the series is over.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it is good to use on your homework but if you hit the wrong number you have to start all over again and it ducks like crap!!!!!!
B001QW8QYS|4.0|Spoiler warning.<br /><br />Pretty good, but some of the morals/religion in it are kind of weird.  As a protestant Christian I wish that the protagonists had been martyred instead of being rescued, to have it be of a more glorious end.  Peter running away from the other martyrs and seeing a vision of Jesus was rather strange and uncharacteristic of the apostle, imo
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|I enjoy this movie it because it was full of humor. it made me laugh so hard I almost fell out on the floor with tears in my eyes. I just had to purchase this movie last night. However that's just my opinion but if you are similar to me you will enjoy ere the millers.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|No enlargement is available for this game. But you can still see the items .  Real fun and enjoyable.  Just give it a try and see for yourself
B0051OZ564|4.0|sucker punch was fun to watch. I had to buy it once I saw amazon had this movie on sale. I enjoy watching these beautiful find women kick ass. It all made since and play out very well however that's just my opinion. Overall it was a great movie.
0525478817|5.0|Might I be wrong to agree with John Green's premise that we all live our lives to be able to make some sort of positive dent in our world, when we die.  I think not.  This story is nothing but a love story, with two teen aged cancer patients being the lovers.  But if one reads carefully and between the lines, one finds a lot about what life is or should be about.  I believe that Hazel and Gus, our main characters, will become like many great characters in literature.  So maybe one day, when their names are mentioned, everyone will know from which book they have come.  I have a hard time saying that I did not cry while reading this book, as I usually cry at most movies and books. This one had more laughs and one gut buster for me than sadness.  I believe that the title of the book may mean more to those of us who have had tragedy in our lives or think that life should be much more than it really is.  QUITE A REMARKABLE STORY.......INDEED.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This game is very fun, but keeps crashing on me with internal errors. Now matter how long you have it, it'll crash.
B00CNGA1PS|4.0|The app is working all right. I don't find it terribly intuitive to use, and the help section could be better.  I am very new to podcasts so it could be partly my inexperience.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Just the thing for waiting in line or in a doctors office. Some new birds/weapons/obstacles. I found Star Wars 1 much harder.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really cool this coming from a 10 year old and it is really really tough to please me. The only things I do not like are how do you earn more minion coins or whatever ,also when you get the residential area everything is happening at one time and it's to hard ,then there is the fact that the battles are way too hard . But, overall the app is pretty AWESOME!!!!!
0316055433|5.0|An absorbing and lyrical tale that never lags in the telling and destined to become a classic.  The characters in this book are deeply complex and the plot is surprising and unpredictable keeping one reading into the wee hours of the morning. I didn't want this 770 page tome to end. Books like this don't come around very often. Highly recommend.
1449320104|5.0|This book is very well written, in a manner it's succinct and a reference pos reading.<br /><br />Any serious C# programmer must have it.<br /><br />Maybe not the only book, but the first 4 chapters can educate a programmer easily in the language basics. Then you can read the book in any order, and that is a HUGE PLUS for a big book.

B00G32QIEG|3.0|The idea was fresh however, Jeff Bridges doing Rip Torn's character from MIB got old. It would have been cool to see him doing something unique.<br />If your going to mimic MIB at least bring a better take on the characters.<br />By the way, I am a huge fan of Jeff Bridges!<br /><br />CA
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I just finished reading it for the second time. Toranaga is one of the greatest characters of all time. I have read the entire saga, and Shogun stands apart from the rest in both content and quality. With that being said, I would recommend them all.

B00190N4E4|5.0|The movie Gandhi deals with a large amount of religious issues. On the surface it seems to be a purely political film about relations between the British and the Indian subcontinent. However, beneath the political tensions, religious tensions emerge. This reveals the dynamic country/subcontinent that is India and which Gandhi tried to reconcile the religious groups into one country. The film begins  with Gandhi getting shot. Contrary to popular belief , Gandi was not shot by a Muslim. He was shot by a Hindu, the  assassin believed that Gandhi  was betraying Hinduism by trying to reconcile Pakistan and India by traveling to Pakistan, and that is the reason he shot Gandhi.<br />In the film, Muslims show great respect towards Gandhi, Jinnah invites and includes Gandhi in all the  discussions about the British leaving India. He greatly respects Gandhi’s views even though he does not always agree with Gandhi. Jinnah tells Gandhi  that he fears Muslims will be misrespresented in India because they are a minority. Wishing  to unite all of India, Gandhi insists that Muslims most hold  high governmental post in all areas of India. This does not go over well with  India’s leader, so he refuses the deal. Fighting in the streets insures  and Gandhi fasts until the fighting has stopped. One of the more touching scenes in the film occurs when a Hindu man who seems crazy comes up to Gandhi who is weak from hunger. The man begs Gandhi to eat because he might be forgiven for his sins. Gandhi ask  the man what was his sin. The man had killed a Muslim child because his own son had died. The man  believes he will go to Hell and that he was already in it . Gandhi told the man that he knows a way out of hell. The man must adopt an orphan Muslim child and raise him as his own. However, the Hindu man must raise  the child as a good Muslim. The Hindu receives the wisdom and departs  to follow Gandhi’s advice.<br />The religious taking from the movie for me that  no matter  what anyonecalls God be it Allah, Buddha, Brahman,Yahweh,God,  we are all children of  him. He loves us all equally and the same, we can all be forgiven by him and we are all equally accountable for our actions.

0385351399|4.0|Imagine joining the most exciting company in the world that has unlimited capital to play with, provides employees with in house gourmet meals, on campus dorms, private concert performances, and was started, of course, by a hoodie wearing college dropout. Dave Eggers calls the sought after company The Circle – a conglomerate of Apple, Facebook, and Google.<br /><br />The protagonist of Eggers’s world is Mae, an only child from the South who left a deadend job with an overbearing manager. Mae is a  conscientious worker and has an adventurous spirit which enjoys the the freedom of detaching from the world and living in the world. This all changes after she is caught on SeeChange – The Circle’s video recording project - stealing a kayak in the nighttime. As reparation, she is volunteered to be the first employee to go Transparent and agree to make her entire life watchable to anyone in the world. In front of over 3,000 circlers, she proclaims in an interview with one of the three Wise Men or top Executives of the Circle:<br />1. SECRETS ARE LIES.<br />2. CARING IS SHARING.<br />3. PRIVACY IS THEFT.<br /><br />The rest of the novel explores the effects of living a transparent life, a direction in which we may already be headed.<br /><br />Eggers questions the future of privacy and ownership of information.<br />Who owns information and knowledge - the creator, the public or the parties involved?<br />As we become a more connected world, have we lost our ability to live in the moment?<br />Which actions are shameful?<br />Assuming people behave better when they are recorded– should we constantly record them? E.g. Speed of a vehicle on a freeway<br />Maybe private companies with market share and user activity should run elections so that more people vote? (E.g. Facebook runs the next US presidential election)<br />As more “dirt” is known about politicians and individuals, it is ever easier to expose them and end their political career. No one will speak outagainst powerful companies because the companies will destroy that person immediately by leaking information. Since users love the company, the company maintains (or gains) power.<br />Did we buy into technology without knowing the impacts?<br />Is there a point of return? Can we still enjoy going dark or would we rather give up (fill in the blank) than our smartphone for a day?<br /><br />Overall, the book is entertaining, well written, and thought provoking. While there is little novelty to Egger’s futuristic vision, he does a fantastic job intertwining near term innovations with pragmatic ramifications raising deep philosophical questions about the balance between privacy, knowledge, and values.<br /><br />The effects of technology make me wonder whether people in the future will be given a second chance. No one is perfect. And, people who want to be a better person, have a different set of friends, or start behaving in a different way need time to actualize their aspirations. Will we be able to accept this new person or will Google search results and dated Facebook pictures preclude us from believing that the individual is capable of change? Can we change despite constantly obsessing over our online brand and the way others perceive us?

B007V65R54|5.0|Silver, Nate The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — but Some Don't<br /><br />There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable.<br />The contingency we have not considered seriously looks strange;<br />what looks strange is thought improbable;<br />what is improbable need not be considered seriously.  --Thomas Schelling (419)<br />Nate Silver’s award winning book The Signal and the Noise enlightens us to our many biases and proposes a way to sift the signal of a trend from the noise created by unmeaningful data. He recommends thinking about prediction and probability in a Bayesian way. Bayes’s theorem of probability and prediction makes us reduce our biases by stating our beliefs upfront. (451) It forces us close the gap “between what we know and what we think we know” (448) However, we must not forget about the unknown unknowns.<br />Political pundits are no better than average at guessing political races, and often receive camera time because of histrionics instead of prediction accuracy. Weathermen have a more challenging fiet. Weatherman must compensate for the wet bias because “people notice one type of mistake-the failure to predict rain-more than another kind, false alarms. If it rains when it isn’t supposed to, they curse the weatherman for ruining their picnic, whereas an unexpectedly sunny day  is taken as serendipitous bonus.” (135) Forecasters must weigh the economic value of each forecast and ask does this “help the public and policy makers to make better decisions?” (134) By factoring economic value into the forecast for the public, the forecast is reduced in accuracy. Forecasting a hurricane warning that will trigger an evacuation is expensive and dangerous. Forecasters have to juggle believability and the economical value of each prediction. “That we can sometimes predict nature’s course, however, does not mean we can alter it. Nor does a forecast do much good if there is no one willing to listen to it. (like in Katrina)” (110)<br />Silver intelligently explains Moody’s oversight in the credit debacle, the herding behavior of mutual fund managers to avoid getting fired which causes market bubbles, the strategies of professional poker players, and the heuristics behind a chess computer program. In regard to baseball GM Billy Beane’s philosophy to “collect as much information as possible, but then be as rigorous and disciplined as possible when analyzing it,” (100) Silver cautions, “but statheads can have their biases too. One of the most pernicious ones is to assume that if something cannot easily be quantified, it does not matter.”(92) Further, if someone confidently presents “an overly specific solution to a general problem” he may be guilty of overfitting his model and omitting data. (163) He reminds us that “Computers are very,very fast at making calculations. Moreover, they can be counted on to calculate faithfully-without getting tired or emotional or changing their mode of analysis in midstream” (289) Humans, however, must decide what we must calculate and identify what cannot calculate.<br />The book is a fun read and a necessity for everyone as the world becomes more datafied.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love the game. It is a lot better than the game on Facebook. I am glad that you. Changed the game. I was bored with the game on Facebook.
044654759X|5.0|Beautiful story; I don't buy books normally as I usually only read them one time. I bought this one because the one I checked out from the library one of my cats chewed the corner and it was either pay them like $40 or buy them a new copy. Well this one was well under $40 so I bought it and gave it to them which in turn I got to keep the one my cat chewed the corner on. Maybe when my daughter gets older she'll read it
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Kinda confusing in the beginning, but pretty damn good book.<br />Recommended to read in a short amount of time, otherwise I think you'd get a little lost.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is an intriguing story, but I did not like the format at the beginning. It took me some time to understand why there seemed to be three different plots. At the end it all came together nicely.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app works great and glad to be able to play it on my kindle. Now, if they would only invite an app to get rid of chocolate &amp; bombs...
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Just beautiful. Feels so much better that the web front-in. Bravo to the ebay team (BTW the Android version feels better than the ipad one!)
B003UYUQZW|5.0|This movie is based on the video game series ''Prince Of Persia'' by Jordan Mechner. I absolutely loved this movie. It's filled with great fight scenes, likable characters, and an interesting story. The action scenes are well done and the film is also well acted. This is a really fun movie and I totally recommend it.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Just an amazing app. Wish it would just stream to my TV like the stock Android video player (that however lacks many, many formats)
B00C6BACF4|5.0|One of the best zombie satires of this decade,  definitely one of their best movies.  One thing I appreciate about this movie is they cut down on the love scenes and kept thw movie going.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|It is kind of a disturbing book and not just from the privacy point of view. The idea of complete immediate feedback about everything you do is overwhelming. I usually take the position that privacy concerns belong to people who are hiding something. But I would not like the constant instant feedback at work, or anywhere else. (And then, today, to read a story in the news about a European worker at Amazon who is monitored this way, I was really freaked.) The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the ease with which I could put it down. I think this was due to a lack of connection to many of the characters, an irony for a book about social networking. Again, though, perhaps it is just pointing out how shallow those relationships are.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a very good game, good graphics and smooth gameplay . No hitches so far. Only been playing it now for one day but like it already.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The book starts off with a rich and detailed narrative, but like many of this authors ends in a rush - as if the author g ot tired of writing. For that one reason I rate it as four stars rather than five.
B003B02O0A|4.0|This was a pretty good book, it even made me laugh a few times. Gonna try another grisham book next.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a wonderful game it is good for kids and adults if i had to choose this or temple i would choose this.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Duhigg does a nice job with the stories he uses to exemplify his point.  It is a little fuzzy on how to change habits.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Have been using this app for a few weeks, no problems at all streaming HD movie encodes from my Windows 7 pc, using Windows media player as the dlna server. Movies are handbrake encoded mp4 files, playback is flawless even at bitrates upward of 6000. The app menus are quick and responsive, and setup was simple. Have not seen any issues with aspect ratio as mentioned in another review, and have watched several movies in different aspect ratios so far. Browsing through shared media on the PC is quick and effortless, and thumbnail view is supported. Will update if I have any issues.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it is fun but it is to adicting<br />it is to slow on the directions<br />it is still fun to play though
B00EBJ624O|4.0|I got this , along with some other cd's for a friend who is a music lover. He says he loves the music, but I'm not so sure his opinion wasn't affected by Yuja Wang's startling good looks and that outfit of hers (!) as much as he piamism.
B0062YADWI|5.0|very lightweight biner.  i actually used the bottle-opener part the other day.  handy to keep on your person all the time.  totally worth $5.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am just amazed at their stories. I just can't seem to stop reading them. I stay up reading much longer than I should since I get up early to go to work. Please don't stop writing them.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It has issues loading.  Didn't get to play much yet as it freezes and blanks out.  Not Game Insight's best effort.
0767919408|5.0|I love his writing style and the subject matter interested me immensely. Great book. One I will loan but keep.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|Great movie!  It is a classic and will always be appreciated for the script, acting and above all the music.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Not as good as some of his earlier works. It was a quick read, nothing too spectacular about the story. It felt as if the model of his stories was one and the same. It was exciting in the first couple books, but now it is all too common. I think that Dan Brown needs to switch the story architecture he uses. It really is starting to feel recycled, this is saying a lot considering I have read all of his books and am really a fan with the exception of the last two.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Simple to play, easy to get lost in.  I have wasted hours playing this silly game, love it!  Would recommend to anyone.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|This should have been included with the headset instead of a $20.00 purchase. Works great for what it does. Buy.
0375704027|5.0|This is the most autobiographical novel Murakami has written. He was determined to write a novel grounded in realism and set out to tell a story about love and loss. Some say it's a coming of age novel and liken it to J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Murakami's storytelling is subtle yet powerful. This alone allows his story to cross national boundaries and linguistic differences.<br /><br />I am teaching through this novel for the first time in a first year composition course, and my students are responding really well. A handful of students finished it in the first few days it was assigned. The discussion is filled with passion and curiosity and many have developed alliances for the two female characters in a sort of &#34;Team Naoku&#34; vs. &#34;Team Midori&#34; kind of way. I have begun each discussion by listening to the Beatle's song, &#34;Norwegian Wood.&#34; Also, there is a movie available on Netflix and Amazon Prime for readers interested in seeing Murakami's novel portrayed on the screen. I intend to show it in class once we finish reading it.<br /><br />I will always be partial to the more fantastical elements of Murakami's storytelling, but most readers who already appreciate Murakami will appreciate this novel. There are some sexually explicit passages, however, they are discussed with some objective distance and not designed to overwhelm the story. I prefer Jay Rubin's translation to Alfred Birnbaum's and consequently do not recommend the audio version of the novel. The reader overacts and detracts from the subtlety of the prose.
0064430227|5.0|My 40 year old son asked me to order this for his little daughter.  I really think it was for HIM but he's not talking!  He loved it a LOT as a child and now she's loving it too.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good book, not as good as &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; though. Cool to see the other books tied in to this one. The ending was predictable from about halfway through the book, so that took some excitement away.
B000W74EQC|5.0|Again, it's Harry Potter!  That right there is all I need to know to love the movie!  But all that aside it is still a great movie!  As they all were!  This has Richard Harris, the original professor, and the kids are sooo young and sweet as this is their first movie and they're not even teenagers yet!  You'll love it!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Great premise for this story but I felt the writing wasn't up to par with the rest of Brandon Sanderson's works. I felt like the futuristic/dystopian elements of the story were the weakest points for me. Still, the story overall was so interesting and so much fun that I finished the whole book in one sitting.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This movie scared me to death with I was 8 years old--more years than you need to know about!  And it's still a great scare for the younger set, and keeps the older set still on the edge of their seats!  This was the first time Robbie the Robot was featured in a movie--later to show up on Lost in Space (TV series in the 60's).  I LOVE this movie.  It's going to be a part of my DVD library for the rest of my life!  And Anne Francis is &#34;OH WOW!&#34; no matter what gender you are!  And those of you who loved Leslie Nielson as the white haired hilarious cop, you'll be amazed at how incredibly handsome--AND SERIOUS--he was in this film!  Lots of little know actors at the time this movie was made, who later became mega stars!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is just SO good! She sings in such a compelling way and I keep listening to it over and over..
0060254920|5.0|My son loved this as a child and wanted his daughter to share in the joy he felt reading it when he was her age.  Good call on his part.  She loves it--especially when daddy reads it to her.  Or else he's reading it for himself and just letting her listen!  Not sure which!  Point is, it's still bringing a lot of joy and the book was in awesome condition when they got it--and they got it within a very few days!
B009G41CG2|1.0|Orange and red flashing adds in the corner are very annoying.  May have caused a health issue.  Tiles very hard to see. Deleted it off my device.
B000W796OM|5.0|I LOVE IT, OF COURSE!  What's not to love about Harry Potter, for Pete's sake!  It was a bit hard when I first saw this movie to see how the kids had grown between the previous movie and this movie.  Made me feel a bit old!  LOL  But awesome movie.  I'll be a die hard Harry Potter fan forever--and I'm in my 60's!  LOL
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a set it and forget it alarm...you wake to a beautiful sound...has never failed. Also very easy to program.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great tear jerker.  Shows some people have SO much heart.  These people had the money to do what they did for this kid, but that wasn't what counted and he knew it.  You get to meet the real NFL star and the real family at the end of the movie.  You don't have to have money to have heart.  And Sandra Bullock is incredible in this movie.  Tim McGraw is great too--but I didn't recognize him at first without his cowboy hat!  LOL
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great movie.  Lots of action and scenes.  Better on large screen but on a large screen TV it is almost the same in the comfort of your home.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I LOVED IT. THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK.  TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ENDURE WHEN DEALING WITH A FORIEGN COUNTY LIKE INDIA TO ADOPT A CHILD AND TO READ ABOUT THE LIFE THEY LIVE.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good to see him return to form after several duds the past few years.  A satisfying ending makes this worthwhile.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! Not what you expect from Jim Carrey, but shows he is a great actor as well as a crazy comedian. This rates just below &#34;It's a Wonderful Life.&#34; I gave this away for all my friends who don't care for Carrey in most of his movies!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it was very slow for installing and I haven't been able to play it yet so I am very disapointed
0385523394|2.0|I haven't seen the hit tv show, but if it was totally based on this book it would be a very boring show.  I don't think there is enough of interest here to write a book about.  Disappointing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is my favorite book of the year. Based in history and the present day, the stories of the two main characters twine together to create an unlikely friendship. And it piqued my curiosity - I'll be reading more about the orphan trains, a real blot in the history of child welfare in America.
B00008YNHD|1.0|An older movie that some may consider an 'art' film.  My friend felt that way about it and that's who it was for.  I think it was silly and dated.  This is a special European version that isn't compatable with U.S. DVD players, and I don't believe it's available in a U.S. version.  Maybe that's for the best.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great narrator! Incredibly sad, but beautifully written. Highly recommend this book for adults and teens who gave prior knowledge of Nazi Germany.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Well written and entertaining.  I like fantasy that is written for an educated audience, and this one is almost there.  I like the inside scoop on what is like to be a musician (Lute player).  You can tell Rothfuss plays...something.  Not quite as good as Sanderson's &#34;Mistborn&#34; books, but up there.
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|Truth be told, the least I expected from [[ASIN:B009D0LBRO one of my favorite mobile games ever]] was a sequel. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best apps there is, but I never felt like it was necessary to do another, and I wasn't quite sure on how Ubisoft would top it. WELP. THIS is how.<br /><br />Rayman Fiesta Run is built from the same touch-based platform gameplay that was molded from the winning formula that made [[ASIN:B0050SVFB0 Rayman Origins]] such a blast to play! This time, there are multiple colorful food-themed worlds lined up on a map for you to pick from, but the core play is, well, the same as before - Just as fun!<br /><br />There isn't really that much I have to say about the app, but I would like to mention the Invaded (a la [[ASIN:B008AU4YEA Rayman Legends]]) levels that you unlock by collecting all 4 Teensies (As you collect lums, you can earn up to 4 Teensies in each level) in the respective levels. They are more-or-less intense versions of the levels you've mastered to unlock them, but of course, provide a higher challenge.<br /><br />You know, it's quite a debate as to what franchise does the App Store best, whether it be something like [[ASIN:B004SJ3BCI Angry Birds]], [[ASIN:B0058VW36U Cut the Rope]], [[ASIN:B00FAPF5U0 Candy Crush]], etc. I believe the real winner here is Rayman!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I like the actors even if the plot line is implausible. The characters have depth and and so far appear their behaviors appear to stay true to their personalities.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a truly amazing book for me. I am a goal oriented person and since I understand and know which love language my wife speaks, I have kept her happy in our marriage, which in return makes my marriage a happy marriage.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Such a cute movie with a wonderful message for both kids and adults! As a teacher, this was a wonderful movie to show my 3rd graders!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is an easy-to-find color at my house. The case is so handy for reading with my Kindle--don't know what I'd do without it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|You totally need to get this I have had it for 3 and a half minutes and I love it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great read, keeping me up at night in the best possible way.  The story grabbed me and took me to the Overlook Hotel and back.
B00EI4V3X2|2.0|These are great for the PS3 and PC, not sure much for the PS4 though. I found with the PS4, you have to use a chat cable from the controller to the headset. There is functional mute button or chat volume controls since the buttons on the headset are only for the bluetooth connection, which the PS4 currently doesn't allow this headset to connect with. So if you are getting this headset for PS3 or PC, I highly recommend it. If for a PS4, stay the hell away and wait for something better to come out, something that will support PS4's bluetooth.<br /><br />Sound quality is great, but I wish there was a way to force 5ghz frequency instead of letting the box automatically setting it. They feel comfortable for long periods of time and battery life is great. Although I wish this would of came with a headset stand like how the X41's had. I have already returned this headset since I have a PS4 and I feel like this headset is not ready for PS4. (No chat volume control, no mute option, chat cable required for chat to work).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I 'm a fan of Scramble and Mah Jong but this game is my new favorite. Many levels to play and just enough<br /> challenge.
0062107313|2.0|I loved \\"The Kitchen God's Wife\\". I really wanted to love this new novel too. Parts of the novel were spellbinding, especially the instruction Magic Gourd gives to Violet. But the rest of the novel is disjointed and amateurish. The novel at times reads like a rough draft~ Characters thoughts and histories are \\"announced\\" by their name in bold type at the beginning of a paragraph. Also at times the character's actions and thoughts grossly contradict their natures. It's as if someone new has materialized. And the history of Violet's mother and father comes too late for us to even care.<br />At 60% on my kindle I started speed reading and skimming~ I was really annoyed with the novel. At 80% I gave up.<br />It's too bad Ms. Tan did not have a better editor~This could have really been amazing!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After so many years I've read the last book of the Wheel of Time series. Quite an accomplishment. What a great time for you to start reading it. You won't have to wait for the next volume to come out. In fact you can get them on your Kindle. Mine take up a large section of one of my book cases. An awesome series. I recommend it to every one of you that love to read fantasy and even to those who just love to read. It creates a whole new world populated with heroes and adventurers, magic and villains. I worried when Robert Jordan died, so many loose ends. But when Brandon Sanderson stepped in the transition was seamless. A wise decision by Robert Jordan's family. Thank you.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|It says what it does and does what it says. Given that it is an Apple accessory and, for the most part, is only usable on Apple products, it is, of course, priced about twice what it should be, but, that aside, it does a very good job. It's well made (of course) and provides gigabit speeds. If you can handle the slowness of 100 Mbps as opposed to 1000Mbps, there are far cheaper USB-to-Ethernet adapters.
B0067TQQI8|1.0|I understand that portable chargers do not charge to their full rated capacity due to efficiency, but I think this companies ratings for this external/portable charger are quite inaccurate.  The 2A port seems to charge way slower than 2A.  I am not sure if it even charges at 1A.  If I have my phone plugged in to the charger's 2A port and I use it at the same time, the percentage of battery on my phone still drains.  It does not even charge at a rate fast enough to charge while using.  Also, the 8400mAh will fully charge my Samsung Galaxy S4, which I believe has a 2600 mAh battery, about 1 1/2 times.  And using 2 charging ports at once is mind blowingly slow.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a story that is history, love, hatred, sacrifice, generosity, pain, and a little humor all thrown together onto a soup of deep EMOTION. Highly recommended.
B00EP22QKG|4.0|Joan jett is a True artist. She penned most of the songs as well as performed them  The album is a very well done collection of introspective songs. More please
0763660531|2.0|There are no words in this book. It is literally just a picture book. Very silly concept to me for the targeted age group.  I was looking for a beautiful book for my daughter to practice her reading.  Sending this back.
B0000714BP|5.0|This comedy deserves its cult status  It examines issues that are central to American culture and provides insight into an alternate life style
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't put it down! Just when I think I'm frustrated and done,  I end up playing more. This game is awesome even if you're like me and refuse to pay for more lives or boosters.
B0065GC0BA|3.0|Very interesting only if you are in that position can you really understand where someone is coming from,it was his life
B00005Q45W|4.0|Cohen has always been a bit of a slow mover, and this album is no different. &#34;In my Secret Life&#34;, &#34;Love Itself&#34;, and &#34;The Land of Plenty&#34; are worth repeated listens - and the rest sort of slowly moves over you.
B00000J2SP|5.0|Finishing up my Rainbow remasters collection- all of them are awesome, brings back memories. Solid rock-n-roll still to this day.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|No one is buying this without first hearing SOAD, and Serj cannot quite live up to that music...However, &#34;Empty Walls&#34;, &#34;The Unthinking Majority&#34;, &#34;Feed Us&#34;, and &#34;Sky is Over&#34; are all recommended
0765322889|1.0|I really tried ot like these books.  Too many story lines, WAY too many characters.  My small brain cant keep up.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved this!  This was even better than the first series.  I am really sorry it is over!  Can't wait to see the next season.
0316187208|5.0|My favorite author.  It's almost as well written as game of thrones, BUT Joe gives you what you want when you want it.  I am sick and tired of waiting for those dragons to do something...  So the story is far superior in that regard.  Plus he bangs out the books like nobody's business....
B00ESF2772|5.0|This is my favorite Dr. Seuss book. It's a blast to read aloud. I'm pretty sure I enjoy it more than my son, who loves it immensely.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|John Green's master use of words is evident in this book. His ability to create not just well rounded main characters but full bodied alive side characters is why I love him so much. Paper Towns has no paper people in it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A very good read. This is a very different book from the Shining. King is a more mature author with greater control over his craft. What he has lost in raw energy, he more than makes up for with a mastery of honed over decades of solid writing and reading. I highly recommend this novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|such a mind teaser... makes your brain work in many ways : memory, logic, problem solving. challenging and fun. needs lots more levels.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is great for saving the YouTube videos I want to watch later in full HD. It's updated frequently &amp; is the only one I've found to actually work. Keep up the great work dev.<br />(Issue on my Note 2 though, lately it hasn't wanted to allowed me to download anything higher than 360p I'd say about 95% of the time, even after I've cleared the cache &amp; even restarted my phone)
1401937268|5.0|Beautiful artwork and a perfect alternative to traditional Tarot Cards.  I love the uplifting and positive messages that resonate more with me than those on the traditional Tarot cards. Well done!
0345525558|5.0|This was absolutely wonderful.  Enjoyed every minute of reading this.  Opens your eyes to what our society needs ot focus on fixing!
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Fantastic story, extremely well done. Great to see Matt Smith and David Tennant together, and Billie Piper again. The story,was wonderful, classic Dr. Who. Could have turned so bad at several points, but instead it was a solid bit of story telling. And, it fleshed out a good bit of the Doctor's back story and the Time Wars (and the fate of Gallifrey). And, now we know the Doctor's next big adventure - great set up for the Christmas special (and the introduction of Peter Capaldi as the next Doctor)? The real treat for me came at the end with the cameo by Tom Baker, who was the Doctor I most fondly remember watching as a kid. All around a great 50th anniversary.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|The Mule rules, even the new school stuff is tight and goes from hard rock to reggae and back again.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating dungeon hunter games I've played. I just can't stop playing it. I even play in my sleep sometimes I can't stop lol.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It seems that this book is one that people either love or hate - and I loved it.  An eye opener into animal and human behaviour and with an extremely unusual plot, the story is beautifully written and intriguing.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|I watched this movie expecting to be entertained. Robert Redford and Paul Newman's depiction of the story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a classic. Did I expect Blackthorn to live up to the epic silver screen performance? No. However, Sam Shepherd does and excellent job in the leading role of this film. Watch it, not expecting a blockbuster film of epic proportions but instead to be simply entertained and you will not be disappointed. If you are a fan of western drama you will enjoy yourself. This film is not even in the same realm as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but if you go in knowing that, and are willing to view it with an open mind, you will not be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Difficult series to read at times because unfortunately it feels like something humans would do. She has written it well and with an ending full of hope.
B00F522C7C|4.0|This movie is cute.  The story line is just like Cars and the kids really enjoyed the characters.  HOWEVER, there are two separate scenes close to the end that scared my kids.. one involves Dusty and some very rough ocean waters (not a good mix for a plane) and the other is basically a WAR scene with fire bursting from planes, planes shooting at each other and planes falling to the ground yelling MAYDAY.  (4 year old.. Is that going to happen when Daddy flies in a plane?  Why are the planes falling from the sky?  What is that fire from?)  I don't know why Disney couldn't have found a less scary way to tell this part of the story.  Anyways, if you have small kids you should watch it first to see if you think they can handle it or if you need to &#34;accidentally&#34; fast forward through these two scenes when they are watching it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I thought this game was really fun.  I had a lot of fun solving all of the mystery puzzles.<br />I can't wait. For the sequel to come out.  I was wondering when the sequel release date is.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Too short for me. This novel could take almost 3 hrs in the cinema.<br />Well the same feelings i had about LOTRs :)<br />Looking ahead for Speakers for death :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't say anything that you won't find all over the Internet about this.  It works great for the money!  The only current drawback is that Chrome for Android doesn't support tab casting yet.  I hope they hurry up and fix that!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|I love Il Volo.  There are no young singers today that even compare to these young men.  What voices.  God has blessed them with talent and how handsome the three of them are.  Love them.  The Christmas album is beautiful.  I have all the albums.  Hope they make many more.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Having seen the movie I thought I would be bored by the book but I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading the next book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Gr8 app to keep the kids busy. love the fact that the minions are the main focus of the app.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so much better that the first,second,third,and whatever I don't know how many there is but it is really fun!
B00005KB9T|2.0|I love the music, however, when I received the CD it was scratched and skips in a certain spot.  I told the shipper and he told me to use a different player.  The CD was supposed to be new.
0375842209|5.0|I found this to be a profound and haunting book. With death as a narrator, it told the story of a young girl in WWII Germany.  It emphasized the impact of words, both from the girl's perspective (positive) and Hitler's (negative).  I have always loved words, and the power they hold in shaping thoughts, opening new horizons and impacting the lives of others.  This book used words in a way that is rarely done.<br /><br />I have seen the movie preview for this, and the story looked intriguing.  I quickly went to buy the book so that I could read it before seeing the movie.  I was a bit unnerved that the book was in the adolescent section.  However, it is one book that easily crosses any age barrier.  I will encourage my children to read it in future years, and I will send it to my 65+ aged parents to read as well.<br /><br />Be forewarned, it does have some Kleenix moments.  I am sure the movie will as well.  And, I apologize now for to those around me when I watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absulutely love this game its amazing you get to take care of a horse that looks real. I have a lot of fun with my horse!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Alex Denisof is the perfect Benedict.  His comedic timing is perfect and the chemistry between him and Amy Acker is wonderful.  Sean Maher's Don John is a huge change from Simon Tam, he had me completely convinced he was a &#34;bad guy gangster&#34; type.  The prose may take some getting used to, but you quickly adapt to it.<br />Loved it!  Would like to see Joss Whedon take on 12th Night.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game,but to bad they don't give you more hints . I recommend this for all ages .
B003IDMUJA|4.0|A realistic view into lives and struggles of rural people in Africa, if not the world. An inspiring story of beating the odds and never giving up
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I am planning to read the whole series!<br /><br />I red this ebook on my android tablet with the Kindle app and I had no problems viewing it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Always loved matching games. Wish it has other perks besides the fireball but still enjoy playing it. Hope more of my friends start playing it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game but it needs a few tweaks. The chocolate is allowed to grow even when the player can't move. And there should be a 15 minute wait to replenish a life instead of 30.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|love it-quick receipt-good condition. love Dexter and I needed this season as I don't get on tv i buy the dvd
B003VANOFY|5.0|Really like the headphones. Needed to adjust the bass level though, otherwise very good ! comfortable, light weight and non intrusive to wear.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Awesome!  I like these two together and hoping to see them again in future Dragon Tattoo films.  Also an unbearably tense scene of a sexual nature that had to be fast forward through.  All together it’s a tight, amazing movie that leaves the viewer wowed.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|There are many \\"based\\" on true story books. This IS a true story and it a riveting. I hope the movie does it right.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I thrive on this kind of fiction. A world I recognise, myth and history that's familiar, magic and creatures I know are all weaved into a plot that can focus on being fun and interesting. The writing is excellent, with enough new elements to keep a \\"magical hero vs The Bad Guy\\" from going stale.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Interesting novel, with the three codas.  It is mostly dialog with little character description.  If you watched Star Trek the original series it is worth the read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|so simple but so fun I got the free version and that is even 5 stars so hey if you are not positive about it then get the free version its fun&hellip;&hellip;and FREE.
0142421715|5.0|Crossed is a great dystopian literature book. Dystopian literature appeals to anyone who likes books such as the Tunnels series, the Hunger Games trilogy and any other book with futuristic qualities that has a society placed in the future. I like this book because it shows how everyone is different in their own way. This is a really independent book, taking a lot of twists since it's predecessor, Matched. The term \\"survival of the fittest\\" exclusively applies here because if anyone's the fittest, I would choose Cassia. Cassia is a well behaved young girl, yet she learns to be independent from her Society. This is not only a thriller, but also it's a romance. Cassia falls in love with Xander, but as Ky's face flashed on the screen, she begins to question the perfection of the Society itself. Later she learns that it was a setup and the Official made it that way to test her loyalty to the Society. This is my favorite book ever. (My opinion probably will change as I read the next book.)
B001NT057K|4.0|Most songs are pretty good.  Was easy to download and like the idea it is in my cloud and i can listen anytime.
1419707299|5.0|Both my daughters love the Diary of a Whipy Kid series.  My 8 year old hates to read but she loves these books.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I love playing this game! It's a really fun challenge ~ Adults and Kids can enjoy this together. A great way to relax and enjoy one of the many<br />Game Apps kindle has to offer!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I use this in teaching ESL to adults.  It arrived in perfect condition and my students love it.  They get vocabulary and accents not possible from the textbooks from both the spoken dialogue and the songs--the melodies of which will keep that vocabulary and grammar in their heads for life.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I cannot believe this app is free! I have bought other Spanish language apps and programs that were not this good. I have done several lessons and enjoy how the program tests your ability to truly learn and understand the material by requiring you to translate from English to Spanish and vice versatile using several different methods. It is excellent!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Excellent quality.  Great price.  I use it in class to teach English to foreign adults giving them accents and vocabulary they don't locally or in the textbooks, etc.  I also watch several times a year myself at home.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have a white iPhone4, which was issues by my company. I love that this product offer protection while showing the look of my iPhone. I love the see-through so the white color of my iPhone and the Apple logo are showing. It's very affordable and comes with the screen protection, too!
0312588887|5.0|I read so many books which are forgotten in a few years.  No one can EVER forget this book!  It made an impression on me that has lasted almost my entire adult life!
B007CKX8GY|5.0|Great book, moving, inspiring.  A window into some interesting history for those who have family members who came from Ireland.
B00DONF9SS|3.0|I'm a little disappointed. Mercury was always my favorite inner senshi so I had high hopes. I didn't really think the hair comments were accurate, because it kind of looked like maybe her head was just bent down. Not true. It's definitely longer than all the images suggest. Also, the paint job is nowhere near as good as Sailor Moon's was. There are some dark flecks on the white of the torso. About 3 stars in general on the paint job, ALTHOUGH the cuffs on the gloves get 0 stars! The cuff on the left arm is a very noticeably different shade of blue than the cuff on the right arm. Thanks a heap, colorblind manufacturers.
B00DVKXZBM|5.0|A classic that will be loved by generations to come. Star trek! Star Trek!  Star trek! Star Trek!  Star trek! Star Trek!
0399157573|2.0|Every time I read a Scarpetta novel I claim I'll never read another. I can barely tolerate Cornwell's smug prose. Yet I buy each one...
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm so disappointed. I can't believe I invested this much of my life into a book that ended this way... Feels like a bad dream :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Very addictive, can't stop playing it and want to go to the next level. Hurry and give updates.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game immensely and can't wait for more! It kept me busy while waiting to board a flight and while in the air.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was an intriguing holiday read.  None of the characters are very likeable which is a nice change.  While it slows a little in the middle - stick with it!
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|Love the movie! So glad my son can watch on the Ipad anytime he wants to with the digital download!!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|While I enjoyed earlier books from this author - I found this dragged a little - I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing did!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Love the actors, writing and look of this show - don't miss it!<br />One note, though, the DVDs contain directors commentary on the first episode only -- the commentary was very entertaining, hoping that season 2 DVDs will have commentary for each episode.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|AWSOME GRAPHICS! I'm addicticted. Very realistic. Play for hours, love all the great locations, and all the different prey I can hunt. Great app. Highly recommended! I have it on all of my devices.
006202406X|4.0|This is a fantastic book.  It's not the fairy tale, tied up with a nice bow ending we're maybe used to getting (ahem, Twilight) but it makes sense.  I found this to be much better than the second book in the series.  Yes, the end was definitely not what I wanted, but it was certainly appropriate.  A fine conclusion.
B00FJSSK1O|5.0|Ten years after their first concert, Epica had gathered in Eindhoven for a single date on march, 23, 2013, a sonic extravaganza serving both as a best of and a crowning of sorts for the leading band of symphonic metal. This 2DVD/3CD pack serves as a memento of the event and it is no standard rock DVD. The multiplicity of cameras, lights, musicians, mikes and collaborators would be expected from a much bigger band, something like U2's [[ASIN:B003ELOQD4 360° at the Rose Bowl]]. While very successful, Epica is still in a niche market but manages to look and sound like a monster band.<br /><br />For ten years, Epica has served their recipe of bombastic metal characterized by a now classic Beauty and the Beast approach to vocals -although Simone Simons' vocals usually set tone- and a cinematic blend of classical orchestrations and metal band. Neither were a first. In the interviews accompanying the concert, Mark Jansen, the band's co-founder, gives a heads up to the pioneering work of The Gathering as a seminal symph metal influence. As for the orchestral sound, one might say that where Nightwish veers towards Andrew Lloyd Weber, Epica is fonder of Hans Zimmer. After ten years, they have convincingly created their own sound.<br /><br />The concert, like the DVD production, is almost flawless. Almost, because there is certainly some overproduction, particularly in the lighting department, that almost detracts from seeing the band at times but Epica would not be the first band to fall into this minor trap. It is up to you to decide how much of a flaw this is, since it is after all a movie even if it is a concert first.<br /><br />As it is a trip down memory lane, we are treated to oldies like Cry for The Moon from their first album but also from their original demo when they were still called Sahara Dust, all the way to Serenade of Self-Destruction, the closing track of their latest studio album, [[ASIN:B007918P1E Requiem For The Indifferent]]. In order to go the distance, and despite almost three hours, choices had to be made. Hence we are treated to Design Your Universe but not Kingdom of Heaven (except in an instrumental medley), Delirium but not Tides of Time and so on. As bonuses, one original song, aptly named Retrospect, and Twin Flames, a North American Bonus track from RftI.<br /><br />A nostalgic aspect of the concert is the return of original band members Yves Huts, Jeroen Simons and Ad Sluijter for Quietus, from [[ASIN:B000B5XSTO Consign to Oblivion]]. And a guest tour of Floor Jansen for two songs (one classic Pergolese Duo and Sancta Terra). Floor is the new lead singer of Nightwish and also the front of her own band, ReVamp, but she was of course the singer of After Forever, another legendary dutch band, now defunct, where Mark Jansen officiated before leaving to found Epica. Missing, perhaps, are Amanda Sommerville who covered vocally for Simons in 2008 when she was dealing with complications from MRSA, and Oliver Palotai, Simons' significant other -and Kamelot keyboardist-who covered for Coen Janssen in 2010. But it's a pretty good reunion anyway. Even more so when one considers that Epica is backed here by the Remenyi Ede Chamber Orchestra and the Choir of Miskolc National Theatre, two ensembles that had already backed them for 2009's [[ASIN:B00274BPQU The Classical Conspiracy]].<br /><br />It is a challenge to do symphonic metal live. The female singer, usually a lyric soprano of sorts -although Simons' casts herself more as a mezzo, probably because of the rich control of her mid range- has to perform surrounded by pounding drums and brutal riffs. As a consequences, she is not always heard at her best. Simons has been known to be pitchy in concert and even Tarja Turunen, every singer's North Star in the field, seemed perplexed at times in Nightwish's now classic DVD concert, [[ASIN:B00284G2IA Nightwish: End of an Era ]]. As for the male singers, grunts being not that natural a production of the voice box, they risk sounding punier and murkier live than in studio or risk their voices forcing them. Not easy. If one adds that symphonic metal relies on ringing orchestrations that sound a little plasticky when they come only from a keyboard, it is easy to understand the challenge.<br /><br />With Retrospect, everything falls in place. Voices are in place, sound is well balanced, orchestra and choir soar with the band with thrilling effect,  as in Serenade of Self Destruction, Design Your Universe, or a few alternative intros (Unleashed). The band, polished by near incessant touring over the last few years, is tight and playful, even though Epica is not particularly focused on showmanship. After Retrospect, Epica has continued touring and is preparing their next album but one feels that a page has turned. Simone Simons had her first child in october which might change her love for non-stop touring. And even though Epica's last album was almost as formidable as [[ASIN:B002RCEBBI Design Your Universe]], one has a sense that is was just more of the same, with the risk of turning in circle. Epica has done so well for ten years that the bar has been set quite high.<br /><br />All in all, there is joyfulness that comes out of this milestone DVD/CD, the joy of a band in full force. One might compare it to Within Temptation's [[ASIN:B001CTUI8M Black Symphony]] from 2008. It does not have the bittersweet taste of Nightwish's End of an Era of even more of [[ASIN:B004VBGAOE Last Curtain Call]], Theatre of Tragedy's poignant farewell from 2011. But it was a hell of a concert.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game,I play almost every day!Most of the time my sisters ask me to play on it.I doubt that if you buy this game you will hate it!So...I hope you enjoy it!
B0058W74UY|1.0|This app doesn't work with Kindle HDX devices.  In fact, the app store does not offer an Adobe Flash Player, they offer some Adobe stuff but not Adobe Flash for Kindle HDX even though the search tool indicates it is available.
B00F35BV64|3.0|yeah, yeah. another trek movie. It was Ok but not great. I guess they feel they can rework old star trek scripts into movies and no one will know.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is soooooo fun! Great for long car trips or plane rides! can be a little slow but still is super awesome! totally worth getting
B0096HL33G|3.0|Acting was good, just slow moving story. The ending left much unresolved. I think it was supposed to have been a love story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked seamlessly after an easy set up. Works great with youtube and netflix.  Hope to see some more services added.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|was a good Drama movie. Teaches of love that we all should have for each other, a love for the unlovable. Good storyline, some violence, but overall a good movie. More for adults...
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was a great movie with an unexpected twist at the end! It's a love story with a mystery, what better combination.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Please, great movie!!!  Must have in the Library.  I wonder how many more words I need to type now..<br />wow
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan has such a captivating voice that every song sounds wonderful.  I enjoy her old-time songs sung in a way that singers of my day sang.

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I have this app on my phone and on my kindle . When I get it out to play all my friends come and ask if they can play. I love this game. I'm so hooked on. I'm so happy that that made this game for my kindle . - Truly yours -Sarah m
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It is a cute game to play but I think you should be able to buy crowns with your coins.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Very good I really enjoy this game fun for me and the kids so awesome I can't stop playing it
B003YOEXUM|5.0|Such a heavy return for Accept! Yea, it's no UDO, but it's still very good, heavy metal. This is the first  &#34;new&#34; album in along time to not loose my interest part way through. Each song has its own thing going for it & Mark sure does deliver with the vocals... If you liked Accept back in 80's & 90's pick this one up & you won't be let down.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is the full version and if you aren't convinced, buy the free version.  After your child plays that, they will be hooked and you will ultimately buy this one.  They work with their letters to learn their alphabet.  Along the way they, it will help with their reading.  Saying A is for apple, or whatever and have the child learn different words that way.  I am definitely into 22 Learn and your child will thank you!
B0000A5A0T|5.0|Why would anyone want to read my opinion of one of the greatest jazz albums of all time?  Can't I just give it five stars and be done with it?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this story! It's the first Adult Romance I've read, believe it or not and it didn't disappoint. The author did and excellent job. The story sucked me in so much I was even reading while watching TV :P I was disappointed with the ending, but I think that had more to do with being disappointed that it ended at all. I guess I just wasn't ready for it to be over so quickly! This would make an excellent movie and I hope to see it in theater some day!

Together with Wheat Belly, which I have not read but read reviews, this book has convinced me to cut out gluten.  With such a variety of gluten-free products now in grocery stores, following Grain Brain is not a problem at all.

B00EE3FVSU|2.0|Broadchurch is an interesting series that we had started watching on BBCAmerica TV, but the thick accents were annoyingly unintelligible.  We signed-up for streaming version in hopes that we would have access to english subtitles.  NO LUCK.  We'll wait until it becomes available on DVDs.  We have watched other programs streamed by Netflix and could access subtitles.

0131103628|5.0|A really good basic C Programming Book.<br /><br />The book informs the reader of just the basics of C Programming, and is very \\"cut and dry\\".  However, the book doesn't clearly explain Pointers (confusing), structs (lacks common implementations), typedefs (not elaborated well) and union (lacks common implementations) data types.  Recently, \\"Understanding and Using C Pointers; by Richard Reese\\" seems to have been written to fill this missing gap.  If you're a previous Assembly programmer, you might want to for go the further explanations, additional book reading, and just skim through the book.<br /><br />Be advised!  The Informit books sold on the Informit website are extremely overpriced!  I'd encourage users to buy the hard copy on Amazon.com, and the hard books is fairly inexpensive.  As you can see, the EBook version (ie. $30 MOBI/Kindle version) is also extremely overpriced in comparison to other EBook versions of books, and likely overpriced due to licensing of the original Informit digital version likely used to produce the MOBI/Kindle digital version.  From my experience with other book publishers, Informit's books are not well appraised or priced according to their educational value provided.  And as such, I tend to avoid all other Informit books, except this book.  (Likely Amazon.com is providing the MOBI/Kindle digital version based solely on this book's popularity amongst C Programmers, even though it is extremely overpriced.)<br /><br />I'm a big fan of O'Reilly books, and sometimes I think O'Reilly gives away some of the best books ever published by O'Reilly.  But as they say, nothing beats giving the gift of learning to somebody less fortunate!  If you do buy this book, be sure to also buy \\"Understanding and Using C Pointers; by Richard Reese\\", or ensure you have plenty of experience of Assembly programming experience or have read, \\"Programming from the Ground Up; by Johnathan Bartlett\\".<br /><br />My experience: Assembly, C, Sh/Bash shell, and some minuscul Python.  Not a fan of Python as it's not well engineered.  (ie. Python Version 2 and subsequent Version 3 are incompatible, not to also mention Python's extremely high overhead or resource requirements, and requires a 64 bit platform to be really usable.)minuscul Python.

The build quality is good and they went out of their way to make this very comfortable with 3 adjustable earpieces that you can change to fit your ear, but I didnt notice anything functional that seperates these from other bluetooths as far as functionality goes.  They look and feel cooler than most thats about it, and it wouldve been nice if they made charger micro usb instead on some custom cord that you have to add to your house of cords

B008JFUPK8|4.0|Movie Review: (Blu Ray Review below.)<br /><br />Man of Steel isn't a movie. It's a cinematic experience quite unlike anything you've ever seen in your life. And you're just not prepared for how fun, entertaining and just amazing an experience it is.<br /><br />Boasting a stellar supporting cast that's uniformly excellent, a brilliant and moving soundtrack, the film is also technically amazing, with visuals that even in a post Avatar and Avengers world, somehow still manage to assault the senses with their outright audacity and the grandness of their scope. So entertaining is the experience that, despite a running time of some 2 & 1/2 hours, the film feels brisk - and almost too short.<br /><br />With a strong script from Goyer, the film takes a few surprising and perhaps controversial turns. But despite whatever nitpicking some may have, it's hard to argue that all events serve the story organically and make sense in the context of the filmmakers' vision. It also can't be argued that a large part of the film's success belongs to the strong script from Goyer.<br /><br />As purely a film, Man of Steel isn't perfect. Goyer's dialog occasionally vacillates between sublime and lofty to downright adolescent. The filmmakers miss a key dramatic opportunity between two of the best actresses working today in Diane Lane and Amy Adams. The meeting between biological father and adult son for the first time is underplayed and lacks dramatic punch. Some moments of exposition seem heavy handed, even here. And the early sequence involving the meeting between the two main love interests feels a little rushed and slightly forced. Plus, there are early sequences where Synder's MTV influenced attention deficit disorder gets the better of him and the editing clips moments too early. An early sequence in which the title character saves people from a burning oil rig, suffers in particular from this tendency. So business-like is the editing, the Director never even pauses to let the audience share in the awe the rescued characters must certainly feel, being saved by a man who's literally on fire.<br /><br />In large part however, this is Zack Snyder's most accomplished and mature film, both visually and thematically. And despite one or two spots where he doesn't give enough time to let the movie breathe, the vast majority of sequences get just the right space and just the right edge and are executed with flawless bravado and style. Some are so jaw droppingly cool they will leave you slack jawed even in the cinema - where you may well turn to the person next to you and ask, \\"did you just see that?\\" even though you know you're watching a movie. Ironically, the movie challenges your suspension of disbelief because it's so immersive.<br /><br />In a world where Avengers raised the bar so high, the idea that a movie about a single superhero could be even MORE epic seems ludicrous. And yet Man of Steel so utterly and effortlessly raises the bar on superhero film action that Avengers seems like a Saturday morning cartoon from the 1970s.<br /><br />And yet against all the spectacle, Synder is smart enough to craft several heart-wrenching scenes involving young Clark Kent discovering the true extent of his difference from other people, only then to be saved in many ways by the counseling of his adoptive parents. In those moments, Snyder is at his most restrained, and the scenes, beautifully written by Goyer, are played with masterful warmth and nobility by both Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who despite brief screen time, make indelible impressions. These few sequences, which feel perfectly in place and of which there are almost a perfect number, ground the superhero spectacle in human terms, and elevates the film with a warmth and meaning that many summer tent-poles lack.  Nearly every one of them, if approached un-cynically, moves the viewer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film will be divisive for certain audiences and contains one specially controversial element that will distract from its many accomplishments. First, the final act too closely evokes images of certain important tragedies, so that some fans in particular, will find it hard to watch in places. It might also explain the irrational nonsense that passed for \\"criticism\\" from certain critics, who all unsurprisingly savaged the flick. This is unfortunate and unfair but possibly understandable. More problematic is that the film may give audiences (and critics) too much credit. For the less discerning, some audience members may misunderstand this Superman. A perennially compassionate character, concerned about the protection of human life above all things, the wanton violence in places and the unquestionably large death toll may lead some to the false conclusion that this Superman just doesn't care as much as previous versions before him. But it's fairly obvious from a story point of view that the stakes are desperate enough that he's given little choice. This is implied rather than explicitly addressed and perhaps the filmmakers should have indulged the audiences to avoid the distraction. Despite the fact that it may have been creatively the right choice, it is an odd decision by a set of very smart filmmakers, who would normally have been expected to avoid that trap.<br /><br />But even with those observations, the film is spectacle on a scale we've never seen, with characters that are all immediately engaging, and with a smart, strong script that's hard to dismiss. There will be unfortunate and unfair comparisons to Batman Begins - a far more imperfect film with a third act that feels tacked on, but which also diminishes somewhat the accomplishments of the first hour. But Man of Steel is only distantly related to that effort. Whereas Batman Begins is a very good movie with a somewhat shaky third act, Man of Steel is an EPIC and whole cinematic extravaganza that is beyond film, beyond movie, beyond mere entertainment, and more still - it's a sublime imaginative immersion in a world so completely realized with a ferocity and appeal so inexorable, only the deaf and blind could truly deny it.<br /><br />A few final observations. First, as Superman, Cavill is indeed convincing. But as Clark Kent, I'm not yet quite convinced. Despite a raw physicality and a look that is highly evocative of the character on the comic page, Cavill's acting is also, ironically for me, among some of the weakest of all who've played the character on the big screen so far. To be Superman doesn't take much, once the costume works and the actor looks the part. It's when Cavill has to do some of the talking that I'm a little skeptical. Thankfully, the scenes in which he seems a little shaky are few and far between. And it could well be that some of his nervous smiles and occasional odd choices are less his fault and more a problem of Snyder's decision-making. There are certainly several scenes in which Cavill actually emotes, so it's clear he has potential. So we'll see.<br /><br />Finally? Despite everything I've written, it's amazing how moving an experience, Man of Steel really is. With tender, delicate performances by Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russel Crowe, Amy Adams and others, the film also explores realistically the burden of what it must be like to be a boy with the abilities of a God, here on Earth. It does it with aplomb, and not without loads of heart. Movie - 5 stars!<br /><br />Blu Ray Review:<br /><br />This Blu Ray unfortunately lacks a real commentary, or any deleted scenes, which I thought was truly unfortunate. There is however a mini, faux documentary about Krypton which is slightly annoying due to the fact that the structure is limiting. We might have learned more about the filmmakers' decision making if they simply discussed their approach to Krypton directly. There's an extended sequence about the physical preparation for the movie which gives a sense of the training for most of the cast. And there is a fun type of commentary involving video with most of the cast members discussing their approach to certain scenes or memories of filming, which takes place simultaneously with the film itself, and nearly all of the major cast participate in this, as well as several members of the production team. As special features go, they're ok, but slightly underwhelming considering how important this movie is. Finally, the Blu Ray includes a DVD copy and Ultraviolet version which are ok if you're interested in those. I've removed one star for the lack of a true director's commentary and the lack of any deleted scenes. If you're a collector of these types of editions, I would suggest waiting for a later release.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|A good retelling of the Superman creation story. Really like Henry Cavill in the title role. Best movie superman yet!
B0002XMKYE|2.0|Very disappointed. The sound in the section where the Germans were discussing Patton, the sound was gone and a commentary on Patton's life was inserted. The one section on the battle scene in the Desert was missing ( which was on my old tape ) . I got lucky in that I found the same set  with a extra disk showing how the film was made. Found it at Bookmans used for $7.50.... threw yours away!
B00G6SDX36|5.0|So I only got it today, so I can't comment as to the long-term longevity, but I really like it so far!!!  I love how thin it is- exactly what I wanted in terms of thickness- I hate when a case pretty much doubles the size of your phone.  The plastic feels sturdy- I was a little concerned with such a good price it would be bend-y or crappy, but it is strong plastic.  I also like the nice opening size for the charging port to accommodate other brands' charging devices which could be bigger.  So far for me, just great!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I wanted to love the end of this trilogy, but I just cant get behind Ms. Roth's writing style. The ending seemed a little forced to me.. Overall, I do think that everyone should read this set of novels, but not if you are looking for something truly deep and thought provoking. Entertainment, yes.

0224098098|4.0|Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy is set in present-day London but this book really isn’t much about the setting.<br /><br />The main character in Bridget Jones is, of course, Bridget Jones. In this book she is just over 50 and she still is rather clumsy and awfully fun. As by reading this book, you also read Bridget’s diary, you’ll always know what’s going on inside her head. Although there were some people in the Lovelybooks book group that thought Bridget acted quite immature for a 50+-year-old, I think it’s still her and as this is her diary, we get to know all her thoughts and this is not necessarily what the people around her get to see. So why can’t people over 50 have crazy thoughts? I think this made her likable.<br /><br />The plot is based on changes that happened in the past 15 years of Bridget’s life. I think that the story was nice. I wish I knew how people of Bridget’s age would see this. I’m far younger, but I can imagine women acting just as Bridget does. Her problems seem very realistic to me. Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy also contains many fun passages but you got to have a special kind of humor to find jokes about farts and things like that funny. I think they were hilarious :D . Other members of the book group were bothered by these passages.<br /><br />Overall, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy was a light and fun read, but I can understand why it might upset hardcore Bridget Jones fans.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have read all his books in this series.  So sorry to see they've come to and end. I feel close to all the people in the books, even though they are the age of my grandkids.  His books are non-generational, crosses over all ages. They grab your attention and just keep going with it.  Most exciting!  Wish I could get the other series of Egyptian gods and the quests of those characters, can't find all the books in my library system. The books are excellent on CD, the narrator is very good at voices and gives the kids more personalities.
1408841894|4.0|The Signature of All Things is mainly set in the 19th century. Its numerous settings include places in Europe, North America and French Polynesia. Even though I have never visited most of the book’s settings, I was able to visualize all of them and Ms. Gilbert’s descriptions are great because when I googled one of the settings, it looked exactly like I imagined it.<br /><br />The main character, Alma Whittaker, grows up to be a reasonable, intelligent, extremely well-read and well-taught woman. It is remarkable to see the world through her eyes. Alma grows up in a wealthy household and still lives a life so different to other wealthy young women. I felt how uncomfortable she felt in regard to having friends and doing things that didn’t fulfil any purpose. I also relaxed when Alma relaxed, sitting at the table, being surrounded by scholars and scientists. The secondary characters in The Signature of All Things are beautifully crafted. Each has their own story to tell and would be interesting enough to write a novel about.<br /><br />The book’s plot spans Alma’s, plus a quick version of her father’s life. It is very detailed. You will learn much about botany (but I guess you figured that by reading the synopsis) but there are also long conversations about spirituality. Even though I really liked the overall story, The Signature of All Things has many passages that felt drawn-out. It was as if everything written had to stay in the book. My reading pace was an interplay of quick and slow. Nevertheless, I think you should read this book if you like the synopsis. The Signature of All Things might be drawn-out at times, but it is also absorbing, surprising, adventurous and different.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Takes a little while to follow the plot. It takes place in Denmark so most of the scenes described are most uninteresting since I think a lot of readers can't associate with them. Same with some of the wording. Book is good though.  It sometimes drags along. Could cut out about 70++ pages of uninteresting descriptions or wordings and move the story along better.

0879309210|5.0|This is an amazing reference for anybody looking to perform guitar maintenance...from a guitarist who barely knows how to correctly string their instrument to a professional technician working for touring artists. Each concept has 3 levels of information: basic (standard common guitar tech knowledge that's very useful for beginning techs), D.I.Y (do it yourself techniques and guides for anybody to gain some hands on tech experience), and deep (advanced, professional tech material). The range of topics covered in this book is wide...I don't think I've ever gone to the book looking for a subject and not found it to be included. Even something as simple as changing your strings is covered in great detail...I guarantee you'll learn something new (even if you're a professional tech who thinks they know it all). There are extra topics included that are just incredible, like very detailed explanations of the setups of famous guitars such as B.B. King's Lucille and Stevie Ray Vaughan's Number 1...and you know the details are accurate because the author has worked on and measured the specs on the actual guitars himself. If you're at all interested in guitar repair, setups, or even just general maintenance, get this book.

B000WAGVHE|5.0|I cannot tell you how much I love this movie.  It is such a feel-good, fun, colorful musical.  My son prefers the original Hairspray (I don't care for it), but this one is the one I adore.  I've seen it so many times now I lost count.  For the first time ever I have spent a lot of time watching the bonus stuff.  I usually don't pay any attention to extras, but IMHO the extras in this set just add to the fun!<br /><br />Since 1996 my very favorite movie was Independence Day with Will Smith.  Although it is still a favorite, if I could only watch 1 movie for the rest of my life, this would be it.  :)

B00G23T5HI|3.0|The Eighth Doctor didn't get much time in front of the camera, but that doesn't mean he wasn't a good doctor.  This Revisited episode would have been a lot better if they had expanded the discussion about the 8th to more than just the Fox Movie.  The 8th has been in a multitude of audio dramas over the past decade, with companions alluded to in the mini episode &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; (which for some reason Amazon doesn't have yet).  Also the episode was missing one main ingredient, a discussion with Paul McGann himself.  Not sure if he wasn't invited but with all the involvement he has had with the audio projects and being in &#34;Night&#34; I highly doubt he would have said no.<br /><br />Episode was OK, just needed a bit more detail on the full run of the 8th.

The arrangements are distracting, Sting is a willing participant instead of the star or center of attraction and overall, I was disappointed with the whole concert.  Pity, take some lessons from The Eagles, Simon and Garfunkel  or Diana Krall in Paris.  OK to share the stage but don't give it away.

B00G4I1CLS|2.0|Blackfish was informative but I feel as if the trailer I watched did not represent the documentary well. But hey, it got me to watch it. Overall the movie wasn't bad. Yes, it victimized sea-world, that's the point. I did often hear throughout the movie that anti captivity activists were the main complainants of whales at sea world and other animal rights activists didn't blink an eye when it came to the treatment of sea world's whales.  The main reason I gave the movie two SARS was because of its portrayal as a psychological thriller, it's a documentary, don't label it something it's not.
B007REV4YI|5.0|What can you say, I wanted this film, and the price was right.  Will continue to check for more Blu-ray/DVD at the right price from amazon
006202406X|4.0|We get both Tris & Tobias' POVs in this book. Initially, I did not like Tobias' POV, though I have read Free Four which tells his side of the story for one scene in Divergent and didn't have a problem with it.  But here, it didn't feel genuine, though I think this may be because his thoughts and feelings were different than what I expected.  It did become easier for me to read his POV as the book went along, though.<br /><br />As for the story, it was interesting where Roth took this.  I know it was her intention all along, but there were parts that were different than what we had been previously told and it felt a little to me like she was trying to correct mistakes from the previous books, so that did irk me a little, but I loved the direction she ultimately took.  I guess it didn't hit me reading the first two books just how limited their little world is.  They know NOTHING beyond the borders of their home.  They didn't even have a name for their city.  What really struck me was how they never really thought to question the borders of where they're from and if they hadn't stumbled upon Edith Prior's message, they probably never would have.<br /><br />This book was fast paced, exciting, sad, revelatory, and ultimately hopeful.  There's been a lot of talk about how people didn't like the way it ended, and I'll leave it to you to determine your own feelings on the matter, but I understood why Roth did what she did and ended the story how she did because, to me, it was genuine.  It was completely in character and believable.  I found myself being hopeful for their future and wishing we could revisit them in a few years to see how far they'd come.  So, Bravo!
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Love Joss Whedon's work.  He definitely does not disappoint in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  We watch every Tuesday as a family then I re-watch at least another time during the week.  Full of action, wit, and an amazing cast with great character development this show never disappoints!

B00GO95TAC|1.0|Like everyone else has posted - I waited and waited to purchase The Day of the Doctor today being as we do not have cable and I wasn't able to watch it.  I always purchase Doctor Who via the TV Pass so I can watch the episodes the next day and download them for when I'm not at home.  This morning I looked and the price was $2.99 (which a normal price for a TV episode) and being that we own all Apple hardware I thought I'd check iTunes too and their price was $7.99!!!  I wasn't able to purchase the episode on Amazon being I had to be somewhere this morning but somehow I'm wishing I would have just bought it.  All those lucky people who bought it this morning got a D-E-A-L!  I came out here now to finally buy the episode and watch it tonight and BAM!  Now the price is $7.99???????????  Sorry but this is unacceptable!!!!!!  I'm so furious my husband told me to calm down before I wrote this.  I will not buy 1 TV episode for $7.99 (I know it's a special but the other specials have never been this much money!).  I was going to give my money to Amazon but if I decide to buy it then I'll buy it from iTunes being as I will watch it on Apple hardware.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED at Amazon!!! :(

B00G32QIEG|3.0|This wasn't bad, like, hoping for it to be over bad, but also wasn't that great.  I had two minor chuckles throughout, that's it.<br /><br />It's basically [[ASIN:B0011E7JBW Men In Black]], with dead folks instead of aliens.  Young rookie, considerably older hand, authoritarian boss, secret organization, far-out underground headquarters...  My daughter and I had the formula figured out and the plot and bad guys figured out and nailed down within the first twenty minutes.  And it flowed right as we predicted.<br /><br />I really like Jeff Bridges.  Like, man, y'know, he's [[ASIN:B00181JGI2 The Dude]].  But in this I couldn't help but see his character as his [[ASIN:B003UESJME Rooster Cogburn]] Lite.  Just not good character separation.<br /><br />The special effects weren't that great, somewhat cheezy at times.<br /><br />Bottom line: was this worth a $4.99 Saturday night rental?  Yes, most certainly.

B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Assaultive lights and colors.  Action, lots of very big action.  And big sound.  Very big sound.<br /><br />The special effects and CGI are top-notch in this film, very, very well done.  Awesome attention to detail.  It did seem to me a few times that scale got awfully skewed, especially with the jaegers and kaiju being absolutely gigantic as they battled, but once fell or came down to a scale to interact with humans, they seemed to get inexplicably smaller.<br /><br />Lots of awesome color, which reminded me of the chromatic assault that was [[ASIN:B001F8W400 Speed Racer]].<br /><br />Some of the tactics of fighting giant monsters also made no sense whatsoever, like standing there and punching them.  But then again, it's a giant robot/giant monster fighting movie...(see next paragraph).<br /><br />There were more than enough nods to classic [[ASIN:B003OUO6UI Godzilla]] films, which I saw as respectful.  Well done.<br /><br />The story: basically Hollywood formula, with the damaged outsider returning to face his painful past, his losses and demons, and overcome the doubts of others to show what he's all about, and win the girl.  With a strong father-like figure, a cocky partner-nemesis, etc.  Yeah, just like [[ASIN:B001TM14VC Top Gun]]or [your movie here].<br /><br />Bottom line: If you dig [[ASIN:B0055X0DJ0 Transformers]], [[ASIN:B008N1LL42 Battleship]], [[ASIN:B000I9UA30 Independence Day]] or any other big-budget disaster/fighting/alien invasion movie, this one will speak to you.  If you're looking for nuanced and original characters in unexpected situations saying unexpected lines, this one will not deliver.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Susan Cain's perspective on introversion / extroversion highlights the former over the latter, seeming trying to redress the cultural and social advantage accruing to the extrovert in American life.  Many of the insights provided are helpful - I now appreciate my spouse's sensitivity to overstimulation more than before reading the book.  However, somehow the prescriptive notions appear to stress a bipolarity between the two rather than a wide range of possibilities, each the product of an varying interplay between nature and nurture.  Yes, tone down the extrovert and turn up the introvert, but let's not simply move everyone towards a common ground but learn instead to value the variations.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|OK fans...needless to say they don't have enough stars for this one.  It is simply the best show ever.  Hunters, family, ghosts, demons, vampires, werewolves, cool cars, angels, you name it Supernatural has it!!!  Winchester's rock!!!!!

B007THA4FI|5.0|This is definitely not a Harry Potter story.This one's for the adults who were waiting so patiently for Rowling' s latest literary masterpiece. It's more like some other authors' work,actually.P.D.James or some other dark noir author. The story line is adult but about teens inter- actions and sad family life.Also about the adults in their small community who are considered hypocrites by the children,and by each other.It's a sad story all the way around with everyone's secrets being spilled by  other people.The culprits turn out to be their own family members.Petty jealousies,mental illness,deep-seated senseless cruelty all take center stage in this novel about the human condition.
B005LAII8K|5.0|A real thought-provoking film.  Great acting, great story.  A science fiction, but without all the high-end technology.  I really enjoyed this one.
0375836675|5.0|It is different from other books I readand it has a good &#34;message&#34; about right and wrong and helping others.  It is suposedly for youth, but I would not recommend it for them due to sexual content that is more fantasy than explicit.  I am old fashioned, I guess.

Finally a female leader who is strong, intelligent,calculating, caring, proud, tactful, sexy, feminine and one of the most brutal people you ever want to meet. She can make her opponent shiver from a simple smirk. Gabriel Macht, Hervey, is poetry in motion. He is a man's man yet simply vulnerable to women he loves.

B00F2HW220|5.0|Ayreon - The Theory Of Everything (Deluxe Limited Edition)<br />2013 Inside Out Music<br />Arjen Lucassen<br /><br />It has been 5 long years since the last Ayreon release Timeline, but it is not as though the prolific \\"Mr. L\\" has been in stasis inside of his dream sequencer. To the contrary, during this time he released the introspective Guilt Machine project in 2009 (featuring young vocal phenomenon Jasper Steverlinck), the second Star One metal album in 2010, and the  hugely successful solo album entitled Lost in the New Real - a psychedelic rock ride full of prophetic \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" commentary on the future. Even though Arjen laid to rest the original Ayreon saga back in 2008, fans always knew that Ayreon would be resurrected one day.<br /><br />As promised by Arjen himself, he is reinventing Ayreon in 2013 with this new story partly inspired by A Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and the movie Rain Main. The story here is actually a story based in human experience more than science fiction and takes place in the present time. In this regard it shares more in common with Ayreon's The Human Equation (2004) than it does with any of the other Ayreon releases. And while this is clearly the least lyrically/vocally dense Ayreon release to date, the format stays true to form. This time around, however, there are only 7 characters, but they are once again portrayed by various vocal talents, both old and new, which is the Ayreon way. Most noteworthy here are Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil), Marco Hietala (Nightwish), and Kamelot's new sensation Tommy Karevikho who plays the Prodigy (main character). Veteran singer John Wetton (Asia) makes an appearance here as well as the Psychiatrist. Of the less well-known singers Sara Squadrani (Ancient Bards) and Australian singer/songwriter Michael Mills (Toehider) showcase their substantial talents, and Spiritual Beggars vocalist JB rounds out the troupe as the Teacher. As usual, Arjen has surrounded himself with a cadre of instrumental talent - the most noteworthy being Steve Hackett, Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, Jordan Rudess and of course the ever/only Ayreon drummer Ed Warby. But while the aforementioned artists are generally more well-known, the DVD introduces us to all of the other very talented artists employed in the project. Really, it is remarkable the number of great musicians/singers/songwriters Lucassen has worked with over the past 10-15 years and this project, in a way, is a culmination of all that collaboration.<br /><br />Musically, fans of Ayreon will find themselves on familiar ground. In fact, this release focuses more on the music than ever before, and while the songs are more keyboard driven (fans of 70's rock like ELP and Yes will find much to love here) the familiar driving riffs riddled with tons of melody are rampant. What's different? The lyrics are direct (no mystery) and quite straightforward this time around with very few prolonged vocal passages. Also, the story is broken into 4 parts (or epics as Arjen calls them) with very short segment tunes that flow from one into the other. While this approach may displease some fans, I think it was a stroke of genius for Arjen to do it in this manner - it really flows like a rock opera and it is a completely engrossing experience, especially on headphones.<br /><br />The DVD contains a typical \\"making of\\" documentary with the usual introduction to the cast of characters type thing very familiar to fans as well as in depth interviews with the main players. These interviews are very refreshing in that they reveal more about the primary singers' musical interests outside of their respective bands, which is something often left unexplored in the mainstream media. The \\"time lapse\\" videos of the recording sessions is something new and the most interesting here would be Ed Warby's 4 day drum sessions condensed into about 2 minutes of time. Pretty cool.<br /><br />As with most things Ayreon, this one has been released in multipleformats. The softcover limited edition media/digipak contains the 2 CDs and the DVD. I was disappointed it didn't come in a hardback media book like the above mentioned projects (Guilt Machine, Star One, Arjen Lucassen) but it does contain a nice pull-out booklet with all the artwork and lyrics (as well as the narrative to the story). However, Inside Out made up for this by releasing the deluxe art book edition which contains the 2 original CDs, the DVD and 2 CDs with music only all nicely packaged in a beautiful 48 page LP sized hardcover book. While the artwork and pages are essentially the same as what is published in the smaller media book, they are bigger and it's easier to read the words and appreciate the artwork. But for me, the instrumental CDs are the real reason to get this edition as they are not offered elsewhere. Finally, the LP edition comes with 2 LPs in a double gatefold format with a shorter booklet and the 2 CDs.<br /><br />The Theory of Everything is an excellent return for Ayreon and yet another epic journey of progressive rock and metal. And as with all things Ayreon the story leaves some room for a sequel ... it's never really over, even when it's over!formats.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|They rarely make them like this anymore. This is a classic ghost story come to life and put on film from the team of John Carpenter and Debra Hill who brought us the immortal \\"Halloween\\" in 1978 and features many of the original cast and crew from that film and other John Carpenter/Debra Hill alums like Jamie Lee Curtis, the sexy and underrated Nancy Loomis, (who appeared in Carpenter's \\"Assault On Precinct 13\\" (1976) and Halloween (1978), Charles Cyphers, cinematographer Dean Cundey, production designer and film editor Tommy Lee Wallace, etc. This is a classic, straight forward ghost story and revenge tale set to moody and haunting music from John Carpenter, once again providing a haunting theme song and atmospheric musical score and soundtrack like he did in his two previous films, Halloween (1978) and Assault On Precinct 13 (1976). This \\"horror\\" movie is scary enough with its suspense and good dialogue and creepy plot, unlike nowadays this film doesn't need unnecessary amounts of gore,profanity, torture porn, etc. to compensate for bad actors and third-rate screenplays and directors.<br />Don't even bother wasting your time with the absolutely ludicrous 2005 re-make. Just like Halloween and Assault On Precinct 13, John Carpenter's original versions like \\"The Fog\\" are the ones worth watching and re-watching over and over again.<br />The film also stars Carpenter's then-wife Adrienne Barbeau (whom I met once at a book signing and lecture, a really nice and wonderful lady) looking sexy and giving a great performance. Also in the movie veteran actor Hal Holbrook as the guilt-ridden Father Malone, Tom Atkins playing hero \\"Nick Castle\\" (another John Carpenter inside joke, his USC film school buddy Nick Castle played Michael Myers in his 1978 Halloween), a spooky cameo by veteran actor John Houseman in the moody prologue scene, and former Hollywood golden age actress,mother of Jamie Lee Curtis and star of the original Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" (1960) Janet Leigh in a wonderful appearance.<br />Also for once, John Carpenter allowed his friend and sexy actress Nancy Loomis to survive the rampage of the attacking ghosts by the end of this movie unlike her two previous Carpenter outings like Halloween and Assault On Precinct 13 where her sexy and attractive but doomed character of Annie Brackett is killed by being stabbed by Michael Myers in the neck and having her body displayed on a bed under Judith Myers' original tombstone in Halloween or her terrified but scheming tight-sweater-clad police station secretary damsel-in-distress Julie being shot in the breasts by a stray silencer pistol bullet from the marauding evil street gang laying siege to the isolated and cut off police station and her body is shown in close-up lying on the floor in a pool of blood with her eyes wide open and a bullet hole perforating from her tight sweater and bosom in Assault On Precinct 13 and sad,tragic,haunting music playing in the background.<br />There are too many good things about \\"The Fog\\" I like and Carpenter's other films to list and describe here. The visual style, the sets and locations, mood, suspense, music, atmosphere, cast, everything. The one thing of note that owners of this movie and those who record it on TV and cable and those who rent it online or whatever is a hilarious, bizarre, and as of this date unexplained inside joke from the filmmakers and writers of \\"The Fog\\" in one of the opening and key scenes. I stumbled upon this hidden and previously unknown inside joke quite by accident upon a recent re-viewing.<br />In the beginning of the film where Hal Holbrook's character of Father Malone first discovers the secret journal of his grandfather hidden in the walls of the old church, he examines the book and skims through the lost book's pages until he stops at a section where the pages clearly  say \\"Midnight 'Til One Belongs To The Dead.\\" Well, the book is obviously a movie prop, and a clever one at that. Rewind the scene, put it intoslow-motion and pause the screen when you see Holbrook's character skim through the pages and he briefly stops at a page with some random writings on it before he gets to the \\"Midnight \\"Til One\\" page. Some of the writings are undecipherable and full of hard-to-read handwriting,, but some are clearly visible and readable and contain some interesting and humorous, scathing, profanity-laden expletives inside jokes and thoughts on the part of whoever wrote it. John Carpenter maybe? He has a wicked sense of humor and it wouldn't surprise me. As of yet, I've tried to obtain information on various multimedia sites about this little-known inside joke in the movie but haven't heard anything yet.

It's a weird and rare opportunity when a viewer gets to witness that moment in an actor's career.  In &#34;Flight&#34;, so many years later, I again witness a star in the making, this time a mature actor embarking on the next wealth of roles to come.

1451648537|5.0|What a journey this man had. Despite the books humongous size with its 600+ pages, the stories, style and pace makes it an easy read.<br /><br />The interviews with Jobs are fascinating and revealing and it helps us understand, in part, what it must have been like to be Steve. For that, I understand this book earns five stars despite some flaws. If you interested in a good biography, good story, details on Apple inner works, this book is a must-read.<br /><br />My only gripe with the book is the lack of development on Tony Fadell's role in the development of iPhone. Tony was clearly a major source for the book, but there's no word regarding him being ousted of the company shortly after the final introduction of iPhone (due to personality conflicts between him and Scott Forestall). It seems strange to see Tony's part/story simply disappear from the rest of the book with no explanation.<br /><br />In the end, the flaws may be the consequence of the hurry to publish the book when Steve die unexpectadly.<br /><br />Buy this if you're a fan of Steve, Apple, Technology or a good piece of biography.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|When I heard they were remaking this I wondered how would they pull this off? I was never a fan of Evil Dead finding it over rated by most. Now I'm talking about the original Evil Dead not Army of Darkness which was a classic. This remake though is the perfect example on a proper way to redo a movie. They keep the exact story and never divert from it but pull a total 360 by giving it a female lead and actually making it scary with the right amount of humor and buckets and buckets of blood.

I was blown away and felt cheated because it took me this long to get on board. I quickly bought everything I could of Slash Feat. Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators, even got tickets to see them live. Needing my fix of Mister Kennedy I was excited when I heard that Alter Bridge was coming out with Fortress. One Listen to Addicted to Pain and you'll understand why, this is simply pure adrenaline rock and roll that will tear your freaking wig off. Other notable songs on Fortress I recommend are Cry of Achilles, Bleed it Dry and Lover (every classic rock album needs a ballad).

B000JMKNV0|5.0|Once again, Lehane has created a gripping novel with compelling characters and a plot that takes the reader on a breathless ride from page one to the very end.  This novel was different from the others I'd read of his because it seemed more fanciful.  However, it is also my favorite of his books so far.  I'm not a fast reader, but I devoured the book in two days.  And while I thought that I had some inkling on how the book might end, I was surprised.  I highly recommend this gum-shoe mystery to anyone who enjoys detective novels.

I hope Warner Brothers will make this right.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book. Stands the test of time for many concepts. It's interesting how everyone sees these big political issues years from now, but in the book, the characters still read paperback books and not a handheld computer like a Kindle :). I recommend this for anyone, regardless of what you normally read.

We finally got a 3d TV and I am eagerly looking forward to enjoying the new experience of a movie I already love.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|The movie skipped through most of it.  We turned it off and resumed the next day to the same problems.
B0016CP1Q4|5.0|It has the song on it that is my husbands favorite and he enjoys listening to it over and over
B00AC8ZA3M|4.0|better than expected.<br />started off a little slow, but many elements of the game made a brief appearance in the movie
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is my daughters favorite singer of all time. She listen to this with her grandpa all the time and loves this
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome fun! I really enjoyed the interactive play. You felt like the case was all reliant on you as the detective!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game is  great. I like the &quot;random deals&quot; best. You have to use a strategy rather then just luck. Fun!
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|I watched the movie like 5 times in less that 24 hours !!! awesome movie, I would recommend it hands down .
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|It's awesome that you get to have air planes and technically do whatever you want! It would be cool to have a little more health when you die. And not spend  $500 every time you go to the hospital.
B000O599XK|5.0|one of many various purchased for father in law as he likes watching  the older western from the 50's, 60's and 7o's
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best books of the year says Washington Post today and I agree. A page turner as Jake Brigance returns to the Ford County courthouse following his big case in Grisham's favorite book, A Time To Kill. A contested will reveals many secrets in a fast paced smart and entertaining read. A great gift.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Bought this game for my 4 year old and he loves it. It keeps him occupied and keeps me occupied between classes. We both play it together too. We love Ninja Turtles!!!!!!!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I enjoyed the entire series and am in the process of completing Dance with Dragons.  The characters are clear and the glossary of the different &#34;houses&#34; a real help in keeping track of the plot dynamics.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I like your game but you need to add sirens to the cop cars and seat and any other siren vehicles if this is genealogy that reads this please add it to the game right away if not please send them this please but after all its fine thank you for your help see ya
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Very interesting.  Not a &#34;fast action page turner,&#34; but an interesting fantasy.  The book continues the Game of Thrones Saga.
B002PYW26O|5.0|Yes, I rated this 5 stars.<br />Lost in Space is a terrific movie, with such promise for sequels, that I'm flabbergasted that in Hollywood's climate of recreation vs creation, that they didn't jump on and exploit the chemistry of the actors in this movie.<br />Anyway, I do not normally give out 5s, but this movie is faithful where it needs to be and the departures from the TV series story are welcome and enhance the story.<br />I also liked how several of the original TV series cast members were cameo'd or given important parts.<br />So, queue it up, have your popcorn ready and enjoy.
B00GCE3TCE|3.0|I'm half way through with the book but I've found something that seems to be a mistake. The author says that Hitler had brown eyes like many Jews but he didn't, he had steel grey eyes.<br />I¨ve been re-reading the part in which it¨s menttioned the color of Hitler¨s eyes but the boy was in an imaginary fight in a ring with Hitler, so I asume is part of a metaphor.
B004LWZW42|3.0|X-MEN: First Class is OK if you're just looking for a generic superhero-type movie about &#34;people with powers.&#34; But if you're hoping for something like the X-Men: First Class comic -- or even something that follows the continuity of the X-Men movies -- this isn't it. They changed just about everything except the powers that the characters have. I got the impression that the person who wrote the movie couldn't be bothered to read any of the comics or even just the backstories of the characters he decided to use. He didn't even make an attempt to be consistent with the characters as depicted in the other X-Men movies. A writer can give the excuse that using the previous stories &#34;isn't working&#34; and how they have to do something different for a movie. But a decent writer should be able to find a way to make things work without throwing out 98% of what came before.<br /><br />If you can think of the movie as taking place in an alternate universe, or if you have little or no knowledge of the X-Men comics at all, it's an OK movie. The actors who play the mutants are reasonably good (considering what they were given to work with) and the characters are believable (provided you aren't too bothered by the divergences from the characters in the comics). The special effects are OK, though they sometimes show signs of being constricted by budget.<br /><br />The tone of the X-Men: First Class comic was light-hearted and fun (unlike the regular Uncanny X-Men comic and most of its spinoffs), while this movie is an attempt to be serious. Why take the title of a light-hearted comic and apply it to a &#34;serious&#34; movie?<br /><br />The movie is currently $4.99 on DVD, and for that low price I'm giving it 3 stars (mediocre), however I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is going to be bothered by divergences from previous continuity (of either the comics or the previous X-Men movies). And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone interested in a &#34;fun&#34; movie in the spirit of the X-Men: First Class comics.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game fun to play...always generated city cash. Would love to find this game in the store. Nice to play.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|I'm used to the outrageous sci-fi movies that become entertaining from their over the top plots and unreal sequences, and that was what I was expecting with Pacific Rim, just a unrealistic humorous robot-alien movie.  Don't get me wrong, it truly is a movie about robots fighting aliens, but it is a VERY GOOD movie about robots fighting aliens.  I actually watched it again the next night.  The action sequences are very graphic and appear smooth motion and real.  This made the movie very good.  The plot is actually very good as well.  There is a little humorous side plot involving Charlie Day's character, but it doesn't take away from the overall dramatic tone of the movie. Would recommend the movie and would hope for a sequel.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I love this app, have met very interesting people. Would dare to recommend it to all of those who want to get to meet new folks
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|The first half of this book is a literary tour de force. Wow! The second half, not so much.  Still the book is well worth reading. ( Other reviewers have detailed the plot, so I won't bother.) This is only the young author's second book: I anticipate other worthwhile offerings from her in the future.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I love this Battery Grip for my Canon 7D. It does at weight to the camera, but great for shooting weddings and events for the extra battery power.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Very good movie, powerful story handled in a genuine way. It is not so much about the plane crash as it is about the devastating effects of alcoholism and drug addiction on peoples' lives.
0226264203|2.0|This is not the title I ordered.  It may be the same book I ordered with a different title, for whatever reason, but it is not exactly what I ordered.  I haven't read it yet.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love the characters in this series. The storyline takes us back to a time when misbehavior was far less ugly than today and people cared so much for each other.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor.  YUM!  Really fun action - made me laugh and cry.  We've watched it a number of times and will do so again in the future!  Really good franchise.
0753827662|5.0|Just when I had my mind made up who to trust.......Keep me glued till the end. Great read! Had me looking back to Amazon for the other books that Gillian Flynn had written.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|Rocket Music Player by JRT Studio LLC is a great music player.  I installed this music player on my Kindle Fire HD and it works great.  The player sees all my music no matter what the format happens to be.  The graphic interface for the player is great as well.  The player also allows you to browse music by album, artist, genre, songs, and even by podcast.  I think this music player is awesome and I would recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works like a charm and really fool-proof setup process... Had to just unpack, plug it in and it walked me through the whole process which took only 2 min.
B003CSV7TK|2.0|Its not the version I wanted.  The version I wanted was about a girl who wanted a house and a father.  Her mother is very anti Christmas.
B00GO95TAC|1.0|The episode was great, Amazons price gauging not so much.  It was advertised as 3.99 the first day then they decided to double the price.  Not worth this much and the way they did it was what I'd consider bad customer service.  Guess I'll be going to iTunes for this one.  The way Amazon dealt with this has turned me off of them for a while.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is soooo much fun!  I truly thank and appreciate that the game creators have made it available for the kindle fire.
B002VE5472|3.0|The movie was okay.  The preview looked pretty awesome but I just felt that the crazy couple could have been a bit crazier.  I did like Tim Olyphant though & the action was pretty intense at times.
B002KKCVQO|5.0|I choose 0.5 lest of my normal shoes , and it fit perfect , I always take smaler in sandal .
0399157573|3.0|I'd like to give 3-1/2 stars because this Scarpetta novel is far better than the last 2 or 3 but still cannot match the very early ones.<br /><br />A modicum of conflict is integral to a story and it is a testament to how well Ms. Cornwell writes that the unpleasant conflicts with those nearest to her in her recent books is so alive it jumps right off the page. But like everything else in life you can have too much of a good (or bad) thing!  Unfortunately, as a reader, it makes me very uncomfortable.<br /><br />In `Dust' Scarpetta seems not as at odds with Benton and Lucy but she persists in treating Marino like an oaf. It does not make for good reading. Relationships, it appears, is not Ms. Cornwell's strong suit in her writing.<br /><br />By the end of the book everything appears to be hunky-dory with everyone but I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth from the unpleasantness that has preceded.<br /><br />That Ms. Cornwell has used Newtown as a backdrop in this book was unfortunate to say the least. From her views expressed we gather that she is appalled at the tragedy and means no disrespect but it does not alleviate how uncomfortable it is to deal with it in a work of fiction at this point in time.<br /><br />I continue to read these books because Ms. Cornwell does manage always to produce a good suspense/mystery story and I do enjoy the forensic aspects that she puts forth.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Up to date map, everything I need, easy to use, price is right.<br />I like the map to explore on. ( weather - I look out my window for the latest updates.)
B000NY12LO|4.0|Jodi Picoult has done it again. Nineteen Minutes is a thrilling page turner that had me sitting on the edge of my seat.<br />The story takes place in a small town that seems normal, but has some inner turmoil. An unexpected school shooting shakes some things up in the once peaceful town.<br /><br />Picoult does a tremendous amount of jumping around in the chapters, and it can get very confusing at times when it jumps from the present day story to past stories that “connect” with the big story line. Her writing style is very unique. This book is very similar to her other book My Sister’s Keeper, but the ending in Nineteen Minutes is much more solid going along with the plot of the book than My Sister’s Keeper.<br /><br />The characters in the story are well developed like Josie, the popular girl that had all the guys drooling over her. And then there was Peter, the nerdy boy that was quiet, but all the popular boys picked on him. Their whole lives are illustrated to us since in this story, “the victim “in the story is Josie, and “the villain “in the story is Peter. These two main characters are explained in great detail, in only 455 pages is amazing.<br /><br />Overall, this book was great. The daring risk that Picoult took to write about a sensitive topic was bold, but it paid off. This book does have some mature content, so I would not recommend this book for readers under the age of 16. Otherwise, if you love a dramatic, thrilling realistic fiction novel, go out and get Nineteen Minutes, you won’t regret it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played this game on Facebook and really enjoyed it. I'm excited to play it again on my kindle. The graphics are great.
B002MFV2IK|4.0|Funny and has great actors.  A very different role for Bruce Willis.  I always watch it around the Halloween season.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I loved this book enough to buy the rest of the series. Already finished book two and getting ready for book three.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|A quirky take on Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice... Rooper is actually pretty good in this spoofy take & I found myself liking the whole thing.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Rigged to get your money!!  I am am hugely disappointed that it is free to get this game but you have to pay for all the fish, paintballs, etc....TRULY DECEITFUL to claim a &#34;free &#34; game  !#&$:
B000UAE7RW|4.0|Top acting here from bygone days...Dunaway & Nicholson together doing their stuff! Again, this was a recommended movie by Margaret Pomeranz & David Stratton from 'The Movie Show'.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great for all ages! A very good bubble game, very cheerful. Can't wait to keep playing.  My kids love it!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This was great! I loved the whole production; couldn't wait to see the next disc...very compelling indeed! Firth is great as Darcy...grim & dour...but Ehle is terrific in this production. A must have and must see movie!!
0563478330|5.0|I love Clive Merrison as Sherlock Holmes. And the entire BBC full cast and sound effects significantly adds to quality of this audio book. While not an un-abridged version, this 2 hour version is still &#34;true&#34; to the original book. If you like The Hound of the Baskerville dramatizaations, then you'll love one!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The sound from these headphones is very clear and very comfortable to wear. The fold up feature makes taking these headphones anywhere with no problem.
B000W94FE6|3.0|The concept is interesting and compelling, but the writing was not. Parts felt vague and repetitive. Still worth reading and I look forward to learning of advances in this field of study.
B00BFPX132|5.0|SODOM CONTINUE TO RELEASE THEIR STYLE OF BRUTAL THRASH MUSIC ONE ALBUM AFTER ANOTHER! THIS BAND DOES NOT GET THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY WELL DESERVE...... I MEAN IT DON'T GET THRASHIER THAN THIS! IF YOU LISTEN TO HEAVY/THRASH MUSIC LIKE EXODUS, KREATOR, ONSLAUGHT, SEPULTURA, ETC, THAN I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE THIS! SODOM HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE STYLE IN THE THRASH/SPEED WORLD OF METAL AND ARE STILL HEAVY AND BRUTAL AS EVER! IF YOU LIKE HEAVY MUSIC THAT MELTS YOUR BRAIN, THAN THIS IS IT......SODOM! SODOM! SODOM! SODOM! SODOM! SODOM!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is useful game and it never stops going it.  Is Cool  cool  Cool  I  like  it<br /> Much  so.  Much
B003K1EYM6|4.0|This works great for the old ipad, gets the job done.. I should give it 5 stars because the one i bought before.. shall remain nameless,,,,(has the same name as a fish) fell apart...
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This is kind of an &#34;origins&#34; story and it is so much better than any other take on the Robin Hood story. The environment and details are authentic for the period and Crowe delivers an outstanding performance as does the rest of the cast.
B000059TFO|5.0|GREAT FILM!!! Now where is the bluray? This film goes along well with &#34;A TIME TO KILL&#34; or &#34;THE BUTLER&#34;..
B009WHDDZQ|4.0|Great movie, original idea/story line, a must have for any sci-fi fan. I wouldn't have ordered it if it wasn't a great movie.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|There's no words to describe how Joe Walsh plays ...he's so good with the acoustic and his effective phrasing as everybody knows from all his albums. But then you see Don Felder also who's even more diverse, fast, accurate and so musical .There's nothing better than this. This concert DVD is so crisp and clear. I've had this concert on VHS since it was released and watched it every week for 2 years. I'm watching it now and I'm still blown away. T B Schmit  and G Frey are gods when it comes to vocal harmonizing. Every little string plucked here is accurate and heard beautifully. My favorite from hundreds of concert DVD's that I own. Buy now before it becomes out of print.
0790731452|3.0|Just a fun movie. nothing spectacular but some darn funny stuff and a stellar cast!! Invite a few friends, make some popcorn and prepare to laugh!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|FIRST of all, I downloaded it and it was completely fine. Then when I got to the title screen, it had to load again JUST because so I could get to the tittle screen. So it kept saying something like: This game had a error so it can't download, would you like to start over your download?
0920236162|5.0|This is one of my favorite books! Every little girl should own this book! One of Munsch best! It is not your basic fairy tale, it tells girls they are smart, clever, and appearances are not everything. I love this book!
1594744769|5.0|World War II with a whole new mindset. Use it in my creative writing classes for symbolism, pacing, characters, and so much more.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is amazing already. The potential for this game is amazing though if you add multiplayer it will be amazing playing together and killing evil monsters.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book so much I bought it for three other people.  My 59 year old mom loved it, too!  Tina Fey is hilarious and interesting.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire Hunger Games trilogy is fantastic.  I read them all as quickly as I could.  Scifi dystopian future type stuff.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|These guys are just amazing!  The joy they express while playing is contagious and shows how hard work can pay off in more ways than just money.  They are truly happy with their achievement.  Such enrichment for my life - for sure!
147676459X|5.0|I LOVE Allie Brosh!  Her blog is so hilarious, and this is a great compliment to her blog.  I would say I still like the computer as the best vehicle for her work, but if you had never seen her blog you would LOVE this all the same.  Her screwball humor is charming and her illustrations have me rolling with laughter.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun Game to pass time while putting off all the items on the &#34;honey do&#34; list and thus causing turmoil and strife in the home front. Seriously though, fun game,but I had to get 15 words and so I just kept typing.  The Marrige is fine(she plays the game too).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The entire Hunger Games trilogy is fantastic.  I read them all as quickly as I could.  Scifi dystopian future type stuff.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Only allows Netflix and Youtube.  Sometimes you will see the webpage but you will not see the video in the webpage.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire Hunger Games trilogy is fantastic.  I read them all as quickly as I could.  Scifi dystopian future type stuff.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Awesome clear hd movie. Only problem was ore ordering it wasn't cheaper than the stores and it took 4 days after it was on shelves to get to the house. Never pre ordering again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A lot of options! I find it just about impossible to sleep through this alarm with the option to have to solve a math problem to dismiss the alarm. I'm a chronic snooze button presser, so honestly I have yet to find a better alarm, and not just for an app!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Very good movie. i was pleasantly surprised at how well done it was. The colors were very vibrant. good movie.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Niffty little thing to have if your mostly deaf like me. 9/10 devices just dont have the volume you need, and even that one good one cranked all the way is sometimes too quiet. It's a little annoying to have this clipped onto your jacket or something, and its also another device you gotta charge. Luckly its very light and you'll hardly notice it. And the battery life is surprisingly well. Its also a tuff cookie. Mine has been around the world with me on my travels and its a little nicked up, but still works perfectly fine.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Amazon streaming was great, but movie was not at par with previous Bond movies. Hard to watch if you are Bond fan!
B00CNGA1PS|1.0|Not worth it. Too complicated to manever while working. You just cant do a simple search there are too many phrases needed
B00FGM0IEU|4.0|I had no idea of the amount of talent that came through Muscle choles, tha legondary Swampers we pretty amazing.<br />Its interesting that the majoity of our american classics came from and through 4 bands the Swampers, Funk Brothers,Stax(cant recall the band name,and the Wrecking crew.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This is a great show.  We do not get the Showtime channels and bought Season 1 of this show.  Got hooked and will watch this second season in a hurry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book to describe it I only need three words... BEST BOOK EVAH!!!! Thxs for reading my 3pic reveiw... BYE BYE
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I really wanted to like this game; there have not been many from G5 that I made it all the way through. Unfortunately, this one held true to form. While the scenes are well drawn, they appear to have been drawn for a middle school audience. Conversation was stilted, and at times it seemed that the characters had more to say!  I played the casual game, and spent a lot more time than I should have tapping around the screen either trying to figure out what to pick up or what to do with it! The irritating 'nag' screen really plucked my last nerve; I'm almost glad to be at the 'pay-to-play' point, now I know that it won't get any better and I can quit without feeling like I gave up. No way I'm paying for more!
0375413405|3.0|not as perfect as i wanted. but still a good cookbook. not a begginners book. begginners shoud start with and easier recipe book. french cuisine is already diffcult so take it one step at a time.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Excellent movie,<br />I saw that my children the truth and convinced me that the film came out good. I laughed a lot, with the occurrences of them.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|this game is ok although initial game play uses loose rules. it isn't until later on that shots must called which I think is how the game needs to be set from the beginning since I lost several games to what I refer to as crash ball players who as you might imagine wrecklessly slam the cue in the hopes one of there balls will find a pocket.
1250038820|5.0|Great book with tons of beautiful pictures! Arrived in perfect condition. So many pictures with great titles and short descriptions.  Definitely makes you feel like you are in NYC!
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I was so tried of the drugs and waisted lifes of the men and young women/<br />the art world was what I was interested in.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I rarely give five stars but I think this book deserved it. Well written. I like stories about the Jews.
3836538725|5.0|I was unaware of Salgado's work until recently, and decided I had to get this book.  Incredible black and white photographs - reminiscent of Ansel Adams' work.  With its huge format and over 500 pages, this book is a bargain at the price. It could be the center piece of your coffee table to browse through at leisure.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Ummmm, I ordered this bag yesterday with Prime free shipping and it came today, I made the order on a Sunday after 5pm...  C'mon, what more can you ask for.  Its as if they have people sending order as soon as it is made.  :-)  I am happy with the bag.  Smaller than expected but fits my two Nikon D5100 with three lenses, flash, video light, cables and extra battery.  Just ordered a batter grip, when it comes I am sure it will fit to, just have to make adjustments.  Bag is customizable so you can create compartments as you like.<br /><br />Why pay more when you can just get this???
B00BC254I8|5.0|In this autobiography, Tyson in his usual raw style gives you his life story and holds no punches.  Even if you're not a fan of Tyson or boxing this is a fascinating read about a man who came from nothing to the highest form of celebrity, only to hit rock bottom. This raw account of a man struggling with his demons will keep you captivated!
B000V4UFZK|5.0|This movie is so fantastic. You need to check this movie out.<br /><br /> This movie will give you a good scare with many surprises. This movie does not fit the typical ghost horror movie route.<br /><br />This dvd has good quality as well. For many years there was a doggie rent release but this one is definitely a step up. Watch this and love it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Just when you think you have it  all figured out, well then it gets interesting. Another dark read from Gillian Flynn.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have no complaints. Great Game! I would consider this better than Cabellas games. For free! This game raises the bar.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Great company to do business with I would us them again if prices remain low. This was after a long surcharge for best price. Great quality.

1603429999|5.0|Amazing information.  So much I did not know.  Well done info-wise and good illustrations. Easy to build knitting skills using this great book.
0802473164|3.0|Good luck ladies convincing your hubby to read this. Its great content, but they aren't interested. Or at least mine wasn't.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A little confusing at first being introduced to so many characters, but when it all comes together, WOW!!! Could not put it down.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|So well written and easy to follow, like a novel but steeped in good research. I love this book. I'll be looking for more of Kearns Goodwin's writing.
B009H7SCMA|4.0|Oh boy! What a very different book! It's hard for me to know what to say, so I'll go ahead.<br /><br />There are many forces that pull me, into different directions.<br /><br />The positive: this work is very original. I've never seen a book like this - combining the game of cricket with dozens of sexual repartees and blow-by-blow accounts bouncing back and forth between the two &#34;games.&#34;  There is no shame in this book, which makes it endearing and honest.  Although she's as deep as a coat of paint, the titular character, Gabriella, is so brash, so commanding, that compared to her, everyone else seems to be snivelling, at her beck and command.  We laugh along with her, and are fascinated by her over-the-top personality.<br /><br />Chivers is my favourite character in the book.  He knows his place, he is loyal to everyone, and he doesn't care what people think of him.  He plays the role of servant perfectly.<br /><br />The squeamish: this story is positively dripping with innuendo, which I'd admit is necessary for this story, as it propels the book forward; in fact, the book blasts off like a rocket.  Some of the sexual tastes of the characters fall in the &#34;icky&#34; category, so I shuddered and kept reading.  This story is so totally unrealistic, which could probably put this more squarely into the &#34;humour&#34; category.  It's brash, it's loud, and it's shameless.<br /><br />So, if you like a bit of a shocking read, blasting ahead on full throttle, and have an open mind, go plunge forward into this book!  You'll never forget this book - and in a good way.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is an excellent little gadget. While it has limitations (it currently cannot stream Amazon Prime, because of the Silverlight use) I've found it excellent for streaming anything from YouTube videos to Music to play through the TV.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I found this game loads of fun...but didn't like the dialogue as it was to long-you can fast forward thru it  which was helpful...the puzzles were challenging and held my attention. if want to \\"sail away\\" jump on board n give this one a try!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The game is great now add a fishing version, the game is just like a real game system&hellip; So this great to play on the fly when you are not by your game system.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I deliberated on this for a few weeks. Even went to a local Best Buy and nobody there even knew that something like this exists. Regardless, I ordered it. It arrived promptly and works better than I expected.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|this is super scary. so many twists and turns, so much of this film seems entirely possible. and of course<br />it is based on a true story.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I did not know any of this that was covered in the book. Have a whole new appreciation for Nikola Tesla and renewed contempt for the unethical financial institions of America.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Neat case that does a good job of protecting your headset while charging it. It's small enough that it's not in the way or a nuisance to have around. It utilizes a flashing LED to keep you informed of the charging status.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a book for my Grandson and he read the whole thing in one weekend. Anything that can capture his interest for that amount of time is a wonderful thing.
B000KX0IOA|4.0|Gandhi was a very interesting movie from beginning to end. I did not know what to expect from a person that was so much against violence in any shape form of fashion. Throwing me off, the first scene was the assassination of Gandhi in New Dhali, India January 30, 1948. It reminded me much of the Martin Luther King Jr. story. A man preaches this non-violent movement based around a certain religion which he knows half of the world will not like, and it’s ironic that he died by violence. He experienced similar treatment from Europeans in South Africa that went on in America. He was thrown from a train for not wanting to downgrade his usual first class status. Gandhi also experienced a piece of discrimination when he learned that coloreds and whites couldn’t walk on the same pavement with one another. He did not understand it. In his eyes, we are all children of God and created equally. He demanded equality with government officials. They refused. He and his followers started burning their Identification to let them know they will take the peaceful way of letting them know how serious they were about the situation. Of course they were beaten, just as the way Europeans handled situations in America. He came up with the famous quote, “Love thy neighbor as thyself”. Situations landed that had Gandhi in and out of Jail. In one of his speeches, one of his followers commented on him not being arrested or beaten, and also commented on the way he dressed. He didn’t dress as the rest of the Hindu people because he was a lawyer who should dress business professional. He started to dress in a different manner, but anytime he was arrested and had a court appearance, he always represented himself.<br />On one scene, over 1000 Hindu people were murdered in cold blood by what looked like an army. Unarmed women, men, children, and babies died for believing in their religion. It’s sad. The European General who ordered the ambush showed no remorse when he stood trial for hisaction. He should’ve been hung if you ask me.<br />Gandhi’s movement and story was admired by a lot of people of higher power. Lots of people to this day still try to carry on the actions of a man like Gandhi. The movie itself is edited, cut, and imitated so viewers can have a brief idea of his life and struggles. He was a man of great power who chose not to brag or boast about such. If the whole world would have faith in their God and religion the way he did then the world would be much different. There would be no wars. Obesity may not exist because people wouldn’t eat more than what was needed nor would they eat meat. Gandhi’s movement was very powerful, and it affected us all one way or another.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|fun game but the energy runs out to quickly and the tools refill too slowly.  other than that, fun to play
1401937268|5.0|Beautiful job to Doreen & Radleigh and the crew that worked on this deck.  I use it often and find it so much more easy and fun to work with.  Gentle messages instead of harsh words work much better to create a better fulfilling and informed life!  Beautiful artwork, and good feelings all around. Thank you Angels
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It doubled the amount of free space on my kindle mist with the basic button giving me more room to download!
140006922X|5.0|It was clear and concise with documentation that I could easily refer to. I had notice many of the discrepancys myself. He organized it in a way that was easy to follow.
B00G70JQZC|1.0|This is the worst X-Men movie ever. The writers never took the time to read the comics or even at least watch the previous movies. Wolverine is not himself in personality or in character. He is made to be a sentimental fragile dude when he looks back in time and at flashbacks. This movie also lacks the villian and morality embedded into each storyline. Here the Wolverine is a bodyguard/CSI investigator/social worker/heart surgeon and may have had inside knowledge about the Manhattan Project or he was also clairvoyant. If you are a true X-Men fan, you will only be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love  this game you would love it because it is good for the whole family to play and they would love it like I do
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Great batch of shows but way overpriced on all streaming services.  I am sure this is set by the producers of the show and its purely a price gouge.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is simple yet fun to play. You won't become obsessed over this game, but it's great to pass the time. The only thing I would complain about would be that you have to connect with Facebook an  use it for some of the quests and people may not wan  this on Facebook or might not even have a Facebook account to use.  In all thought, I do not regret getting this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's like subway surfer but it's not. And it's the minions. Which makes it a million times better. Runs smoothly. Highly advise getting this app
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This, by far may be the best book I have read in a long time. I reccomend this to anyone who has a knack for adventure.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Very god movie and great packaging. I used this movie for my marine biology students and they loved it. It sparked a lot of classroom controversy.
1449430295|5.0|I always have to have my Dilbert thought for the day, so I can see what's coming to my company next ;-)
B008V59AFW|5.0|The clarity on the discs is unreal.  You can feel Tony Levin's bass lines run right through you.  The bonus discs as well are of great quality and clarity.  A must have for any Gabriel fan.
0316204366|5.0|Excellent book that helps to alter your view of common conceptions of the underdog, why  Ivy league colleges may be bad for your child and provide self esteem for the parent only.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|It really does work well in the pool establishing my tempo.  I use it hand in hand with a few Total Immersion workouts.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Feels good in the hand, offers just the amount of protection that the 5s should get. I was seriously tempted not to get any cover my phone. I did have some concern that I might not grab it properly one day and that it would slip and fall. The air cushion case gives me just the right amount of grip without being bulky, unsightly or intrusive in any way. Not sure why others complain about the back surface easily scratching. I pay no attention where I put it or how I put it in a zippered pocket or what not, and I have no scratches at all after more than a week of using it. I did make sure to be careful when prying the two protective films from the front and back so that my nails wouldn't cause a scratch. I didn't put the screen protector on. Installation was a breeze although the plastic covers took a few moments to lift up the right way. I'd say don't be impatient with this if you want to avoid scratches.<br /><br />The clear version is obviously still visible yet barely so. There are moments when I regret putting a cover on at all because the 5s is just perfection in design, but I tell myself I'll be thankful when I do eventually carelessly let the phone slip (the phone is just a little too thin for my relatively wide fingers). An event which, thanks to the tacky grip of this Spigen cover, is very unlikely it seems. Very happy with this case overall.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Plays just like the real deal.  Considering the fact that it was free, it's pretty hard to complain about it.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Mindless humor with a typical story line.  If not for quality cast would probably have been a 3-star movie at best .
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game, except for the fact that you need social media to complete some of the tasks. I don't have Facebook. I don't want it. It is disappointing that because I prefer not to share my personal endeavors on a media website, I am punished in a game. But all in all this game is fun.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really enjoy this game it's hour's of fun and I can't put it down. My son love it too.
1594202273|5.0|Not only does it give a good story of how the Damascus Broken Arrow happened and was resolved (and there were some real heroes on that missile crew) it gives a good update on nuclear weapons security. The bibliography is solid (and there were items that were declassified that you're going to want to read). I studied this field in the 80s and the major works at that time were in the references. Good book if you're interested in this field.
3527406018|5.0|In my 35 years in physics, this is one of the very best textbooks that I have come across. If you’re interested in elementary particle theory, you’ll do yourself a huge favor to read this book. It provides a wonderfully approachable introduction to a rather esoteric and demanding field of physics, and I guarantee you’ll keep it, and continue to consult it, as you progress.<br />Anyone who ever wrote even a tutorial review article, let alone a textbook for students, appreciates the difficulties this involves. Professionals who wrote a lot of papers but never taught any class themselves tend to scoff at this notion, but personally mastering a subject is one thing; being able to teach it effectively to students requires considerable additional skills above and beyond being a subject matter expert.  And when it comes to teaching, Griffiths’ book is just about as good as it gets. Of course, the book is for (upper!) undergraduates. But its level has little to do with the fact that this is an exquisitely well written student text! Profs who think about writing particularly graduate texts would do very well to study the deeper didactic devices Griffiths uses and learn from his style. Students the world over will thank you for it – and are much more likely to buy your book!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Won't connect to my wireless network, little or no support, probably going to return it. Google: you're going to have to lift your game if you want to sell consumer electronics.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Could not be more stoked about this. Shipped fast. For the price and totability it is a deal. It was so easy to setup.<br /><br />My reason for dropping it down a star is that the services to work with it are not all there yet from your tablets like Amazon Prime and other video sources. Funny since I own the Google tablet ;) Also, you have to mostly have pay for subscriptions.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|Kooky, fashionable and vapid describe the main character.  She wants to buy everything but she can't afford it!  So she goes into debt with her bankcard and develops elaborate schemes to avoid them despite a very determined debt collector.  So hilarious.  In spite of all the lies and shopping, there's a romance too. I laughed and laughed.  Loved it.  Would have gotten five stars but I'm not a fan of premarital sex in books.  And occasional swears.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Very interesting.<br />You can read how to play in the app's description.<br />It's actually a lot of fun.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This is an amazing book. I read it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. An interesting angle for a superhero/mutant storyline, one that isn't oversimplified or overdone.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|Everything great and on time... the ultimate in historic early Who footage w/digital remix. Big surprise with the bonus extras. Very creative choices in bonus sections, not the usual junk, this actually has cool stuff....Cheers....James
B0063IH60K|1.0|This program is awful. I want to delete it. Too many video ads between games which stops playing the game silently.
B000VLOKQI|3.0|Perfect price for a second best DVD (Kids are Alright is a Master Piece) I am happy I have this at a discount rate, KUDOS FOR AN ULTRA QUICK DELIVERY....honestly, good job I was very impressed....Cheers mates!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Unlike most movies, this one started out with a bang and fizzled out as it approached the predictable end. Good acting though and it was refreshing to see a movie that was not carried mostly on the shoulders of just special effects.
B000002OX3|4.0|I have the original American Vinyl record, one of my very favorite albums of all time. I was expecting the CD to be the American Album version with the real hit record &#34;Happy Jack&#34;. I got some alternate acoustic version (Demo?)...it's ok, the rest of the CD is fantastic and the Jan & Dean covers of &#34;Bucket T&#34; (hilarious and cool Jan & Dean recording and lyrics) and actual Jan & Dean version of &#34;Barbara Ann&#34; are worth the CD alone.<br />Every Rock Band has it's hero's. For The Beatles it was Buddy Holly, The Who it was Jan & Dean...makes perfect sense. The hilarious and irreverent Who did well learning from the &#34;Originators&#34; of subtle comedic Rock and Roll, not to mention the &#34;anti-establishment&#34; 3rd finger in your face antics of Jan & Dean....priceless!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is great for learning. Makes it a game and is challenging . Great learning tool. Very easy to use.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you have ever had dogs or still do you will love this book. This was a bitter sweet story from the dogs point of view. Really was a great easy read book.
B008220BLG|5.0|i loved how this was a different kind of zombie movie and still had my attention. i can watch anything with zombies in it bc thats my thing right now. well, has been since 28 weeks later. but with the walking dead out there and everyone trying to get in on the goods of the now.. this movie wasnt half bad. interesting little twist made this comedy/drama zombie well worth watching. it was cute and it had me laugh out loud a few times. id watch it again. and have.<br /><br />thanks!
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Really improved my diving photos. Always put it on when I was already submerged, had no issues with bubbles forming between the filter and the lense. Always felt installed really securly, never worried about it coming off. I would keep it in a little pocket on my wrist until I was underwater.
B002RI9YCI|5.0|Lovely, lovely story and one to imagine could happen. Also available on audio read by the writer, stunning as well. The Uncommon Reader is the Queen (England) who reads of course but not novels and suddenly discovers them and the changes it makes to her thoughts and even the way she conducts herself. Plus the comments from those around her - absolutely fascinating comments from the fiction Queen looking at a book of Cecil Beaton (famous royal photographer) -
B0079IEPHA|5.0|The show, now approaching its 4th season is a witty, a bit tongue in cheek view of corporate law.  Season one established much of the history behind many of the lead characters.  Still enjoyable to watch again and again even when you recall the various plot lines.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a really good game and I love this because it's like a new series except in game mode
B008X9I6X8|1.0|This is just a very bad movie.  Acting is silly and a joke considering some fine actors are in it. Directing is bad and overall not even up to grade school play standards.  Would give zero stars if possible.  However.  If really bad movies give you a hoot this one will leave you in stitches!
B00CRMASUQ|4.0|i love that it was decided to create a comic version of this book. it helps to visualize better the story since it has a lot of imaginary criature. however, the only downside would be that some parts were left out of the book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am enjoying this game immensely. It keeps me thinking as I try to find clues and hidden objects and to solve puzzles. You get to play for a while for free then have to buy the game to continue, but by that time you will want to keep playing. It is well worth the price!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is fun and fast paced and the minions are so cute!!!<br />This game is free but you have to purchase stuff in the game and it can be pricey, so before you get the game check it out.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I hated Prometheus the first time I saw it in a theater, because I was expecting a prequel to Alien. It isn't, but it has since become one of my favorite films.  Some of the plot holes (not all, because there are lots of them) were filled in by the extras following the film's credit roll.  However, while the film stretches the limits of plausibility, it is still one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.  The special effects are absolutely stunning, as are the H.R. Gieger-inspired sets.  The magnificent, otherworldly score amps up the suspense level in nearly every scene.  I have watched this movie 6 times now, and it never seems to get old to me. Each time I watch, I see something I missed the last time around.  This movie is a keeper - it grows on you over time.  That's why I decided to buy it instead of just renting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun but averaging at the same time it will hook you for sure makes u want more candy can't get enough<br />.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I love Celine Dion. She could sing the phone book and I wouldn't care. That's all I got. The end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE IT. Just wish you had more lives without spending boocoo bucks... Candy crush will keep your mind busy when you have too much time to think. It's too fun.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a fun game and the app works well on my new Kindle Fire HD. I love playing it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 10 year old daughter says &quot;it's awesome&quot;!  It's easy and fun and its one of her favorite movies!  Great job on this game!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Easy to read on my new Kindle Fire HD. I can increase the font to made reading easier. Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|2 thumbs up! fun to play and doesn't require you to buy anything to enjoy it. The best part though has to be the captions during loading time or when downloading :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this a lot. wish I didn't have to wait for lives-that is the only reason I didn't give the app 5 stars.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have a few friends that play this so its fun to compete against them. its an addicting game and it has its challenges.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is the cheapest and best way to buy these movies. I enjoy watching them. Perfect gift for a fan.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Great movie.  It entertained.  It had action.  It had conflict.  It had a troubled hero - who is redeemed.  It also had a little romance.  If you are looking for a fun &#34;video game&#34; watch - I suggest this.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Gotta love government conspiracies.  :D  It has an excellent plot and flow.  If you are a fan of snipers, then you will like it too.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|the chromecast needs to be reset every now and then in order to star working again. it is still a work in progress
B009YQJ322|5.0|I give it 5 stars while others may give it 4 because of the way it opens your mind t be able to think of other wild ideas.  The graphics and music helped play a part as well.  In my opinion, this move is better than most and was well thought out.  I loved everything about it.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Amazing game with amazingly detailed graphics for a kindle game. it doesn't force close as much as the other big game apps with high detail graphics so great job gameloft.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome game! lot's of fun, my kids can't stop playing! wish that you didn't have to wait so long for a new life.wish they gave you more than 5 lives,  other than that were enjoying it very much!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I actually laughed out loud through this crazy, funny, sexy story.  It is told through the guy's view and is oh soooo true about men and women.  Just read it and you will be happy you did!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Love it! Great album
B0017SWPXY|5.0|From the title and the cover, I'd assumed this was a whimsical tale about a dog racing around in the rain, and thought maybe I'd check it out someday. Then I was told about it: that the racing in the rain referred to auto racing, was narrated by a wise old dog that knew its days were numbered and was okay with that, and I became intrigued. By the time I finished it I concluded that, while the Chet and Bernie mystery series is an extremely entertaining dog's point of view one, The Art of Racing in the Rain might just be the best, most thought provoking novel I have ever read. One five star reviewer said he was not a pet-lover and had no interest in auto racing but loved this book, anyway. Since I am fond of both, imagine how I felt. Five stars doesn't do it justice, but that's all I was allowed to give it.<br /><br />If the author spelled out the auto racing connotation with Enzo being the dog's name, I missed it. But the connection was instant for me. C'mon, what auto enthusiast hasn't heard of Enzo Ferrari? Enzo and his owner Denny Swift were like brothers. Through thick and thin, Enzo was there for Denny, providing emotional support and so much more. Imagine having a dog that, after listening to you talk about a legal issue, would destroy a document not in your best interest before you could sign it. Denny, too, always had Enzo's best interests at heart. The tragedies Denny endured were traumatic, the kinds of things that have happened to real people. Without Enzo, he might not have made it. And the ending? I couldn't have thought of a better one.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Boring... the film just dont brings you into the movie.  The acting is sub par.  I turned if off after 45 min it was sooooo boring. Save your money on this one
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good book.  It had me just as captivated as the first book.  Looking forward to reading the last and final book in the series.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great movie!  Good balance of action, humor, intrigue, and mystery.  I liked that it was different than a normal Tom Cruise movie and could definitely see this as a series of movies.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I purchased a set of these headphones through Amazon in August of 2012 for $7.49, and they still function wonderfully. I would have been willing to pay $20. Accordingly, I strongly endorse them -- with one huge caveat. As many of you have undoubtedly noticed, the price has skyrocketed to over $50 as of late November 2013. That is unconscionable! Sony should bring the price down, or more and more customers are going to boycott them. If Sony isn't the problem and some outfits (including Amazon) are buying up the stock of this product and jacking up the prices, cut it out! The world I choose to inhabit is an ethical one; it does not tolerate economic tyranny like this.<br /><br />8/1/2014: Since I wrote the above paragraph, the price of the headphones has increased even more! I could hardly believe that the price today is around $140. This is unconscionable. It appears that the manufacturer and its distributors are playing games with the consumer. Be wise and think twice before purchasing this item.<br /><br />By the way, my MDR-W08L headphones are still working just fine.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Pretty good movie, some good computer graphics.  It would have been really great at the movies. I would watch it again.
B00FEN000S|4.0|Thank you Movie Gods. Not another Transformer movie. Oh I liked Transformers; the first one that is; though after that, I was bored with the series. But Pacific Rim is different. More human yet still robotic in it's orientation. GREAT ACTION scenes! The movie definitely had some hallmark moments. Worth the time to spend watching and you should enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game. I was at level 29 before mom deleted it because I was addicted to it.
B004MKLRYC|5.0|Wonderful novella--a sort of extended joke.  I read it in one sitting and laughed out loud at the last line, it was such fun.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I plan on reading many more of Malcolm's books. He seems to have done his homework and provides insight that brings many occurrences to new light. Anybody thirsty for knowledge will find this work very interesting and educating.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|OK, you got a big budget for computer graphics special effects, why be so repetitive? We've seen this urban fighting in every Marvel based movie, I think this time they went to to the well way too many times. It probably has turned me off future Marvel superhero movies that are becoming longer, with thin plot lines and longer and longer CG FX fight scenes we've all seen before.<br /><br />Too many fighting scenes lasting way too long, too much building smashing, ending was not worth the wait.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I have had lots of fun playing this game.  Great graphics, easy to play, relaxing and fun.  Good game to kill time.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Interesting characters but the overall movie seem to drag on occasionally loosing my interest in the characters. Maggie Smith was a joy.
0007398557|5.0|because it shows facts of life in a clear and direct manner, full of humor and sensitiveness and with a deep understanding of human carácter...
1933952806|1.0|I found this book not very helpful.  It just seemed to me like an illustrated owners manual.  But at least they were nice illustrations.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Love the movie. Great price on the DVD. My daughters are obsessed. Play this thing over and over again. Holding up better than expected after their abuse.
1250030951|5.0|FANGIRL was such an amazing book. I'm not exaggerating. It was cute, lovely, heartwarming, deep, well thought out, interesting, relatable, and is something I would reread in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Cath is starting her freshman year of college away from home, with a roommate she's never met, is without her twin sister for the first time, and is quite the introvert. She doesn't particularly want to make friends. She doesn't want to party. She wants to go to class, make good grades, and work on her Simon Snow fanfiction. She's thrown into a world so completely unlike everything she's used to. It takes her time to slowly adjust and she learns how to live without her other half, care for the people she loves from far away, and how to step out of her little shell. FANGIRL follows Cath during the fall and spring semester as she figures out who she is, who she wants to be, and how to let others in.<br /><br />Cath was basically the spitting image of me while I was in college. She'd rather hang out in her room than go to parties. She hated talking to drunk people. If she kissed somebody, it meant something. Her mother walked out on her family when she was young, like my dad, and she has had trust issues ever since, like me. She wants to be with somebody but is deathly afraid that opening up her heart to somebody is just giving them the ticket to turn around and walk away later. It absolutely sucks to have this thinking but I could not relate to her any more than I did. I met Rowell at YALLFest for the first time but after reading this book, I feel like she met me a long time ago and decided to write down my college story. She just added the fanfiction thing in to make the story more interesting. I was, and am still, a big introvert who has more online friends than she can count and would rather hole up in her room reading and talking with the book community. If any of you are like this, which I'm assuming we all are to some degree, you've got to read this book. You'll instantly be connected to Cath and know exactly what she is going through.<br /><br />One of the boys Cath comes across is Levi. I fell in love with him from the first second he appeared on the page. He's overly polite and pleasant, always smiling, and doesn't hesitate for a second to help Cath with anything she wants. He is the definition of a good guy. He has nervous ticks that are adorable and I loved how he and Cath interacted with each other. He made me furious at one point--side note: the exact thing he did happened to me when I was in college. THE RAGE I FELT--in the story but he found a way to turn everything around and make me love him again. He's flawed but perfect wrapped all into one adorable character. I wish I had/do come across someone like him.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how Rowell included some of Cath's fanfiction in-between chapters. We're told constantly that she is working on her fic and getting to read some of her past work firsthand was really neat and made me see why she loved those characters even more. Some excerpts were directly from the Simon Snow books. While it was cool seeing the differences between Cath and the real author's work, this was only a snippet of what happens and I found myself skimming. Since I hadn't read these &#34;books,&#34;  I had no clue what was happening during this scene, who the people were, and what their ultimate mission was. They weren't in order by book either, so it's all random. I wish I had gotten to know more about who they were because it would've made me understand Cath even better.<br /><br />FANGIRL takes the crown for my favorite contemporary of 2013. Hands down. It was such a great story and I can't wait to relive Cath's journey again in the future. If you haven't read this, I strongly suggest you do!
0345522478|4.0|The Good: Hounded is different than any other urban fantasy I've ever read and that's impressive. A male protagonist, a druid at that, is just the type of unique viewpoint that makes this novel something special. Being mind-melded (of sorts) to his dog is an interesting twist as well. There's action and adventure and humor throughout this novel - making it a very engaging, fun read.<br /><br />The Bad: Hounded is occasionally a little too wordy, a little too muddled, and a little too heavy handed with the attempted humor to be the perfect start to a series.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Great delivery!  Good Irish music.  Nice listening music!  Good selection of music to listen to.  Highly recommend if you have ever been to Ireland!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|if you are looking for something play YouTube in your TV, so t he Chromecast is your best choice with HD video quality and it worth the cost, but don't try to compere it with Apple TV that for it's something different
B00004TS0E|5.0|A good classic Christmas movie that should be watched every year.  Oldie but goodie!  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!
B000YMHOUS|2.0|The concept was fun.  However, it was morally ambiguous.  I wouldn't recommend it for kids or teens that don't know any better.  It sets up traditional family values as sexist and entitled.  Then from that point of view, spends the bulk of the movie suggesting alternatives to traditional family values.  I gave it two stars because the concept was clever.  As characters developed and made changes, they turned to color.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Wonderful Life is a wonderful movie.  Delivery was great!  Classic movie...another must for the Christmas season.  Lessons to be learned!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best stable game. Always exited to play. I will give five stars to this game. I look for other best games from imangi.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this good graphics and mellow music.  This game is fun and very addictive. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B0063IH60K|1.0|It won't  open to let me play.  It has queued next to it. What does queued mean . Word search also is queued.
0345803485|5.0|I am a big reader, and this is the first book, series actually, that I have read multiple times. I wouldn't consider E.L. James to be the best writer in the world (repiticious sentences and at times and too many &#34;Oh baby's&#34; for my taste), but it definitely gets the job done and is worth your time FOR SURE. Paints a very engrossing, romantic picture.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|A FUN game.  It is addicting and time easily slips away.  It.is well worth the money - 99cents.  It tests your mental processes.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game has been around for a while now yet it is still addictive, fun and challenging. I can play for days, take a break and then come back to it only to get addicted again. There have been some levels where I thought I'd never pass but eventually did. I love this game.
B0085LMFAE|4.0|There's an issue with the second song, Graceland, at approximately 2:30. It seems to skip.<br />Other than that. One of the best albums ever put together.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Amazing cast of actors.  Riveting story.  Hard to believe that this had really happened in the &#34;land of the free and the home of the brave&#34;.  A must see for all Americans...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a wonderful story teller.  He advances several of his characters from &#34;A<br />Time to Kill&#34; three years forward.  It is like catching up with some old acquaintances in this book.  He holds your attention up to the end and does not reveal the ending.  I would definitely recommend this book.
0307476073|5.0|Excellent. I first read the a library book then bought one for my friend. She really enjoyed it. The book talks about hiking the trail and the people she met. It isn't a guide book for hiking the trail it more about personal revelation. Good read. Worth the time.
B00G4EXNNM|1.0|Well if you want to listen to Norah doing true country music, not just some Starbucks-friendly rock-country hybrid, this is it.  Just not my cup of tea...found this unlistenable.  Ew!<br /><br />Her recent forays into more of rock/pop inspired music are ok, but personally I would much prefer more of a jazz/blues flavored Norah, as seen on her blockbuster first album, \\"Come Away With Me.\\"<br /><br />UPDATE 12/11/2013:<br />Yeeeeeeeeee-haw!  41 \\"unhelpful\\" out of 53...nice to see that the reputation management company shills are really earning their keep around here these days...love you too, my sweets, xo xo!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/6/2014:<br />Since the shill \\"unhelpful\\" votes keep coming, I think a 1-star rating would be most appropriate...LOL!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I luv this app! I'm so happy I can finally play it on my kindle I have had it on my iphone for a long time
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I love is game it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)<br /> and the bad part about it you have  to buy the stuff for the garden
B000002UR7|5.0|I love Radiohead so what can I say i love this album. it was good start to finish. I really enjoyed it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this whole series!  Once you start you won't be able to stop... All the actors are excellent and the period costumes are fabulous.  Season 4 starts soon, yeah...
B00ET47USI|4.0|Enjoying this game. Would recommend for anyone who likes solitary. Offers option to play more than one suit so it doesn't get boring.
B003R50AW8|5.0|This book was incredible. It was one of those rare reads that challenge the reader to think about their own life and how to change it for the better. If Ed can do it, so can I.<br />The 'breaking of the 4th wall' really blew my mind--in the best way, of course!<br />Markus Zusak is officially now on my 'Greatest Authors of All Time' list
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books in this series and Allegiant was a huge let down. You can't tell the two perspectives the book is written in apart, and the writing is boring and monotone. I only continued reading out of hope it would get better. It didn't. I would recommend reading this if you need closure, but personally I wish a friend would have just told me what happened. It was a waste of time reading this.
B009PAETCG|1.0|Boring, don't waste your time. Soccer is so much more than just shooting goals. Maybe I didn't get far enough but I lost interest very quickly.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|doing the job well on supported apps. the problem is that the range of supported apps is very limited. waiting for google to add support for google+, images, mobile chrome browser and local viedos.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not a big fan of science fiction. I don't do aliens or anything of the sort. But all of that is not the story of this book. The real story of this book is Ender Wiggin, and he is a glorious protagonist! The weight of his genius: the fulfillment, isolation and despair it breeds ... the manipulation, worship, and envy it inspires ... that is where the power of this book lies. It is sincerely thought-provoking and inspiring. I enjoyed this book so much! I am so glad I read it!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great addition to the series.  I can hardly wait for the next one to come out! Love George R.R. Martin's imagery and descriptions.  I absolutely devour his books. Yum!<br />I also love that the books don't have the graphic sex that the tv show has.  Thank you.
6305128952|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies which I watch often! I would recommend it to anyone who loves horses and Robert Redford!
B006VFLIYK|2.0|This is a good work by Baldacci. However, the dialogue  between the characters gets repetitive. The ending stretches reality too far. This book could have  been about half as long an  still told a good story.
0321934318|4.0|The one the instructor chose over the other available books and I trust him.  Sometimes I wish the print was clearer on the pages.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Good movie with lots of suspenseful scenes. Jumpy filming gives you a sense of panic. Only part that was just OK, was the ending, it was anti-climatic. I would still recommend to a friend.
006202406X|1.0|This book was just awful... I really don't know where to begin. Let's just say I felt like Bradley Cooper in Silverlinings Playbook.. I wanted to scream &#34;WTF&#34; and throw the darned book out the window!<br /><br />Let's start with the beginning... good start, I guess. But about 15% into the book the plot started to get so convoluted. The explanation of Divergence is just stupid. Also, Roth decided to write this book in both Tobias's (Four) and Tris's POV, when the first two books were only in Tris's POV. The first two books Four was strong and stable and I really liked him. But in this last book, Roth made him out to be an emotional man child... seriously. I was getting so annoyed with him and actually both Tris and Four's voice seemed so similar I couldn't even tell whose chapter I was reading. Not good.<br /><br />As the plot thickens...(or kinda thickens.. it was so 1 dimensional) there are all these new ideas introduced (GP - genetically pure people; and GD- genetically damaged people) that you start to lose the whole Divergence plot entirely. This was so poor explained and irrationally introduced that I almost gave up on the book about 60% through. But alas, unfortunately, I decided to finish it. And what a terrible ending... without giving it away, I feel like Roth ended the series just to shock us. Honestly, I was just left shocked with how terrible it was. The ending absolutely did nothing for the story but make it even worse. After this ending, I have no interest in seeing the movie.<br /><br />I feel so disappointed because the first two books were AWESOME!! I truly believed it would be a strong contender to the Hunger Games Series... but no way, absolutely, now way.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So good!!!!! Can't handle it! I am obsessed with the entire series and cannot say enough good things about these books!
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This game was funny and awesome! I really enjoyed playing it in my free time. You should definitely try it!
B001NLL93W|5.0|So good!!!!! Can't handle it! I am obsessed with the entire series and cannot say enough good things about these books!
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I was at the Brooklyn concert, and unlike the previous poster, I think this recording is superb and accurately captures Barbra's voice. This concert was so much better than Streisand: Live 2006, and Barbra might be singing some of the same songs, but the interpretation is unique each and every time she sings them. Some highlights from this album include: Bewitched, Bothered, & Bewildered; People; The Way We Were/Through The Eyes of Love; As If We Never Said Goodbye; Rose's Turn/Some People/Don't Rain On My Parade.<br /><br />In addition, the mastering (sound quality) of this CD is better than Streisand: Live 2006.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|So good!!!!! Can't handle it! I am obsessed with the entire series and cannot say enough good things about these books!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked the twist at the end. I like si-fi  and found it OK but a little youn for me.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is very long and the prose is somewhat difficult to read in certain parts.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy read.
B00GO95TAC|1.0|Are you KIDDING ME?! $7.99??!!  If we were in Britain it's FREE on BBC One!  What an over commercializing RIP OFF!  I understand that Amazon has to make money, and I don't mind a reasonable charge for the good copy ($3.99 or so).  But $7.99 is a straight rip off!  Especially when it was $3.99 this morning only to go up 100% when I'm home from work.  Forget it!  I'll go elsewhere.  I may pay the same, but at least they aren't doing the bait and switch in one day!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever ... it doesn't hang in between sometimes..(ahem subway surfers) and the updates are awesome
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have tried other versions of this game but I always come back to this version because it is easy to use, easy to view and I like the 'go back' and hint functions.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Perfect!!! Finally I received my copy! Live in Atlantic City is the best part of &#34;The cake&#34; Enjoy it everybody #BeyHive4Life
B0028AQLYE|4.0|Very happy with the product. I've played with and comfort is excellent. Good quality product and the price is right what is sought
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Ok so this is a 2250076432174432477 fun I love this game he's funny and serious and cool just like me.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Amazing marriage of heavy and introspective elements with pure poetry. After reading many reviews on this project it sure seems that it went way over the heads of many listeners. Maybe years from now. Packaging on the deluxe version shows careful insight and is work of art. It was awarded a bronze from European Design. Even the model image (Lulu) has careful insight into its creation. Great music and great visuals...thanks to Anton Corbijn, David Turner, Bruce Duckworth, Sarah Moffat, and of course Lou Reed and Metalica. Not often do you find great lyrics in heavy music.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King brought the reader back to the Overlook hotel and Danny's story with style and finesse. It has been many years since I have read The Shining, but it was such a powerful book that when I picked up Dr. Sleep, it was as if only a few days had passed. King is a master of character development and even though he can sometimes go a little crazy at the end of some novels,  he exercised restraint and kept it together in the end. Loved it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|You know, I read the reviews of this book on Amazon before I bought it, but I didn't listen.  Instead I went with the hype that surrounds it and I was WRONG!!!!!! I'm sorry, I can hardly get through it....it's taking forever....and doing little for me along the way.  It is really written badly....if I read the phrase &#34;down there&#34; one more time in my life it will be too soon!!  Don't waste your time with this, people.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Had so much potential and just did not live up to the first 2 books. It did not capture my attention as the other did and the ending ruined it for me
B004LROUNG|4.0|It was good but not the fascinating read of other Grisham books. Late in the book to get<br /><br />the hero to rise with no good explanation.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love this show.  Funny and entertaining!  Hope this show continues for many years.  Always a must see on a Monday night.
0307476073|4.0|This book was entertaining but not inspiring. I could imagine doing something like this as a young hippie. I hope her back has stopped hurting!
B00BX8PG5M|3.0|Demi, a Soviet captain past his prime, has been given command of an outdated diesel submarine.  Neither he nor his crew are particularly happy about it, nor are they excited to take on some new men, whose purposes are mysterious and whose background is questionable.  Before long, Demi begins to realize how strange things really are, and that his sub may be the last thing standing in the way of nuclear war.<br /><br />PHANTOM is a decent little thriller, though it has its flaws.  The one catching the most flack is that Russian soldiers generally speak Russian in Russian accents.  But whatever.  If that's your biggest gripe about the film, then you're missing the point of fictionalized entertainment.  There are bigger issues of logic, plotting, and pace at hand; the film bogs down a bit, and then rushes towards its conclusion.  By the end, it becomes a different film altogether (which makes one think how truly good PHANTOM could've been, if had stuck with this more cerebral tone all along).<br /><br />However, one major thing PHANTOM has going in its favor is the caliber of acting on hand.  Ed Harris gives a reliably solid turn, with William Fichtner matching him step for step as Demi's second-in-command and best friend.  David Duchovny gives a surprisingly good performance as the ambiguous Bruni (there are no straight up villains in this film, yet another thing going in its favor; everyone has reasons for why they do what they do).  The supporting cast is also game, particularly Johnathon Shcaech as a confused political officer, and the great Lance Henriksen in a brief but memorable role.  The acting carries this film; the final few scenes, as well as brief scenes throughout the film, make you wonder how good PHANTOM could've been; but overall, if you're looking for something to kill an hour and a half, you could do far worse.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|For angry bird and star wars fans alike! Absolutely engaging and fully exhilarating gameplay spanning the entire saga. All ages will enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing, I've read it 3 times now and I get emotional with each read. I've cried, and laughed and had been brought into perspective of my own life. &#60;3
B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman voice is soulful, and speaks to your heart.  Sit back, relax, and let the words sink in.  Love her.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so much fun and so relaxing and easy. I love that you don't have to keep buying coins. So many games just cut you off right  in the middle of playing to get more money to continue playing to the next level. Good fun, relaxing and lots of levels.
B0030MKGKY|4.0|I like Jeremy Renner in this movie. It was pretty good and I recommend this as its a guys kind of movie.
B008JFUNJQ|3.0|It should have been three movies. Everything was right. casting, dialogues, special effects, but to have a movie cram not one book but two into a two hour film rendered it unintelligible. I was not surprised since I had heard NOT ONE WORD from anyone about the film. Usually not a good sign. I was indeed disappointed in the bullet point script. Like a rock skipping across water. Perhaps thnere will be a long cut DVD  that better renders the meaning of the stories.
B00BGIC170|2.0|This wasnt worth it. It was basically a man running from life, in the bathroom. I would definitely pass on this movie. Wasnt all it cracked up to be. Like food with no salt...blahhhh
B00881VLCE|5.0|Wish there were more free ones available.  Like doing puzzles.  This one you can even decide on how many pieces you can use.  The more the pieces the harder it is.
B0076DELIG|4.0|You can count on Michael Connelly to deliver time and time again. Harry Bosch delivers again despite the odds and his lack of support from his superiors.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like games that are a challenge.  This one is fun because you are playing against another person.  Too bad you can't just give them a thumbs up sometimes on their scores.  Can't believe the high scores some of them get.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Enjoyed it.  Couldn't stop reading till it was over.  Looking forward to others books by Flynn.  A little twisted but that's what I love about Flynns books....keeps me on my toes.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This one could really be a challenge at times.  The only part I got a little bored with was reading the story, I would just rather look and find each part that was listed.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book finds Danny from the OVERLOOK HOTEL.... amazing good book again!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Thanks for givin me the creeps!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fabulous series for the &#34;hard to buy for&#34; person. The photography is stunningly beautiful and the series can be viewed mulitiple times without tiring of it. Anyone, young or old, will enjoy these dvd's.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I always LOVE to watch this around Halloween.  It's fun, funny, quirky, and cute.  Sarah Jessica Parker is my fave!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Could not put it down. Great book about the incredible human spirit.
1936891026|5.0|This book may not be for everyone, because not everyone will recieve the message, but it is intended for everyone, in that creativity lies in every human in some form. A lot of reviewers complain about the short chapters, the seeming lack of content, the casual flippancy Pressfield occasionally invokes when discussing the image of Hitler as a repressed, blocked artist, the third part of the book that deals with higher dimensions and serving a higher purpose. etc. No, this book may not be for everynyone. But if you are a blocked creative with an open heart and an eager mind or someone seeking to launch any kind of humanistic endeavor or starting a business, etc, you should consider giving it a try.<br /><br />This is an unorthodox book. You'll finish it in a day or two. It's filled with words like \\"Resistance\\" that sound like self-help buzzwords. It isn't. It's a very apt and all-encompassing term for the forces that keep you from doing your life's work, whatever that may be. Distraction, apathy, booze, procrastination, excuses, toxic relationships, depression, and my favorite of Pressfield's: \\"compulsive screwing up\\", just to name a few. Anyone honest with himself who has ever claimed to have \\"writer's block\\" knows it's a cop-out, an excuse for not sitting down at an empty screen/page, and doing the work.<br /><br />This book will kick you in the ass and show you how you've been self-sabotaging yourself. It will also fire you up and give you the strength you need to press on and do the work. Pressfield is a kindly drill-sergeant; he holds no punches but you get the feeling that he really wants you to succeed.<br /><br />As I read the opening chapter on resistance I saw my guilty self on each page. Illusions were shattered. but it inspired me to sit down at the blank screen and do it. You'll read it once and then refer to it again and again as you might work with a coach on your golf swing.<br /><br />It's a blue-print, not a map, and everyone's experience will be slightly different as they work through their own demons creating their blocks, so don't expect this to solve your problems. It's up to you to kill your own Minotaur. YOU have to do the work. Identifying the things in life that hold you back, the negative thought patterns, perfectionism, etc., is only the beginning.<br /><br />The third part of the book, the part that addresses that thorny issue of where ideas and inspiration comes from, will be where many will fall by the wayside. Pressfield cautions you not to hold on too tightly to that precious gemstone you call your \\"talent\\", and open yourself to other possibilites, that there may be a higher dimensional energy at work here and that we, the artists, writers, dancers, whatever, are only the agents that this energy works through. Call it what you want. god, the universe, the tao, whatever. I think it was jazz great Charlie Parker that said when asked where his ideas come from, \\"I just try to get out of the way\\". He meant that he suspended all ego and allowed the work to flow through him from a higher plane. not comfortable with all this higher-dimensional nonsense?  Maybe it's not for you.<br /><br />But The War of Art will help you. It's helping me. Try his other one, Do The Work as well; some of it is redundant, but is still very worth it. you have nothing to lose, only your blocks, so open your mind and try it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am a # 1 best selling Author on Kindle.  This book os very helpful.  Highly recommended.  I wish I would have had this advice when I was starting on my journey. It would have saved me a lot of time and anguish.
1490313370|4.0|I became interested in purchasing this book shortly after reading a Business Insider article on his what he learned as a trader, as I was a trader. The book ran the along the lines as where I have been heading spiritually. It took me a long time to say that word (without snickering) coming from such a rational and logical upbringing. What this book offers is a connection between that world and the entrepreneurial world. It couples a philosophical approach with exercises to encourage the creation of new ideas for your next business. Too often, I would have the skill set and passion but not the ideas to start my next project. Choose Yourself offers a practical guide with the Daily Practice to get to this point.<br /><br />If you buy this book, you should be doing so in expectation of moving yourself and life into a new direction using the techniques outlined. And if you are not willing to make such a move or if you expect something absolutely brand new that you have never, ever seen before (sarcasm intended), then move on.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|gives clear results and is easy to use. students can practice writing equations and see the resulting  answers. Good for Special ed students.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I love this game it is fun becuase i get to defeat people. Come . A nd defeat friends and show who the best.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I would not say I love it, I reserve that comment for my wife and children. However, I would say for the price it is hard to beat. I have used it for two months. It was easy to install and serves the function for which it was purchased perfectly well. I like the size as it takes up minimal space and is unobtrusive. Also, it allowed me to connect my newer HD TV into my older analog Denon sound and entertainment equipment at minimal cost.
B00BJNHACS|4.0|Ok, t  is game is Awesome. There are many complex levels you have to get through. The only thing wrong is that sometimes when it is OBVIOUS that you touched a boost sometimes it doesn't give it to you and then you end up running into a snowman. Anyway, buy the app, it's totally not a waste of you money.
B0058DRUV6|3.0|I started out by really liking the book and then by the time I realized that many of the &#34;great&#34; companies no longer exist, well then,<br />the book lost its allure.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Still wondering if Jacob killed Ben,that was not clear had to use my imagination.The book held my reading atttenton and i recommend it.
B00B78AIV0|3.0|I read her book Americanah first and it was so wonderful that my expectations were high for Purple Hibiscus.<br />Not everyone gets to create 2 masterpieces. Still enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B001MSMULG|3.0|Reminds me of the Avengers in their way their agents were assets to be used and discounted as human beings.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a great sequel to Hunger Games! While I felt a bit cheated by the plot which was similar to the previous book, it is clear that the stakes are higher here. I enjoyed the new characters that got introduced and I fell in love with Katniss even moreso than in the first book. However, the pacing is a bit off and some of the characters are overdone. Minor quibbles aside, it was still fun, if repetitive.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game. Zynga has out done themselves. Keeps me playing. Love it play it constantly. Relaxes me after a long day of work. Only problem is after you buy one thing with coins you can only buy more with crowns and get to g coins can take awhile.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie musicals, and I bought it so I could see the alternate ending, which is much darker than the movies, and therefore more akin to the play. I must say I liked that ending better, if a bit overdone. I won't spoil it, but it is almost the opposite of the theatrical ending. At any rate, the songs are great, and Rick Moranis is an excellent Seymour, as is Ellen Greene (who was the original Audrey in the play). Also, Steve Martin plays against type as a sadistic dentist. Overall its a great movie for fans of musicals, horror films, and of course black humor.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very good app have been trying to find a good cleaner for months, this is absolutely the BEST that I have found...
B00E8S2KV2|4.0|This is really a 3 star movie, and I find it even harder to sit through than the theatrical version. The biggest problem /i had with the theatrical version was the pacing, which made the movie go at a snails pace, however the new cut doesn't seem to be a director's cut, and the pacing problems stay the same. There is also a very dumb song in the middle with the goblin king that makes him more nonthreatening than he already was. I hope that the second part of the trilogy is not as bad as this.<br /><br />As far as the supplementary material, this is a must have for aspiring filmmakers. The docs were interesting and informative, but they appeal more to geeks and people who need to know everything there is about this production. Overall, I do not recommend the movie, but I do recommend this set, because the supplementary materials make up for everything.
B00CXQL828|3.0|R. Kotzen is doing a good performance on the vocals, but his guitar solos lacks some melody. Most of the songs in this album has some familiar tones to it, more like borrowed melodies from somewhere.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Even though it is the 6th season, this show is still funny and seems to get funnier with age in the way that wine gets better. The only weak part was during the 1st few episodes after Howard comes back from space where he is coming to terms with his newfound fame. My favorite episodes are the one where Bob Newhart plays a former television show host, Professor Proton, and the one where the boys go to a comic book convention, while the girls geek out on comic books. Overall, great set for a great show!
B009NH6JRE|3.0|thought I can get the HD advantage on bluray compared to dvd, but I was wrong. No improvement on the details except I get more picture noise. I should had bought the dvd format.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|There is nothing to really say that others have not said already. Season 4 while not as good as Season 3 (which I believe to be the best of the series), is still amazing and better than most things on TV.
0892818875|5.0|This is a very helpful book. It's genuinely about aromatherapy and essential oils and helping find relieve from a number of emotional charged issues. The chapter on depression is especially helpful, as it divides depression into five distinct types. The opening of the book has two pages each devoted to various essential oils. This books also boasts stunning photography and lovely line drawings. Most aromatherapy books focus on physical ailments, so having a book focusing on emotions is a great addition to aromatherapy reference materials. If you have a friend or family member interested in aromatherapy, but don't know what to gift to give: This is it!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is amazing! I grew up thinking that the musical represented the book. How wrong I was, as this book is much darker than the musical, and the witch is much more menacing. I actually want to see a version of this story more now than ever, as I believe modern audiences will like it more than the original.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! Lots of different activities that keep you interested. Amazing fraud and you have the ability to get a unicorn!! Could the game be anymore awesome?!
B000QCTNIW|5.0|I love neurology, and especially, the concept of plasticity. If you want a great introduction to the world of plasticity through several interesting case studies, and/or if you enjoy neuroscience, this is a great book. It is not very hard to read like other books of its kind, and quite fun. You might even find that you enjoy the subject more and want to read more about the subject, like I did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ya fun I loved ot you should make a minon shoter. that would be awesome. weeee don't shot me noooooo
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this novel for some strange reason. Sure its a ripoff of the far superior Battle Royale, but its still a fun book. I enjoyed the detail that Suzanne Collins puts into her work, as well as the believability of the characters. There is not much else for me to say, but if you are a fan of well written stories as well as books were there is a lot of action, this might be a good book for you. I do think Katniss is one of the great literary characters of modern times, so I would highly recommend it if only for that.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|i really love this game so much it is my favorit game of all time you need to get it
0671250671|5.0|If everyone read this book and took it to heart, the world would be a better place.<br /><br />Touches on areas of thought I've never seen anywhere else. Really did change my life, but for the better? Reading this and then 'People of the Lie' brought a new perspective to life, though at the same time, adding to the dark that can be seen from people.
1444779559|4.0|I had read A Time to Kill quite some time back. Though Sycamore Row can be treated as a stand-alone, I was under the impression that it’s a continuation of A Time to Kill and loved this chance to pick it up again. There are quite a few returning characters and as such brushing up again would also be a good idea.<br /><br />Seth Hubbard, a rich businessman, was suffering from Lung Cancer. He decided to make a new will before committing suicide. That shouldn’t raise many eyebrows, except there are a few catches. This new will is handwritten, excludes his family and names Jake Brigance as the executor! Yeah… And the best part is that Seth excluded his family and passed on 90% of his wealth to his black housemaid… Double yeah! While Seth’s family rushes to contest the will, Jake is left to defend the will and its beneficiary; he must also find answers to so many questions – Why was he named as the executor? Why did Seth change his will at the last minute? Why did Seth choose to kill himself on the desolate piece of land known as Sycamore Row? And what did Seth and his brother witness and what effect did that have on the whole situation?<br /><br />As a backlash of Jake’s previous case, where he successfully defended a black man accused of murder of the white rapists of his ten year old daughter, there is high racial tension in town. So, Seth’s decision to cut out his family for a black housemaid fed to this tension. But Jake Brigance once again handled his case brilliantly and proved to us that he is a character worth having us cheering in his corner. The pace of this novel is somewhat slow. But the 540-something pages are justified in building up the plot in a way so that as readers’ we can feel the tension and the pressure building up. Plus the twists in the end make it totally worth it.<br /><br />I was feeling quite disappointed with Grisham’s works recently. Though they have their own place, the Theodore Boone series doesn’t really do justice to Grisham’s full potential. Sycamore Row comes just in time to remind us and to bring us a taste of what we were actually missing.to Grisham’s full potential.

0140067477|4.0|Tao of Pooh Book Review<br /> People think of Winnie the Pooh as a goofy, clumsy character and perceive his adventures as playful and pointless. In “The Tao of Pooh,” it is explained clearly how many aspects of Pooh Bear relate to Taoism, or ancient Chinese philosophies. The characters interact with each other to portray this idea simply.<br /> I overall enjoyed the book very much. It was a very quick read and I found it simple to get through the pages with an easy understanding. The book entertained me and I was able to grasp the general idea of Taoism. The whole concept seemed to be rather difficult to understand, but the book could not have made it any simpler. I believe an important message throughout the story became relevant through the quote, “The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise” (24). This particular quote from Lao-tse depicted an attitude that many Taoists have shared. As well, one particular part of the story I enjoyed was the Cottleston Pie Principle. It means that people should stay true to themselves and not want to change or try to be different from who they are. I believe it’s about contentment within the self.<br /> While I enjoyed and appreciated this story, I do not recommend it to everyone. One must be interested in ancient Chinese philosophies and Winnie the Pooh mixed into one book. However, an interested reader’s mind will stay focused on the story because it was very well planned and thought out. I also do not believe the seemed to be difficult concept of Taoism should be looked at as intimidating.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I love being able to go to my kindle, and see what the weather is going to be like for the whole week . It's gives you the temperature hour by hour.

B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|what a bunch of juvenile nonsense. now i remember why i had made a mental note to avoid these authors. nancy drew has deeper plots than this.  the action is made up as they go along. it is ninety percent filler . i dont understand all the positive reviews. this might entertain a young child but that would be a stretch. i definitely do not recommend.

B00FEHXCIG|2.0|This is just Iron Man 1 or 2, with a few random plot elements. If you're a huge Marvel or Iron Man fan - go for it. If you're a casual movie goer looking for a good flick - skip it if you've seen the first two. Also: if you have not seen &#34;The Avengers&#34;; there are plot spoilers in this movie.
1451666179|5.0|This book was thoughtfully written, riddled with raw honesty and brilliant sarcasm, and accompanied by simple but poignant illustrations that never fail to evoke emotion. You'll laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh with every page in this book. Don't forget to follow her blog to make sure you read material that didn't make it into the book!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Greatest gadget! We dropped our $100 a month satellite service months ago. This is easy to install! And fun to use.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|Some very funny parts, and some very uncomfortable parts.  I don't know if Aniston as a stripper is implausible, but I do think she looks terrific.  A lot of women in their twenties have never looked so good.  The guy who plays Kenny is excellent.  I feel a little bad for Roberts, she never seems to get roles to really showcase her talents.  And Sudiekus, blah.  If this jackwagon were even half as talented or funny as he thinks he is, his ego would be better tolerated.  His transparent and obvious self adoration is the most obnoxious thing about this movie.  There is one scene where he looks at the camera...right at the camera.  And this is in the movie, not the out takes where it belongs.  So if you happen to be a Sudiekus fan, you will love this movie.  If not, some of the funny is worth putting up with him.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best product ever, can't wait for more apps to take advantage of this. Using it with the Chrome browser is great.

0399165274|1.0|I've read all of Forsyth's novels and this is the worst- even the jacket is garish. Cardboard characters, feeble plot and little tension. All in all- a big disappointment. There's even sloppy grammar  any editor should have changed. Forsyth also has a major general two ranks above lieutenant colonel. Hey, Freddie, ever heard of a brigadier?
1476729085|5.0|I saw this book and kind of skipped over it as pleasant but not necessarily must-read. Then I saw a review comparing the feelings it evokes to those elicited by Rainbow Rowell's fabulous Attachments, immediately sending this book to the top of my to-read list. And I'm so glad because it worked out very well for me!<br /><br />Don is a professor of genetics who has reached the age of thirty-nine without meeting a suitable partner. He decides to tackle this lack by creating a questionnaire for what he dubs The Wife Project. Soon after he meets Rosie who he deems completely unsuitable but something about her interests him and he begins to help her with her own quest to find her father, discovering that not everything can be quantified on paper including but especially love.<br /><br />It is suggested by the text that Don has Asperger's or is at least on some part of the autism spectrum evincing many of the symptoms of that diagnosis though it is never explicitly stated. He has a rigid schedule and is upset when it's disrupted, he is compulsively orderly, and he struggles with social cues, maintaining only a handful of friends. However his time with Rosie disrupts his well-ordered days and introduces him to a wide variety of new acquaintances who actually appreciate his ability to consume information such as a barman who is impressed with Don's knowledge of cocktails or the baseball fan who discusses stats with Don. I loved seeing Don's world open up and how his skills were appreciated rather than looked down upon.<br /><br />The book reads very cinematically, appropriate as it is my understanding that it began as a script and it falls within the framework of a screwball/romantic comedy, made even clearer toward the end when Don studies various romcoms to win Rosie. I don't want to go in to too much detail but there are so many funny moments as I previously hinted at above.<br /><br />But for the most part, it's just the way this book made me feel. I know that's not very descriptive to you, a potential reader of this book, yet that's the way it is. I would love to provide concrete examples of why this book worked for me but it's the total package that pleased me and has me singing its praises. This will definitely make my faves list of 2013 and will be pushed on various persons of my acquaintance in the hope that it brings them as much pleasure as it did me.<br /><br />Overall: Simply an excellent feel-good read. Left me feeling all sweet and fuzzy. I definitely second the Rainbow Rowell comparison as well as Tara Catogge's comparison to the fantastic A Confederacy of Dunces with its bold, not the norm hero.y descriptive to you, a potential reader of this book, yet that's the way it is.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's so easy to use.  I love being able to compare 5 translations.  The font makes it easy to read.
B008J05EL8|5.0|Officesuite includes generic fonts... serif, sanserif,  monospaced and symbol. These fonts are good and you don't have to install this option to create pretty good looking documents. The optional fonts are identical to the ones used on your desktop so it's a worthwhile investment if you want your docs to be formatted exactly like your desktop. Someone states in a review that these fonts are included in the pro version.  They are not! As to why they are sold separately...  license fees for these fonts have to be paid and they are not really required, so it gives you the choice to pay if you are fussy about formatting. FWIW, they are indistinguishable from the desktop fonts.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was a good movie. Of course it did not completely follow the story line of the books, (as it usually happens with book-to-movie transitions) but if someone that did not read the books were to see it, I think they can coherently follow the story line.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|A great game got a discount. When I got it, it was something I could spend the rest of my money on. Which thank you but this is a really fun game in my opinion.
