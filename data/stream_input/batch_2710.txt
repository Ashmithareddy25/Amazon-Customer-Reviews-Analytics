B00867GHS8|5.0|Nephew carries tablet everywhere with the movie on while in the car. He needs to have it or he will be upset the whole car ride.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a hard review to write because I am so sad at Vince's passing on in June of this year. I have read nearly every thing Vince wrote during his career and the Mitch Rapp character was one of my favorite leading men. Thor has Harvath, Silva has Allon, Child has Reacher, Berry has Malone, etc but Rapp was one of a kind even among these action heroes. In The Last Man Rapp once again delivers his usual flair for justice and what he knows is right while putting the politics behind him. Flynn has always given Rapp a great voice and strong beliefs that he used in protecting America and this story does not disappoint.<br />I hope that the last novel Flynn was working on comes out eventually, but am not sure that anyone else can bring Rapp to life as Flynn did. I know it is odd but it deeply saddens me to lose a character that I had become as invested in as Mitch Rapp; but my sadness for Vince Flynn's passing manifests in a grieving  for the person I know, Mitch Rapp, because it is through his characters that I got to know and love Vince Flynn as an author.<br /><br />For anyone new to the Mitch Rapp series, I would recommend going further back and ensuring that the full story of Rapp is developed by starting at the beginning of the series. The early Flynn novels that did not feature Rapp are well worth Reading as well.

0307744434|2.0|I'm a big reader and enjoy all sorts of books.  In particular, I tend to like best-sellers and highly rated books on amazon.  I've always felt I was pretty easy to please books-wise.  I was surprised when I didn't like this very much.<br /><br />After all the hype, I was pretty disappointed in this book.  I read another review that said it could've been 100 pages shorter and I definitely agree with this.  I got pretty sucked in in the beginning, but then around page 300 I couldn't believe there were still 200 pages left.  I just kept waiting for something to happen.  And by the time it did, I honestly didn't care that much.<br /><br />This brings me to another point, I didn't care a lot about the 2 main characters, which is rare for me.  They seemed more like caricatures of people and like I didn't really know them.  Another reason why I didn't care what happened.<br /><br />My last critique is that the \\"magic\\" system in this book is barely explained.  It seems that you just have to concentrate and practice a lot, and then you can do magic!  Since this book was about 2 battling magicians, learning magic under 2 different mentors, you would think that there would be a fully developed, interesting magic system.  Nope.<br /><br />Anyway, this gets 2 stars since I did enjoy it in the beginning and I did finish it.  I just feel it could've been a lot better.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very entertaining and fun to play. The only problem is you have to wait for more energy. I recommend for you to play it especially if you like horses. It is great.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|This is a fantastic app in all regards except the radar-mapping screens.  There are apparently two versions of this app.  One includes using Google maps for the radar screen and one doesn't.  If you purchase this app at Amazon it WILL NOT include the Google mapping ability.  This in my opinion makes the app useless without Google maps.  My phone along with most others supports Google maps. Why not include it as an option in the app. Instead they include open maps which is way too busy, detailed and fails to define state borders which makes storm tracking much more difficult than it needs to be. Buy the app at Google Play Store and you will get the Google mapping ability.  Great app, just don't buy it at Amazon.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Shipped quickly at a very reasonable purchase price and included was a very nice note including the exchange/return policy.  The letter started with a statement that was very kind.  I will always purchase movies/audio through Bob's Media Market if item is available.  He even gives you his cell phone for anything you might need....WOW.....excellent customer service....few and far between these days!

B008Y7IUBM|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a child. I only remembered one thing from it. Watching it again recently, I discovered the rich plot, and deeply developed characters. It's a childhood adventure of a unique kind. They don't make them like they used to.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Haven't finished it yet, but very good so far.  Keeps you interested. Keeps you advancing to the next chapter. Can't wait to finish to begin the next one in the series.
B008LXZFH6|2.0|What was deemed funny in the 70s should have stayed in the 70s. Few comedies from this era hold up, and \\"Anchorman\\" is unfortunately no exception. If you must watch it, try a couple of martinis with the popcorn. No guarantee but alcohol might help.

1594746036|5.0|I guess I do judge a book by its cover, loved the photography, and the story line was kept me turning the pages until the end. I finished it in two days, and look forward to the sequel. It might be a young adult book, but as an adult it took me back to fanciful times, and what a wonderful thing to immortalize those that are in the photo's... great idea!

B0034G4OYA|5.0|Me and my girlfriend love this movie and have watched it repeatedly and quote it often. Would highly recommend this movie to any age group
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good movie that happens to involve sports. It's a story more about the relationship between a father and daughter than about baseball - baseball is how they connect in the story. I'm not a huge sports fan, but I liked this movie.

B00AW0KGYI|4.0|This was pretty good.  I really thought the extended version was GOOD.  The dog dish with the hot dog to Jacob.  That was so funny, LOL!!!!  And the fact that Edward let Jacob have it when he &#34;imprinted&#34; on their new daughter.  They shouldn't delete scenes in the first place.  They were pretty funny and they were good too.

B0050AV5MW|5.0|Purchased this Kindle edition of this book after I saw the first season of HBO Game of thrones. Presently have sailed thru to book four. A very well written and fascinating story. Only thing worrying is that with this pace and plots after plots this story may not end at all ...
B00B3EJ292|5.0|Movies devoid of offensive language, explosions that numb the senses and sexual content are nearly non existent.  Add exceptional acting and you have a WINNER.<br /><br />OUTSTANDING!!
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The West Wing is a first rate program and it has been fun re-watching all 7 seasons. Season 5, 6 and possibly 7 had a couple of episodes where corruption on the disc made it tough to watch.<br /><br />Without the technical issues the rating would have been 5 of 5.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|you know it is a show that grows on you! cant wait for the new ones! love to watch this on i -pad right before bed!

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones always leaves you wanting more.  It's action packed and I love the fact that it's unpredictable, you never know what's coming!
1781162646|4.0|This book is a great summer read.  It's short, it moves quickly, and the characters are all compelling.<br /><br />Much more a coming of age story than a ghost story, but King is a master at writing believable, and likeable characters.<br /><br />The ending really worked for me.  I had to read the last few pages through the tears welling up in my eyes.  Both Joyland and 11/22/63 before it have emotional endings that are perfect for the main characters, and really hit the reader (this reader anyway) hard.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Time crisis but better. A little sluggish but responsible since when moving. I like the call in bombings and grenade physics. Fun solid game.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Is my favorite TV show I love everything about it. Great actors- actreses and the clothe is fantastic. It sure takes a person to those years.
1439153663|5.0|Fascinating story from two different perspectives - that of a white indentured servant and the illegitimate half slave master's daughter who has been charged with taking the girl under her wing.  Complex characters abound.  Really interesting story and fast read.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|My dad is a bit of a \\"birder\\", so it was fun to watch a movie about his new found hobby, and it actually turned out to be a pretty cute movie. I must admit that I L-O-V-E all three of the main actors, so my opinion might be a little prejudiced by that... but I'd recommend it to a friend.  :)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Couldn't put this one down, looking forward to the next in the series and the ones to follow after that

B002O3Z50G|5.0|I have watched Twister so many times! It has become a seasonal favorite, like Jaws or Hunt for Red October.  My copy of Twister disappeared so I got it again!<br />For those who don't know the movie, the protagonist, Jo, lost her father to a tornado in Oklahoma when she was just a little girl. As an adult, fascinated with twisters, she was determined to develop an early warning system for letting people know a tornado was coming. In doing so, she became a scientist and a storm chaser. It makes for a edge of the seat type of movie!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I LOVE pinterest until the update when it just stopped working. if that problem was fixed I would give it a 5 star rating.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Awesome Movie. Although I though it should have been the hulk and iron man movie. Loved this movie for sure.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I loved the new actors in this movie, I think well chosen. Story line was great and good to see &#34;Spock&#34; back in action but still true to his historical character.

This is a great DVD and I just keep doing level 3 over and over now along with the cardio kickboxing DVD of hers. I actually bought this one for a friend because I already had it
B004XZR63M|5.0|Definitely helpful, glad I bought it. It's mostly anecdotal, but it helped me visualize his points. It really dumbed down some terms too. I think this is great for personal development and if you're in a transition in life, it gives you great ideas, especially if you wanted to try something different. If I took away one thing from this book it would be that We have to be open minded to see all the opportunities laid out in front of us. Some people will never see them and complain nothing good ever happens to them. And some people see it, understand it and take action. Anyway it's a great read. It's different from the literature I usually read but probably even more helpful and more relative to making money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun app! Easy to navigate! Excellent graphics! Based on the app as a whole and all I've seen so far, I give this app a 5! Really wish it had more horses to choose from though.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Another unnecessary addition from Disney.  Visually nice, Franco is annoying.  Tries to be funny but fails.  Makes Kunis ugly...so that sucked.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|Gripping from page 1. Couldn't put it down.  The characters were brought to life with the turn if every page.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Good player for when I transferred movies to my Kindle Fire. I wish it would turn off when I hit the home button rather than just going smaller.
B008JFUTT0|3.0|This recording is Rodriguez in the studio years ago so the sound quality is not what we'd hear today.  Plus, I saw him in concert recently and his voice has only gotten better with age.  I'd love to buy CD's of him performing this music as he sounds now.
140006922X|5.0|This exploration of the life of Jesus as a Jewish revolutionary opposing both Rome and the established Jewish leadership versus Jesus as the Christ is absolutely fascinating. The editorial manipulation of history for religious purposes in the gospels demonstrated in this volume provides a 2000 year old example of \\"spin\\". One take home message here is that there is not much new under the sun. This book demonstrates why a foundation of fundamental religious belief is literal interpretation of Biblical writings not historical analysis.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It would be more fun if it told you what to do. some of the puzzles were hard butthere was nothing too bad.

B00785P2QC|4.0|Best game yet Love it but can you make the monuments cheaper and please add a space shuttle so I can make a city on the moon? I would love a moon city or at least a space shuttle. Please?!?!?!
B004TJ1H3C|2.0|I have a feeling season two will be just as disappointing as season one.  This is not the great archeology Stargate that all of us are used to.  Don't waste your money.

B00402FGE4|2.0|I've just made it through episode 2 in season 1.5.  Basically, the second half of the first season.  I have no idea how Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis could have allowed this show to come into being.  There is so much conflict between the civilian and military presence on this ship of death, it is like watching a soap opera.  The change of minds and bodies as select members jump back to earth to communicate over this several billion light year distance is quite frustrating too.  And since mankind really cannot even measure a million light year distance, how do we exactly measure billions of light years?  Sorry, the Hubble can't see that far.  It is no wonder this show lasted only two years.  I will watch the rest of the episodes.  But I have a feeling the dual DVD set is on the way to Goodwill once I finish.  If you really adore Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis, don't bother with SGU.  The characters will aggravate you more than compel you.  It is nothing like the first two Stargate series.
B0012GMZ5E|5.0|I bought it for the electric blues rock I enjoyed when I bought it around the turn of the decade of the late 60s to early 70s. During the time of Hendrix, Cream, Fudge etc., At that time it was available on a vinyl LP. Now I own it and enjoy all over again without hearing the snap, crackle and pop.

B001TAJGO6|5.0|ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of \\"is it worth it?\\" as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub-plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film - the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been \\"Love happens because of fate\\". But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again - he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes \\"Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love\\". This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.<br /><br />My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.caf fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love\\".

B005G4TJUC|3.0|The movie itself was a disappointment.  I didn't like that Megan Fox was fired, I didn't like the lack of closure on her character.  I also wasn't thrilled with the new girlfriend already in place, and Sam was like a caricature of himself.  It was all just a little over the top for me.  I bought it because I have the other ones, and I wanted a complete collection.  Upside, again, is that this inexpensive version is nice for people who just want the movie itself.
B0015F1VY8|3.0|This movie has pretty much the same Controlling Idea as the previous Elizabeth movie: that devotion and inner strength is required to protect one's country. But this movie does a way better job of proving the idea. Even though as queen, Elizabeth is far removed from the physical battle and spy vs spy action, her actions (and inactions) drive every turning point forward. When she wavers, England suffers, when she is strong, England triumphs. This makes for a very satisfying ending where she rallies her troops to defeat the Spanish armada in one of England's greatest naval victories in history. Great movie.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca
B003UYUQZW|4.0|I really like this movie.  Of course, Disney always makes great movies, and the cast is made up of excellent actors.  This particular version didn't have a lot of features.  I did go for the cheapo version, but I wish every movie included its own trailer, at least.  Still, I recommend this movie to anyone.
B000SW2F6M|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven is about one man's dedication to be the perfect knight in order to protect the innocent civilians of Jerusalem. He seeks redemption for having murdered his own half-brother and sticks to his principles and refuses to \\"do a little evil for a greater good\\". In the end he gives up the city of Jerusalem to save its inhabitants.<br /><br />The primary plot of the movie is and external quest: battles to save Jerusalem. The turning points of the main plot are driven by internal and relationship struggles: the knight trying to do the moral thing and giving up fortune and love in the process.<br /><br />Unfortunately, probably because I watched the extended version of the movie, the main plot doesn't get going until half way through the movie. The back story up to the knight's arrival in Jerusalem (which doesn't include a lot of key turning points) wastes more than an hour of screen time before the main story gets rolling. And the first significant turning point is the knight having an affair with the princess, making his later choices of staying squeaky clean as a moral knight seem hollow and arbitrary. The knight, aside from the justified murder at the beginning of the film, doesn't go through much of an arc: he is good near the beginning and stays good to the end. The redemption arc of the princess is a little more interesting but less relevant since she's not our protagonist. So we end up watching a squeaky clean \\"good\\" guy go through heroic actions against clearly \\"bad\\" guys and watch the very expense set piece battles. Unfortunately internal and relationship driving forces feel hollow. I might have been distracted enough by the action to not really care, but at 3 hours long (the extended version) its hard to not notice the slack internal and relationship arcs.<br /><br />Some ways that might have made it better: cut the entire first act prior to his arrival in Jerusalem, yes including his dad Liam Neeson so the main story gets going right away. Make the protagonist go through more of an arc: place some of his not so good choices into the middle of the story so we don't watch a \\"good\\" guy go through 2.5 hours being a goody two shoes. Make his redemption less about his mourning of his perfect wife since he goes around sleeping with a married princess. Or: just admit that this is a simple Action film so pack all the action into 90 minutes so we have no time to worry about the internal and relationship arcs.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.cahe protagonist go through more of an arc: place some of his not so good choices into the middle of the story so we don't watch a \\"good\\" guy go through 2.5 hours being a goody two shoes.

B001EBWING|5.0|CASABLANCA is a great film because of the weaving together of the three plots at climax that gives Rick's final action simultaneous meaning on the personal, interpersonal and social levels. At climax, Rick chooses to give up the chance to be with Ilsa by coming to terms with the civic and patriotic responsibilities in a world in upheaval. The film would have been good enough if it ended with that. But with one more twist it reaches greatness by completing Ricks' internal journey from bystander to patriot. Rick has tricked Renault into freeing Victor Laslo, but Renault places a last minute call to Strasser, putting Ilsa and Victor's escape into final jeopardy. Rick shots Strasser to complete the two sub-plots: Victor and Ilsa are guaranteed to escape and Rick has sealed his fate as a patriot. These two sub-plots reach a positive climax as the main love story between Rick and Ilsa plummets to its classic anti-climax. He sacrifices the chance to be with Ilsa to become a true patriot of the world. We are touched by the great story because of what has been won by Rick's noble sacrifice.<br /><br />My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.ca
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It's an amazing story that makes  you tear up at certain points.<br />You can't put this book down. Very inspiring.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|Oldboy is about the idea that love conquers vengeance. It takes both of these concepts to their Shakespearean extremes and leaves them to duke it out in a fist fight to see which comes on top. Love does. Thus, love conquers vengeance. Signed, sealed, proven. Q.E.D.<br /><br />To hide the big twist of the movie, Oldboy starts out by pretending to be a revenge flick. The main revenge plot is that of Oh Daesu's quest to find the person who imprisoned him for 15 years and give him a piece of his mind. This revenge plot is supported by another revenge plot of Lee Woojin seeking revenge on Oh Daesu for having caused his sister's suicide.<br /><br />The love plot is the relationship between Oh Daesu and Mido. Which develops over the course of the story. In the end, Lee Woojin reveals that Oh Daesu had caused his sister's suicide by spreading a rumor about her love with Lee Woojin, and that he had sought revenge by imprisoning Oh Daesu for 15 years and setting him up to fall in love with Mido, who is actually his own daughter. So Oh Daesu is faced with a choice. He can kill Lee Woojin and win his revenge. Or he can apologize and try to preserve his love with Mido. In no uncertain terms, he apologizes. Love wins.<br /><br />The idea that love conquers vengeance is setup for a climactic clash clearly and dramatically. Then the idea is camouflaged with crazy high stakes, innovative directing and editing, a symphony orchestral sound track, and, of course, very graphic violence that actually supports the story.<br /><br />Oldboy is an epic classic and it's a shame it is being remade in English.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I have never  heard of this movie before until a friend at work was telling me about it. It is a great movie. I recommend anyone to see it especially if you are into action and suspense. It is a great movie!
B000SOYEQY|3.0|Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs.<br /><br />The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence.<br /><br />It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact.<br /><br />But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring.<br /><br />Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway?<br /><br />These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca
B00AEFXJ86|5.0|I have never even heard of this movie before, until my boyfriend mentioned it to me. It was a great price and was packaged great when I received it. It is a very good movie. I recommend you to watch it if you haven't seen it yet!
B0045INOCO|3.0|Apocalypse Now does not make much sense to analyze with Story Charts because it's not really a movie. It's a piece of historical social commentary on the non-nonsensical nature of war by showing us a collage of scenes that outline the ridiculousness and craziness of war.<br /><br />You can see this on the Story Chart: there is no Internal Change for anyone (Willard starts out dazed and broken, and he ends up the same way). There is no Relationship change. There is just the external quest of the mission to kill Kurtz by going up river (seems like a metaphor for some sort of mindless journey). And an illustrative tapestry of crazy scenes you find along the way.<br /><br />The movie does not PROVE the central idea that \\"War is horror\\", it just shows us the effects of war. That's why to me it's not a real movie, just a series of muddled situations that is somehow supposed to mirror the craziness of war. It shows us as opposed to making us feel the central idea by seeing a tight story propelled by the choices of the characters. Sure the scenery is memorable and the situations weird and unforgettable, but so is a National Geographic article.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca
159463176X|5.0|Like Abdullah&#34;s and Pari's father who was a master storyteller, Hosseini follows these children and weaves a masterful story of their separation and eventual reunion. Since I had read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I knew I would be reading another good story. All 3 books give the reader an appreciation of the &#34;humanity&#34; of the Afghan people rather that their being represented as a news item and often in a bad light.
B0019IMVDG|3.0|Casino is tough to analyze with Story Charts. The casino racket plot (along with all the other subplots) all start at their highs and tumble down to failures. The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.<br /><br />My main beef with the movie is two fold.<br /><br />One is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters \\"cool\\" and full of \\"attitude\\" and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.<br /><br />My second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how \\"cool\\" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from \\"cool\\" gangsters.<br /><br />I think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.<br /><br />I don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.caize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.<br /><br />I don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal?

B009NQZVKG|4.0|Good dialogue and descriptive writing of exotic locations but drags in places.  Rollins has become too formulaic but his conceptual, scientific plots are still right on.
B002WTOXUK|3.0|District 9 is a modern E.T. with guns and computer rendered aliens. The story is deceptively simple, a growing friendship between a human and the alien ends up with the human sacrificing much to save the alien and send E.T. home. The genre is more Action than E.T.'s Drama as the main escape plot encounters some pretty interesting obstacle and the gory nature of these E.T.s and the human's transformation into an E.T. provides enough tension and intrigue to keep the tight story very engaging.<br /><br />Pretty awesome.<br /><br />The filmmaking is very interesting too, with some documentary style scenes to move the plot along. Very different and engaging. The choice of locale (South Africa) and a weird accent with an unknown lead actor make the story easier to believe (like how some foreign films can get away with really cheesy lines and be very impactful because our social filters don't detect the foreign language cheese: like a lot of Anime (Naruto) or some South Korean romcoms (My Sassy Girl)). Pretty cool. A very tight movie.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca
B00E00OGE2|5.0|I viewed this movie with another adult and 3 children, we all loved it! I am a huge fan of animated movies, and this is one of the best animated films of the year! The story is intriguing as it grabs your attention in the very beginning. The colorful characters are funny as they come to life, sound effects are totally awesome, and the children found it very entertaining from start to finish, as well as the adult viewers who enjoy animated. My daughter also loves animated, and wants to view this movie again. She compares this movie to several Disney favorites, and rates this one excellent, for story and characters. We will indeed be watching it again-and-again, as we do all our favorites. The theme of this delightful animated feature is snails and speed, which never went well together. The message is that we can all follow our dreams, and hope for the best. Theo is different, because he wants to race cars, instead of gardening. His family tries to convince him to work in the garden, where he belongs. But, he never quits on his dream. After he turns into a speed machine, the movie becomes more exciting. Fun-filled, and very enjoyable. Highly recommended!
B0026IUXO2|1.0|The plots were picked well to illustrate the Controlling Idea, that Monarchy requires total devotion, such that Queen Elizabeth would give up marriage and love to be devoted to England and be known by history as the Virgin Queen. But, the plots don't really grind against each other, the turning points are not natural progressions of each other and the story limps along without being driven by Elizabeth. For example, most of the Monarchy plot turning points are not effected by Elizabeth herself, instead they are by luck (Queen Mary dies, she is declared queen) and by others (Walsingham captures the priest and all the traitors). The Controlling Idea does not feel proven, it does not feel that she HAD to become the Virgin Queen to save her Monarchy and England. The sequel is much tighter in driving home its idea. Given this story, I'm surprised a sequel was given a chance to see the light of day.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book was pretty good. The movie inspired me to read it and I'm glad to say that the movie was very true to the book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the lack of romance between Katniss and Peeta.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I rarely think about buying an accessory for an accessory, but this compliments the Legend so much, I don't know what I did without it. Before getting this case, I would charge my Legend whenever the battery got low. I waited because it was a bit of a pain to charge, the cord that the Legend comes with is particularly short. The problem is that if the headset were dying, I would be worried about calls dropping out, and I don't want to fiddle around with cords and functions on my phone while I'm driving (which is mainly when I use the Legend).<br /><br />PLUSES:<br />(1) Adds time between charging: Even though I don't need to charge the Legend very often, with the case I need to charge it even less. I'm probably charging once every month with moderate use.<br /><br />(2) Battery life signal: Tells you when the battery is low on BOTH the case and the Legend. This is extremely helpful as an early warning (it is also a negative - see below).<br /><br />(3) Keeps the Legend charged: I now I have my Legend constantly fully charged because when I'm not using it I turn it off and put it in the case. This is very easy as when I get a phone call, I can just pop open the case, pull out the Legend, flip it on, and it automatically pairs and then answers my call (I haven't missed a call doing this - and I don't do this while driving).<br /><br />(4) Fits in my pocket better: TWO ISSUES (1) Part of the problem I had with the Legend was putting it in my breast pocket or even pants pocket, the cover for the ear piece would often come off. With the Legend in the case, I don't have to worry about the ear piece rubbing off when taking it out of a pocket. (2) The other part of the problem was just grabbing the Legend out of my pocket. I find it much easier to take out the case, so that even with the short amount of time added to take the Legend out of the case and orient it to my face, the time different doesn't change.<br /><br />Sure, I could keep it on my ear, but I don't really like to do that all the time. I think in social situations in particular, it seems a little rude. And so I like having the option of having the case in my pocket and easy to get to when I need it.<br /><br />(5) Easy access to charging: Say I am using my Legend a lot one day and going through battery. If I get a rest, instead of looking for an outlet and a cord, I can just pop the Legend into the case, and get some charging done while I'm out on the town, or running errands, or anything that requires I not stay in one place for an extended amount of time.<br /><br />(6) Small form factor: Fits in the breast pocket of my dress shirts, or easily in my pants pockets. I'm sure some people will not find the size to be that small (certainly larger than the Legend itself), but I find it easy enough to have with me without causing me inconvenience.<br /><br />(7) Slick design: Import for a number of reasons. For one, it just looks more professional. But most important is that the design makes it slide in and out of pockets easily so that I can reach it at a moments notice.<br /><br />-I'm not considering this a factor, but I've found it to be fairly sturdy as well, although I'm not about to test this out. I've dropping it only a couple of times, and not in any significant way, but there weren't even scratches when I did.<br /><br />NEGATIVES: Why have negatives on a 5 star review, because these do not take away from my personal enjoyment of this product.<br />(1) Battery Charge indicators: While I like the fact that they have indicators, they are a bit rudimentary. It uses a flashing light (1 for the case and 1 for the Legend). It will flash up to 3 times to indicate the level of charge remaining. This does not seem like a accurate way to determine the amount of battery remaining. I would think they could add some kind of percent readout (maybe even just having more flashes), so that I charge it only when I feel necessary (10%? 25%? etc.).<br /><br />(2) No Lock on the door: This would be nice just in case I drop it so that the Legend doesn't fly out, but it is not completely necessary and I could see the reason not to have it. If there were a lock on the door, then it would be harder to use it on the fly, to take out the Legend when someone calls from the case. Also, it is not completely necessary because the magnetic mechanism that charges the Legend in the case also holds it in there fairly securely already, AND the door hinge is fairly strong and doesn't flop open (just don't go opening and closing it all day without stop). Still there might be a way to have a locking mechanism that didn't take extra time to open (though it might cost more if they did that).<br /><br />(3) Legend sits in the case in an unusable position: The Legend sits in a way that you need to adjust it when you take it out in order to use it. Again, this is only an issue if you are trying to take it out very quickly. But it also might be an issue if you are worried about wear and tear on the twisting the Legend. I haven't had any problems taking out the Legend fast enough so this hasn't been a big deal. I also don't feel like the Legend is that susceptible to wear from twisting.<br /><br />(4) Made of plastic: Sure it is fairly sturdy, but I could certainly see someone putting either pressure on it (like if it falls to the bottom of a book bag) or just being rough with it. Still, this is not a big issue for me. I'm not particularly rough on my things, and though it could be made of stronger materials, that would likely make it cost more.<br /><br />SUMMARY: This is a must have accessory for me now, and I can see myself buying another similar such accessory if and when I need to upgrade from the Legend. For now, I am very happy with my Legend and very happy with the case that makes the Legend even better. While the case could be made sturdier and the battery indication light isn't very detailed, it does what it is supposed to, and does it very efficiently.his would be nice just in case I drop it so that the Legend doesn't fly out, but it is not completely necessary and I could see the reason not to have it.

0307474275|5.0|Here was a book, filled with reverence, and art, filled with curiosity, and searching, filled with angers and self flagellation, filled with assumptions challenged.<br /><br />This book is a work of genius.  It lays open our assumptions, our faith, our beliefs.  At the core of our selves is the spark of God, and the source of ultimate Truth.  It is the spirit that searches all things.  It is the Spirit that reveals and conceals.<br />It all boils down to the realization that the Spirit of Truth is the final word.  We can be barraged with doctrines, and assumptions.  We experience religious and cultural pressure to believe this or that.  The chapel of Roslyn had references to many different religions, Jewish, pagan, Christian, Egyptian, and through it all the spirit of truth shines.  Mary Magdalene is the Apostle of Spirit.  She is the representation of Mother Spirit, and of the great truth of the nature of God.  The Spirit is the spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind. We seek this Spirit because it was also in Jesus.<br />Through all this we must wade through antiquated religious fervor, totally wrong interpretations, and the violence of attempting to force others to adhere to a particular religion.  Constantine saw Christianity as a path to personal power, but was not baptized until his deathbed.  The Catholic Church followed that path unwittingly.<br />The notion that Jesus was married with a pregnant Mary Magdalene when he died is patently untrue.  His sister Ruth and the other sisters Martha and Miriam did indeed carry the bloodline that Jesus had.<br />But after all there are many untrue things in the Bible.  We believe many untrue things.  People have taught us many untrue things.  Our whole lifestyle in the 21st century has many untrue things in it.<br />But when you look into your own heart, and search for the truth by way of God's spirit, then things come clear.<br />This is a novel.  It is understood that novels are fiction.  Many novels have a great deal of truth in them.<br />But if you are fully armed with truth in the inward parts, the falsities of the novel fall away in the wake of the marvelous truths therein.  If we carry truth in our hearts, the truth of the presence of the Holy Spirit, symbolized by the Holy Grail, we find the balance, the beauty, the clarity and the marvelousness of God throughout all creation.at deal of truth in them.<br />But if you are fully armed with truth in the inward parts, the falsities of the novel fall away in the wake of the marvelous truths therein.

B00CA3C1N4|3.0|This game is fun for short periods, I like the challenges and the graphics are good, but it does use a surprising amount of battery to play. In my S4 it burns about 10% Battery in 15 minutes.  The game play is easy to learn and it does require some level of strategy to win.<br /><br />I rated this 3 stars:<br />-1 for high battery drain<br />-1 for price given the amount of time it can be played and still be interesting.<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />MG
B00AR83PN4|2.0|Not a very fun game, and caused my kindle to have issues. I removed it.<br />It is a Tetris wanna be on steriods. And not a very good one.
B001PPGAJE|5.0|The first in the series, and by far my favorite.  Also, it's WAY better on Blu-Ray than DVD.  The graphics are crisp and everything comes to life.
B009NY43NY|4.0|If this is really the end of the Sookie novels it wrapped things up in a pretty little bow... however there was definitely enough room for more to be done if / when readers clammer for more Sookie.  Another good, entertaining and engaging read with all the excitement you come to expect, twists where you don't and dead on fun throughout.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Saw the movie great. Read the book also great bit different. Can't wait to watch the movie again for closure.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was in a high school geometry class when I learned that Kennedy was dead.  This book brought back so many memories.  Stephen King is my age and remembers exactly what it was like &#34;back then.&#34;  Reading him is like being in a time warp.  I would recommend this to anyone, but especially to baby boomers.  He makes the extraordinary and supernatural seem plausible.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great Game! I love the minions! Wish there were more levels and a way to earn coins faster than having to buy them! WARNING...game is quite addicting!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My son was thrilled that were ordered the complete set. We took a weekend to watch it. We were pleased with our purchase.
B00AK77WPE|5.0|I recommend this product to everyone who loves latin music!! It´s an incredible concert, believe me!! Juan Luis Guerra is the one!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|AFTER READING THE 4 BOOKS THE WRITER MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN IT WAS ALL HAPPENING. THE SUSPENSE THAT THE STORY HOLDS YOU  AT YOU CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK. I WOULD LOVE TO MEET THIS WRITER ONE DAY. JUST STARTED READING THE FIFTH BOOK, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS: A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, WOW. I KNOW WHY HBO MADE IT A MINI SERIES. THANKS GEORGE R.R. MARTIN
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|This is definitely not your usual love story. Heartbreaking and haunting at the same time you will never forget the beautifully broken main characters.<br />  This is a realistic story of two men who love one another, but are terribly flawed to a point of no recovery. They are the best thing to happen to one another, but are toxic for one another at the same time. I was wishing for a happy ending were they would resolve all their issues,but you knew that they should really never see each other again for their own emotional growth and sanity.<br />  It is hard to find a gay love stories were there is genuine emotions and chemistry between the two lovers, and due to the wonderful acting you believe every twist and turn of turmoil the character go through. I watched this movie seven months ago and I am still haunted by this tragic love story.
111846446X|5.0|The book is pretty short but it has a nice preface from the author about how he came up with the Raspberry Pi and brought it to reality.<br /><br />The Pi runs Linux, so if you're not familiar with the OS, this book will not make you proficient. However, since all Pi are the same hardware, the preconfigured images work and the book will show you how to set that up along with a little introduction to Linux.<br /><br />This book probably should come with the Pi, but since it costs about 50% of the Pi's cost, it's been left out to keep the device cost low.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book. The book deals with a lot with death, war and the holocaust, but despite these subjects, the humanity of the main characters shine through.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is very awesome the company that made this game has great games I even have the club story game
B0097K21YW|1.0|Boring. too much like angry birds, which was REALLY boring, and I can't figure out why it was such a big seller.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Love this movie. A great one crazy tho.I have not seen it in years. Hence the reason I bought it. But I can't wait to watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|you can't just let it go at &#34;I hate it&#34;???? This is 100 rooms, with little variations. Enough already! ;-(
B005V2S7FW|3.0|The app is free, yes, but the service is only free for 14 days and it doesn't work that well. I keep having to go online to find out my passwords because it won't log in correctly. The desktop version works great. The tablet/phone version needs some work.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Not interesting at all. Would not recommend to any other users. How about the Great Karnac instead? (old Johnny Carson persona)
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I love that for one low price i got the cd and an instant download.  My daughter loves it.  I am not sick of hearing it yet.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great gift friends and understanding collections is all it takes. great game and easy to catch up if u cant play everyday.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a must read it was even better than \\"The Kite Runner\\". It made me cry many times. What an outstanding writer !
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved reading this book, the ending was suspenseful and captivating but the first hundred pages were tough. I would recommend this book to all fantasy fans, and suspense and action seekers.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Tried watching it twice but kept on falling asleep. It didn't help that there was some issue with Amazon streaming. I basically gave up on it. You are just not sure about where this movie is goingor what it's trying to say.<br />This is...Crap
B000PMFS2I|4.0|It was vary entertaining. Reminded me of vegas.  Also reminded me that I am too old to go there. Not that active now.
B001NLJ33K|3.0|Action packed but hard to remember who was who as well as the strong accents being hard to understand. Loved Colin and Jamie.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This movie was exceptional . we laughed, we cried, we sighed...I could probably watch this movie once a month and enjoy it every time!
B008JFUPPI|4.0|\\"Un-dead police officers?\\" Really? C'mon! This PG-13 action-fest once again had me scanning my mental Thesaurus... Absurd? Ludicrous? Preposterous? Ridiculous? Outrageous? Goofy? Hilarious? I think you get the picture. If you've seen the ads you know a recently slain cop joins a team of undead police officers in the Rest In Peace Department.<br /><br />This goofy comedy, written by Phil Hay/Matt Manfridi (\\"Clash of the Titans\\") and directed by Robert Schwentke (\\"Red\\") is a sure-fire winner, full of action, comedy and Computer Generated Imaging. I freely admit that there were times things got too, too silly and my interest faltered, but then the story rallied again.<br /><br />We watch:<br />  * Jeff Bridges (\\"Hearts of the West\\") is Roy, wearing a Buffalo Bill beard and mumbling like he has a lower lip full of chewing tobacco; he's an old-time lawman on the third sixty-year extension of his assignment.<br />  * Marisa Miller (Victoria's Secret model) in her slinky gold dress, is Roy's avatar when he walks among us.<br />  * Ryan Reynolds (\\"Chaos Theory\\") is Nick, slain by his trusted partner and stunned by this new turn of events. He quickly adjusts to the idea that he can't be killed any more, at least THAT is a relief!<br />  * James Hong (\\"Safe\\") is Nick's avatar.<br />  * Mary Louise Parker (\\"Red\\") is Proctor, the R.I.P.D. orientation officer in her short black uniform and white knee-length go-go boots...she made me think of Diana Rigg.<br />  * Kevin Bacon (\\"Frost/Nixon\\") is Officer Hayes, ready and willing to comfort his partner's widow.<br /><br />The CGI technicians had a blast and the audience saw blowie uppie stuff galore! Our poor heroes are really up against big-time trouble: Global Warming, the Black Plague and bad cell-phone reception. At least Amazon will tell us when the DVD is available.
157421327X|2.0|Sometimes shopping on the Internet is a risk. This is one of those times. The &#34;book&#34; is more of a pamphlet and definitely overpriced.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|My husband wanted to view this movie so we streamed it last night.  He seemed to really enjoy it but I gave up on it about halfway through and got out my book to read.  This movie seemed silly to me - people just running around and shooting at each other.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like problem solving games and Can You Escape was fun. Moderate level of complexity. I can't wait for more rooms to solve.
030758836X|5.0|My mom heard about this book, and she wanted me to read it before her. I loved it! She liked it only because the book was more targeting towards my generation than hers. Both of us hated the ending. Overall, great book! I highly recommend. Couldn't put it down. No complaints on packaging or shipping.
B009M7G1PU|3.0|Having skimmed through a well thumbed copy that had been passed around all my friends in the sixties, I thought I would have another read of this classic on my Kindle and this time read ALL of it rather than the parts with a page corner turned down! It's taken me a while and how times have changed. I enjoyed it but the writing, compared to modern snappy styles, is so slow and sluggish it felt like wading through treacle half the time. Lots of repetition that slowed down the pace and almost had me skimming again. I know that's the way of the classic author, but it would be nice to see this re-written with a good editing. Not in any naff fifty shades style, but a general tidying up would be good.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|While I'm awake I find reading this classic literature written by someone who knows what writing words in the English language mean, rather illuminating.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|the updates cause you to lose tokens and BB dont care. they dont even reply to your tech support claims. very very disappointed. its a free download game but to play it is far from free. the newest room cost 100 tokens to play and your lucky if you get that much for free in 24 hours.
B005LAIHUO|5.0|I honestly did not know what to expect in this movie, but was pleasantly surprised in the retelling of this story.  The actors were amazing, the director did a great job.  The tale of the giants, how everything came to be and payed out is very creative and entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed this!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a good game I guess but makes u rate it or else u cant play any more so they suck for that
0553214632|4.0|Arrived on specified day and was in complete perfect and new condition. Not an overnight read though.  For my daughter's high school honors biology class
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a very addicting game!  it would be fun and challenging for any age group.  no instruction needed - you just use simple
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Isn't there a policy on not accepting reviews for products that haven't yet been released?  Oh well, I guess it's all in the name of hype.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a fantastically entertaining and is an uncanny reflection of work life in a law environment. A wonderfully written script. Witty and charming. A wonderful cast of characters make for a fun time.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|loaded it, tried it, then removed it. to be fair, i also tried several others, i am still looking .
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The voices, the garage feel, the longing...  Yep, that about covers it.  LOVE IT!!!  People of all ages love this band, lots of friends have this disc and can't get enough of it.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all times.  Makes me proud to be a woman after I watch it.  Love Julia Roberts
B008NW67E0|5.0|Words cannot rate such a stunning achievement as this - honestly, do NOT pass this disc up!  Not a bad track on it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good way to pass time. Was challenging and yet not too difficult. Would have give 5 stars if more levels were available. Just when you get hang of the game it's over. Game way too short. Need more levels. Hope up dates come soon.
B005544V6A|4.0|Title says it all.  I'm no lawyer so I don't know exactly to what extent the scenarios they play are plausible in a real court, but it's still entertaining nonetheless.  If I was a lawyer I'd probably hate it.  I'm in IT so I can't stand when movies like &#34;Swordfish&#34; or &#34;Firewall&#34; talk techie; I have to turn them off, so it's probably like that if you're in the law field.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Campy.  Lots of cameo appearances.  I liked the first one and this was the same.  Yes, they are getting older...but they don't hide that fact...if you don't count the plastic surgery look.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some levels are really challenging and some are easy. Great brain work out. I would certainly recommend this app. Level 10 is a stumper.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I play this game just because its funny and fairly entertaining but I don't know how realistic it is but it is pretty fun
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Definetly recommend reading this book.  Love Dan Brown books and this one was as good as the others I have read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Initial problems with getting it to launch were resolved by removing from device and reinstalling. Game is very entertaining and fun. Lots of action and fun<br />. Great free game
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I only rated this 3 stars due to the slow first chapters. Once Pi became shipwrecked, then it was very exciting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I look forward to each upcoming episode. The acting, writing and production are top notch. This series is seriously addicting!!
B006OFN0SE|5.0|This picture was recommend to us.  It is a good store about this person.  We enjoy Leonardo Dicaprio  and he does a fine job in this firm.  We do recommend this film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter started me watching this series and now I can't just watch one episode.  I have to devote the better part of the weekend to get through a season...I wish it wouldn't end.
B0099114WO|5.0|Love this film, as it is warm and funny and lots of other things.  Of course, I love the actors in this film too. Buy it; enjoy it and laugh with it. This is a must film, especially for us oldsters. Smile.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Really enjoyed reading. Characters are well developed. John Corey is wonderful and very believable in attitude, with a lot a humor.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a sport film.  I'm not into sports that much, but this movie I do recommend.  Brad Pitt does a wonderful performance in this and it does my heart good and brings a warm feeling too, that even though you don't have lots of money or connections, you can with the right attitude and hard work, make your dreams come true.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app. It's very fun and addicting. I've only had it for a little while and I'm hooked. Get this app if you love Ice Age!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Great price as well.  Saves the item when kids are using them and might drop them like my own do
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!  Makes you really think, and each level gets harder, but not too hard that you can't figure it out.  Get more levels quick...I'm addicted!!
0316017930|5.0|It is apparent in this day and age that &#34;ego&#34; and &#34;self-made men&#34; are still intertwined.  Moreover, &#34;success&#34; is still defined by many<br />to be synonymous with &#34;money&#34;; the amount of, and the acquisition of .  Fortunately, Gladwell helps separate out advantage, opportunity, being lucky, timing, and background and how they influence the making of an outlier. Lastly, the reality of how<br />no one really succeeds alone, but how the aforementioned with other people, determines one's success.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Short and sweet...  Treasure Planet is Amazing.  'TP' was made around the same time as 'Road to El Dorado, Atlantis and Sinbad - all big bombs at the Box Office.  Yet, all of these were awesome and, more importantly, underrated.  Although, 'TP' is my least favorite movies of this group, it is still amazing with Disney's best animation combined with a rich plot.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is challenging.  I don't care for the long wait between runs (though I have plenty of WiFi speed and bandwidth.  Also, as a former facebook user I dislike anything that needs friends and or money to unlock complete game function.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|In short, 'HP' Sorcerer's Stone felt like an '80's movie, ahead of it's time; not the blockbuster others consider it.  I feel the Special Effects were weak given the time and budget.  That said, it's still a good film and I like the main characters - Harry, Ron, Hagrid and Dumbledore (no, I'm not a big Hermione nor McGonagoll fan.)  At the end of the day, 'Sorcereer's Stone was a good start to the seven movie franchise.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|charger was great the first few days ,then again the kindle fire became unchargerable. the battery again has the question mark  on it. so idk what to do any more. but the charger works for the first 4days. I think its the kindle fire and she just got this 2012 when it first came out
B00E00PM40|3.0|Since Dreamworks have been on such a roll , Turbo was the Dreamworks movie that really disappointed people. Dreamworks made great films like Puss in Boots, How to Train Your Dragons, Madagascar 3 , Kung Fu Panda 2 and Rise of the Guardians, When the Croods came out, it was a movie that didn't worry people if Dreamworks was going downhill with the films they will make , but now its pretty clear that Turbo made our worries become reality. The movie is hugely predictable and throws in big plot elements that can literally break the movie into pieces, But the way the movie did the racing scenes was put into the movie like a work of pure Art. The Animation is so vibrant, The movie although telling from the point of view from snails looks very vibrant, It also looks a bit to much like a rip-off of A Bug's Life but as it is , its very fantastic animation. The movie handles the racing scenes spectacularly because of the right tone needed to animate racing scenes and has fast animation that is animated fantastically. The Characters are poorly written , they have very fun personalities and have nice voice acting and they are pretty well-developed. Overall , Turbo is on the low end for Dreamworks films, but at least it was not the terrible movie it looked like. 3/5 stars!
B001CO42MU|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough! I just wish I could give a full review without spoiling any parts or it but I will say it's one of the greatest movies about drugs made so far (plus it's a true story)! Some of the best writing, awesome acting, amazing story, great cinematography,etc... Go Watch It Now!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is fun if you like war and base building love it it is worth downloading just get this game
B0063GORYU|4.0|hard not to make mistakes that cost you a move otherwise this is an excellent game and can be enjoyed by all.
B00D4PDJMY|5.0|I streamed the album last week when it was being previewed and was quite frankly confused/skeptical.  First listen, the album came off as a schizophrenic, unintelligible NOISE.  By the third listen the songs started to differentiate themselves and it was clear this was not a Pantera/Down clone but a heavier, angrier beast that eschews typical song structures.  If you are looking for lyrical melodies and catchy riffs similar to Anselmo's other projects, this album is NOT for you.  If you want something HEAVY and ANGRY, think grindcore meets Trendkill era Pantera, I believe you will enjoy this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Thought this would be a really good game because of the reviews, but once I got it, it never opened up.  Very disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked it well enough. Not as good at the room but entertaining. Not so challenging that you can't progress. I'm waiting for other levels
0810994739|5.0|Bought this for my 8 year old daughter since she just finished the first one.  It was much cheaper to buy a used version from Amazon.  It arrived quickly and looked practically brand new!  Great purchase!
B00DU74U74|1.0|My wife and I fell asleep.  Not sure about her but I just couldn't give a damn from the beginning.  Check this out:<br /><br />The boyfriend intro was as clumsy as it was bizarre.  The first thing he does is hold a knife to her throat because he thinks she's an alien.  Then seeing she's a human plants a hard sultry kiss on her.  She bats him away.  Chase ensues.  He tackles her and she tells him to get off her.  His excuse for acting like that?  \\"Duhhh!  I haven't seen a human in two years.\\"  Whaaat. . ?  So when you see one your first impulse is to hump it?<br /><br />So anyway, they get separated and she gets infected with an alien and catches up to him in the desert.  She's overwhelmed with joy at seeing him again and runs to him.  His response?  He backhands her because she's been infected.  This is just weird.  Peoples' emotions seem to be able to turn on a dime with no warning or reason in this movie.  That's big trouble.<br /><br />But there's a big problem with her characterization as well.  Ultimately, the boyfriend (I don't know his name and I don't care what it is) introduces himself like a rapist: Knife at the throat, hard sloppy kiss, jumps on top.  Now, I'm thinking what kind of female viewer is going to warm up to that kind of guy?  I suppose there are a few women out there who might BUT those women, I don't think, are the same women who would say a little bit later on in the relationship, \\"Sleep with me.\\"  If your boyfriend introduces himself like a rapist, I'm thinking the dialog would be a lot less innocent sounding than that.  Sorry if you're offended but I think a movie should make sense.<br /><br />So the characterization is totally unbelieveable.  And after they meet again and he smacks her I basically tune out because these characters are as fake as a 3 dollar bill.  This is my first exposure to Stephanie Meyer and I'm wondering if the clumsy, bumbling characterization is one of the reasons writers like Stephen King can't stand her.  I'm not encouraged to see what all the hub bub is with Twilight or her other books.
B002RRN952|5.0|While at some points the story is a bit murky, the acting is fairly good and the action is great.
B00D4L2JZG|1.0|Too bad.  She had so much potential, and ruined it by transforming into another pop/electronic auto tuned singer.  She devolved in to this sorry excuse for an album.  If you like latin electronic dance music, then this is for you, if not, stay away from this album.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|I love the evil dead series but this one got old quick. It was a good movie but two hours in a 2 bedroom cabin gets old quick. Ive spent 26 months in Iraq as an Infantryman and 2 years as a cop. Needless to say ive seen some gory bad stuff but this movie was over the top and made me just not wanna watch it anymore. I dont mind violence but im starting to think the things you see and the movies you watch will affect you. Why do you want to watch unnecessary violent gore with no purpose. There is a point in this movie when I seriously wanted it to end so I could leave. I got tired of 2 hours of solid violence and over the top gore. Honestly, how many times will you watch this movie if you buy it off Amazon?
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am enjoying the'spider'. It's really fun to play. Good job! The graphics make it pleasing visually as well aschallenging.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is simply one of the most wonderful books I have ever read.  It has an air of suspense, yet each page requires the reader to linger, ponder, and consider the eloquent images created by the author.  It is magical in every sense of the word, and I found myself savoring every aspect of the book, not wanting it to end.  I rarely read books more than once, but this is one I will definitely consider reading a second time just to examine the author's craft and style.
0345472322|5.0|This is the best self help book I have read in years! I have given 5 out as gifts. Most people worry about being perfect and what others think. This book will free you from that bondage!
1439181780|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  Easy to read and pleasant.  I got both the electronic version so I can have it with me when I travel and a copy of the book itself.  I've bought several of the hard copies and given it away as gifts to friends and family when I saw that they were struggling with some issues in their lives.  It has a powerful message and so far everyone that's gotten a book and read it (with an open mind) has benefited from it.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I bought this to see the reports on the ratings for heath  what happen to pain an all the daily explanation s cannot find .  Would rather free version to this.  OOVER PRICED
B004U8VWLE|5.0|I thought this movie was pretty damn good. I love Aronofsky and this movie just adds to that. Would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind movies that are a little dark/weird
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I find it hard to work on my kindle probably don't know how to work it. I can't seem to find the place to go nd ask questions about my kindle. Maybe someone will see this and maybe I can get some help.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Just a little something when your day needs a little brightening. Turn that energy boost into something productive. Can't wait to see what is going to happen when I can buy the potion.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I hate the redesign.  It was so much better before.  It's so confusing now.  I just want to read what the forecast is. REDESIGN
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just like subway surf except BETTER. it is so much fun. I LOVE this game. You should really get it. Especially if you like subway surf.
0307472841|4.0|I discovered Henning Mankell when I was looking through books for sale in a hospital gift shop, waiting for my husband's procedure to be over.  I love a good convoluted mystery and this one is a beaut!  It give you a view of life as it was in China and move you unerringly through time to the present.  I don't want to give away the plot so I wont say more; but, the character development is part of the reason this book is so compelling.  This is my second (or third) Henning Mankell.  I enjoyed it so much, I bought two as Christmas presents!
B005ELQVGW|3.0|I was a little disappointed in that i felt that it rehashed some of Bjork's older material.  It wasn't as &#34;new&#34;-sounding as i had hoped from an artist I have been following for many years!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was worried that the ending would be too disappointing and I would have wanted more. I still want more but it was a better end than anticipated.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!  Like vintage Bowie from the 70's & 80's yet refreshingly new!  What an artist!!!!!
B0067TGSOK|5.0|If you are dreaming of independence through business ownership, this is your guide. Multiple examples and success stories, and some general pointers on how to proceed and potential pitfalls. Highly recommended.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|Haven't heard anything new from Kate Bush until now and it is good but I miss a real strong song on this one.
1781162646|5.0|It is not often I find myself laughing out loud while alone on my bed reading.  But this book does that to me.<br /><br />I am new to King.  I always feared him, the way you fear the empty old house on your street.  Noooo good could come from that, and sleeping is important to me.<br /><br />So, I started with 11/22/63 - how scary could that be ?  And I loved it !<br />Next I ventured \\"Under The Dome\\" (not sure why - who cares) liked that one a lot.<br /><br />Now Joyland - I normally read on kindle so I had to order this one up from the Library - great invention the library, people should use 'em more.  And now here I am being dazzled by King's skill and talent and obvious love of good clean sentences.<br /><br />There is a reason King is the best selling author of all time (as the book cover exclaims)<br /><br />The story is more than compelling and spellbinding is totally overused.  I can see each character; I can hear them too.<br />And what about the way King speaks to the reader:  \\"Hey, I was 21, remember ?\\"<br /><br />It is official I am a fan of Stephen King.  In fact, I am going to visit my library again and get all his old books.<br /><br />And what about that cover ?  I am a woman who likes men, but there is nothing subtle about those tits.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|, This is an adult series, without violence ,killings  and car chases.  A look into the world of advertising, and the flaws of the people who pursue companies, for their business.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|the most beautiful edition in thw whole world the box looks like a book and the art is very beautiful i already started to rewatch the whole saga.
B004G600A4|5.0|My husband and I love this movie as much as the Kids do!  It's funny, great songs, not too scary for the little ones, and the story line is great!  We have found that our kids have a hard time watching this movie straight through (4years old and 2 years old), in comparison to some of the other princess movies.  Definitely a must-have if your into the Disney Princesses.

0788859544|5.0|Our daughter is just getting into the Disney Princesses.  This is a great addition to our collection.  You can tell the age of the movie by the clarity of the picture but still a must have for a little girl!
0062255657|5.0|I loved this story - I've lived it! Like Gaiman's nameless narrator, I was a rather solitary, imaginative, bookish child of the post-war British Empire; that now-distant time of relative affluence and stifling conformity before the advent of televison, computers or mobile phones. I know this Dennis Potter-meets-Enid Blyton world - filtered through the inescapable cruelties and miscomprehensions of childhood, it was a time of cosy certainty for children; roast lamb dinners followed by steamed pudding with custard, and rambles down unsealed, blackberry-hedged country roads long since overtaken by suburban sprawl. But we knew about the borderlands of the wild things, us country kids. Unshielded from the realities of birth and death, of \\"nature red in tooth and claw\\", and with the veils of all possibilities still shifting about us, we knew that tigers lived under the bed and that gods and demons were as real as you and I.<br /><br />I see the influence of much-loved childhood authors lurking beneath the surface of \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\", authors like Kipling, Tolkien, Henry Treece, Rosemary Sutcliff and Alan Garner, whose work was shaped by the powerful presence of the natural world, the echoes of an older, more pagan England, the ancient battle between the forces of light and darkness, and the timeless themes of universal mythology; ritual kingship, the Goddess and the hero-quest as the one true story behind all legends.<br /><br />That the young hero of \\"Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" should find the Cosmic Ocean in a duckpond on a rundown farm at the end of a rural lane, guarded by the dread Triple Goddess - Maiden, Mother and Crone in the guise of a comfortably down-to-earth farming family - comes as no surprise to me. We fragile, inconsequential humans have always mythologized our lives in order to make sense of a terrifyingly random world beyond our control. And we've always known that reality lies in the perception, Gaiman and I.<br /><br />Category: Whatever you want it to be- adult/YA/fantasy/coming-of-age/fairytale/horror story/memoir...
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This is the best Christmas movie I've seen in years and one that could be enjoyed by the whole family. There are lots of laugh out loud moments.<br />Ann Summerville<br />[[ASIN:B00BGI7HGK Grandmother's Flower Garden (Pecan Valley)]]
B003JH8LPW|1.0|I don't normally do book reviews, but this one cried out for one.  I was recently on a family vacation, and had downloaded Dan Brown's forth installment on the Robert Langdon series, \\"Inferno\\", which was a great read.  I've read \\"DaVinci Code\\", \\"Angles & Demons\\", and \\"Lost Symbols\\", and all were great.  So I was only half way through vacation looking for another read and found \\"Deception Point\\".  Wasn't bad.  So then I downloaded \\"Digital Fortress\\".  Saw that it wasn't very well rated, but I'm a computer geek, and after all, it's a Dan Brown, so how bad could it be?  Oh my god.  Early on in the book, I was questioning whether this was the same Dan Brown.<br /><br />The plot concept is a good one.  Character development, not too bad.  The technical facts were god awful.  His research for the other books was great.  I don't think he bothered with researching technology on this one, which was at the center of the whole plot.  64bit encryption keys? Was this written in the 80's??  Brute force cracking of encryption??  Only as a last resort, not as the primary method.  Screen locks at the NSA with 6 character passwords that they don't bother to use most of the time?  Not likely.  He completely reverses the definitions of a computer virus and a computer worm.  System Security engineers will never be found crawling inside a computer to solder on an IC chip.  And a virus cannot cause a computer to melt down, I'm sorry - completely implausible.<br /><br />And then the characters, after they develop, perform actions that are completely out of character.  Their actions don't make any sense for what we know about the characters.<br /><br />I finished the book only to see how bad the train wreck was going to be.  If this book was not written by Dan Brown, no self respecting publisher would accept it.  Even so, I have to question them.  They couldn't have read more than the first couple of chapters before agreeing to publish.<br /><br />Very painful.  Unless you want to see how painful, don't bother wasting your time on this book.

0553582038|4.0|...this is still, on its own merits, a good book.<br /><br />Everyone complains that this is the book where the Song of Ice and Fire series begins to lose its steam, and I will say that I kind of agree there.  A Storm of Swords is an excellent novel full of action, violence, political intrigue, and as always wonderful characterization by George RR Martin, and topping that is a challenge. A Feast for Crows is inferior to the previous novels because, as many rightfully complain, not much happens--or at least, compared to the pacing of the other books in the series, not much happens.<br /><br />My main problem with a aFfC was the first third of the book, in particular the first 100 or so pages. The prologue concerns characters we don't know in a place we're not familiar with. Okay, that's fine. Then the ensuing chapters are more of the same thing. We meet the Prince of Dorne, a man we only know by his relation to a minor character in the previous book, and then we meet Damphair, a barely-mentioned uncle to a character we haven't seen since the second book. The reader is left wondering when the story is going to move on already to the characters we know and love. When it does, still, the pacing is very slow, particularly with the Brienne and Cersei chapters.  At least the Cersei chapters are intriguing because we get to know the way her sick mind works, and that's all very entertaining. The Brienne chapters, though, are a low point. When you think about it (spoilers, spoilers), what happens to Brienne from the beginning of aFfC 'til the end? She travels around looking for Sansa and Arya, meets a few people, kills some people who try to kill her...nothing really of note until the very end, when she meets Stoneheart--a character we've all been dying to see since the epilogue of Storm of Swords. Sorry, folks. You only get a glimpse of her. And Brienne's story is left at a cliff-hanger anyway, so all those slow chapters you read didn't even end any way final. Sigh.<br /><br/>But, despite all of that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, because the good outweighs the bad. The last third of aFfC is on level with the previous three books, particularly with the goings-on of Jaime and Cersei. When things implode for the Queen Regent, it's awesome and scary, and Jaime's reaction is just magnificent. True, there are no great battles, but the story moves forward, relying more this time on the politics and character relationships. There wasn't enough Sansa (Alayne) and Arya, but I enjoyed those chapters, even if I am a little frustrated with Arya's position right now in Braavos. Hopefully George RR Martin does what I want with that character and turns her into a killer assassin. I did miss the other characters (Dany, Jon Show, Tyrion), but I had the comfort of knowing they're in the next book, which is already released. I imagine if I read this when it came out and had to wait five years to know what happens next, I would be ticked off. Luckily, I got to jump right into aDwD.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows may not be on par with a Storm of Swords, but it's still worth reading despite its flaws, and in some parts it is just as great as its predecessors.

B007PJFIU6|4.0|I think this is just the american publisher's product (under license) versus the international version. The art is completely different and just as wonderful. All fans of dixit will love this. One star was docked because this one only accommodates 6 players rather than 8.
1451695195|4.0|This came out just after my 44-year old brother had a major heart attack and flat lined 7 times.  He told tales of seeing heaven, seeing our parents(who are both deceased), people in heaven telling him its not time-go away, he saw my aunt-she was mad and screaming for him to leave, etc.  He also says that everything was in black and white, yet it's the most beautiful place he's ever seen.  It made me believe that you go somewhere, I just don't think you can understand until you've been there and done that.  Proof of Heaven is a good read and just one man's telling of what he saw and remembers.
0525478817|4.0|I devoured this book in 5 hours and would have finished it sooner if it weren't for everyday tasks, such as eating, getting in the way. I became so engrossed in the lives of Hazel and Augustus that I didn't  want to put the book down. Green's realistic portrayal of cancer and the effect it has not only on loved ones but patients is refreshing. Green was able to take what could have been an unconvincing teenage love story and turn it into an unflinchingly accurate story of love, loss and acceptance while simultaneously making the reader not only sympathize but relate to the two protagonists.

0316228532|1.0|I was so excited to dive into a new story by JK Rowling. Within the first 50pages I was already getting the sense that this book was heading nowhere...and the F word 5 times on every page was getting really old. I tried to suspend judgement and kept on reading in the hopes that the plot would pick up. However, another 50 pages or so later and I realized that the book was just smut and not worth finishing. I dumped it in a trash can at the airport--not even worth reselling! So disappointing and trashy, without a trace of the creative brilliance in Harry Potter.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This is a very fun game, when I first got it a played  this game on my kindle for about one hour the game is very fun but I think it could be free because all you do is race an avalanche.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is the best book that I have read in the last year. The oral history aspect is very hard to do, but, with minor exceptions, Brooks excels at it. And thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />Its really not about zombies...<br /><br />Really. This book is a giant \\"thought experiment\\". What would happen if there was a global pandemic in our time? Whether you realize it or not, this book explores immigration, nationalism, nuclear war, nuclear winter, environmental collapse, changes in warfare, capitalism and global economic shifts. It even looks at religion, as Russia turns back to religion and the motherland. All wrapped up in a gripping interview format. It is like the indie documentaries you see on Netflix and Apple TV, only more intense.<br />This book explores immigration in nations completely overwhelmed by refugees, survival, what would we *really* do as a last resort? And it also deeply explores what would happen to the US, Russia, France, North Korea, China, Pakistan, India, and even Cuba, which becomes a world power. And Israel, that shuts its border wall and lets no one in. Despite all this it is not preachy.<br />The zombie part is interesting, and has some chilling moments. What would happen to the military if you had an enemy that could not be blasted off the face of the earth with techno weaponry? It returns to a pre-Civil War skirmish line, hand to hand if necessary.<br /><br />The movie is *not* like this book, despite the title. You've seen the movie trailers with the Zombies swarming faster and faster. That breaks all of Brooks' rules. They don't do that in this book.<br /><br />So why not five stars? It is really really difficult to present dialog that is unique to every individual. Most fiction authors stray mid-book to where their characters speak in the same voice (Orson Scott Card, for example, does it for most of his books). Brooks for the most part doesn't do this - I only noticed it mildly - once about one third into the book, and then once near the end. Otherwise near perfect characterization and dialog.the end. Otherwise near perfect characterization and dialog.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I enjoyed the way the story is told through the eyes of different survivors and victims.  I loved having to have to &#34;hear&#34; all sides of the story in order to complete the picture.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Language was so foul, it was almost unbearable to read.  There was nothing admirable about the two main characters.  The only reason I finished reading it was I couldn't imagine the ending of a story so convoluted.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|The more one watches this entertaining, well-written, and finely paced and nuanced classic, the more you realize why it deserves its lofty perch as one of the most enduring and endearing movies of all time. And the more you wonder why movies like this are so hard to find in the offerings of today. The dialogue is witty, crisp, and memorable. The performances are perfect. There is just enough symbolism and larger themes overarching the plot to put the story in it historical context, and yet it remains timeless. In the end it is about the universal quests for love and liberty, and a reminder that life in challenging times can make heroes of us all--and be fun. What more can one ask of a movie?
B00AYR2FQ6|4.0|Very hard to categorize the sounds on this impressive album. Sure there is an emphasis on country music --- and Matthew Houck is even sporting a cowboy hat on the back cover --- at least in regards to the arrangements and the instrumentation on some songs. But this isn't \\"normal\\" country music and I don't think there are going to be many fans of mainstream American country music who will appreciate, understand, or enjoy most of this album. This music is more thoughtful, quirky, and engaging than anything you'll hear out of modern day Nashville. I like one reviewer's description of this as \\"Pedal Steel Electronica.\\"Or perhaps \\"Electronica Americana\\" would be another apt description? But no matter how you classify the music on this album, there is no denying the addictive power of these songs. Mesmerizing, soothing, and just plain lovely. And I love that way that Houck's voice breaks when he sings. Heartache by the numbers ... and outside the lines. He sounds like he is feeling these songs, adding to the authentic vibe. This artist keeps getting better and better.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Little bit of a learning curve but fun and simple once I completed a few beginner maps. Can be frustrating since the AI is doing what AIs do best. Spam ships like they do and you have a chance.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|I was left feeling unsatisfied at the end of the book.  Too many storylines left incomplete and the ones that were completed were abrupt and unsatisfying.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I bought this album for myself and love it so much I ended up also buying it as a gift for my Dad. I enjoy listening to it on autumn evenings in front of the fireplace or on long drives when I'm in a quiet, contemplative space.  Reminds me a bit of Van Morrison. Really excellent work!
B004R36QUE|5.0|This one is a keeper.  I just loved everything about it.  One could see and hear every word.  A fine choice of actors.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and delightful.  The quests are easy and you can play the game and upgrade power ups without having to pay a dime.  Of course, if you pay to get credits, you could level up sooner. :)
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Impressive and mesmerising.  Looking forward to the second and third movies now.  And, it ended the way I wanted it too, although many would disagree with me.
B001AFF25W|5.0|I bought the Kindle version. It's an easy read and gives you practical ways to overcome procrastination. Brian Tracy shows you how procrastination is sometimes just decision making. Prioritizing tasks often means that some get put off. Looking at goals help you decide the right and most effective tasks to choose.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I didn't warm to the character or the story.  I enjoyed the bit about India and the animals, the imagination was working, but I felt no warmth toward Pi.  I thought it was quite repetitive too.
B008XJ8WE6|5.0|We enjoy this presentation of Joseph's life.  Well done, impactful, funny, colorful with great lyrics and acting. Costumes are great!

B006GWO5NE|2.0|This was sent with accelerated charger to fix the problem of the where the charger goes into a kindle fire being loose and not charging. It works great as a charger but did not help correct the problem. Amazon customer service was helpful and concerned on one call but complete idiots, for lack of better word, on other calls. We will not be buying another Kindle after this experience.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I don't usually bother to rate games, but this game surpassed my expectations. Great graphics, fun game play with good controls, and hours of addictive fun. I got this as the FAOTD but I would still be thrilled if I'd paid $0.99 or even $1.99. Even better, it doesn't harass you with ads or constant reminders to rate it. I'll keep an eye out for other Yippee Entertainment games.<br />My ONLY negative comment (and this is very minor, I only mention it in case the game developers read the reviews) was that on a few occasions the red birds did not want to leave their nests, and it would take upwards of 5 hits to make them fly away. Otherwise, the game has been glitch free and great!
1781162646|5.0|This was my first Hard Case Crime novel and I turned to the best, Stephen King.  Carnival themed novels are a big draw for me, because there's always a layer of slime underneath the family fun factory.  King managed to create the most likeable characters, especially Devin Jones. King made a wise choice in setting the novel in the 1970's, where a young man could still rely upon his wits and personality; enough to draw people in to help you in tight situations.  The crime is not the selling point for this novel.  It's the rich characterization, excellent writing style and non-anvil hints that doesn't insult the reader.  This is a must read novel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this cute and exciting game.  Fast, and exciting little game.  It changes with every try!!  Cute and exciting!!  Love it!
B00CH87HF4|2.0|To Gameloft's credit, this is the best attempt at free-to-play Diablo that I've seen.  It's much more of a game than last year's &#34;let's copy Eternity Warriors!&#34; Dungeon Hunter 3.<br /><br />All that said... I have no idea why I keep coming back to this series, wasting 3 days, then shaking my head / deleting the game.<br /><br />Equipment balance is rather bizarre.  Inventory is incredibly short in supply (unless you buy currency / inventory) for the first 15 or so levels of the game.  Weapon upgrade gems, which are fused / used to strengthen equipment, have a billion varieties and all take up the same amount of storage space as weapons or armor.  Shortly after opening up the goblin area, drops fall off completely and inventory space frees itself up.<br /><br />Virtual controls are decent.  Like all mobile games w/ virtual sticks, you will never have the precision you really need to play a game like this well.  You'll routinely face just BARELY the wrong direction and get hung up on a corner instead of going through a doorway, or will walk into the edge of a particle instead of dodging it.  There's no block button, and any sort of potion or buff system that makes a strategic difference (and isn't just a real-money sink) is sorely absent.  While you will be able to use your skills to strategic effect, you'll hit a wall every time you have a multiple-waves type encounter - normally for several mindless levels of grinding until you've gotten a decent enough weapon to make an impact.  It's surprisingly fun for the first 7 or so levels, but by 20 you'll have no desire to go anywhere near the game.<br /><br />The main reason progression is so slow is due to the structure of the &#34;wave&#34; encounters.  Sadly, you must weather the storm of atrocious online features in order to progress at any sort of a normal pace.  These encounters put you in a room with no terrain or strategic play-encouragement of any sort.  It's simply &#34;we're gonna throw every mob we've made so far at you, picked without any thought as to how their AI will stack up&#34; - this kind of progress gating is incredibly lazy on behalf of the developers and it's hard not to take it personally.  It's &#34;pay us to out-balance the shortcomings of our design and control&#34; - and isn't satisfying in the least.  That, or team up with a bunch of borderline-fingerless preteens that sit there and die for 20 seconds while trying to in-game chat....<br /><br />The game looks and performs spectacularly on Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  Rarely a frame rate drop - online is a different story, but that's not the device's fault, but rather the typical-to-mobile-games trash net-code / connection.<br /><br />Gameloft is still Gameloft.  They suck the soul out of genres you've already played to death, give them passable-at-best touch controls, and pace it in the most excruciating, money-grubbing way possible.  At least in this case the game looks good and there's enough to do to keep your attention for a few hours.<br /><br />I still can't see why anyone would pay for the privilege of playing the same boring game, but enemies now die in one hit.

B001TH16DI|4.0|I'll cut to the chase. The first movie looks so much better than its old DVD release, but still not that great for Bluray. Wrath of Khan also looks better than the DVD, but still not so great on Bluray. 3-6 look fantastic.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|Phantom is one of my all time favorites. I had the amazing opportunity to see this in LA for my 16th birthday with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, and have seen it live with other actors multiple times. This version showcases the music, costumes - it continues to be hauntingly beautiful!
B000GG4XJM|5.0|this CD was even better than I thought it would be. Anyone that likes Bruce Springsteen will love this music.
B00AU15HPC|2.0|Returned the CD due to a scratchy sound on most of the songs. Love Justin Hayward but was unhappy with the way he performed most of the songs on this album.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Movie was funny but predictable.  Really enjoyed the singing and the choreography.  Elizabeth Banks was hilarious.  I love the fact that I never have to worry about scratching the DVD and I can watch it any where.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is a great movie about a lonely robot on post human earth. It is very entertaining with an underlying message about where we might all be headed.<br /><br />Is great for both adults and children.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I can't believe this was Elizabeth Haynes first novel as it was one of the best psychological thrillers I have read in years.  It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  This is my favorite type of book and I look forward to more by this author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Managing such fond did end and did did she didn't did. Did she. She even Shane Shane Shane Shah dhs
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I do not want to give any spoilers, so I will just say I so hated the ending of the book that it ruined the novel for me.  I also think there was a lot unsaid and it really left you hanging.  I also felt the father was an unreliable narrator and wished we could have examined it from many points of view.  I was very disappointed considering the rave reviews.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the game very much. I hope they add more levels soon. Some of the puzzles were a little tricky, but still on the easy
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I saw this app and was interested in it. it has lots of puzzles of different types and is awesome.  no compliants yet
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Tried two Facebook apps on kindle HD & both aren't any good. Sticking to my laptop for the most part. Just good for a quick look.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|The Gmail App is easy to operate and very pleasant to eyes. Plus the ease to manage multiple accounts is awesome
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I read the other reviews about this being a waste of money because the Kindle Fire HD already has a camera.  However it is only 99 cents - not a tremendous investment.  The best thing about this is that it has a delay on it - 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.  Therefore you can press the picture button, hold up your Kindle to take the picture and then wait for the delay.  Using the camera that came with the Kindle Fire HD was horrible - several times I attempted to push the button (which was very difficult since it is facing the other way) and failed miserably.  With this App, I can press the button and then hold up the device to take the picture.  There are some other features which I have not yet test for so far so good!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Perfect!  I love how the cover allows you to prop my kindle up on its side. I often play games during my lunchtime at work.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|The author presents the facts as if he's in a hurry.  He doesn't develop his characters fully, so that each remains a type for the historical record he wants to present.  The characters are emotionally flat.  A disappointing read that came with high recommendations.
630471193X|5.0|Phenomenal movie. It's one of my all time favorites. John Travolta gave one of the best performances of his carreer.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Solitar is the only game I play on my kindle.  The only down size is  you may not get your chores done because you spend so much time playing.It is a lot of fun love it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I loved it. John Malkovich and Helen Mirren stole the movie.Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman were great, too.Pretty funny for being about CIA assassins.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a good app keeps me informed on the weather. Lets me know what the weather for the day will be so I can plan my day.
B005HSL626|5.0|I am hooked on playing this game. I really have to stay focus when I play so that I don't get the bomb. Trying to increase the score each time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. I recommend any looking for an awesome and free app get this.  It really will entertain you.
B000RIWB16|5.0|The white Stripes have such a great sound and this is one of my favorites by them! Got to love Third Man Records!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I'm addicted to my watch, and I use the stopwatch and timer all the time. But, you can only run one at a time. That is where this really shines, the ability to run multiple timers at once. The app is intuitive and easy to use. I love it!! I do wish it could be prettier, but I'm more a sucker for functionality over aesthetics, and this totally rocks in the functionality department.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|This is lighter fare for a Stephen King book but still enjoyable if you're a fan.  It has that element that I love in a Stephen King book-there is an underpinning theme that makes you think and evaluate what more is going on.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Easy to play, this is just what you'd expect from a hangman game. But, the drawing are better than the stick figures I am used to. Otherwise, it is a good way to pass a few minutes now and then. Intuitive, and you just get in there to start playing.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have FB on my regular computer and when I downloaded this app on my Kindle all it did was mess up both FB pages.I need to know how to transfer photos to the Kindle from the mac computer. help please
B0089LOG02|5.0|This one has been on my Kindle way too long.  When I saw it reviewed on Peeking Between the Pages I decided it was moving up on the list.  It was a good move.<br /><br />Its funny how it seems like a lot of books I read at about the same time all seem to have a common thread.  Lately the thread I've been seeing is possessions as holders of love and/or memories.  Everyone thinks Vivian should clean out her attic--get rid of all that junk she's never going to use again.  However, there are reasons she has kept all that stuff all these years and telling Molly about those reasons is the basis for this story.  The book alternates between Vivian's early life and the current day.  Just as it seems hard to believe women would travel across the country to marry men they never met, it seems strange in today's world that orphans would be put on a train and dropped off in small towns across America with very little screening of those who took them in, and little follow-up to see if a placement worked for a child.  On the other  hand, as Molly, and lots of other real Mollys in today's world can tell you, the modern foster care system isn't always any better.<br /><br />As Molly and Vivian work Molly learns how much they have in common and she is able to break down some of the  barriers she has erected to protect herself and is also able to reach out to help Vivian in a much deeper way than to just clean out an attic.<br /><br />While Orphan Train is a short book it packs a powerful punch.  Grade:  A.
0451197879|3.0|The book was fine. It's condition was &#34;less than pristeen&#34;. It was readable, the story was good and for the price, it was a good buy.
B005ES0ZKS|5.0|I have damaged nerves in both feet and it is impossible for me to wear normal shoes, so I have been through a lot of Crocs. They are loose fitting and the soft rubber allows me more comfort than any shoes I have worn.<br />I have had these only one day and thus far I am so impressed. I was able to place my insert in the shoe with no problems and the shoe fitted perfectly. The cushioning on these shoes is fantastic....They do not take all the pain away, but just to have had them one day I am truly impressed. I will post again after a month to let other know how they are going. So...for those out there that have pain in their feet I feel like these shoes should be given a try. I have been in pain for 9 years, I have had 4 surgeries and I am on disability ....so anything that helps is so appreciated...Thanks Amazon and thanks Crocs..
1781162646|5.0|Brand new book. Good read. I was very happy with it. I would recomend it to any Steven King fan as an addition to their collection.
1439152780|5.0|Mrs. Morton's books keep me entertained for hours and days.  It's a pleasure to read books that are so well written in a time when many people can barely spell.
B001BC2ZS6|1.0|I hated every minute of this book so boring I hated how it ended it was at to sad but I had to read it for school.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is so fun I could play for hours! I recomend this game to all people. At first I thought that it would be boring because it was free but my friend was right it is a great and fun way to pass the time!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|An owesome & timeless Disney movie. Me & my grandaughter won't get tired of watching it any time soon. Just like I did with her mom way back then.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What I liked about this book was that it wasn't a rehash of a story I've read before.  You have to draw your own conclusions as the story progresses because the narrator is part of the story and his motives about how he decides what he should tell you might be questionable.  While that is at times frustrating, I chose to roll with it and see where it would take me, and I enjoyed the ride despite its several bumps.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Reminded me of a 48 hour story. I would think I would know where it was going and then it would take a new twist in the story. Interesting characters.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I got this game cause I love zombies! The game is so much fun! Everybody that stops by, I make them play. They really enjoy it! You'll be selling alot more of these because of word of mouth. Mine. I'm thinking of buying them for Christmas gifts.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Is it a fun thrill ride action movie? yes.<br />Does it have interesting dialogue? yes.<br />Do the fights have some great moves? yes<br />Lots of quotable one-liners? Yes.<br />Is it funny? yes, haha
1612680003|5.0|This book has changed the way I look at money, finances, investing, and how I want to live the rest of my life. Easy to read and filled with exceptional insight. Those who complain that the book doesn't offer a step-by-step guide to becoming rich are totally missing the point. Essential book for anyone who dreams of becoming financially free!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|It is a really good movie!! Disney did a really good job on this movie! We all loved this movie!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Good storyline, great script, very moving, and watch the pros at work. Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii I am I am I am I am
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Hans Zimmer has produced another excellent soundtrack that raises the movie above a merely visual experience by immersing the viewer in music that stirs an emotional response.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best free rpg I've come across. I can't wait to try the rest of the classes out. Don't take my word, try it for yourself.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A great story with thrilling love, John Green portrays the hardships of a girl who loves a boy but does not want to die and leave him lonely, with a horrible twist you will never see coming, I recommend this read to anybody.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION IS AWESOME! The new update fixed the fire glitch and added cake+buckets! Not as many features as the computer version, but I highly recommend this game.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I ordered this for my grandson to watch since he is into the whole superhero stuff.  I got so engrossed in the movie I have watched it several times now!!!!
0671015206|5.0|I found this book to be full of good info and tips from the wealthiest individuals that have been successful in making their own millions!!!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I cant believe they'd give it out for free! Even with the save limitations it's still an amazing app. I can spend hours upon hours creating gorgeous one of a kind pieces of art!  Cant go wrong! So many different variants you can apply! The only real problem I had was when I used it in &quot;pics art&quot; (app), it took over Flow Paper entirely until I had to remove pics art from my device to get Flow Paper working again. Sneaky app! Now its working when I open it, yay! If you like creating beautiful art, even if you arent any good, this app is a must! Would love to purchase the full app, but the free one works so well! Dont want to be disappointed with the paid version! Eventually I will purchase it : )
B002BWP49C|4.0|I felt the movie did not live up to the pre release hype....but it did continue the  feel the need to see the saga to the end.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Perfect Ending to the series.  I enjoyed nearly every one of the series, but this book moved me. I realized the characters had become friends and I loved seeing the culmination of their lives. Very well written. I finished it in 3 days.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|The book is a well-written lie. He implies his success was due to his blog and social media. In reality he bought thousands of dollars worth of positive reviews. Amazon has tightened up their system, so the possibly of other Indie authors following in his footsteps are slim.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|Easy to assemble.  My two year old grandson loves it, though is a bit young to fully master the controls.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nicely made app, I like the way it finishes your game for you when you know you've won.  Nice lay out.
0738737909|5.0|This is truly one of the most beautiful tarot deck I ever seen and the accompanying book is very detailed! Very deep! Wow!
B003JJA59K|4.0|sad and depressing, but shows you exactly what we would face and completely makes you think about our futures and what this world will become.  the relationship between this father and son was so emotional.  i loved this movie.  the acting was incredible and went straight to the heart
B008BDZP3K|5.0|So you're intrigued by this Frank Zappa chap, you've heard a lot of different things about his music, you don't know where to start. Well; Hot Rats is where you should take the plunge!<br /><br />I could write forever about this album but in a bid to be more helpful to the Zappa novice I'm going to keep it brief.<br /><br />Where was the music world going to go after Sgt.Peppers but to Zappa's Hot Rats? It's a beautifully textured album, featuring a resplendent array of instruments from fair-ground organs, to clarinets, flutes, saxes and of course some blistering guitar for it was on this album album that Zappa was revealed as a supreme axe master! The quick succession of phases, textures and moods which permeates Peaches en Regalia especially is one of the LP's most attractive qualities. If music could capture colour then Zappa has captured a kaleidoscope of colour here.<br /><br />Zappa was by now also a gifted composer of the so called 'rock concerto'. There are moments when so much is going on it's like a busy conversation in which everyone is shouting at once but one in which the cacophony somehow shines with clarity and complete musical sense. A composer this intelligent could quite easily give us something stiff and serious but instead his style is one he clearly wants us all to enjoy and enjoy it you will.<br /><br />Not many have ventured to be so brave and daring as Zappa, he's a one off and always will be. However, I like to always sign off with a recommendation! Discharge Lounge, look them up folks, they have an EP named Honourable Discharge that I downloaded from a site called bandcamp and they are an epic, very tuneful and humorous live band to boot, the Zappa freaks amongst you will love them!
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|Iggy still has his attitude intact, and it's a solid effort from the Stooges. My barometer for &#34;great&#34; is &#34;Raw Power&#34; so this one is actually &#34;I really like it&#34;. I hope Iggy is planning on touring--that I would LOVE!
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I did like this movie.  It had a funny twist concerning expectations and what happens when a person assumes an outcome. Pleasantly surprised and enjoyable.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Whoa, I wasn't expecting much after 35 years, but this is great. Ozzy is &#34;dumb like a fox&#34;. He's still got it, and this thing rocks. Makes me kind of wish I'd have sprung for the $200 ticket to the tour this summer.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I happened to buy this app the day it was free, so, it's worth more than what I payed for. Is it worth $15, heck no.
B004FUPK6U|5.0|Inferno, in my personal opinion, is Argento's finest cinematic showing. As a huge fan of the Giallo genre, this film is not to be missed. The imagery in this film is truly amazing .
0062278096|5.0|This book is so much better than I expected.  Anyone saying to not buy this book is simply mad.  Not only does it have some very cute bantering between John and Sherlock on post it notes but it really puts you in the mind of Moffat and Gattis. Tons of behind the scenes fun facts and very in detail. Although the whole case file of The Reichenbach Fall had me in tears.  Love this book and am do very very glad that I purchased it.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|App works pretty well, but don't much like the ads that came with it.  (It did at least warn me that they were part of it before I clicked &#34;yes&#34;)  Now that I have it, I'd prefer to just have used the web for Google's services.  I'd just delete the app but I'm not sure that would even eliminate the ads.
B002RPR6DU|2.0|I knew that Doug Trumbull had done the special effects for some great movies (2001, Star Trek), and I wanted the check out this movie, knowing that he had directed it as well as done special effects.  Maybe I'm missing something, but both the acting and story-line were cheesy, just more environmental wacky-ness.  I wish I'd rented this, rather than purchasing it.  Now I have a movie on my shelf that I'll probably never watch again.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This product works very well. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because of two reason, both of which are minor in my mind.<br /><br />a) Once you lock it into position isn't not that easy to move it around. I believe this is because the arm is rated for fairly heavy items, which would preclude easy moving around without a tremendous increase in cost or compromise in design, neither of which are desirable.<br /><br />b) The downward angle of the first joint somewhat robs the surface underneath of access. I'm not entirely sure what this design decision is trying to solve. A slightly upward angle (or even no angle at all: make it straight) should not limit the surface access function as much. Can anyone explain this decision?
B000I8ERVM|2.0|Pretty disappointed, I heard some good things about this movie.  The movie was slow and dialogue is terrible, its not scary and the acting is mediocre.  The court room scenes are so bad its funny and that's half the movie right there.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, I was just hoping for more.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I recommend this game it's story is good and the graphic are awesome.  It's a giant ongoing puzzle which keeps you thinking. It was a great deal.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very intriguing and challenging game which will put your deductive powers to the test. I like it. My only criticism is that it comes with no explanation of how to play the game. Maybe that is part of the intrigue of the game -- you have to figure it out for yourself -- but for me it would have been helpful to include a tutorial.
B008476HBM|5.0|It was definitely not a quick, easy read, but I very much enjoyed every bit of it. I will absolutely be reading more of Jane Austen' s novels.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This DVD arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. The movie is very very good;<br />I enjoyed it very much.  Children especially should see this movie as it is about primates<br />who are much like humans with feelings. Just a very entertaining movie.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|I love this movie Pixar always does a great job! My kids find this movie great and enjoy it allot its also neat to help them not be scared of the dark and monster!
B000641D2Y|5.0|This DVD arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. Children will like this<br />movie very much. I am happy with the purchase completely.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|My interest roused by Tony Ortega's review of The Ocean at the End of the Lane entitled \\"In His New Book, Is Neil Gaiman Exorcising His Scientology Past?\\"(a question, by the way, the book  does not address directly), I read the first chapter on Amazon and immediately downloaded the Kindle version, jumping it to the top of my otherwise long reading list. I'd never read Neil Gaiman before--for shame and I'll remedy that--and I admit to curiosity about the possible autobiographical content (I was aware of his family's role in the enigmatic \\"church\\" of Scientology), but I stayed for the pure pleasure of an enthralling story.<br /><br />I already knew, given Tony Ortega's reproduction of a news clipping about a South African who committed suicide in the Gaiman driveway when Neil was a boy, that the author had drawn some on his personal story, and it is safe to assume that the rest of the book, no matter how fantastic or magical, is analogous to of his own story. Those who have been through the Scientology experience, where science fiction is promulgated as dogma, can perhaps better track with the reality behind the myth:  how a mere child, born into an environment where there is more fear than love, compensates creatively with the material he has (books, in this case) to build a cocoon in which he ultimately feels safe.  Jenna Miscavige Hill's Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape (2013) is a no-holds-barred non-fiction description of this same traumatic experience.<br /><br />But specifics aside, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a stellar example of  the Visionary Fiction genre, certainly not to be tossed into the Fantasy bin. Visionary writers, says Professor Edward Ahearn in Visionary Fictions: Apocalyptic Writing from Blake to the Modern Age, seek a personal way to explode the normal experience of the \\"real,\\" using prophetic visions, fantastic tales, insane rantings, surrealistic dreams, and drug- or sex-induced dislocations in their work. Their fiction expresses rebellion against all the values of Western civilization--personal, sexual, familial, religious, moral, societal, and political. Ahearn describes such writing as exhilarating, immensely disturbing, vital, and subversive.<br /><br />But Visionary Fiction, while it can be dark as Ocean is at times, is not fatalistic. According to the Visionary Fiction Alliance website, the first characteristic of Visionary Fiction is: \\"Growth of consciousness is the central theme of the story and drives the protagonist, and/or other important characters.\\" Appropriately, Gaiman does not spell out the lesson intended, if any in Ocean; but at its conclusion we know that a subtle something in our vision of life has been stirred up and changed. All the better that it lingers well past the end of the story, perhaps even finding its way into our own ponderings and dreams.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Does not even work. Crashes causes phone and kindle problems. A total waste of time. Why sell an app that is this awful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't play many tablet games but when i saw this i had to try it out!  All the minion fun you could ask for...for free!
1439163154|5.0|I found this book so riveting and raw. James Franco did an excellent in being able to tell these stories through the perspective of the teenage mind (male & female). It makes you wonder if HE actually had some of these experiences because they are so detailed. Not only is he a great actor, but he's also pretty good author.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Having all of Michael Buble's CD's, I can honestly say this is one of the best. It was so easy to download even for me.  :)
1439153663|5.0|Bought this for my mother by accident (she wanted the Kitchen Help), but it turned out to be a fantastic book! She was very pleasantly surprised. She thought the writing was very good, had a good historical narrative, and is definitely willing to purchase another book from this author. My mother is quite particular with her books, so this to me is a big thumbs up for this novel!
B000002I53|5.0|I have discover in Coltrane something special with music. I have started with Blue Train and then this one and I can say, I love both albums and he's awesome gift for Jazz.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game and its addictive! All ages will have fun with the game. It's challenging and entertaining..I highly recommend you playing it..
0061733199|4.0|Great book. Has a broad range of things to help educate the novice adventurer. Useful things to store in the back of your mind in case you find your self in some precarious situations.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|Don't have much to say about this movie it was ok.  This is all I have to say about this movie
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was such an amazing book. I enjoyed it because it had Nikola Tesla's journey and shared his joys and his failures. I found it very inspiring because it helped me to see that I'm stuck in a certain way of thinking and that I have kept holding myself back because of fear and rejection. I really enjoyed hearing the quotes from all different great people that I have admired and the book has helped me to see how I can change and be just as great as my heroes.<br />I strongly urge people to buy this book if they are struggling in life, if they are unhappy or just need to be inspired and shown how to find their passion. I can't wait to read his book : awakening your inner genius.<br />Well done on such a great book Sean Patrick. I hope you sell many copies :).
B005COO1X6|5.0|Read this book in a matter of a couple of hours. Stephen King at his best, weaving a story and painting compelling pictures with words. As usual, the ending is different than you think it will be. I won't spoil it for those looking to read a great story. Thank you Mr. King...you have done it again.
B008KFS77U|1.0|The green power free is better than this version. It makes my phone lag if I try use it right away. I can't send a text immediately. Sometimes my wifi will not come on and work right away. I wish I had saved my money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it, first book I could actually read and get through!!<br />And I read it in two days!! Definitely recommend
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|If you are looking to improve your hand/eye coordination this is a good game.  I didn't like that it just repeats the same scenes.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Who cares about how crappy the plot is, all that matters is epic kaiju vs. Jaeger fight and it delivered. Loved the movie, and will be buying it when it comes out
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Loved this book.The primate study was well drawn and the way the story let the reader construct their own understanding of  story worked for me.
B000SL1SSE|5.0|This movie has been out for 15 years and people are still bashing this film? Stop living in the past and move on, legendary's godzilla should make you happy, so stop worrying about how bad Zilla is and focus on next years godzilla
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Rented the movie to watch through Amazon Instant Video. My girlfriend and I loved the movie. A must watch movie.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I bought this item for my Macbook Pro and I like how compact the hub is. I havent noticed any reductions in data transfer rates either which made this a very logical purchase. Would highly recommend it
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is the best and scariest game ever. I mean I literally dropped my Kindle and ran after I saw him. I like how it's not until the like fourth page that he pops out because it gives me a good chance of winning. Though I have to say what happens after you win is very unfair. Hopefully in the next chapter they have it that when you win there's a way put and you can escape. The creators of this game are amazing. It's really creepy after you die or when you in a corner you can actually hear him talking to you. Overall it's an amazing and scary game it's worth the money.
1781162646|5.0|I am pleased with the book and will recommend it  to my friends<br />Thank you very much, all was correct
B00422LESO|5.0|I love anything Austen and this did not disappoint.  Seeing the Austenesque characters in this novel brought to life in this way was highly entertaining.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Bound to be one of our classics and probably one of Tom Hanks best ones. You people are great.<br />Keep the good ones coming. Thanks
B000P0J09W|5.0|Delivery was fast,Movie plays great&My children&I love this movie...I can see us getting a lot of use out of this one!!
1416550550|5.0|I found this book to be a well written modern gothic romance, complete with dark atmosphere, creepy characters and family 'plots'. I listened to the audio edition, which I would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game among all the games I've downloaded is the one I play the most but need to add MULTIPLAYER or perfect REALMS<br /><br />-THEGAMERATER
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|No need for me to go into any technical type aspects of this release as I just rely on the fact that I have been listening to Black Sabbath since about 1979 and I really like what I hear in \\"13\\".<br /><br />My favorite Black Sabbath is by far the Ozzy era stuff, but I still enjoy the Dio years and absolutely love Born Again with Ian Gillan on vox.  With that said, I am 100% on board with this new \\"13\\" release.  I think it sounds great and has some awesome jams.<br /><br />Stand out songs for me are End of the Beginning, Loner (great riff), and God Is Dead?.<br /><br />Damaged Soul - wow, what a jam session at 3.30 in!  Love It.<br />Dear Father - again some amazing riffing and jamming.<br /><br />Overall \\"13\\" is great.  Great to listen in the car too as it has an awesome driving beat straight through.  No need to skip any songs.
B005ES11VK|5.0|These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I love them. They are roomy, incredibly light weight - perfect.
B007N8RULO|2.0|The game itself is fine. However, the app freezes frequently between games, and I have to force-quit. Annoying. Would not recommend.
B0060AY85C|5.0|From the beginning to the end the characters consume you. Strength is the name of the protagonists. The love for each other and everyman is heartening. Anyone who likes a good story will like this read.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I  don't know why it took me o long to pick up this book, but it was worth the wait. Top of my list, best read, would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a dense story to sink their teeth in, you will come away with a sincere appreciation for the author's style.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very easy to use you don't  have to have internet to play after its loaded. Much like other solo type games, directions are easy to understands. You can choose different design for your playing cards.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game and fun to play.  Looking forward to helping child figure out the clues.  Need to come out with more levels sooner rather than later.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|As I remember only three short chapters of heaven story. It can be dream or confusion just at the time of gaining consciousness which he FELT for days or longer. Is it the scientific evidence that a neurosurgeon says? The content is very simple that he felt \\"love\\" and it can be the love of God whose existence he doubted. Becoming a best seller is a winning of editors, ad, and christian brouhaha.<br />Someone who believe dreams are (spiritually) meaningful may take this book seriously.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|If I were you and I was looking for a good game with good graphics easy controls and an entertaining game I would get this one
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Depressing movie. Not funny. Loved this little family in &#34;Knocked Up&#34;, but hate them here. Slow, dry and boring. Mom character is especially horific and whiny.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I had this album back in the '70's and forgot how much I loved her music until the Boston Strong concert.  This CD brings back such memories.  I love it and her!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Very Vibrate Colors, Great story line, A little disappointed with the ending,I won't say as not to spoil the ending. Some will be fine with it. My girls wished it would have been a little different. Great movie overall.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart does it again.  Arrived quickly - love the new songs.  Hard to believe it's been so long since I bought his first music - sounds just as good today.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I really like this calculator it's HUGE!! Unlike the store bought calculators you can see the numbers very clearly and it looks great on the Kindle Fire HD.  This would be a good tool to teach kids with too!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The MMB clicked multiple times when I clicked. Because I open new tabs all the time with this, it was quite annoying. But, through email correspondence with the company, they sent me another free of charge, and I am VERY happy with my customer service experience.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A beautifully written, heartrending story of courage and love. A life so far removed from what most western people experience.
0385344325|2.0|Charlie Rose had Lee Child on and I thought this book would be worth the read...I don't buy many books, so it was a leap of faith to buy this one.  The hero is so ....two dimensional male, all the stereotypes I think of American men, without giving more depth.  I'd like to read a book of a male hero with more depth, more sensitivity, more interesting as a human being.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining<br />It makes it fun to play a card game even if u don't have the actuL card game
1476733953|5.0|While it is not a deep novel, the characters are very believable and situations the have to deal with are challenging without being out of the realm of possibility. It is a story that helps us understand our present world's conflicts better.Good for adults and young adults.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a great game! Really enjoyed playing it! Wish there were more rooms to explore! Can't wait until you add some more!!
B005T87QCI|1.0|Purchased this game for my son yesterday and it would not play on my tablet.  Sound played but the screen was completely black and there was no way to exit.  Even tried uninstalling and going through the long download process a second time, reinstalled and it still would not play.  I would not download this app!
B004D2GMR6|5.0|fast shipping.....great gift/dvd for any Bon Jovi fan. Its easy to see why they're going 30 years strong! Great concert!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|really boring ambitious movie. the sci fi story with the asian girl could have been good but unfortunately the movie wants to explore all these other awful stories. everything else  besides the clone sci fi was beyond bad. the make up and accents of the different A list actors looked really bad and sounded terrible. the worst part was the story where halley berry and tom hanks speak in plantation slave english to each other, it was embarrassing to watch. its overall this is a really self indulgent film where big name actors get to play a wide range of characters with little regard to credibility or entertainment value. do not recomend.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's so easy to play, colors and different 1 minute or 5 minute sets keeps me hooked on. Will be playing this game for a long time.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|I think there is no better legacy to leave on this earth than art.<br />As a big fan of the blues, Albert King's music makes me happy that there's a way for him to be heard--long after he is gone.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is my kind of writer.  Her writing style reminds me of Hemingway's, that is, direct dialogue and commentary with very little use of metaphors. She talks to me directly, succinctly, with humor, without embarrassment or excuses or blame; no whining this author. That is a quality of writing that I find so difficult and so rewarding.  I read her book in two sittings and I wanted more.  I look forward to reading the best essays of 2013.
009950569X|5.0|It breaks being effective, attention-grabbing, and influential down to a science! If you speak, teach or write in any capacity a must read
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Looks great on my husband.  Bought this for a gift and he loved it.  Invicta makes great watches that look expensive but are affordable.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book was my light path for my body building journey,,<br /><br />It gives many informations and  explanations for what how and why to do it<br /><br />Involving what good to eat your training methods etc,,,<br /><br />Give it a shot and you won't regret it<br /><br />Meshari alhindi
B008QQP34I|2.0|I like the movie, but the third disc was missing.  Bought it used especially for the 3 disc edition, however the one missing was the digital copy, so I can live with it,  wasn't described how it was, but in decent condition.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Really ... this show can be quite confusing and frustrating. There is always movement between different time periods that dont always make sense. They could have left out the graphic sex scenes and put in more clarity to make the scene more seamless. I am all for thinking things out and I love surprises but some of this show is just plain stupid.<br /><br />Season 1 was much better eventhough it had some of the same time/place issues.<br /><br />I like a horror/thriller that doesnt leave you wondering how and why.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I loved the book and was really hesitant to watch the movie, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised. The movie is so captivating and does an excellent job of capturing all of the emotions from the book.
B002BWP49C|4.0|The movie I never saw. It was good now this vampire series makes since. A must buy Im glad I did buy them all.
B0011Z50VM|5.0|I love Staind and this album brought all my favorite songs together. I bought all their CD's when they were new but overtime I have lost some here and there. This album was a great buy to me.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I purchased all of these movies enjoyed them all. I also purchased all the books I love the actors and actresses.
B009FOBMBI|3.0|It is an okay album. I really liked their past albums better. This one had one or two big hits but the rest sounded strained like they were just trying to make an album without actually putting much thought into it.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I plan on doing what it says to do.<br /><br />\\"By day and by night I am prospered in all my ways\\".<br /><br />I am so grateful that I found this book. I encourage everyone to buy this book and live it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1612049214 The Adventures of Billy Chicken Toes & the Wolf: Add Your Own Art Children's Books]]
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Who doesn't love CCR. I was real happy with this purchase. Has all their biggest hits plus some songs that I didn't realize they covered. All in all it was a great purchase.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Recently, I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy S4 (SCH-I545) phone.  And I love it. {Sorry honey}  Love it so much I wanted to use it in my work.  So, today I ordered and paid for a Kindle version of the Internal Revenue Code (2013).  OK, keep the laughter down.  I'm a CPA and do lots of tax work.<br /><br />To make use of the Internal Revenue Code (2013) I downloaded the \\"Kindle for Android\\" software product from Amazon.  After 2 hours of fiddling around I finally discovered how get the product to download. Once downloaded the product installed itself.  I then press the OPEN button on the Amazon download screen.  When the application did not open, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Much later, and after I wrote the above shown drivel .....<br /><br />Then I determined that I should have reinstalled the factory version of the Kindle reader instead of downloading the Amazon version of \\"Kindle for Android\\".  The determination was made by looking at the active application log of my Samsung.  So, I told my Samsung to uninstall the Kindle reader I downloaded and reinstall the factory version I had deleted when I purchased the phone.  After the reinstall of the factory version was complete, I then UPDATED the factory version of the \\"Kindle for Android\\" reader.  At that point the Kindle reader icon appeared on my application screen and I was able to open the \\"Kindle for Android\\" application. Once open the Kindle application displayed the Internal Revenue Code.<br /><br />So, I read some of my favorite sections.  God, I'm boring.  I really need to get a life.<br /><br />Being very happy with the end of a difficult day, I returned to Amazon and purchased the Income Tax Regulations.  For some reason, Amazon executed a behind the scenes process which automatically downloaded the Regulations.<br /><br />I'm happy... And why am I happy:<br /><br />Costs<br />Internal Revenue Code book from school___________$160.00<br />Tax Regulations book from school__________________350.00<br />Total____________________________________________$510.00<br /><br />Kindle price:<br />Internal Revenue Code for Kindle__________________$6.99<br />Tax Regulations for Kindle_________________________9.99<br />Total_____________________________________________$16.98<br /><br />And so now you see the reason I'm so happy.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I have been waiting to have the money to buy this book because it had so many great reviews. I heard that it was fantastic but I don't know what makes it fantastic. The only part I felt connected to was the part towards the end and it was touch and go. I really feel like I wasted $10 and now it's $4. Very upset by that but what can you do, nothing. Back to the book. I read a lot of books in every genre but this was very difficult to understand and poorly written. Teens were talking like grown people and grown people were talking like teens. It felt forced like someone chose a tough subject to write about and everything else was just thrown in to fill up pages so a book about a very sympathetic issue could be sold. Was there a romance, I don't know because it never peaked. I think the great reviews are from people who haven't read any good authors yet or are just being sympathetic about the issue of cancer. I have family who have died from cancer so yes it is a touchy subject for me but this book, any book, should make you feel something, John Green's The Fault In Our Stars, did not. It's so sad because there is potential to educate people on this subject being a known author, but he didn't do that and it's just sad.
B00005K3O0|5.0|I actually got this book, the sequel &#34;For Love Of Audrey Rose&#34;, and the movie &#34;Audrey Rose&#34; for my sons birthday.  All arrived in good shape.  I am sure he will like them since expressed an interest in the topic.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this series! I couldn't stop watching! The great thing about this is that I can just play the next episode!
B006LS7DQE|2.0|I loved playing this game until I got t  a certain point and then crashed. I can't go through any portals anymore so I can't play. I even contacted Namco and they told me it wasn't their problem to fix. Awful and waste of money!
0451169514|5.0|It is so scary that just a genious like King could think a book like this.<br />IT is one of the most famous horror novel in the world and there's for sure a reason<br />It's a must buy if you like King or the horror in general.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game to play. Fun way to pass the time. I have really enjoyed playing it.<br />Every one should try it.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I highly recommend this film to anybody who loves Mozart or at the very least are interested in Mozart. I loved this film so much!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|My friend &amp; I downloaded this app as the free app of the day. We really enjoyed it. So much fun for trying to find the gems. Very entertaining!<br />Must try it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am a tween and I LOVE this game! its so adicting and I love how you don't need Internet to play it. Go minion rush!!!!!!!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Not sure how he does it read my first le Carre in 1980. You will not be disappointed , his characters are deep and the narrative/dialogue is sublime.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Just got this album on vinyl, arrived in good condition, though got it on digital, still feels like getting the vinyl one, all the songs are just amazing
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this is stupid candy crush is like the best game ever and you guus don't have it.  it makes absolute no sence so please get the actual candy crush saga
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Lots of fun, dragons are cute, gets more challenging as you level up. Great graphics, the best part it's free!!
0425256162|4.0|A stunning futurist extrapolation. Can be lengthy in its explanations at times, however thrilling. I impatiently await Poseidon's Children part 2.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have now used this rangefinder for five or six rounds and it is everything I hoped it would be.  It fits easily in my hand, is easy to use and very accurate.  I now no longer have to guess my distance to the flag whether I am in the fairway, in the rough or anywhere else I may find myself on the golf course.  And if you have ever seen me play you know that I tend to experience the entire golf course.<br /><br />The pinseeker technology works as advertised and picks up the flag even if the green is framed in trees.  I would definitely recommend this rangefinder to other golfers.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|Interesting take on how even entertainment was strongly influenced by the politics of Nazi Germany. The acting is wonderful, and I loved the musical performances. The movie is a bit dark, as you would expect it would be given the subject matter.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ana is just a giant mess of a human being. She's insecure to the point of it being laughable, 'klutzy' (even though she only trips twice in the entire book), and a complete ditz. She's a virgin (of course) who's never taken any sexual interest in anyone before.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Christina Aguilera was absolutely fabulous with acting and musical performances that I hadn't expected to be anything more than adequate. Cher was Cher, and she was as good as she always is. She plays a &#34;burlesque theater&#34; owner, whose entire life's love of the performance is embodied in her mostly successful brick and mortar theater. The money isn't coming in fast enough to keep the theater, and the plot is based on saving the business and of course a love story that's actually interesting.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The reason for my review title is because I did not expect the twist.  So was the main character a good guy in the beginning who by his environment went to the bad side or was he dishonest to begin with.  Very good read who likes lawyer stories and the writings of John Grisham.
0142000671|5.0|I bought this book for school, I need to make annotations as I read, and the space to the side was perfect for making important notes! There were also no damages to it. It was new as requested, and I recommend this book to people in similar situations.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A marvel of a book from a master storyteller. I am always amazed and amused. A young man receives an incredible gift from a young girl he barely knows. In the process he comes up with a fabulous tale to try to explain it... or is it the truth?
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and I absolutely love it. Cute, charming, and a great plot. Had to rent it to watch it again right before I went to see Monsters University.
159463176X|5.0|I have read all his of his books.  Each one is better than the last.  Read them all, you won't regret it.
0345529057|5.0|I've had no issues with the binding or formatting of the books.  I'm into the 3rd book already and they seem perfectly sturdy and I haven't encountered any formatting issues really at all (and I review and edit documents for a living).<br /><br />As for the content, the stories are incredible.  Other reviewers have gone into great detail, so I will keep this part short. He has created an interesting world with a variety of characters.  His way of jumping from character to character in different chapters is unique and really keeps me interested.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was my first<br />Book of thos author and it was very enjoyable.im now going to read the hit by same author
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Jerry Cantrell's obsession with vocal harmony has finally paid off, musically the band is as always great! But integrating Duvall took some time! A new chapter in the AIC saga has begun!
B00340LM8C|4.0|Lighthearted crime caper, stunning visuals of the French Riviera, a very natural and polished performance by Cary Grant. Landmark film for Grace Kelly, set her on the path to become the Princess Grace of Monaco.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|One of the best shows that has hit tv in years!!! Smart, savy, mind the anatomical gore, its there, but other than that finally a show that takes it a level up!!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I love Mahjong, and this version offers many game selections. I will recommend this game to all my friends. Thanks
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If a person is looking for a first hand account of what goes through the mind of a modern warrior in the war zone, this is a must read. Chris Kyle talks about his deployments and life in a way that makes it real for the reader.  This is the best autobiography that I have read that focuses on the person and what he was thinking more then the technicalities of the battle s.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I can't wait to read the rest of the book with this series. I rate this with Rick Roriada Percy Jackson Series I can't wait to see what happens to Thor and the rest of the kingdom
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Book #62 Read in 2013<br />The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern<br /><br />Marco and Celia are bound to each other by a competition they have been entered into by their father/guardian.  They do not truly understand the lengths that this competition will bring them to and the venue for the competition is the night circus.  The circus performers are all tied into the competition so the weight of many lives are weighing on Celia and Marco.  The two fall in love which complicates the competition, to say the least.  This book has great characters, a paranormal aspect that is woven expertly throughout the story and twists and turns to keep readers engaged.  I enjoyed it.<br /><br />[...]
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I mean it works but paying for it to play some fancy music in the morning's. really,.................so I just say don't get this trash
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love this new Angry Bird game, so much fun to play and such interesting ways they attack. So happy I got this if you want fun this is the one to get, once you start you do not want to put it down.<br />Try it you will love it.
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|What a movie! Not at all what I expected. This is the kind of movie you keep thinking about for a long time afterwards and you start discussing and thinking it over with others. You almost need/ want to watch it a second and third time, so you can fully appreciate &#34;it&#34; ;o), without wanting to say too much... Wicked story, many unexpected turns and really has your attention till the end. One of the best movies I have seen lately!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|this album by far is up there for best album of the year in my opinion.  way better then kanye west album as well as jay z album.  he keeps it real while remaining humble.  Those who put kanye and jay z above him are clearly not listening to the album and the story he tells.  Wale and J. cole albums are definitely about what music should be, along with Kendrick Lamar.  Todays music it is hard to find good music.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Really fun movie even for adults.  I finally know what the little yellow things are.  Makes me want to see the second one.
1936608898|4.0|I bought this because my daughter went through the whole30.  She's enthusiastic about it, but I don't have gut problems.  I'm 80 years old and do have lots of inflammation but not a great deal of pain.  I'm interested in the concept, but I doubt that I'll do the whole30 program.  It just seems so restrictive, even for 30 days.  I am trying to eat healthier for various reasons, including losing 10 pounds.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great to have....It lets me see when I am about to run out of battery life when I am texting or playing my games. Thanks for the app.... babygirl3674@hotmail
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love all of the cute little minions and it cool how the game is set up and also I play it for hours I love this app hope you will too.
B000W9399S|5.0|Basically, this book is beyond amazing! It's funny the whole way through! the characters are fun and likeable and the writing is superb!!! (Sigh) It's simply one of the best books i have ever read and I recommend it to anyone who loves a great story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will leave you emotionally scarred. I'd heard so many great things about this book and finally decided to read it. In a way, I wish I hadn't because I feel like before this book i was so careless to the world outside of my life. This book has opened my eyes to things I hadn't even thought of before. I thought the book \\"Mocking Jay\\" by Suzanne Collins was a depressing book but after The Fault In Our Stars, I am officially scarred for life. But in the best way. This book by far is my favourite book of all time. Thank you to the wonderful author that decided to gave the courage to right a book with Romance, suffering, death, and utter insanity all in one book.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I am not into the &#34;Graphic Novels&#34; so my take is more from a story line and acting standpoint. Actually quite good acting 5 stars. The story line is relentless in it's constant turmoil and crisis 3 stars. Looks like the animators had a lot of fun.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game! I like how you can exit the game, and it still makes money while you're gone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Excellent radar on demand. A must during hurricane season in Florida. I really enjoy the Extended forcasts and the Extreme weather alerts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game of the year I LOVE This Game your man who was your man who was your man who was your man who was your man who was your man who was your man who was your man
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I'm kind of haunted by this book right now!  It's the last of Gillian Flynn's novels that I've read, and by far my favorite of her three.  I just wish that I hadn't read it so quickly...
0440423228|5.0|This is a great graphic novel. My only problem is having watched the HBO series faithfully it's hard for me to wrap my head around the way all the major characters here look compared to the live actors we've all become familiar with.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is awesome but the only thing I don't like is  the updates<br />It doesn't come out at the same day as Apple
0425252868|5.0|This is a terrific book that shows what both the Germans and Americans went through.  It is hard to visualize that the Germans had to continue to fly despite the large number of missions they had flown, unlike the Americans who after 28 missions could return home.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in WW II history.  Excellent writing!
B00B7ERH04|5.0|The camera on my Kindle Is awesome.  I love it and will make sure all my friends know about it.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Thought it would have more stratigic action.  I would recommend it.<br />Not what I thought it would be, but still fun.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|You can love this book for its sentences, for its insights, or for its total ambiance. I don't think of it as a story-driven book, but the story is fine too. I bought the Kindle Edition after a good review in the NYT and have really enjoyed it. The writing is very good without calling too much attention to itself, and there are many insights into human (and animal) nature. But I think I liked most the overall intention of the book toward animal rights; it does not seem to me to be directly a treatise on animal rights, nor is that a driving issue in my life, but this book leaves you with a sense of the importance of that issue whether or not it seems central to your world. The book conveys Truths about that issue without arguing the points, which I think of as one of the chief advantages of the novel form. A very good read. I look forward to more by this author.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's very easy to type into and read.  I use it all the time now instead of my regular calculator.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A very brief, and interesting account on the greatest minds ever, Tesla. I could finish this in a single read, and am left with a positive feeling.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Every time I watch Mamma Mia movie, I feel like I'm on vacation on a sunny far away island.  The movie is a joy to watch and the ABBA songs are very true to their original renditions, as if ABBA is singing them.  Who doesn't love ABBA?!<br />I saw the Mamma Mia when it first came out as a stage musical and I believe I like the movie version much better!
B002BWP49C|5.0|i have all of the movies. but this one. now i have it too. played good and in good shape. come on time. ty good job

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Alright so I bought this item almost 3 weeks ago and it seems like a great item.  You have the 4 customizable dpi settings, a customizable color scheme and amazing accuracy with this mouse.  Only issue I have had so far was learning how to customize the mouse acceleration and mouse speed because it was flying all over the place when I installed it.  After correctly getting the settings right it behaved normally.<br /><br />It was weird getting used to the large size, as I had a wireless mouse that was half its size, but after a week you get used to it.<br /><br />Can I say I'm happy with this mouse:  so far yes!  If anything wrong happens in the future I'll re-post.<br /><br />Final thing to say, I have to give it to Anker for their support team and caring about customers because I got like 4 emails from them and Amazon asking about my satisfaction with their product.  These guys seem to care and I have the feeling, after this and seeing how they properly deal with complaints, that if anything happens to this mouse in the next 6 months they will take care of it for me.  Good job Anker doing the right thing!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Have very much enjoyed this series, nice to have dvd's because want to watch again.  Acting is great and storyline interesting!!

B0054XOMX4|5.0|I purchased this for my nephew. He was quite intrigued by the Japanese packaging.<br />Nicely made, I think these look better than the ones available in the US Market.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|I'm currently struggling with the repair company to get this watched fixed. Seiko has never been a brand I was too thrilled about and I know why now, but the watch was nice looking and thought I'd give them another try. Well that was a mistake. I had to pay to ship it back to them and now I'm trying to tell them, with my original invoice that the watch is still within the warranty. There service center reps are not too helpful.<br /><br />More to come...
B001PK5TIM|4.0|If the title didn't give it away already, TOKYO GORE POLICE is nonstop batshit insanity. Sometimes the movie displays self-awareness, and other times it makes you blink and think, &#34;Did that REALLY just happen?&#34;<br /><br />I'm not even sure what to think anymore. Life is confusing. See TOKYO GORE POLICE.<br /><br />Not for the weak of stomach.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|An oldie by goodie.  I laugh everytime I watch this movie.  I really is cute.  A couple of tear jerkers in it also.  A must to see

B005D63ICI|5.0|Not for the faint of heart.  I think most people know that.  I never thought I would enjoy a character who kills people.  But I love revenge movies, and everyone he kills is inexplicably evil.  These are the people that would cost our theoretical society millions of dollars to prosecute and he is saving us the trouble.  I know that is wrong, and is bypassing the judicial system, but there is some sort of justice there.  In an imaginary world, of course.

0757302661|4.0|As a first time mom, I am looking for a way to deliver my baby naturally. A co-worker recommended the hypno method,  but I didn't want to spend a lot of money and have to dedicate countless hours to classes. So I read the book! I got a lot out of the technical explanations as well as the breathing exercises and relaxation cd. I just couldn't get into the true hypnosis part of it. I can imagine I'll use the parts that I felt work for me and it has to be better than not doing anything at all,  right?
0375842209|4.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" is a long tale set in Germany during World War II.  The main character and the book thief of the title is a feisty young schoolgirl named Liesel Meminger.  Her young brother dies at the start of the book.  She takes her first book shortly after her younger brother's death.  Her mother disappears, and Liesel is left in the care of a foster family in the town of Molching, Germany.  Liesel is nearly illiterate at the beginning.  Under the tutelage of her foster father, she learns how to read the first book she took. So begins her passion of words and books.  She develops a close friendship with a young boy named Rudy Steiner, who is obsessed with the black athlete Jesse Owens.  A major turning point in the book occurs when her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, hide a young Jew named Max, a man whose father once saved Hans's life.  Max writes a book for Liesel by writing on the pages of Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf,\\" the pages of which he had made blank by painting them white.  A deep connection is forged between Liesel and Max.<br /><br />One of the most unique features of the book is the use of Death as the book's rather compassionate narrator.  Throughout the book, Death makes interesting side comments in boldface type.  By allowing Death to narrate the story, Zusak brings a haunting quality to his story.  When speaking of human nature, Death comments, \\"So much good, so much evil.  Just add water.\\"<br /><br />The Book Thief has received many awards from around the world and has been translated into many languages.  The author is applauded for his daring.  Book reviewers rave about the book.  There are a number of reasons for this.  It celebrates the power of words.  We get to see the rule of the Nazis from a unique point of view.  This is clearly an important piece of work, and it's a story that will keep you interested until the very end.  The characters are memorable.  Young Liesel is a character you will long remember.  One professional reviewer described the writing as \\"elegant, philosophical and moving.\\"  In the end, it was the prose that I felt was not what I would have liked.  Other recent books with memorable young characters (\\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"Peace Like a River\\") had much better prose in my opinion.  I would have liked to give this book four and a half stars; but that's not possible.  So I gave it four stars because I saw the book as less wonderful than the vast majority of readers.scribed the writing as \\"elegant, philosophical and moving.\\"  In the end, it was the prose that I felt was not what I would have liked.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|I bought this due to all the great reviews and I now wonder if they were reading the same book.  It meanders from time period to time period without good transitions.  I do not recommend this book .  It is not cohesive.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|One of the only faults with the hero Jack none Reacher is his dislike of Christianity.  This was hinted at more subtly in other novels but once again the villian is a devout Christian, albeit one of the extremist variety.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins has again crafted a masterful tale of suspense and adventure.  I purchase his books understanding that my sleep routine will be stressed and my attention compromised until I reach the last page.  His far-reaching imagination continues to amaze me.  The addendum ending will lead to greater mysteries (I Hope) but i don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't read it yet.  Don't miss it if you like James Rollins.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I like this game, but it sometimes has hard levels. For example, When Pigs Fly level 27 is hard and so is Road Hogs level 5. Also, I have a question. Why isn't Rise & Swine on here yet? What's taking it so long to appear? I know I did the same thing for Flight in the Night. I am also eager to see the new suction cup wheels. When will you put Rise & Swine on here? I am looking forward to be playing it.<br /><br />This was written by Lisa's son Sam, who is a true Angry Birds fan.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|Seriously, I'm not surprised this film was delayed multiple times. It was really a bad script.  The anachronisms alone were beyond the pale (I mean, seriously, insulin?) and Famke Jannssen was completely phoning it in.  For a movie of this ilk that actually is fun and not a bad plot, go with Brother's Grimm.  Gemma Arteton is always a pleasure on the eyes, and Jeremy Renner makes a competent action hero, neither really deserved this film.  It could have been so much better in so many ways.  Is it entertaining? Yeah, sure. However, it does kinda run like a teenage boy's D&D adventure.
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|just wanna see a gruesome act? , go ahead and watch the movie. do not have high expectations... adults wont feel scary at all.. (men).
B004GJXQ20|1.0|Nope. Don't get the hype. Poor descriptions, one-dimensional characters, painful plot development.  A waste of an afternoon reading this derivative work.  Won't waste time writing more - it was just not good.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Even thou I've never been to a opera, or a theatrical performance, i really wanted to see the cast's work at the movie. it felt a little weird in the initial few minutes..  but then the story took over it.. the cast have lived the movie.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This film is long.  Very long. And, it needs to be.  Telling a story like this in 1:59 minutes can't happen. Very character driven and with some of the best casting, say, EVER, this film really nails it on the head.  I think the film harshes on Lee a bit, and really is pretty anti-union in tone, it's a joy to watch on a Saturday afternoon when you have no other plans or if you are home sick. Because, like, it's long.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Very first Mahjong app I put on my Fire and have never looked back. Great levels and layouts. I have had to restart from scratch twice (replaced device).

B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is a great series, Both consisting of Common sense, and Greed. Like any other addiction, Walter White had gotten addicted to making Illegal money. It will be sad to see the series come to an end, and with Family involved, it won't be a &#34;Happy Ending&#34;.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Don't get me wrong, Wolfgang is a great album. 1901 might be the only song I've heard on the radio that prompted me to run to the store and by the CD in the last 5 years or so. That said, every song on Bankrupt! is outstanding. I can understand some folks not liking it as much as it is more electronic and perhaps more 80's, but considering that I love 80s music, this album and its melodies and layers is truly one of the best things I've heard in a long while.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cool little game. Runs great on my HTC one.<br />Can be addictive. You better have fast fingers, lol. Highly recommend this game. And it is free.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was okay. It was not as good as the other 2 books.  Predictable. It was not worth buying it.
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|First, let me say that I am an ardent Sibelian.  I have listened to and owned numerous recordings of the symphonies.  I first heard this cycle on LP when it was issued in the 1970's.  I thought it was the best ever, and I still do!  Bergland did a masterful job of instilling Sibelius in the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, who played this with all the passion and conviction of a Finnish ensemble!  The re-mastered sound is terrific, too.  I am so glad that this set was finally released on CD- and at a bargain price!!<br /><br />Don't pass it up!

159562015X|4.0|I've taken personality tests with accurate results; Myers Briggs and the DISC (jung).<br /><br />Personality tests are great for just general learning about myself and the type of person I am. Though, when it comes to something I can act on, these tests are lacking. I'd categorizing them into entertainment, honestly.<br /><br />I've been looking for a way to discover my strengths so I can focus on leveraging them to their fullest. Something you can't do until you know what they are. StrengthsFinder did this for me.<br /><br />The book is a catalog of strengths, each of their descriptions, and action steps you can take on leveraging your strengths. But the biggest plus to having the book is that you can lookup your friends/colleagues strengths and understand why they take certain approaches to the decisions they do and how to work better with them.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who cares on improving themselves. I've bought copies of this book for my parents, by brother, and two of my co-workers; this is how much I believe in the test.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Ok, this is my new favorite game! I haven't stopped playing since I've downloaded it! It looks really simple, but don't let that fool you bcuz it's really complex. You'll be playing every chance you get, trying to get just the right angle! Great game!
B009YQJ322|5.0|I was uncertain what to expect from this film. I adore Karl Urban and am somewhat familiar with the graphic novel series but... unfortunately, also familiar with the absolutely dreadful \\"Judge Dredd\\" - so, all in all, I believed it would be at least worth a go.<br />I was pleasantly and awesomely surprised. This film is kick *ss - no if's, and's or but's about it. Karl Urban's Dredd is relentless in his pursuit of justice. He is... amazeballs. The rookie role (Anderson) could have been dreadful but this was certainly not the case. Lena Headley's Ma-Ma is a be-hatch of the highest variety. Which... really is the entire point. However, warning: This is a violent film. It is an unmitigated violent, action film. There is no fluff or contrived romantic aspects to it. Which is precisely as it should be.<br />I shall be terribly disappointed if this film does not get a sequel.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved it. I am actually rereading the series for a second time. The pace is fast and I loved getting to know the characters once again.

B0078XGEK2|5.0|If this book could be rewritten for grade school children and made mandatory I think that a lot of today's societal issues in America would start to go away! A friend of mine turned me on to this book and it really provided me a lot of clarity. Love is not some ushy-gushy-Hallmark card feeling. Life isn't about being handed everything and then asking for more. The only thing I'm entitled to in this world is hard work. This book really opened my eyes to see that the way I had learned to live life isn't wrong, I was much closer to the right path than many people before I read it. I have recommended this book to a few people, unfortunately only one has attempted to read it. I definitely recommend this book highly! I think that if you live any other way you are really missing &#34;IT.&#34;
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have always been intrigued by this movie after watching it for the first time. Had to have in my collection, and a great price for a Blu-ray trilogy.
0099532042|3.0|Very good read.  Mankell is an excellent story teller.  Unfortunately I think the political overtones came to dominate the novel.  I came away feeling that the undercurrent political message was to glorify the murderous regime & dictatorial legacy of Chairman Mao.
038572179X|2.0|Bought this for a book club.<br />I'm sure it is a good book, but did not appeal to me. Sorry.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Not since &#34;Titanic&#34;, by James Horner in 1997, have I fallen in love with a soundtrack.  I never thought an album would ever surpass the great and timely work which &#34;carried&#34; that epic movie.  However, as time marches on, new discoveries are made, and new highs are achieved.  This album is to the music world, which &#34;the Dark Knight&#34; is to the movie world.<br />As with the &#34;Man of Steel&#34;, I shutter at the thought that a sequel could surpass this.<br /><br />Herman Cummings

B004HO6I4M|5.0|When I received it, it was in perfect condition. A great movie for a long car ride with the kids or just a movie night.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|No complaints.this one is slightly different with the western theme but If you liked thier previous albums you'll like this one as well!
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|The scariest thing about this movie is the fact that I watched more than 30 minutes of it.  This is not a very well-written horror movie.  The scares just are not there.  There are a few creepy and disgusting parts, but nothing worth talking about.  Thank god for those big red boxes that let you rent titles like these for one buck.  Trust me, if you are looking for thrills and chills, stay away.  If you love gore and mindless Saw-type movies, try it.  Either way, it is NOT worth buying.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|I'd never read it until it was available on the kindle book store.  I am glad I finally did as it was a great read.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I will admit... I had not heard of Robert Pattinson until the Twilight Saga came out. Being a woman, I do enjoy Twilight a lot. However, Twilight has NOTHING on Cosmopolis. He played a very believable character. I have read the book by Don DeLillo, and he fits the position to a 'T'.The dialog was spot on! (I didn't understand a lot of it, but I didn't in the book either. It did seem very convincing!) If you hear any bad reviews of the movie, they probably didn't look into the film very well.<br /><br />I could watch this film over and over!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I went into a camera store to purchase a backpack for my camera and accessories.  I could not find one under $100!  Then I went onto Amazon and found this one for $30. This was the best choice I made.  I stood under a sprinkler system and my bag got wet and nothing happened to my items inside.  They stated it was waterproof when I purchased it and I do believe it is.  It is spacious and has extra compartments for me to carry other items besides my camera and accessories.  I don't feel like it is heavy when carrying it on my back and I really like it because I am able to take pictures and not worry about it falling off my shoulders.  It's like hands free.  I would highly recommend this bag!

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I ordered the wrong film that I did not have the equipment to plat it on. I returned the film in good faith and requested a copy that would play on my equipment. Your answer was to chage me a restocking fee and I never did get a playable disck that would play on my equiptment or a refund just the restocking fee. I therefore have no further intentions of ording from your company. Thank you
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|We gave this movie a 5 stars when we saw it in the theater.  It was awesome.  The movie was also like 3.5 hours long.  Amazon cuts off about an hour and removes some key parts of the movie.  It was a waste of money through Amazon and they give no disclaimer that it's not the full version.
0770437400|3.0|With more than 2,000 reviews, you hardly need mine, so I'll make it quick: World War Z tells the story of a decade-plus-long fight to survive a global zombie epidemic. Instead of telling this story in conventional narrative, focused on one or two scrappy bands of survivors--the zombie-story norm--WWZ presents fictional interviews from survivors, an attempt at a Studs-Terkel-esque narrative pieced together from oral histories.<br /><br />World War Z stands out for being a genuinely global zombie story, looking at how the breakdown of the global economy might affect lives the world over, and at what sorts of military responses countries might deploy against the threat of the undead. It's a nice idea, blowing two big zombie tropes up to a massive scale: critiquing modern capitalism and showing the many ways in which humans might pull together or destroy one another in a fight to survive. It sweeps some of the me-me-me rugged individualism out of zombie survival.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Brooks just isn't a good enough writer to really pull his concept off. His oral history narrators all sound remarkably the same--he doesn't differentiate between them well enough to convince. And the stories he tells with some of them fall into TV-movie tidy, sappy territory--the story about the mysterious voice over the radio helping a downed pilot, for instance--which breaks the attempt at complicated realism he seems to be hoping he's pulling off elsewhere.<br /><br />In the end, this is fluff--more a meta commentary on war oral history reporting than anything else. In retrospect, I feel like I could have better spent my time reading either a real war oral history work or an actually taut survival horror story.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I had never read this author before but the book was recommended by a friend, and I am so glad. It moves quickly, it is touching, it is happy, it is sad, but overall, it was a wonderful book.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I love this app!!! I have used several other task apps, which only partially did what I needed. Until this app, I either used task apps that integrated and synced with my google tasks but did not have notifications, or used apps that had notifications but no google sync. This app does both. It syncs with my gmail and gives me notifications, which is exactly what I have been looking for. I have outlook at work synced with google calendar and tasks, which also syncs to my android devices, which also syncs to thunderbird. The ultimate in productivity.
B00CW665VI|4.0|4 1/2 stars! I absolutely loved the style the author used.  It is hilarious, sexy,and you never really know what might come out of Drew's mouth. If you need to smile and laugh you need to read this book!

157421327X|4.0|The information I was curious about.  It covers what it says it will.  I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject.
1475143389|5.0|This book is a very informative book. You need to count your macronutrients to get shredded or to get bigger.  It is the total amount of proteins, carbs, and fat you eat in a day. It doesn't matter how often you eat food, it is the total amount in a day that matters and ensuring that you don't go over your alloted calorie intake. Everybody has their preferences. I can't eat 5 times a day and it is better to eat 3 times a day than 5 if you go over your calorie allotment.<br /><br />Most renown enthusiast/nutritionist go by his principles and charge around $35-50 dollars. This is a steal for the amount of useful information in this book.
B0097C8XL0|2.0|There are no directions that I have found. I like penguins so I thought I would give it a try but no explaination of what to do or how to do it. Not happy with it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive and some much fun.  Great brain excercise! My children and I enjoy trying to solve each level together.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read it before seeing the film as I doubt they will get it right.  And if they do nothing can beat the written word for narration  and character insight.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This movie is surprising. Surprising in how well made it is and how it makes you feel like you are right there observing all of this happen. It really brings to life the devastation of the tsunami.

0553582038|4.0|This is a story that goes on and on, and I suspect that there will be many more books to come, but it is interesting and exciting.<br />You want to keep reading to see what happens next.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Literally one of the worst movies of all time. The story was stupid, the acting was horrible, and the visual effects were so fake it was hard to watch. We turned off the movie half way through.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|0.o needs more time like an hour!!! am i wright!!!!! plz!  i mean its like 5 min. why not 50min!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Great game, But really hard. There is only one thing that I would fix. That is getting the world's without even rewarding them.  The graphics are great and never lags on my kindle. Great thing that it's free because it's like a stop and go thing. All you have to do is with a click of a button you have it downloaded. I got it because my family was in a rush to go somewhere and asked me if I wanted a game. But the downloading is pretty slow. Piglantis is hard because you have to go directly underneath the water and rocks. I let my 1 younger brother play it and 2 younger sisters play it. They even addmit that the game is hard. Why have all of those levels at one time to get kids and adults overwhelmed?<br /><br />If any problems with this review tell Amazon Amiditly or any other reviews.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I never thought I would find a way to download YouTube videos into mp3 format.the time has come and it is finally here. an amazing job
B005HSL626|5.0|Never gets old! Great way to kill time even with a friend or family member of any age! Both people can play.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRUIT NINGA!  Hope you go on your 51st.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't stop playing!!!!! Wish I got the levels sooner. Warning, level seven KILLED me. Had the hardest time figuring it out!
B000BW7QX6|5.0|This is a movie that comes from the Firefly series. I think this is a very fine movie and that the series was way to good to have been cancelled. The casting is really good, the acting is also good, the writing is excellent, and while there is a lot of serious scenes there are also a lot of funny ones. Serenity survives on the outskirts of a society ruled by winners of a brutal war which most of the crew fought against. Nathan Fillon plays the captain, Gina Torres his number two. A Baldwin is in this but guess what? he is not related to those Baldwin's. His character is pretty mercenary and is usually only interested in money, sex and booze. Summer Glau is brain manipulated schizoid who can go from a rabbit to a wolverine in an instant. No one wants to mess with her in case she goes off!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these book. My family can tell u I NEVER read...... I still can't believe that I read the 3books omg.... I really would love to know more of that Christian was thinking.....
B00006F7IM|5.0|There are four movies based on the ideas for this one. I think this one is by far the funniest. Wesley Snipes is hard to recognize at first but his character is well done and funny. Cerrano, played by at the time little known, Dennis Haysbert can't hit a curve ball to save his career. He turns to voodoo to help out but it is a funny voodoo. Charlie Sheen is excellent as the crazy \\"Wild Thing\\". Tom Berenger is an aging catcher on his last legs (knees). The stripper owner makes a nice catalyst for the team as they make a run to the play offs.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|this item is good according to price. i love it. i recommend for this item. it is very protective too.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|While all the Tremors movies are billed as horror they are much more of a comedy in my opinion. They are campy but well done. The first one gets a 5 from me but this review is for all of them. As with almost any series sequels seem to fall some. The Tremors sequels are no exception though I still find them funny enough for a 4. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are hilarious in the first one and I think his only being in that one is a big reason for the fall off in the later movies. All four are worth watching in opinion and I do own them all.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Absolute can't put it down stuff - highly recommended unless you are offended or upset by detailed violence including torture. However, it is what I would expect from a medieval period.
B00061QK02|1.0|I started to watch this but it is so bad I just stopped watching it. I gave the DVD away to some poor sap.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the BEST GAME EVER. It's also addicting i love this game if they didn't have this game i wouldn't know what todo
B00005JNJV|4.0|This movie was bought for my son but I watched it and thought it was pretty good. Decent action and good graphics.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|Great movie.  This is a fun movie whether you are an adult or a child.  Recommend to everyone who likes animation.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was outstanding.  A well written, inventive, expansive and gripping story of the inhabitants of the Silo.  The characters are complex, and their world so richly crafted you find yourself concerned for their lives and eager to step outside...assuming you can put down the book!  Even after 500+ pages I could have continued to read more of Howey's Wool series.  I recommend this book to all sci-fi fans, and look forward exploring Hugh's other works this summer.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I cannot open the book purchased and wish to return  it. I have reregisted etc but with no success thanks
B008J34466|5.0|Love love love this CD. The CD came right on time and I've listened to it everyday since. Great CD to keep me alert during my commutes :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game will blow your mind at how easy it is to pick up and fun to master!!! You may loose track of time, so watch the clock... or don't! ;-)
B00499NHLC|4.0|I really love the interaction between Sherlock and Holmes.  And the way Sherlock deduces is amazing.  Just a great, all-around show for entertainment.
B003UBTX72|2.0|Skipped over some parts but overall enjoyed learning about the old days and how the Stones got their start. Good read for a Kindle.
1846573793|1.0|I received a box like the picture above, but inside the discs were of another book.  Inside was the book, &#34;Fifty shades Free&#34;
B000BISBDY|4.0|I didn't think I was a Johnny Cash fan but they had this on sale and I previewed it and like the 30 secs of a few songs so I bought it.  Once I got it I listened to it non-stop for days.  If you like classic tales and good music, you will like this.
1878424319|5.0|I purchased this book at the recommendation of a friend and will be passing it along to my 18 year old due to the simple nature of the message and the way it is delivered.<br /><br />Of course there is nothing entirely profound in this book that most of us haven't read or heard before. HOWEVER, the way that the message is given to us, how Ruiz helps us to look inside ourselves is a message that I think merits the 5 stars. As someone who has suffered in life (I know, who hasn't, right?), reading this has just solidified in me that I need to learn that everyone has their quirks and we all can only control our own reactions to what happens around us. Again, nothing I haven't already learned in life but the reminder is given in such a way that it makes you go \\"oh...I've kind of been an idiot in my life\\" and propels you toward change if that is what you'd like to do.
0142410322|5.0|Got what I was expecting and very quickly. Great transaction. We always get ebooks but needed the actual book for a summer school project. Easy way to get it cheap since it will be read and then donated anyways.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|sucky lame no directions such a dumb game I uninstalled it in about 4 seconds after I installed DUMB LAME
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel stands out for character development. You can fell their pain and emotions, laugh and cry with them. The authors ability to paint a picture with words and carry the reader from section to section with continuity is indeed a talent posed by few writers today.  Looking forward to the next novel.
B009POCG2C|3.0|A pleasant enough movie, which would have been even better without the baseball plot line. How Americans can call cricket boring, when baseball gives a whole new definition to the word, is beyond me. Clint Eastwood is still always a pleasure to watch though.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|I think the game is a lot of fun. It's a different way to play sonic, and it's challenging so far. Blah blah blah
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|have watched this movie many times very funny and also heartbreaking. It is the movie to watch as it is unbelievable about the dad and little boy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I give this a 5 star because it  never freezes on me and it gives u something to do when your board :)
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love Downton Abbey AND my new Kindle HD!  Downtown Abbey episodes just get better and better, and so does Kindle!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it is definitely dark, it has graphic scenes and some are brutal. That said, it is not gratuitous but really integral to the story.  The story is told in the past and  near present and flips between the two, this would normally be distracting but I didn't find it so here, in fact it seemed to propel me through the story, wanting to read yet another chapter of each part well past my bedtime!  You can see how this could happen where the &#34;lucky&#34; girl meets a seemingly perfect man, he isolates her from her friends, becomes controlling, bullying, and on into abuse. Her friends think he's wonderful and cannot believe her fears and concerns, and thus she finds herself more and more alone... with him.<br />A great read, I will definitely read more of Elizabeth Haynes work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm so happy to own this season, I'll be watching this over and over.  The quality of the video is outstanding and, of course, Downton Abbey is my favorite show.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Hope the popcorn has more action than the movie,  Too fragmented and not enough depth.  Sorry I spent the money.
1558908846|4.0|I bought this dvd by mistake & ended up loving it!!! I added it to my new collection of Stallone movies. It's a little corny, but the effects totally make up for it.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I feel like I recorded these DVD's and then transferred them. The picture quality isn't that great. I have a new high quality flat screen and DVD player and the picture it lousy.....on all of the DVD's.....
B000HF702E|5.0|Great movie. Fun for the whole family. Macaulay Culkin did it again!! He is hilarious as the rich kid. We couldn't stop laughing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like that you can actually feed,ride and buy more horses.(not real money it's the money you make from the game) it's like you have a real horse!
630460288X|5.0|Love this movie! Sandra Bullock...fabulous. The comedy as well as the effects is great. Love Stallone as a hard nosed cop & Snipes as the villan...wow!!!
B009LMTDL0|2.0|I did not find this book interesting or original or clever or wise or inspiring or beautifully written or written from the bottom of one's heart enough (those are my personal criteria). So abandoned it on the second chapter as I have a line of books that I chose to read. I do not have problems abandoning books that are not touching or holding my interest by the second chapter.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|very quick delivery.  have been wanting to see as a favorite movie of several family members dealing with bipolar.  consider if dealing with at all.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Downton Abbey series is not only historical, but classic!  I loved watching every episode and can't wait for the fourth season to be available on Prime!
1878424319|5.0|Simply written, profound, honest and perfect.  If we all followed the agreements...we would find unconditional love of ourselves and others.  Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thank you for this game. I'm so sorry I didn't type more  I lost it. I love minion rush. THANK YOU!!!!
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|The movie was very good, however, the 3-D disc did not work properly. Had to watch the movie on the regular dvd disc. Originally ordered this item to watch as 3-D.  How doI return this item?
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|All the trademark quotes, a father son bonding moment. And crazy action scenes.  Story line was decent, but not very dominate in my opinion.  I thought both villain and plot were better in live free or die hard
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book, and once I got toward the end chapters, I felt that this book could have gone a different way.  How the accident took place and from the time her son called his mother and told her about the accident to his critical state was too overwhelming. I won't be reading anymore of his books for awhile.
0307387178|5.0|Fascinating book, as was the movie.  A very sad story of a young<br />man with a passion, but woefully unprepared to tackle the<br />wilderness, with the resulting tragic ending. Especially sad was<br />the ending when his bereaved parents visit the school bus in<br />the Alaskan wilderness where  their son died. I love all of<br />Krakauer's books, especially Banner Under Heaven.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Loved the acting, scenery, building of suspense and tension. Very well directed. If you love western movies, you'll love this one. Has a great sound track too.
B00001W9G0|5.0|I loved Streisand in this movie! She was very heroic and wanted to save the world of fascist people. Redford did an excellent job handling her...haha!
B009NY43NY|1.0|If you've read the previous books, don't waste your time, attention, or money on this lazy, half-assed ending to a series. If you haven't read the previous books, don't bother getting attached to characters at this point. Ms. Harris can't even remember the plots to the earlier books so you shouldn't either.
1400067936|4.0|As stated by the author in the prologue, the main premise of the book is: \\"More generally, we underestimate the share of randomness in about everything, a point that may not merit a book - except when it is the specialist who is the fool of all fools...In my experience (and in the scientific literature), economic \\"risk takers\\" are rather the victims of delusions (leading to overoptimism and overconfidence with their underestimation of possible adverse outcomes) than the opposite. Their \\"risk taking\\" is frequently randomness foolishness.\\"<br /><br />Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories. Clearly, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voice only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision...And like many platitudes, this one, while being too obvious, is not easy to carry out in practice.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"It is a fact that our brain tends to go for superficial clues when it comes to risk and probability, these clues being largely determined by what emotions they elicit or the ease with which they come to mind. In addition to such problems with the perception of risk, it is also a scientific fact, and a shocking one, that both risk detection and risk avoidance are not mediated in the \\"thinking\\" part of the brain but largely in the emotional one (the \\"risk as feelings\\" theory). The consequences are not trivial: It means that rational thinking has little, very little, to do with risk avoidance. Much of what rational thinking seems to do is rationalize one's actions by fitting some logic to them.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"There is an important and nontrivial aspect of historical thinking, perhaps more applicable to the markets than anything else: Unlike many \\"hard\\" sciences, history cannot lend itself to experimentation. But somehow, overall, history is potent enough to deliver, on time, in the medium to long run, most of the possible scenarios, and to eventually bury the bad guy...Mathematicians of probability give that a fancy name: ergodicity. It means, roughly, that (under certain conditions) very long sample paths would end up resembling each other.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"1) Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns. In other words, one sees the variance, little else...2) Our emotions are not designed to understand the point...3) When I see an investor monitoring his portfolio with live prices on his cellular telephone or his handheld, I smile and smile.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"...It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made when it happens that should be the consideration. How frequent the profit is irrelevant, it is the magnitude of the outcome that counts.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"...Brian Arthur, an economist concerned with nonlinearities at the Santa Fe Institute, wrote that chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely  defined edge in a given area of expertise.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Causality can be very complex. It is very difficult to isolate a single cause when there are plenty around. This is called multi-variate analysis...People might ask me: Why do I want everybody to learn some statistics? The answer is that too many people read explanations. We cannot instinctively understand the nonlinear aspect of probability.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"I am just intelligent enough to understand  that I have a predisposition to be fooled by randomness - and to accept the fact that I am rather emotional. I am dominated by my emotions - but as an aesthete,I am happy about the fact. I am just like every single character who I ridiculed in this book...The difference between me and those I ridicule is that I try to be aware of it.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"People confuse science and scientists. Science is great, but individual scientists are dangerous. They are human; they are marred by the biases human have. Perhaps even more. For most scientists are hard-headed, otherwise they would not derive the patience and energy to perform the Herculean tasks asked of them...It was said that science evolves from funeral to funeral. After the LTCM collapse, a new financial economist will emerge, who will integrate each knowledge into his science. He will be resisted by the older ones, but, again, they will be must closer to their funeral date than he.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"It took me an entire lifetime to find out what my generator is. It is: We favor the visible, the embedded, the personal, the narrated, and the tangible; we scorn the abstract. Everything good (aesthetics, ethics) and wrong (Fooled by Randomness) with us seems to flow from it.\\"I am happy about the fact.

B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I have manifested many great things in my life before reading this book. And that is why I was delighted to learn about Pam Grout's book and excited to do the experiments she describes. After reading the book and doing the experiments without a shadow of doubt in my mind that I will manifest, the only thing that I saw within 48 (24 actually) hours is \\"lime green\\" cars.  Yes, that's the colour vehicle I focussed on.  And within 24 hours, to my delight, I saw two.  48 hours sounded awesome and I truly believed the rest of the experiments would be successful for me.  They weren't.  I get better results with Neville Goddard's way of manifesting. For those of you that are like me and didn't get results from the experiments in E Sauared One book, look for Neville Goddard's work online.  Most of his stuff is free and you can find audios, books, transcripts, and lectures. Neville's da maan! Good Luck!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is an excellent game. I have played tons and tons of games and the Settlers of Catan series is my favorite. Game play is excellent and I have played it with lots and lots of people and no one has not liked it, even people who aren't into board games like it. Very unique game style and play. The way it's setup every time you play it can be different, many different scenarios and possibilities with game board layout and resource numbers. Very cool, never gets old!

B007FEZQF8|4.0|With out a doubt, this is the most violent, bloody, gory comic book I’ve ever read. Despite that, Zombie books are a medium that reveals human nature like no other!<br /><br />In all my years of reading comic books I never thought that I’d be this entertained by the zombie genre! As I’ve mentioned in previous reviews, I have parameters when it comes to violence in comics, and zombies are no exception. These creatures of the undead feast upon the flesh of innocent human beings, and viewers are exposed to the contents of what they eat. Despite being dominated by blood and gore, zombies provide something that other horror genre monsters lack: a clear view into the human psyche. The film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (George A. Romero) helped define the modern zombie by introducing them as flesh-eating monsters. Max Brook’s novel WORLD WAR Z took an even greater step by displaying how a worldwide zombie pandemic can abruptly throw civilization into chaos and madness. This event is more popularly known as the Zombie Apocalypse. Both works mentioned effectively display how the inner nature of humans can change for the worse when plagued by a threat beyond their imagining. The components of these two phenomenal works (though WORLD WAR Z was later inspired by this book) make Robert Kirkman’s THE WALKING DEAD, a saga that captures your attention hook-line and sinker!<br /><br />This first volume of the ongoing series opens with a police officer from a small Georgia town named Rick Grimes, receiving a gunshot wound during a highway shoot out. Rick wakes up in the hospital three weeks later, only to find the entire building empty and abandoned, by the living that is! Rick is horrified to find the hospital overrun by corpses that move, walk, and have only one thing on what’s left of their mind: their next meal. After narrowly escaping the hospital, Rick shockingly discovers that these creatures dominate not just the hospital and his hometown, but the entire United States, and quite possibly the rest of the world. Although he finds his home abandoned, with his family gone, Rick still believes that his wife Lori, and his son Carl, survived the zombie outbreak. Following a lead that the larger cities where protected by the government, Rick decides to search for Lori and Carl in Atlanta. Making his way to Atlanta, he comes across a group of survivors stationed outside the now overrun city. Within this ragtag team of refugees, Rick will learn what it truly means to experience survival, as they must not only protect each other from the undead, but also from themselves, as they can easily plunge into the depths of savagery.<br /><br />What truly makes THE WALKING DEAD a thrill-ride is that rather than focusing on the zombies themselves, Robert Kirkman directs the entire plot on the effect the zombies have on survivors of the apocalypse. Although the characters aren’t deeply explored to the extent they are in the TV series, Kirkman fully portrays how an invasion of biblical proportions reveals the true disposition of the victims. As the individuals in Rick’s group suffer from the zombie pandemic, various individuals lose their morale, and faith in life returning to normal. This leads to some members descending towards immorality caused by their own desires. Officer Shane, Rick’s lifetime friend and partner in the force, illustrates the descent into corruption better than any other survivor in the book, as he begins to develop envy for Rick when he becomes competitive for the objective of his yearning. An apocalyptic aftermath provides the perfect setting for the fall of civilized behavior, as fear of death causes men to give in to their urges, slowly rotting the principles of civilized society. It’s like a snake revealing it’s true self as it sheds its skin.<br /><br />The only flaws I believe this book has, is the occasional fast-pace of the story, and that the level of language grows stronger towards the book’s end. Other than that, THE WALKING DEAD provides not only a gruesome zombie tale, but also portrays that a lack of rules and civilization can cause men to succumb to corruption. It’s astounding that a simple monster such as a zombie, can effectively demonstrate how far the human spirit can be pushed towards breaking point.<br /><br />“The world, that understandable and lawful world, was slipping away.”<br />― William Golding, THE LORD OF THE FLIESnly a gruesome zombie tale, but also portrays that a lack of rules and civilization can cause men to succumb to corruption. It’s astounding that a simple monster such as a zombie, can effectively demonstrate how far the human spirit can be pushed towards breaking point.  “The world, that understandable and lawful world, was slipping away.”  ― William Golding, THE LORD OF THE FLIES
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I never could get out of the first room and never could really understand what to do !  I love Doors but this game hasn't worked out for me.  May have to find cheaters book.
1781162646|4.0|I love Hard Case Crime novels, with their lurid throwback mix of down-and-out detectives, killers for hire, and femme fatales.  I was a bit puzzled by Stephen King's first entry into the Hard Case series, [[ASIN:B000FCKFGW The Colorado Kid]], a talky bit of non-suspense set in King's own New England... of course, that book later became the basis for a popular TV series, which explains why I'm not the one who gets paid to pitch TV series.<br /><br />But I also love Stephen King, especially when he's on his game.  Joyland, his second Hard Case effort, continues King's recent career renaissance.  Oh, sure, it's a bit of a greatest-hits collection, rather than a bold new direction for the author.  The first-person narrator is a lower-rung writer; funny how many of King's protagonists are writers who are less successful than King himself turned out to be.  There's grief over a lost love; an improbable romance with an idealized blonde beauty; a couple of low-grade psychics; a couple of ghosts; and an awful lot of big-hearted small-town folk who treat our hero with such kindness and wisdom that you'll want to cry.  King mixes and matches these elements in many of his books, but he's put them together particularly well here, especially as he manages to keep the page count below 800.  Also, the bad guys in King novels almost always turn out to be A) demons, B) serial killers, or C) big-hearted small-town folk possessed by the spirits of either A) or B).  I'll leave you to figure out which type of bad guy we're dealing with here.<br /><br />\\"Joyland\\" is thus like nothing else in the Hard Case Crime novels not written by King.  The first half of the book's 280 pages features our lovelorn college-age protagonist, a New Englander named Devin Jones, working at a small-ish independent amusement park on the North Carolina coast in the summer of '73.  There's a cold-case murder mystery at which Devin and his summer colleagues express an interest in, but that's not the focus until much later.  In the second half, Devin stays on at the titular amusement park into the fall season, and both the romance and the mystery - not to mention the ghosts and psychics - draw him into a web of danger.  The climactic, vertiginous showdown is a bit Hitchcockian, but I guess you can't really end a murder mystery any other way.<br /><br />The book is also told in flashback - the climax take place in October 1973, the week before I born, but Devin is writing from the present day, and thus works in more topical references and the occasional political barb.  The emotional content is more important than the ghosts and the murder mystery; really, this book is just plain-old touching, a memorable meditation on youth and lost love from a writer on the brink of senior citizenship.  \\"Joyland\\" deservedly takes its place in the top quarter of King's fictional output.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great intro season for this series. Never as good as the book but HBO did a good job at making sure the highlights were reached.
1439102813|4.0|4.5 stars.  Heartbreaking and terrifying.  The story follows the rapid descent of Alice, a Harvard professor, into early onset Alzheimer disease.  Lisa Genova is a neuroscientist and is very familiar with diseases of the brain.  She uses this expertise to carefully and convincingly tell the story of Alice's loss of self.  My only complaint about the book is that its ending was rather abrupt.  Since Genova had spent time elucidating the effects of the disease on Alice, I expected a more detailed end to the book.  I truly hope science finds a cure to this devastating illness quickly.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love Facebook.Love the games and socializing with friends old and new....It's a nice way to spend some time,when you are not busy with other things  :)
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read this book straight through in one night! I loved that it was from Drew's point of view and I literally laughed out loud throughout the book!! Loved it!!
B0058W74UY|1.0|I didn't download this app thanks to the warnings in these reviews.  But who in this company is so unfamiliar with the correct usage of the English language that they would use the bulleted description  \\"-Works more better now.\\"<br /> I am not a writer, editor, or English teacher in any form; but even I know that \\"more better\\" is very wrong!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|The music is fantastic and reminiscent of the films. the nostalgia is great. but the birds powers really do take the game to another level.
B0009WFELY|5.0|Ordered it fairly late on Wednesday night (9:30ish), received today Friday at 5 pm! Packaging was nice and the record looks perfect. Can't wait to listen to one of my favorite albums on vinyl!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This series has been wonderfully addictive.  I was a nice end to a much loved series.  These are the kind of books you can read more then once.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It begins as an interesting character study with interesting observations about men and women and relationships and marriage. The characters seem realistic, layered and nuanced. Then as the second part begins the novel degenerates into a bad TV movie of the week. The mystery and drama of the novel is gone. The characters become uninteresting and flat. What was character driven becomes plot driven and the plot becomes stupid.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Use it on my Kindle Fire a lot! Use it with other apps when I'm. shopping. I have bad eyes and this helps. K would say if you do not have a calculator. this would be a good app to own.
B00BIR381W|5.0|absolutely love this show it  one of the best shows ever  i always look forward to more  and it keeps getting better
B00BESM14U|2.0|I was bored with this movie. Cliche angst. This is one of a long line of mediocre indy films that think they are special....but aren't.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|he does not always guess the person correctly, but ALWAYS takes credit. when he does guess right, he is pretty amazing, though
0374533571|5.0|This book really causes you to see from the perspective of Pat, the main character, and to experience what he feels as you read in between the lines. As you read about him and his journey of struggle -or, the movie of his life, as he calls it- you start to feel as if you have a friend on your own journey of emotional healing from whatever wounds you have experienced in life. It isn't a book with all the answers, but it is a book that captures so well the deep longings and inquiries and feelings that we have to learn to embrace as we live life. I read this book in a time in my life when I had a lot of inner anguish and churnings and questions about relationships and how to be happy. It certainly made me feel a lot less alone in the world.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The graphics are good you are not inclined to buy more gems you can play this game and have fun with out using real money. When it was for ios I got it and played it and it was fun and I enjoyed it but now it's on the kindle fire so a lot more people can enjoy this games potential Its way better than dragon story in my opinion because it encourages you to buy more gems and money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I only had to get help with one level, so it wasnt too challenging for me. I will play more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Best book that I have read so far anybody who likes really good books this is the book for you
B000JO9JHW|5.0|After years of friends telling me to watch this show, I finally decided to give it a try and it blew me away. Dexter is hilariously morbid and absolutely worth the buy.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I really like this app i play all the time along with dragonvale and lords and knightihope you like this game
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Season 2 was a great follow up to the first season. If not MORE intense, it was so good I couldn't stop watching. Finished the whole season in 2 days!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I just watched this and it was very entertaining.  Then I just found out that Red2 is coming out soon.  I'm going to go see it!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It easy to use along with phonic sounds for pronunciation which is a plus. I would recommend this app for everyone.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Full and rich of life and history of old. Brings forth a great adventure more then worth following the families of westeros. Full of love life adventure and betrayal. What more could you ask for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best game app I have ever downloaded! It's different and actually makes you think.  Get it if you haven't already!!!!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I have only read 10% of the book. So far, I really enjoy the REAL story! everyone works in financial field should like it. hahah
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The game is great. Learing how to play Magic. Would recomed it to everyone who likes Magic. Love the game...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|one of the better ones from g5.keep them coming like this .hints were great if you get stuck graphics good too
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|This game presents a great challenge but I miss a few more instructions.<br />I've been a gamer since Atari 2600, and usually, you had a very creative booklet to explain every detail - the instructions were half the fun since the graphics and sound weren't.<br />This app has good graphics and sound but doesn't tell you a lot.<br />Yeah, you have to conquer all stars.<br />Your troops go where you tell them to, you can SPLIT deployment.<br />How do I know that? Trial and error, though it IS mentioned casually somewhere in the tutorial - the tutorial is okay and tells you everything ONCE - I still prefer an ingame guide.<br />There's the multiplayer option of course, and upgrades.<br />There are many upgradable abilities, but again, little explanation.<br />It took me almost 14 minutes to win the first round, that was close to the time limit. That wouldn't have happened with better instructions.<br />4 stars, it's a GREAT game, just not very well explained.<br />Does the AI have pity on you if you choose the beginner level?<br />Not really, just try it :)
B002GYI9C4|4.0|Be aware, I don't give five stars unless something is life-changing. While it's not life-changing, I truly enjoyed this series. If you liked The Wheel of Time series, you'll love this series, too. My recommendation? Buy the trilogy and save yourself a bit of coin. (Maybe to push against?) :) Seriously, I really enjoyed the suspense and development of the characters and world in the series. Also worthwhile? The Alloy of Law, a follow-up to the series, also worth the read. I'm looking forward to the character development in this new series. As with all of Sanderson's books I have read, can't wait for subsequent books. I wish he would do a follow-up to The Wheel of Time series he completed for Robert Jordan.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones was born to play Dave Robicheaux, and Mary Steenburgen is perfect as his wife, Bootsie. Fans of the the James Lee Burke novels (like me) will not be disappointed.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I wish Brandon Sanderson would do a follow-up series on this. I feel like I'm left hanging. What happens to the main characters???? Help!
B000FC10QG|4.0|Just found a typo in chapter 1.<br />\\"The breech (breach) was now total, and that afternoon...\\"<br />Please review it and fix it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it!  Ending was definitely sad but left me wanting more.  Can't wait for season 4.  I may have to watch it on PBS rather than waiting for it to come out on Amazon Prime.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|The game plays well and looks good but beyond that offers no real charm. The tutorial doesn't tell you much about how to play, so you have to figure it out yourself. Double tapping a planet makes some little explosion thing, but why? Why do planets sometimes create the little orbs (ships?) and sometimes they do not?<br />The AI is also pretty annoying. Even on beginner it seems to know things the player cannot. Example; the enemy AI knows when you have few orb/ships on a planet and immediately attacks, every single time it happens. The player doesn't know how many enemies there are unless attacking or exploring.<br />Yet another issue I found was that as you progress, the game zooms out for you, but I couldn't find a way to zoom back in. Maybe there is one, maybe not, but it should be easier to do.<br />I played it for a while but ultimately decided to remove it from my phone. Hopefully these issues will be sorted out and I can give it another try.
B009GED3HS|4.0|Not much to say. This is an online order. The video quality is great, plays quickly without a lot of buffering.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome<br />Omg<br />Lol fun so cool psychiatry<br /><br />Some cool you are awesome by Joe Rob Joe I'd feel sick fun ebbs duh db
B005LF9OCE|4.0|Not much to say. This is an online order. The video quality is great, plays quickly without a lot of buffering.
B00B4804KS|5.0|JP blew me away when I read it as a book, then blew me away when I saw the movie in theaters and now watching it at home on blue ray it still has me awed.  3D looks good but the movie can stand on its own without the 3D conversion bump.  Must have regardless.  I am amazed at how many people still haven't seen this film.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I wishh I had this app on my desktop. It is a very well designed collection of network utilities. Nuff said.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I love it! I wanna ride my bike into the sunset more often. I like the colorful graphics and the option to choose which graphic and color you want to show off. A great \\"spin\\" on bike safety. I wish more bike shops had this option. It's worth the money and compliments I receive daily. Good business to. I had a shipping error and they personally emailed me to make sure I was taken care of!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The suspense and the characters really kept me wanting to continue reading. Truly enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books and look forward to reading more of them.
B009UNGYHG|2.0|The item worked fine for about 2 weeks,  then developed a shortage.  I now must place something on top of the charger for it to work.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|This was a very fun movie.  The plot is simple, but it follows in Matrix footsteps.  It reminded me of Fahrenheit 451.  It was very enjoyable even though it seemed like a very short movie.  I would recommend this movie for fans of futuristic sci-fi flicks.  I wouldn't miss it.
B003XT603Q|4.0|I read this novel travelling in Europe, and it put me in a mood that was a bit surreal, adding to the \\"time-off\\" or \\"spacing out\\" intended by  my touring old castles and ancient churches and jostling in strange crowds. I agree with most general, positive comments about the quality and effects of this novel. But I felt a glitch when the story carried me to the end where it explained why Naoko and Watanabe were not able to have intercourse again (which seems to be a very important reason why Naoko could not respond to Watanabe's pledge of love and try a life together). The author's explanation, through Naoko's mouth, is she \\"never want to be physically violated again\\" after her first and only, highly satisfactory intercourse with Watanabe. This is a critical dynamic force in the story, and it does not make sense to me. I can only come up with two ideas: (1) Naoko is pyschotic beyond common sense and really belongs to a madhouse, which would make her unfit for being the object of a normal person's romantic love (but the object of sympathy and caring); and (2) the author weaved story down the path wonderfully but can't run it up  in the end (out of wit). Well, I really enjoyed the book until that point, and then I was like, \\"huh, that is it?!\\" Like a great dancer falls onto his but at the last note.<br /><br />Anyone with me on that?
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie surprised me.  I'm not a fan of superhero movies, but this one is good.  Even though I wasn't too familiar with the characters, I enjoyed it.  The dialog was particularly sharp for a movie of this kind.  I will be buying it for my DVD library for sure and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies.  Don't miss this one!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the classic 3D movie.  Everything about it is stunning and mesmerizing. Watching the birds fly amongst the cliffs. INCREDIBLE!  A must have 3D movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely needs more levels asap! I love the multiple room levels forcing the player to memorize important clues. I was very sad it ended at level 10 when it was becoming more difficult, but I still cannot wait to share this with friends.
B001F12J48|5.0|We watch Polar every year and to experience it in 3D - WOW! Thank you Santa! A great family DVD.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like that  i have many different options with this app. I can set up different  alarms  with different settings.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Dexter is an excellent psychological thriller. Unlike any other murder mystery I've read or viewed. Sometimes it's difficult to manuever through the process to buy it online, but it's well worth the trouble.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its free soo get it its the awesomest game ever I play it every day its cool
B004EC5IUW|5.0|fantastic animation, voice acting, plot.  Please watch this movie because it deserves the money!  watch 1.11 first so um yeah
B004B63M1S|5.0|This movie was super corny. It had a plot that was very easy to see through, horrible jokes, and a lot of graphic violence.....which is EXACTLY WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED BE.<br /><br />This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, it's very fun, and if you can relax and enjoy it's corny nature instead of expecting a super serious hardcore action movie, you'll be the better for it. This movie is AWESOME.<br /><br />-PC
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love this app so much! My kindle broke, and my Irulu has been a great replacement.<br /><br />This app is fluid, and accessible, however there is a strange setting. You can change the  brightness setting, and when you turn it all the way down the screen turns black. This is extremely annoying because I can't change it back because it's black, and I have to uninstall/reinstall the app to get it back to normal.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My wife and I enjoying playing on our kendals. We like all the different dragons you can make. The only thing we have an issue with is our dragons go invisible; and when they do this we can't do anything with them. If they would fix this it would be a 5 star.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very good I and interesting it a good interesting read.<br />Bla bla bla  worth reading  5 more words to write
006178480X|5.0|This is his latest in the Sigma series.  This is a thriller and the adventure the characters undertake is a ride.  I love that he always explains the science of the novel or the history used, at the end.  I recommend his books all the time.
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|Full disclosure: I knew nothing about Bonobo until Ninja Tune's tie-in with Cartoon Network's IGPX, where the label (and their two sister labels) had their catalog sampled for the soundtrack and the \\"Zen: A Retrospective\\" album, where the track \\"Pick Up\\" became one of my favorites out of that double album. However, years later, I dug into listening to Bonobo's work before Black Sands.<br /><br />Now, based on what I've heard from then up to The North Borders, there was a definite change in the production style between Dial M for Monkey and Days To Come. Bonobo's sound started to trend towards mellow, earthy lounge and ambient with a nice spark and thumping bass to many tracks that made you take notice of each track's subtleties. I believe that this album is another step into an intriguing evolution for Bonobo sound-wise (no pun intended). Definitely a good follow-up to Black Sands.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Absolutely the best SLR backpack out there. Fits my camera with standard lens on, plus an additional 3 lenses (including 70mm-200mm), separate flash, mini tri-pod, and all my other accessories. If I had a laptop, it could add that in too...! Very well made, and very happy I found this on Amazon.
1427200246|5.0|This book is inspiring and very helpful to get employees engaged.  I have passed it around our company and everyone who has listened to it has been inspired.  I actually have purchased it in hard back also since I have had so many requests from people to borrow it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is by far the best plague game I have ever played. You need to buy this game $0.99 is worth the pay!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is no wonder this is a book club favorite.  It is just that good!  Won't give any more details; you just have to read it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|One of the few movies you can watch over and over. I bought the Blue ray, DVD bundle and feel it's a great value. Also came with 2 digital copies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book! I think anyone would love this novel. See the movie too-it is so great! I think teens would especially like this book.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Not as good as Downton Abbey but still quite fun. It's a little more difficult to understand with the accents.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is so very cute!  I loved this movie and I really recommend it to anyone who is interested in a loving christmas movie ;)
B00513DGIO|5.0|Everything you've ever learned about the history of economics and the emergence of markets and trade is a lie, or at least that's the premise of Graeber's book. He makes some good points, like banks and banking weren't always mainstays of trade and commerce as they are today, and that issues we face today, such as sovereign debt and financial crises, are actually inventions of the banking sector, and how the idea personal debt even came about in the first place. He doesn't, however, make it into a political diatribe for or against a certain system or policy. Rather, he impartially explores the very origins of the idea of &#34;debt&#34;, from the late stone age through the earliest civilizations, and right up to how it continues to evolve today. Whether your interest in economics and debt is professional, academic, personal, or just as an engaged citizen, you owe it to yourself to read and understand Graeber's book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Enjoyable, but short. I can't wait for future entries in this series to be released. Excellent first foray into Kindle games.
B0026NBZDU|3.0|In fairness, I really enjoyed Part I (the first third) of this book.  The characters were interesting and I was totally confident in the plot that was building.  Unfortunately, the story-telling fell flat in the second part of the book once the narrator shifted.  Instead of perpetuating the story, Part II simply restated the same events, albeit with a different narrator.  Part III of the book takes you back to the original narrator and the story picks up from the end of Part I.  I felt like every time the author took me one step forward, she also took me two steps back.  There are certainly enough plot twists to keep the reader engaged, but for me, some of the impact was lost in the dragging narrative.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book, really love how the author tells the story from so many prospective.  Also, enjoyed the history lesson! Looking forward to his next book!
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|It's the Beach Boys how can it go wrong?  The product did not take long at all to get to us.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting! Would recommend to all kids and adults! And you can compete against your face book friends! Too cool
B005VGMYZM|5.0|PROBABLY THE BEST CONCERT YET FROM ANDRE RIEU.<br />EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN GERMAN, IT WAS STILL FUN.<br />WE FELT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LONG, BUT VERY GOOD.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I love this series. There are no scratches on any of the discs and so many awesome special features including deleted scenes!! Any Star Trek nerd would want this set.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was suspenseful in a good way but I think there should be another book. I think you should make it where the great prophecy is there but it's still the same generation
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is a great game. I love all the characters in it. The baby is really weird. I love this game you should get it.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I downloaded it for my kindle fire HD and it doesn't work. It won't play videos or download videos onto my kindle
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I didn't like this movie it was MORE A romance movie then a scary movie. I wouldn't buy it again!! See it at the movies bfore you buy it from amazon.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is an amazing album. I am glad to see some hip hop making it on the air that isn't just hedonism + Autotuned and simple minded lyrics.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Sorry but I haven't seen the movie yet. But the previews looks like it'll be a good movie. Can't wait until it comes out on DVD. I did pre-order it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun to be honest the only thing I don't like about it is you have to connect to Facebook to play with a friend and also they give you goals to achieve three goals at a time and three of them you have to connect to Facebook and if you don't have Facebook so your kind of stuck there but other than that I love this game
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this as an escape movie.  It was both funny and endearing.  The colors and animation were wonderful.  I recommend this as a sweet getaway for all ages.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Love the art. So far looks great. No Torn cards or crappy looking artwork on any of the cards. Have art from 4 of the zelda games.
B006LSZECO|3.0|After all the hype and hearing from other readers I thought this would be a gripping mystery/adventure, but I had to force myself to keep reading it, hoping it would somehow redeem itself. It never did. While quite original, the writing is weak. Told by two narrators, I often had to check to see which one was speaking as there was so little difference in their voices. The behavior of the title character became predictable and her husband's behavior was inexplicable at times. The fact that neither of them was in the least bit likable was part of the reason I had to struggle to get to the end.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great sci-fi series. Noah Wyle and cast have done an awesome job & definitely kudos to the writers.Not your atypical alien take over show. So far it's the best I've seen in awhile. Hopefully the can continue to keep it &#34;real&#34;.
0062255657|5.0|I can't fully wrap my head around this book quite yet. It's short, quick to read, and yet creates a world so enormous and elaborate while remaining fragile all along. I usually read quite fast but found myself unwilling to short-change this experience by rushing even a single sentence. I didn't want to miss a word or the slightest nuance. I fell in love with Erin Morgenstern's Night Circus last year and this has left me with that same melancholy feel... like there's a world out there just too fabulous for the rest of us mere mortals. Do a favor for your inner child and immediately read this book.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is so fun. This the perfect game for me because I LOVE animals there so adorable. Best game ever<br />LOVE this game.
1936608898|5.0|Just finished day 30 of my whole30 diet and never felt better. I had been vegetarian for 5 years and thought i felt great, until now. Ive read so many diet books and different eating styles and none of them ever stuck or worked for me as much as whole30! It starts with food has given me a whole new outlook on the way i eat and what i am putting into my body. it stars with food was a huge part of my whole30 success. I previously tried to do the whole30 only by using the resources online but found this book to help even more! The book is packed with useful information and is extremely informative. It really helps you understand why you should be eating the way the book outlines!  I no longer crave sweets or carbs (which I never thought was possible)! My energy levels have Sky rocketed and i no longer feel tired throughout the day. i sleep better, my skin is clearer, and ive lost some of the Fat off my body! I've tried so many new combinations with foods and have been pleasantly surprised. Zucchini noodles is a great substitute for pasta and I never thought meat would taste so good to me again! I will say the 30 day challenge takes commitment! You have to plan ahead almost all your meals and you definitely spend a lot more time cooking in the kitchen! I did the plan with my boyfriend so we motivated each other! Know that it is extremely difficult to go out to eat during the whole 30, but not impossible! we both plan on continuing our whole 30 for 15 more days to extend to a whole 45! After that myself and my boyfriend have decided to only eat paleo for the rest of our lives! This has been such a great change!  This definitely won't be my last whole30! Great read! Definitely works! Highly recommended!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|From the very first page Morgenstern's The Night Circus had me trapped in its web! A tour de force of the imagination it was like nothing I had read before. With stunning imagery the author creates a beautiful and imaginative location for most of the book to take place in. On more than one occasion I remember wishing I could also be wandering through the different tents of the \\"Circus of Dreams\\"!  The characters are rich and mesmerising, taking on completely different nuances as the story progresses. I 100 percent recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates a bit of magic and losing oneself in events out of the ordinary!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really enjoy the puzzles. not just the standard easy fare. some have easy components, but then require multiple steps. great, love it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Haven't been changed over the years for a good reason. These are fantastic, solid, great sounding  headphones especially for the price
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it!!!best game ever. I recommend it to every one! (Especially people who love horses)  Get it!!!!!! It's awesome
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|If you have a Yamaha amp- this connects effortlessly and is incredible.  We now can sit on the porch and run through our playlist as we like! I think it should work just fine on any amp, just that mine is a Yammie and its easy as to use. Sound quality great (or as great as mp3 will ever allow).
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I don't recommend this for small kids, but my kids thought it was so cool.  And my 74 year old father loved it.
0385532458|5.0|John Grisham at his Best....in little bite sized pieces (collection of short stories). Great writing, humor, and irony.<br />  Get it!  Enjoy it!
B001HN6922|5.0|My kids thought this movie was better than the first one.  They love seeing the underdog triumph.  Loved the ending where mater chooses what is best in life.
B008JFUR10|2.0|I just saw Pacific Rim a couple of days ago and I'll be damned if I can tell you what the main character's name is.  What is it?  I have no idea.  Minor point I guess.<br />So here is the movie in a nutshell - get a blender and put in Godzilla, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers, Transformers, Independence Day, and Avatar.  Boom - you've got Pacific Rim.<br />I'll give the movie one big kudo though - they did grime right.  You see, heavy, grimy, industrial tech is the key.  For example, in the original Star Wars film, tech was big, greasy, and dirty.  In the prequels, Lucas screwed it up because he made everything new and shiny - more like Star Trek than Star Wars.  Are you listening Disney????<br />Regardless, they got the tech feel right in Pacific Rim.  Big and dirty.<br />So what is the problem?  Well  like usual, the plot makes no sense at all.<br />First of all, you need to have some sort of introduction to the main character - some reason to care about him.  In this case, all we really know is his brother got killed.  Who is he?  Why is he there?  What is his motivation?  Why do we care?  For that matter, what the heck is his name?<br />After his brother gets killed, what is he doing in construction and how does the black dude running the show (what is his name) know exactly where to find him?  He just lands in his helicopter and is like hey... let's go.<br />So here we are with main hero we don't really care about.  He gets paired up with Asian woman - what is her name anyway?  What the heck?  Anyway, at least they do a better job developing her character.  We see her motivation through childhood memories.  Of course, the confusing part is how they get paired up - apparently you choose your partner by some sort of kung-fu stick fighting.  Notice how everyone is usually paired because they are brothers, or twins, or father and son.  So what about main dude and Asian chic?  Well they figure it out by stick fighting.  Huh?<br />Oh, and what about that guy who does the mind meld with the chunk of brain?  What was his name?  Anyway... are you kidding me that the aliens then send a couple monsters through the breach just to get him?  Why?  What's the point?  He is worthless.  And when he freaks out down in the bunker that they are after him, everyone else just believes the guy?  Wouldn't they just think he was nuts?<br />Oh, and does it make any sense that the world governments are shutting the Mick Jaggar program down?  Why?  So they can build some big walls? Which of course fail, but then why don't they start funding the Mick Jaggar program again?<br />Oh, and if nukes seem to work on the monsters, why not use them more often?  The creatures come up out of the sea, right?  The people know when an \\"event\\" occurs, right?  So dropping a nuke on them would just create an explosion out in the ocean, right?  Uhhhhhhh.... I don't get it.<br />Uh, can't forget the politically correct mumbo-jumbo either.  These aliens apparently want our world because we polluted it, global warming, etc  so now it is just right for them.  Oh yeah, and they are jumping from planet to planet consuming the resources.... Oh wait, that was Independence Day... oh wait... nevermind.  Anyway - the whole \\"man ruined the world\\" theme is for pansies.  According to the film, these aliens sent the dinosaurs as well, but the planet wasn't ready for colonization at the time or something.  So what do they do?  I guess they decided to wait a couple million years for human to evolve just so we could have an industrial revolution and pollute the atmosphere.  I mean heck, I'm sure the aliens didn't mind waiting around for a million years or two before invading.  I guess the aliens figured they couldn't just do a little terraforming themselves... they would rather wait for apes to evolve into humans and for humans to create acid rain (oh wait... whatever happened to that?) or an ozone hole (oh wait, whatever happened to that?) or global warming... er I mean climate change... or something.<br />Really?  This is the best the writers and producers could come up with?  The aliens created the dinosaurs, invaded earth with them, but then decided to wait around for millions of years for humans to evolve and trash the planet?  Really?<br />So what is the deal with these Mick Jaggar robots anyway?  You build gigantic robots to fight alien monsters and they mainly do so how?  By punching them in the face?  If that was the main design idea, why not give them spiked knuckles or something?  At least the red robot has spinning blades on its hands.  Yeah, they have fancy weapons, rockets, etc  that they break out, but the main move is usually just a good old elbow drop to the cranium or something.<br />Hey - anyone else notice that Optimus Prime has the same sort of sword in his arm?  Anyone else notice that the acid spitting monster is just like the big bug from Starship Troopers?  Anyone else notice that the big speech scene before they go off to battle is just like the big speech scene in Independence Day?<br />Sooooo.... I guess the big plan is to drop a nuke down the breach and blow it up - except that they find out that there are some sort of gates in the breach and you need a monster's DNA signature to open the gates.  Whatever... I'm cool with the basic idea... except that leads to some questions about how the breach was created... but that's a discussion for me to have at your house next week over tea.  Regardless, so the Gipsy Mick Jaggar goes down the hole with a dead beast and the gates open.  Fine... but then how do the escape pods get back out?  I though you needed monster DNA to open the gates?  Right?  So how do the escape pods get out?  Do you only need monster DNA to go back down, but not up?  Maybe, but what would be the point in that?  The monsters never come back anyway.  Each one is on a suicide mission to cause a bunch of damage.<br />Oh... almost forgot. There are only 4 Mick Jaggars left at the Hong Kong base.  So what isthe great strategy they use when they get a double event and two monsters pop up?  They send only two to fight, leave a third back in reserve, and leave the main character and his Gipsy Jagger back at the base.  In other words, they could go 4 on 2, but they choose to go 2 on 2 and get their butts kicked... of course.  Hey, how about at least going 3 on two?  What's the point in holding number 3 in reserve until you start losing?  By then it is too late.  Who came up with this plan anyway?<br />All that being said, I still give the movie a 2.  The effects were really pretty well done and it was entertaining enough if you didn't think at all about what you were watching.
B008QOH1NG|5.0|The sound was great for a live event.  These guys have lost NOTHING!  They ROCK!<br />Good to see all four original members!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Intense...held my attention.  I will recommend it.  Wished it ended differently.  The ending was abrupt and I did not feel it was finished.
0440246318|4.0|I want the first line of a novel to grab me by the throat, shake me and leave me gasping for more. This doesn't happen often, nor did it in this novel by one of my favorite author's. In A Wanted Man, Lee Child doesn't really grab my attention until page three; I know that's hardly a stretch. But let me tell you at that point he paints a vivid picture with his words.<br />Large, intimidating, and scruffy, Reacher is trying to hitch a ride, and has a strip of silver duct tape pasted across his freshly broken nose. The visual of the splintered fingernail picking at the edge of the tape, the sound of the fractured nose as it clicked and ground...cringe worthy!<br />Now I'm there, the author has my attention; I want to know how he broke his nose, why is his fingernail splintered. Then the ride begins. Lots of riding around in the middle pages, but in usual Reacher fashion, there is always a big finale.<br />I was not disappointed, and as I have come to expect, the writing was tight and the sentences structured well. My eyes flow easily through the paragraphs, the images bold and clear in my mind. As long as Mr. Child writes them, I am eager to read them. I hope he can keep them coming. Eventually I suppose Jack Reacher has to age and grow too old to go on, perhaps at that point the author could pull out Son of Reacher. Wait...maybe daughter of Reacher. Reacher Cleans Up Assisted Living?<br />Reviewed by author Shelley Riley [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]
B00506NRBS|5.0|I really enjoy the way Derek looks at life and business. It's refreshing to me and encouraging. His tales of customer service, growth and change are quite informative.
1781162646|5.0|If you like King, and I'm not sure why you'd be reading this if you didn't, then pick this book up. Don't expect a plot twist around every corner. Do expect the book to be entertaining throughout.  I encourage you to try to not read the last 50 pages in one sitting.
1250006341|4.0|My mother LOVES it, so I can't get my hands on it YET! I can hardly wait! It's a lovely book.
B004XISI4A|1.0|I think the series has taken a sharp turn and is starting to take a dive - the same way Robert Jordan's Wheel of time series did.... It has been a painful read that already started at book 4.<br />The question is - do I want to continue reading till the end?....<br />I doubt it!<br />(I did continue with Feist though and I am grateful for his last books were back to his best!).<br />These guys just can't replicate what Brooks and Eddings and to a lesser extent Feist achieved.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Love the acting and the concept that this movie provided. Loved the Saudi prince working with the Americans to do something as simple as fishing.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|After reading this book, I am pouting forth a,positive attitude about everything. My mind,has been changed about do many things  I already feel good things coming my way.
B00D3XAA4M|4.0|I like this because of the beautiful pictures that are offered. It helps me dream of a vacation in Europe.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I'm relatively new to running and had never considered not eating meat before reading this book. I feel like this book has helped me learn how to push through when a run gets hard. I'm also giving vegan a try and like it so far. We will see.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun and entering for the car or jst sitting around my sister love it very much get it hcdg dgcs
B0057UA486|5.0|The movie itself is, of course, superb, but the rating is for the blu ray transfer, which is flawless.  Like watching it in the theatre.  Another bonus is that Kubrick's original aspect ratio is quite close to 16:9, so the film fills most of the screen.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is a great family fun movie. It has great humor for all ages and the antics are a blast for all ages.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If you saw the movie and thought to yourself &#34;Well, self, that was lame&#34;, then this book will be a pleasant surprise.  Well paced, well written, and with lots of snapshots of interesting characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. engages the mind and hard to put down. can't wait for more levels to be added. hurry hurry
1932100660|5.0|I found this book fascinating. Being somewhat familiar with the subject matter, I still found myself learning new things and gaining an even clearer picture of how our diet impacts our longevity. He explains scientific theories and research studies in such an easy to understand and clear manner, while keeping it all interesting. It was surprisingly a page-turner!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show. It's really a masterpiece.  My friend told me about it and I got hooked.  The characters are excellent. I am going on to Season 3.  They deserve to win an award.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I was all ready tired of the &#34;Candy Crush&#34; game and was looking for something different.....<br /><br />This game Rocks, i started playing and an hour past like in minutes.<br /><br />Really addictive game and you can play solo, vs on the same device, VS on the internet, VS on the LAN<br /><br />This game has it all :D<br /><br />The only bad thing is that my friends have iOS and they cannot play with me ;)
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The series, the Vikings, is realistic and deep into each personality.  I love the authenticity of it as well as the story line.  Truth is always more interesting than fiction.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I love this game.  It is so addicting, once u start u cant stop.  The one bad thing I will say though is that some times the game cuts back to the home screen and freezes so the only way u can get back on is by shutting it down.  Other than that this is a great game!
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|I hate the fact that you have to start at the beginning every time to want to play.  The beginning levels get boring after a while.  They get better as you go on, but I can't take it anymore.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|everyone should try this game especially if they love the minions of despicable me. its addictive and fun! the minions are hilarious!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Captivating characters and a thought provoking look at life, relationships, and self discovery.  The movie is great as well!  Must read

B000CNFC76|5.0|Great movie, a true story beautifully told.  I'm not even interested in golf and have practically zero knowledge of famous players of the past.  I loved watching this movie regardless.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Perfect fit the Iphone doesn't move around in it and doesn't feel cheap to the touch. Well see what happens if it's ever dropped.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It was good to play it was fun and different and you didn't have to wait a couple freaking spurs just to d o something
B0063GORYU|5.0|First time I used it, it was not what I was used to, but after another attempt , I got hang of it and really enjoy playing it now.  Wish it had more explanation of what random, winning etc. mean.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these type of games. I can't wait until they open up more rooms. I will bet they get even harder. they really make you think.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|love means spending yourself for others' good.  this is really an example of how one should live!  like Rick, like Ilsa, like Victor, or Sam.  I hope to see more movie like this be made in US.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You can play a lot without having to spend real money. Very addictive, fun and entertaining. Great to play five minutes many times a day to build cash quickly.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat totally rocks with another great album. King diamond on guest vocals is just awesome.Enjoying this album a lot.Music style changes a lot on cd,from a western sound to metal.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love these types of games silly, pointless and best of all... FUN!! Great game and look forward to playing more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is an amazing game that kept me up almost all night long. Best game ever! Now I finally have something to do during the day. It is almost like a minion version of temple run... but WAY awesomer.
1554072840|5.0|I had this growing up and I just got it for my daughter. She loves to read it while sitting on the potty. I really love the openness and honesty in this book. Toddlers need the details and they need to know this stuff is normal and common to everyone. My daughter loves to point out her eyes, ears, head, hands, vagina, legs, and bottom when we go over each body part. She sees that Prudence has poopie accidents on the floor too but she also goes in the potty. The old school potty hasn't confused her at all. She just turned two and has been going in the toilet almost every day since we added this to the potty queue a couple of months ago. Highly recommended! I manually edited the book so that it uses the words we use in case anyone else reads it to her. Easy peasy. :)
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|So much fun great way to pass time while bored... or waiting on wife to shop great fun absolutely awesome
B006LSZECO|4.0|Bought this book after hearing a lot about it on TV and radio. It was a quick read (finished it in about 4 days) and definitly kept my attention. Worth investing the $12.00 it will cost you - pretty exciting until the end.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well written and acted. Really good bantering with believable stories. Would strongly recommend this for light hearted viewing. Don't miss it.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|After finishing the book I brought on vacation with me I decided to grab something on my Kindle. I saw this and decided to give it a shot - though I thought it was very interesting it was slow at times. It was a quick read (I finished it in about 3 days). It is worth the read to hear her story and see what her and her family had to go through.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Lost a fan.  Worst book ever.  Sold out followers. Got refund and won't buy her again. Sad! Eva and Gideon were completely lost in this attempt. Thought someone else wrote it. It was that bad.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I rented this movie when I went on vacation - I had read the book and normally enjoy the books better, but I will say this movie was pretty much on point with the book. The casting was good and followed the book story line to a tee. If you are looking for a romantic movie worth seeing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is Challenging but not to hard.  It's Exciting to solve the puzzles and I'm not really a puzzle person.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|really good book, but could use some cleaner language. I am looking for more of oatmeal`s books. I encourage you to read it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed the season and the involvement of the characters in the story line, but also enjoyed experiencing a little history through this costume drama.  Looking forward to subsequent seasons
B002S43V3Y|5.0|This is an amazing move.  It should be required viewing.  Listen to the message.  Relax.  Enjoy.  Share with the youngins.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|The classic album plus a live recording. Can't go wrong with this, you will enjoy it. I always go back to this album and this is a great way to do it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Way more exciting than the movie! I'd recommend it for anyone 13+. Even my husband seemed interested when I told him the differences in the book and the movie.
B008BO61BE|5.0|One of their best albums, one of the best Metal albums ever. Will never stop listening to it. This special edition with the bonust live stuff is awesome . What a nice deal.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like to play minecraft with a firend or by my salt. And now you can do it too.You can play it on anny lecherous.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is the best game on the planet and it good for the mine I love it I love I really love it bioch
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Certain authors make you feel like you are living life with them. John Green is one who does that for me. He sucks me in and I can't get enough. This is the reason for the 5 star review because it reminded me what it was like to be a kid but it reminded me too what it was like to be angry and hate the rain for falling.<br /><br />I know these teenagers seemed unrealistic but I imagine in the face of horrific disease and death, you would grow up a little faster than most. He paints the picture of what it means to give yourself over to another person and the severe letdown of having life get in the way of all our plans.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love the actors and actresses that play the characters.<br /><br />Great story line. Lots of special effects. Nothing held back. I highly recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this game and played it until it crashed. I wasn't too sad as I had only invested around five dollars. I re installed  the game and it happened again.  After I realized this game couldn't be won without spending a lot of money I gave up. Play Dragonvale, instead.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Fast, holds its own. and is much better for gaming. Amd can not compete.i highly recommend it to gamers on a budget.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book was well written but unsettling. I wouldn't call it dark, but it left me feeling like I'd had a bad dream.

B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|I thought the movie was long and hard to follow things going on, and didn't think the acting was all the great either.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Iconic.  Influential. It's all been said before, but this film deserves every accolade ever heaped upon it.  Anyone interested in the history of film, horror or otherwise, should see this movie...multiple times.<br />As with any film, it should be viewed within the context of the era in which it was made.  This particular film challenged many cinematic conventions, and changed the industry as a result.<br />Hitchcock was a true master of his craft.  Can't recommend this enough!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I had a copy of this and gave it to a friend. So I had to order a new one for myself.
B007MLMJ18|5.0|Pablo Alborán is a fantastic singer-songwriter. He has a great voice that you can enjoy whether you speak Spanish or not.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Besides the plot for different characters, the contrast between the &#34;upstairs&#34; world and the &#34;downstairs&#34; world, and the way they intertwine is quite interesting.
B009MJUB7W|5.0|These are well built toys that my grandchildren really enjoy playing with. They are very durable and will last a long time.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|This record was an early morning impulse purchase, and it is so infectious in its upbeat fun-ness, I can't stop dancing to great tracks that make me want to find my inner \\"magnetic hero\\".  If you want to be solemn and sad, find something else to listen to, if you want to add to the list of \\"good s***\\" in your life, get this album.
B0094GW6YE|5.0|Good as always, you can't go wrong with kiss, they are the hottest band in the world. This one sounds amazing.
1439153663|5.0|This was a real &#34;page turner&#34; for me.  Being a docent at a historic home I am always interested in learning more about early American history.  This was not only educational but also a great summer read.  I will keep this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the game the new update is awesome.They added more details to th lab and added a new vehicle(jet ski).GET IT OR DIE.<br />BANANA!
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|I'm a total Trekkie, so call me biased, but I just love this movie. You can tell that it was really just a movie to show off the new 3D special effects of that time period, so they spend more time than they should on showing off things like that, but still, it's a great movie overall.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't wait for the new levels to be released! This was a blast and it really made me think. More please!!

B00AEFY0F2|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times I watch this movie I enjoy it each & every time.  Tom Hanks is a superb actor!!  Funny scenes, one right after the other, with a very tender & moving ending.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this movie.  Gary Sinise also gives a wonderful performance.
B0031RS42K|5.0|So enjoyed the plot and the characters. Wasn't sure because I love the Da Vinci Code and others with the main character.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I really like it.  It's easy to charge the battery when needed and keeps my Kindle Fire clean, free of dust, protects it from any bumps or scratches.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Storyline and acting were great. I would not be surprised if it became a classic b/c I could watch this over and over and I don't say that about many movies made nowadays.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Everyone loves old classics right? Well this is my favorite! Reading the book is so much more better than all the the different movies. I love this book, and its perfect for all ages!

B00004Y6NW|5.0|Sultans of Swing is outstanding. Knopfler is King on this album. Excellent 1st Album for a band. The years of Punk was taken over by Mark and David Knopfler, John Illsley and Pick Whithers. Amazing. A must for major fans.

B000FA5TTW|5.0|A riveting story. Unexpected idea of heaven and our connection to those who have.<br />Preceded us in death. The destruction of the family was heartbreaking.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have loved all of Hosseini's books and this was no different.  He expertly takes the reader through the lives of multiple people in an emotional story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game! its fun and keep my mind busy. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is reading this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author chose an unexpected twist; to go from feeling sorry for this girl to feeling like she is the daughter of Satan
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is a graet gift for anyone who watches Doctor Who.  It's a great replica, and it can extend, exposing this cool spirally thing inside.  It does makes the sound effects, and they sound awesome.  It lights up too! And the secret ink is a blast.  So far it hasn't had any problems, and it's been a couple of weeks.  All in all, excellent! Totally worth the cost!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having the Bible<br /><br /> at my fingertips. Easy to use. Great plans and devotions. Can read the Bible at night without turning on the light.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Awesome DVD set, and awesome show. I've really enjoyed watching this series, especially the very early episodes. Great gift for any fan of mysteries!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I first heard of this story on 60 Minutes last year and was very moved by the story and the making of the movie.  I have caught glimpses of him on some day time talk shows since then and was happy to see it at my library so rented it. (I have HBO and Showtime and was waiting for it to come there).  What a wonderful movie.  I also watched the \\"making of\\" extra on the DVD, which adds to the experience.  I went one step further and bought the CD and the entire CD is great.  I am a big Bob Dylan fan and the comparisons to him are true.  It really makes you wonder what would have happened if he caught on back then and what he would have done. Watch this movie and I dare you to not get a happy tear in your eye.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I dont understand why this is not compatible for the Kindle 2nd Generation Tablet. I wish I could play on my kindle I really do, but I guess not!

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|there was something very sweet about this movie. it was very entertaining, witty, and fun to watch. i wasn't familiar with these actors but they were awesome. i look forward to seeing them in other movies.
B006XBSC8C|5.0|So many good songs and major hits on one album, it makes it worth buying the CD, rather than just downloading the songs, so I can keep it as a collectible.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I like that and our girl Adriana Nicole Engle likes that<br />And she likes one<br />She wants that from amazon

B000FA57US|5.0|People should buy this DVD. It is really good and scary also. I am a halloween fan when it come's to Michael Myers. Buy it soon while the prices are good. Thank you Amazon.com. John Stematz.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|With 17 pages of reviews already, I won't go too in depth with this or tell the plot yet again.<br /><br />What I did like:<br />The story line. They had a legitimate reason to be in a creepy old cabin in the middle of nowhere.<br />The subtle homages to the other Evil Dead movies, like Ash's old car rusting behind the cabin for instance.<br />The characters. They're actually likable and not overly annoying (I'm looking at you Texas Chainsaw 3D).<br />The set. It looked like a real place and not like it was just plopped in this spot for the movie's sake,although I think it probably could have looked a bit more moldy and decrepit.<br />The opening scene was a good one. I agree with another reviewer that said that they should have added the long and overgrown road that leads to the cabin to add to the feeling of desolation.<br />The gore.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />The absence of Ash as a character. I can deal with the emphasis on Mia being the main character, but Ash is the essence of the Evil Dead movies.<br />There was no feeling of the woods being alive with a dormant entity. This played a major part in what gave the original so much of a foreboding atmosphere.<br />The deadites felt more like they were \\"exorcist\\" possessed and not \\"kandarian\\" posessed.<br />Too much satanic symbolism in the book of the dead. Evil Dead was never about satanism.<br />Duct tape used on severed limbs and deep puncture wounds? Come on. At least half ass a tourniquet so the characters don't bleed out in a couple minutes, although they never do.<br />Remember, when a vehicle rolls over on your hand,immediately pull if off instead of digging it out of the soft wet ground, and then run around freely with your tattered stump.<br />Mia gets resurrected, comes back normally, and somehow doesn't have one scratch on her.<br />The ending. All rituals come together for the main Deadite to rise and it turns out to be an anorexic chick-thing that puts up little to no fight.<br />No, \\"notanother peep, time to go to sleep\\" song or \\"join us\\" whispering.<br />They should have left out the lame one liners such as, \\"you're gonna die here you pathetic junkie\\" and \\"eat this mother******\\",<br /><br />Sure, my dislikes outweigh the likes, but that's just the Evil Dead purist in me showing. This is still a solid horror flick, and I will have no problem adding it to the rest of my Evil Dead collection. When I saw this in the theater, I sat through all of the credits as I always do and I was not disappointed to see Bruce Campbell's \\"groovy\\" face at the end. Look for it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|From the music to the story line, its keeps you engaged and wanting more. Looking forward to the next season.
3832797033|5.0|You know Rene Staud does beautiful photography, if u want a coffee table 911 book this is the one to buy.  I only wish it had the new 991 turbo in it. Overall a must have if you love the 911 or automotive photography
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|I like it, but it will not let your battery charge on your phone while this app is running.  I believe it's because the screen is on, but otherwise it's got some nice sound effects.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've just recently become a fan of the show.  I was able to watch the first two seasons on a friend's DVDs and then watch season three through amazon.  Can't wait for the next season.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and getting to add it to my Blu-ray collection as an adult makes me happy.
B003QSS2VW|4.0|Great movie for families with young kids.<br /><br />Appropriate themes for young children, although it can get a bit scary at times.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great series. Started watching recentrly but it keeps me entertained all the time. Recommended to anyone looking for a science fiction series.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|We decided to upgrade our Star Wars dvd's to the better quality Blu-rays. I'm glad we did! The movies are so much fun to watch due to a much sharper picture.  If you're a Star Wars fan you won't regret purchasing all six of Star War episodes in the Blu-ray format.
B007FFL45S|5.0|Great book on a daily read. Day by day taking each day as it comes, and magic does happen!!! Thank you. Love it
B0053FANS6|5.0|It was time to replace our three Mummy dvd's with the better Blu-ray copies. I'm glad we did, the quality of the blu-ray movies are fantastic!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Very user friendly. I am not very tetchy and I cAn navigate this app perfectly. Everyone should use this app, great for hunting bargains.
B000PMG16U|5.0|It was time to upgrade our Star Wars dvd's to Blu-rays. We love the quality of these Star Wars Blu -ray movies. Fun movies at a reasonable price.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|When I found out that I could get the App free ans down loaded it to my Kindle I was even happier, now when I have to sit and wait for the Doc or any other reason I have to wait , it does not bother me I just play Bubble Witch Saga!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It was time to replace all four of our Indiana Jones dvd's with the Blu-ray copies.  The quality of the blu-ray movies are fantastic! Great price and fast delivery!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My fire had lots of memory occupied, and showed that there were personal videos loaded, when I have not loaded any.  It was perfect and cleaned up lots of space.  One thing that was taking up more space than I realized was the magazines.  It is the cleanest cleaner I have found without too many ad's.
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani is the most transparent, honorable teller of truth in this Epic on-going Spiritual Journey. Her power to express touches my soul and...  Exceeds all my expectations of what our Purpose is right now, where we are at.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My boyfriend and I enjoyed playing this game and we could not put it down. We eagerly await more levels.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a very very good game.  But not enough plays during the game. But still not a bad game at all.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading this author's first two books, I knew I would love this one. The story is told from many different perspectives but is more powerful than a simple linear story would have been. I highly recommend this book!!!!
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Action action action!<br />Make up and set design superb!<br />'<br />Not made for children.....very violent and a bit too pandering
B0041TM5OU|5.0|Enough has been said about the music; if you buying this; you already know what you're getting into.<br /><br />The vinyl came securely packaged and in flawless condition as per usual from Amazon; everything plays thought perfectly with no warps or skips; its probably the 'flatest' record i own! Sound is rich and warm; no complaints at all. all I know from the packaging is its a 2010 repressing; sounds very authentic to me. Definitely buy this, no collection is complete without a copy!
B00004XPPC|4.0|An interesting movie to see Hollywood types make a movie that is closer to the realities of war and it heart break.  Especially how it plays on the minds and hearts of different people and how they deal with it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a good read for our road trip. We even looked forward to reading it when we were not driving.
B000ZHCQ5U|4.0|Another Hollywood take on the Cold War era - but this time a darker vision, but a possible one they thought at that time.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Only recently discovered I can watch British TV shows on my iPad in the US. So happy I can now watch them on our big screen TV thanks to this. Works fantastically.
B00004XPPE|4.0|An interesting take on the political ties with the military - how they could have possibly played out in the Cold War Era of US-USSR relations of late 50's - early 60's.
B005BZQVF2|4.0|paul was pretty funny, not the best or funniest but worth watching and renting, i would recommend this movie to anyone that like a comedy
B0002XMKYE|4.0|Good Hollywood rendition of a great American war hero of WW II - how he was the right man for the job at that time.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever ! If you have never seen Forrest Gump then you need to. I would recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Nice to see that as time goes on the movies get closer to the real horrors and realities of war and its long time effects to the humans involved.
0689835604|5.0|It is a cute way to help teach your toddler the parts of the body.  My little great granddaughter loved it.  thank you.  the hard cover and hard pages are wonderful because little hands cannot tear them and they begin to love books
B004GJDQT8|3.0|This app for my Samsung Galaxy S III works as advertised and one that I can recommend that wants that type of connection - but a PC is  a better way to go.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Its like Evil Dead 3.0, new aged, great quality, great gore effects, creepy, suspenseful and scary. Great classic throwbacks. Well done film. 5/5 because it made me jump.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great game the only prolem is that it doesn't have alot to do if you don't buy something.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is really fun. I just got it and I can't stop playing it. It is the best game I have ever played in my life. I just love this game!!!!!!!
B009YBU8CQ|4.0|Not quite as good as half a yellow sun , but beautifully written and emotionally charged. Gives an interesting insight into contemporary Nigerian life , and avoids the usual African clichés of poverty , corruption etc. An ordinary story of a fairly ordinary life , written in an extraordinary way.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is cool and very real. Worth trying. I'm only doing this to get 5 invest points<br />  Hope you enjoy it.
0446693804|4.0|My book club read this book and liked it a lot. Lots of discussion about memories, but the ending was a little to abrupt for me.
0425263991|5.0|I love the Psy-Changeling series by Nalini Singh.  If you love paranormal and romance thrown into the mix then this is a must read book/series.  I read this book in one day that is how good it was.  No spoilers here because I do not want to ruin it for those who have not read the book.  I highly recommend this series and this book is my favorite!
B0095P33IW|4.0|I wasn't expecting or looking for &#34;Gone with the WInd&#34; here though. I merely wanted some pleasant entertainment to pass a little me time away. I enjoyed watching the movie.
B003UESJFG|4.0|This is easily one of Dreamworks' funniest movies; Will Ferrell and Jonah Hill's personalities shine through in their voice acting and the story is well executed if not slightly cliche at times (probably intentionally).  But in my opinion, the picture quality of the Blu-Ray version leaves something to be desired.  I watched it back-to-back with a Pixar movie and the Pixar movie was undeniably better in terms of resolution (yes, full 1080p with HDMI on both).  There were times I was squinting, trying to figure out whether I was watching the DVD or the Blu-Ray disc.  At times, scenes with a lot of detail or repeating patterns, appeared pixelated.  But it's still the best looking version of the movie you can buy currently buy.  Great movie, just not the best Blu-Ray I've ever seen.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|The book gave me a nice and easy short intro to the new features and power of HTML5 and its connection to Javascript. Good for a quick idea on the capabilities of these technologies if you are thinking about using them in the future.
B00BLF9FOK|3.0|I was expecting more, but actually the storyline was good.  He looked so old and tired.  I think make up could have done a better<br />job on him.  But I'll keep watching his movies for I have seen all that he has been in and keep hoping he'll hit a really good script.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a Great game! You can pick it up and jump in whenever you just have a few minutes or if you have a hour of down time- But, I have yet to see the Idol...
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I am in the same aghe bracket as the actor in this movie.  I hav admired their work for the most part. I found this nostalgic and funny and entertaining.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|My son spoke to me about this movie and behold here it was for rent on Amazon so I decided to rent it.  I like these types of movies mainly because I am a kid at heart, however, some scenes of the giants could be a wee bit frightening for really young children.  I enjoyed the movie very much and was not sorry I paid $3.99 to rent it.  In fact, I watched it more than once before the rent time ran out. Filled with plenty action and who could help but fall in love with Jack the farmer turned giant slayer and the fair maiden princess aids her in time of distress.  Stories like this will never grow old to me........fun entertainment for family movie night.......just  be sure wee ones are close to you in case the sight of the unpleasant mean giants frightens them.
B00498YZH8|4.0|This Missouri set story gets very nitty gritty about a daughter whose father puts her family home at risk; she works to hunt down the reasons for why her house is being foreclosed on, meeting tremendous resistance on the way by relatives and neighbors, only to learn the gruesome facts in the end, but wins back her home in the process.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Because I dearly love the original Wizard of Oz movie I could not wait to see this, however, for me it was rather bland. I would not purchase this movie for my library.  Love the beautiful scenery but lost my enthusiasm. I watched it through to the end. Kept hoping it would get better as I watched ......sadly, for me it did not.  That's just my opinion - you may feel differently.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|its the best zoo game I've played. I recommend it to all animal lover's. GET THIS GA<br />E!!! you won't regret it!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I love this game and u should definitely try it and also try the other games from this maker like : crazy dentist crazy doctor kids spa and many many more hope u like them :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|i actually felt tingling through all my body when the couple kiss's. this author is great at making the reader feel what the characters are feeling. good read.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It has a very diablo-ish style, combined with fun and interesting system for getting better gear. It has a few downsides, but the ones it has are better than most other free games/apps.
0345803493|5.0|This one just continued the abrupt ending of the first &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; trilogy. I just ordered the last episode &#34;Fifty Shades Freed&#34; and can't wait to finish the read.
B007N8RULO|5.0|It gives your brain a workout.  I am 83 yrs. young and just playing this game makes you think and by doing so it helps your memory.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like that you get to eliminate bad guys, and play with new armor.<br />I would recommend for my age group 8, 9, & 10 years old.
0525478817|5.0|This was our book club's selection and it is a beautiful book, but I have to say that it broke my heart. I know it's the ultimate compliment to a writer to have people emotionally invested in their work and this was totally true of this book. It's totally worth reading of course, just be prepared.<br /><br />My suggestion is to have a book that will make you laugh waiting in the wings (\\"Where'd You Go Bernadette\\" or \\"Sex & Suburban Lunacy\\" or \\"Bossy Pants\\"), because Fault in Our Stars made me so sad by the finish, I really needed a sure dose of humour after that.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is very fun! The only problem I have with it is that is the prices are kind of high up there. But this is a fun game to play with friends! Gets more&amp;more challenging! Love it!
B000EXZI28|4.0|The cd of This is Where I came in is a really great cd I especially liked hearing Maurice sing lead in Man In The Middle and Walking on Air I never really knew just how good a singer Maurice was until hearing him sing lead on these two songs, I just wish Maurice would have sang more lead vocals in so many of the songs they have, but all in all if your a Bee Gee fan than I would suggest buying this cd and adding it to your Bee Gee collection, it's a great cd..
B0064X7FVE|5.0|JUST love this app. We can check on we're we our going to see if it's going too be bad or good weather.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great you get all your weather information quickly. I like the way it warns me about bad weather.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Great movie...a must watch if you've ever had or plan to have a baby!  Great job covering &#34;all the aspects&#34;!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good book, keeps moving from story to story and moves between decades.  Not to hard to follow.  Good book for when you have to read put down and pick up again later.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Having searched high and low for a quality astronomy/planetarium app that actually works on a Kindle Fire HD is an occupation unto itself. I can't help but be overjoyed in finding this one. It's not free but in somehow collecting 500 &quot;Amazon Coins&quot;, I can't help but feel I've spent 200 of them wisely. Not only does it work well, but it works VERY well with features I very much appreciate.<br /><br />The app has a bit of a learning curve to it that the tutorial addresses adequately. Nit-picking just a little, I'd have appreciated a bit more readable font. Beyond that, I can't find anything that I have an issue with. I just hope it continues to perform as well.
B0053KWDES|3.0|Basically this is suitable only for use with smartphones.  I was disappointed after buying it for use in a home office.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Excellent sound quality - does not introduce any noticeable distortion, and the frequency curve seems flat, apart from the bass boost feature.<br /><br />2. Provides good volume boost, even with high-impedence headphones (mine are Sennheiser 580).<br /><br />3. The bass boost can be off, low or high; and a gain contol can be low or high to suit the impedence of the headphones.<br /><br />4. Nicely finished, compact, smooth metal case, seemingly durable, and smooth-turning metal volume knob.<br /><br />5. Silicon elastic bands to strap it flat to a typical size smart phone (iphone shape).<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. It is exclusively battery-powered!!! It *will not work* from USB power.<br /><br />2. It cannot be used while charging.<br /><br />3. Charging takes several hours.<br /><br />4. If accidentally left on, it will run down the battery in a few hours, though not in use.<br /><br />5. The controls and connections are on three different sides of the device.<br /><br />6. The USB cable is only about 30cm.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS:<br /><br />Because of the battery dependence, short battery life and likelihood of users forgetting to turn the power off every time, it is a poor choice for a stationary situation. In my experience, it needs charging frequently and I kept having to re-plug the headphones into the PC to bypass it for hours, then take the USB off, re-plug the headphones to the amp, then repeat the switcheroo next time it ran down the battery.<br />If you listen mainly from a small portable device, it may be worth tolerating these limitations so you can get better sound quality from headphones rather than the little earphones.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Filled with mystery, magic, and adventure, this book was a real page turner. I'm eagerly awaiting the third book in the series.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|taking a cue from lighter-hearted versions of the DC Comics universe, lego batman pits the dark knight and his partner robin against the combined menace of the joker and lex luthor. when a bid to steal kryptonite comes into play, batman is forced to call upon superman for help... which doesn't sit easily with the grim hero. working together, they battle the villains until a devastating weapon in unleashed--and even the world's finest aren't enough for this challenge.<br />family friendly, fun and funny, this movie is a great superhero adventure for even young viewers, with plenty of action, easy-to-follow dialogue and clear-cut characterization. my four year old loved it!<br />recommended.
B00004VW35|4.0|This is a country style of album from Neil but the songs are good. If you are after the Harvest type of Neil Young then you may not go for this one. Having said that it is a better album than just about everything he has done in the last twenty years.
B002DR3WG2|3.0|Lizzy was very spirited to be a women of the 1800's.<br /><br />The other sisters were great characters. After Lizzy, I probably liked Mary the most. Jane would get on my nerves with her pollyanna attitude. The two younger sisters were 1800's version of the Kardashians!<br /><br />Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley were decent fellows and they followed through on their attachments to the two Miss Bennets.<br /><br />The mother, Mrs. Bennet was hilarious to me. God Bless her husband for putting up with her.<br /><br />The character who brought tears of laughter to my eyes though was Mr. Collins. His fawning over Lady Catherine was remarkable!!
B008O69SZ0|5.0|If you're an Ian Hunter fan this cd is a must! Ian still writes great lyrics and all the tunes here are just fantastic! There are really no weak moments here. My personal faves are \\"Fatally Flawed\\" (this is just brilliant), The Title Track, Comfortable (Flyin' Scotsman), \\"Wild Bunch\\" & \\"What For\\". I am glad Ian still churns out quality music. Bravo Mr. Hunter!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The book is easy to read and follow and at the end you will have a very polished product. The book takes you through the steps with easy to follow directions. A very useful tool for anyone wanting to publish on kindle.
B004TSKKE0|5.0|This novel is so rich and surprising that it was definitely the best book I read in 2012! Do not give up and you will be rewarded.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|My husband will watch it at least once a week. Great graphics. The retired sailors at the end make us proud to be Americans.wow
B00A8FXT8M|4.0|A good traditional novel. Looses some power near the end. I want to read Augustus though! So enjoy this book.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|As my husband is retired military he wanted to see the movie so I ordered it for him.  He said it was &#34;okay&#34;.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This book is not written well. Also, the central characters are living in an amoral universe. Don't waste your time...
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Free is good.  Very similar to super expensive ones i've tried out in hobby shops.  This might even save you money if you actually want to fly RCs (I wouldn't know, I've only crashed them!)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app!! Very good for anybody no matter the age! :) no regret with this app. Great variety of horses it can just take a lot of time to get enough coins
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best app ever!!!!!!! if your looking for a great app go with this the price may seem high but it is so worth it!!!!!
B0087HT36U|4.0|This is a great game and is very fun . Wish they would make modes levels but very fun totally worth it. Just get the game it's fun ....
B007SGM084|3.0|I felt the books are ill written with a lot of grammar mistakes. Reading it once will be enough, I sure hope the movie is better.
B0014JKJK2|1.0|I might as well been ice skating the way I was sliding around in the kitchen wearing these clogs. Sad because they seem quite comfortable, but I don't recommend them for kitchen work unless you want to break your neck.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is the only movie I have seen in the theaters three times.  I have seen it six times since then.  Great action, great video, great audio, and super great green dress.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|We had just seen Monster University and loved the movie.  Although we had already seen Monsters Inc. before we decided to rent Monsters Inc. to see how the two movies related to one another.  Disney did a very good job.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|The main thing I don't understand is why the oppositions guys keep coming at your stars forever, but your guys run out before you have a chance to get anywhere. To me, Not worth the hassle!!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Our 2 granddaughters, ages 4 and 7, love this movie.we bought it because of Mara Wilson (Miracle on 34th Street) and just knew the girls would love it.
B002RKSZKI|3.0|I am an avid Austen reader.  Although this is one of her most well-known, I just couldn't make myself finish reading it.  I got caught up in the little things and just got bored reading.  Like I said, this is not my first Austen novel so I know the style well enough.  I would suggest maybe going for a different novel if you are new to the style.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Excellent storyline and interesting characters.  I like how Ryan has blended magic, aka the &#34;dark&#34; arts, into the story.  Now we just have to wait for the next installment...hopefully, it won't be too long.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|I had high expectations for a great cast, but it failed to deliver, poor story line. It was a &#34;Geritol&#34; Andy Rooney &#34;Lets make a show&#34; kind of a movie.
B004TLM284|4.0|Britney Spears is back to the top chart list. I heard the songs (hold it against me, till the world ends, I wanna go). I knew I have to download the album.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Fantastic film. A true story with heart and soul! I loved it. The development of the friendship of the two main characters and the effect they had on each other was simply moving. Great Earth, Wind, and Fire sound track and classical music.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Native is another good album by OneRepublic. There are many good songs in this album. OneRepublic has done it again.
193700788X|4.0|I cheated and read the last chapter when I was at the fourth chapter. I was terrible disappointed with the end. Then I went back and read the entire book and was more accepting of Charlaine Harris's final ending to the Sookie Stackhouse saga.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is great for teaching young people about the middle ages. It's cute and fun to play. The graphics are playing and realistic.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great acting, great writing, great music, what more do you need. I loved the crazy characters and how they deal with their personal quirks.
B000JML90Y|5.0|I had never had the opportunity to read this before. I hadn't realized the extent to which Darwin bent over backwards so as not to give offense. The apologetic approach wasn't the firebrand that I was expecting, considering the reaction to it by the opposing view.
B00932A3SK|5.0|good paced movie, action, never gets boring and intriguing story. For a lot of movies it's easier to guess the ending, this one makes it slightly more difficult
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My kid loves this app and will use it for hours. He likes the cat one as well. I like that they combo the dog and cat.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Love Regina Spektor---I've been a huge fan for so many years now. I'm glad I found her CD online so I can listen to it in my car.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|He writes just as he performs...to shock. I do not believe it was realistic. I will never buy anything by him or about him again.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Love Regina Spektor---I've been a huge fan for so many years now. I'm glad I found her CD online so I can listen to it in my car.
B0041KXOVC|2.0|We would have loved the movie, however, it wouldn't play as it had a message that was displayed that said:  &#34;wrong area&#34; and so had to send it back without having ever seen it.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This is a great dance song that ought to start out many parties this summer!  If you're a Daft Punk fan, you'll love it!
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|This game has no real point. But, It is a game that passes time. It kind of reminds me of a 1990's video game because the graphics are not that great. But, not too bad for free
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|2 lacks the zip, humor and humanity of the first Iron Man or even of The Avengers.  And the Blu-ray disc didn't work.<br /><br />Nonetheless, in my opinion the movie on dvd was more entertaining than most movies.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app! It is really cool. I use it everyday when I go to bed, or if I just need time to myself. This app does what it says. I like that you can choose what sounds you want to use. I would recommend this app to anyone, it is well worth it.
B00687PWQG|4.0|Very interesting. Best for serious history nerds who like to fact check via Internet during the show. But still get wrapped up in characters and emotional tensions. Hubby and I are poli sci majors and we loved this
