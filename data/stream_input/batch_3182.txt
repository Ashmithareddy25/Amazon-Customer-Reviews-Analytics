B005COO1X6|1.0|It has a great beginning but a stupid, contrived ending that will leave you saying &#34;WTF! What a lousy ending&#34;.
1416575464|5.0|Such a great book, and a great magazine. I wish they'd write a sequel to the book and bring back the magazine!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This is the best app ever. I got this as a free app of the day and I am now hooked. The characters/ people are pretty creepy but you will honestly love this game. BUY IT!!!!!
B004G8ZZHU|3.0|Very entertaining and true to the original series.  Not the best movie of the year but worth viewing just for the fun of it.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a good read, the author kept the story line flowing and most of all very interesting. I would recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire continues in the same mind consuming pace and content in which I was not able to predict the story-line as The Hunger Games.  There remained continued multidementional Character development until the ending of the story.<br />  I was very caught up in the weaving together of many characters with emotions and compassion.<br />There was almost a compulsive lead into the next book, that there will probably be less time before I pick that one up!
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|This is a steal in Amazon, DON'T BUY IT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY!! URGENT Someone has to put a stop to these thieves, the product has no subtitles shown in Season 1 and 2, I will put the strongest complaint in the world. this is a robbe, listen to me and if you love your moms DO NOT BUY THIS BOX SET.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love all of the challenges but 2 things I hate, one how it always tells you to rate it, and two how it always takes you back to the bookshelf, I mean just let the game go on, but over all its so much fun.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Was surprised at how hard to was to get into this second part.  Almost did not read it. It was worth the plow and I can't wait to read number 3
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Fun game. Really enjoy playing it. It's simple &amp; can be a nice mindless distraction. Easy to learn. Great for any ages. Try it.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Beyonce is the greatest to me! She and her band, dancers, and lil mamas are so full of energy. She puts her heart and soul into all of her shows! With a Beyonce concert dvd you can enjoy an amazing concert experience in the comforts of home!
1440503257|5.0|This was a great gift for the true Harry Potter fan!  The recipes have quotes from the books and allow you to serve what was mentioned in the books.  Great gift idea!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Wasn't sure about this game at first. Wow! I've been playing this game for days. Get it. You won't regret it!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Just like I remember the old Pac-Man. Will help kill a Dr. office wait real fast! It doesn't freeze up or anything either. Very nice
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I love science, botany, and courageous women.  This has all three and much more.  Interesting characters continue to appear throughout the book.  Very enjoyable.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I don't really use very often. Quicker and easier to just go through the Kindle's regular web search. Not useful.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Good story lots of action<br />Very good follow up in the ironman series<br />Marvel continues to produce very entertaining movies
B00B2V66VS|4.0|One of my favorite games! They&#34;ve put in a lot of new challenges...both in the run and daily and weekly score challenges. Los of fun!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Still can't believe I bought it only for $6. What a great price! This is one of my all-time favorite series. Amazing how only one season accomplished so much. Love it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|its very easy to download with the kindle fire as long as you have Internet it works fine. you can just search any vid press it and download as mp3 or video. I reccomend it :)
B009O07NDY|5.0|I know this will bother many but I like the film score more than I liked the movie. While it is a fun set of scores, it is not as rich as say, any of the LOTR film scores nor should it be. This is another story being told with movie, actors, scenery and of course film score.<br /><br />This CD is a fine addition to any collection of film scores and in particular, complements the LOTR film scores.<br /><br />I would be remiss not to mention I am a big admirer of Howard Shore's works.
B00338QENI|5.0|I'm not much of a science person and I definitely have no interest or background on biological matters. While science is definitely a thick thread in this book, it is so much more than a science story. It reads like a memoir and a biography and historical escapade all rolled in to one. I couldn't put it down and accomplished very little in the two days it took me to read it!
B002P5XXR0|4.0|James Horner - you really just can't get much better for film scores. The Avatar film score is not the most complex film score but definitely hits home and works very well for the movie. I am glad I added this to my collection of film scores and would buy it again.
B00F2362IE|5.0|So cool<br /><br />Fun awesome mean vs green  shredder is an bitch<br /><br />Will always be mean  turtles are awesome is a mutant
B001N1DPDE|5.0|My fav knife!!!!!!  This is a tank!!!! .25&#34; thick blade.  I had a huge smile the first time I picked one up.  Feels like it will go to hell and back and ask for more.  I have 3 of these now in various emergency/ hiking bags.  The coating on the blade is nice and tough.  The edge on all of them is shaving sharp too! The pommel can do some serious damage/work. The grip is bigger at the end to give the user better leverage for chopping which it will do quite well! The sheath is an awesome kydex that fits nicely with no rattles.  I haven't found a better knife for the cost. I might buy one for my father for Father's Day too!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! Love that I don't have to have friends who play (even though I do) in able to advance in the game. It makes you think as it is a 'mind' type of game.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Good knife, 1/4&#34; thick blade that means business. The handle is soft and comfortable enough, but is a bit wide, I have somewhat small hands. It is grippy though even when wet.  The sheath is nylon and is pretty nice with a pouch for extras. Check out Ultimate Survival Tips on YouTube for great knife and gear reviews, he is really thorough and fun too! Lots of knife for the $
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who don't love Facebook? Able to connect with friends and family. While it took me a while to get used to the layout, I have figured out where everything is.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Easy to use and does a great job cleaning up junk that slows down the Kindle.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A fun read with enough twists and adventure to make you want to keep reading. Now to start the next book.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is an excellent book. It's a very &#34;quick&#34; read that flows quite smoothly through a myriad of events over that particular summer. It's a book I was sad to see end, as I was quite ready to read about the summer of 1928! Quite enjoyable and entertaining view of a specific time.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|I laughed throughout the book so good to relax and giggle at the hilarity of Bridgets escapades, I will read it again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this thing! I did not like the idea of having to plug it in, when I plugged it into the USB port, the volumn went out on my new tv, but a simple restart fixed that. After I got it running, I love the thing! Watching Netflix or YouTube is simple as touching the chrome button, highly recommend this item.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|this book is brilliant well written, and I had seen the t.v series prior, I love the excellent references and fasting makes sense.
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|I'll admit when I first heard about this (from a preview on another movie) I was intrigued. So I rented it, worth the rental price.<br />The story was ok, I was entertained though the writers could have expanded on the character's backstory a little.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I had this on a cassette (and still do, by the way), but I wanted it on CD.  This three disk set is an absolute gem and I'm very glad I got it.  Even though it's basically three disks of the same material, each one had a different presentation which makes the unique.  This set is an absolute delight and a &#34;must have&#34; for anyone who like Fleetwood Mac.
B0020VKZ4I|5.0|Diana Krall is wonderful: a great voice. Her piano arrangements are a perfect compliment to her vocal arrangements. This is, I think, her best album.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|This is one helluvan action-packed flick... once you get past the rather slow-moving beginning.  However, once the action starts, hold on to your seat because it really takes off.  I won't be a spoiler, so I'll just say there are a few scenes that are definitely of the white-knuckle variety.  While some folks may not care for it, I found it to be a riviting movie once it got up to steam.  Yes, do buy it, because it is indeed an action packed flick.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome playing with my  friends we always make huge houses or a neighborhood .I would love it if you could add a few mods including  mos furniture and minecraft comes to life
B00005JL0I|5.0|Although this movie is definitely dated, it's still a totally outrageous spoof of the James Bond flicks.  David Niven is excellent as Sir James Bond, as is Peter Sellers.  Woody Allen is great as the inept nephew Jimmy Bond, and Dalah Lavy is fabulous as a femme fatale.  Orson Wells is the classic bumbling bad guy,  There are carloads of truly gorgeous females in this flick, which only makes this send-up so much better.  Buy it, drop it in your playback, and prepare for a truly hilarious time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great novel, loved that it was a follow up to one of his earlier novels. My favorite author for a reason
B004EPYZSK|5.0|At first, I found this one to be a bit hard to get into, but as it progressed I discovered that you could not really view it as a western, per se, but as a really well-done piece of sci-fi. Once you're thinking in this mode, the whole thing comes together beautifully.  Daniel Craig is great as Jake Lonergan, and Harrison ford is perfect as Col. Dolarhyde.  Too, if you're patient you learn why the mysterious lady is mysterious.  It does get almost gory toward the end, but not too badly.  The ending is also a tad bittersweet, but that's all I'll say about that.  It's a very good film and I highly recommend it but, as I said, don't look at it as a pure western, because it ain't one.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Great movie!  The whole family loved it.  A great movie for all ages; jokes for the adults, but discreet enough the kids miss it.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|What's to say?  King Kong is still the standard for this type of movie and Ray Harryhausen is still king of stop-motion photography.  This film is an absolute classic, and no, that's not the Third Avenue El that gets ripped down.  I believe it's supposed to be the old Sixth Avenue El where it made the left turn to go over to join with the Ninth Avenue line.  It could also be the Second Avenue El approaching the 28th Street curve,  It's kind of irrelevant, though.  King Kong does a real number on it, anyway.  Still, this is a classic to be enjoyed over and over and over, so do so!<br />Whoops!  My bad!  It wasn't Ray Harryhausen who did the critters.  It was Willis O'Brien who did the SFX on King Kong.  I stand corrected, and I thank the corrector.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Cool temple run 2 has a ton of cool new features I played this  when it came out and I t s the best app ever
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Functions perfectly. I wish Nintendo hadn't stopped producing these, this is such a high quality controller I bought 2 of them.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is agreat little game.  Just got it for my Kindle.  Seems likewise wonderful app..<br />I would recommend this to anyone into matching puzzles.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is my favorite movie of recent years. I love true stories and it doesn't get better than this one.
B001UG56ES|5.0|I feel it was an excellent movie. The acting was outstanding. I like the way it showed people loving and caring for others..
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love a book with action and drama and this book had plenty of both! The relationship didn't turn out the way I thought it would and I'm not sure if I really ok with it, from a female perspective. Love is love though. I think this was a great read and would definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome game I love the way the game gives you mystery boxes and its a really good game I would like more people to play it this game is a 5 star game keep it up !!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app it is the best app I have seen one of my friends play this game and I really liked it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app I get to play with and talk to my friends. The rooms are fun the only thing I would change is how slow it is to advance through the levels
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's not very often a book comes along that is new and compelling.  Wool definitely fills that bill and more!  A must read for sci-fi fans.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I give this book a 5 star rating it's filled with action it's very unpredictable and shocking. This book has inspired me as a writer, a poet, a singer and a song writer. I would definitely recommend this book to teens, young adults, or people with a high level of maturity (even though I am only 12 and still a little immature). I would also strongly advise people who love a shocker and a thriller to read Lauren Oliver's descriptive vivid clear writing, people who enjoy a great novel... READ THE WHOLE TRILOGY!!! :-)<br />Thanks for reading my review...enjoy!!!!
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|&#34;Region: All Regions&#34; it's false, since my EU ps3 can't play any bd inside this barrel.<br />&#34;mismatch between disc and player region codes&#34; is what i get.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The challenges and quest are very good graphics. The game moves at  a good steady pace without having to make any purchases. I appreciate having the option to speed it up if I feel it necessary though.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I only use my tablet to use this app. As a student of linguistics, I can whole-heartedly say that this app is top quality in terms of language learning. It engages with language learners. It is not just some flash card program. the invites learners to speak and not just memorize declensions and conjugations. It is also helping translate many websites.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this s game . The board changes which gives you more of a challenge but easy enough that you can figure it out with no problem. I think even my 5 year old could figure it out.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My grand-daughter palys this, she hasn't said much about it.  I know she was upset because she couldn't get the icon to go the way she wanted it to go.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an amazing book I wish it was longer<br />I read it in one sitting and skipped breakfast and dinner for it
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Deleted it off my kindle, I don't even remember what it was.  But you need to try to see if you like them, I'm glad they are free.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I was 13 years old when my 3 friends and me went to see Halloween. The whole theater was getting<br />their moneys worth, My friend's Dad dropped us off, he paid for all of us then left and came back to pick<br />us up. Everyone in the theater was really into the movie, it was a terrifying experience. Halloween was and still<br />is a horror classic to this present day. This is the film that started Jamie Lee Curtis movie career, and it also<br />stars the late, great, Donald Pleasence. I would buy the Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition instead, it has lots more<br />extras and feaatures. Still, this DVD is worth buying.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|My grand-daughter seems to enjoy this game and she doesn't cut her dolls hair.  But she doesn't play it a lot.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I really like the game. However, to really fully enjoy the game you have to spend too much money! You even have to pay over$20 for a character in the story.?? I don't get it. Also, the wait time on processing some of the items is ridiculous. A whole day (24 real-time hrs) to make a ring. I am only at level 16 and I am bored from waiting to make items to sell. Besides, once you finally get them made, you can't sell them!!! I wonder if the ones that create these type games try to play them any length of time???
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Deleted it off my kindle after trying it, I didn't like it at all, but you need to try it before you really know if you like it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was very frustrated with the writing style and needed to double check who was talking multiple times.<br />But I loved the story and got lost in the faction world many times. I wish it ended different but I don't think it would have made a better story. I was attached to the characters and felt sorrow when things didn't turn out to be a fairytale.<br />This story brings life into perspective and I am grateful for Veronica Roth's point of view. Thank you.
B0086700CM|1.0|Deleted after a couple of trys of palying this game, but you need to try it to see if you like it.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|it's a delightful book with a charming attitude and terrific recipes. There is nothing intimidating about it and, even if you don't cook it's a good read. Fabulous recipe for chicken stock.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Great read and many twist and turns. Hope to read more of Liane Moriarty novels.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|good flick, but not as exciting as i wanted it to be.  i am legend was better, and most other zombie movies are better.  this one just has brad pitt and it's title is all dramatic.  yay?
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I'm.downloading it now and I'm having second thoughts would if it messes up my kindle what if u have to pay for the coins to spend on the game? I'm just sayin
B008LXZFH6|5.0|this is a hilarious movie.  if you watch it you will laugh until your man/lady parts fall off.  but that sounds bad, so maybe don't watch it?
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Why else?  It's the conclusion of the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; saga and while certain characters met their demise, it's the crown jewel in J. K. Rowling's cap.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really thought this book was the best of the three if only for the nice pacing and interesting world building.  The ending Spoooooiler aleeeeeert was iffy to me since a main character died after having SHOULD have died a million times before and somehow avoiding it.  It seemed a bit iffy to me that you can be shot and come so close to death SO many times over a couple of months then just HAPPEN to die by gun shot wound at the very end when one more little success would have made it a nice, happy world.  Seems a little convenient to me, and contrived, like the author was trying to hard to shock fans and pull at heart strings.  Still an interesting tale, though, despite a somewhat flawed ending, and worth the read.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Anything Doris Day sings is wonderful.  It's understandable why she was Columbia's highest paid artist during the reign of Mitch Miller!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|its ok but i dont really like jow you have to wait for 30 minutes for another life it takes along time
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is the story of a young German girl growing up during World War II.  Her mother is too poor to take care of her anymore so she is taken to relatives to live.  Along the way, she watches her little brother die.  Her new parents are also poor, and she must help her mother take in and do laundry for the townsfolk.  She develops a love of books.  Because she cannot afford to buy them, she steals them.  In this sad story there is a comic moment when she saves a book from a Nazi bonfire and it is smoldering and smoking as she walks home.  A young Jewish man comes to them and the family hides him in the basement of their house.  As the war goes on the whole town is in peril from Allied bombing raids.  This is an extremely sad story.  Sometimes it goes right up to the edge of melodrama.  Mr. Zusak manages to save his story by including characters like the shrewish stepmother and the girl's obnoxious friend.  It is the story of this young girl's urge to survive war, improve herself, and find a better life.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pretty good game. Gets a bit repetitive at times and don't like the long time restraints however. Still enjoy it.
B004A8ZWT2|4.0|Based on the French film &#34;Anthony Zimmer&#34; this movie is about a thief who is trying to reignite a romance with a woman he left for two years.  With a new face, a new voice, and a new name, he lures the woman to Venice where he plans to reveal himself and explain his long absence.  The problem comes when the man he stole a fortune from learns he is in Venice and comes after him with a team of Russian thugs.  This movie puts its stars, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in unusual roles; Depp is the romantic lead, and Jolie does not throw a single punch.  Although I don't think they ever connect as a romantic couple on camera, they are fun to watch.  The mistaken identity angle is intriguing, the scenes of Venice are spectacular, and the music is great.  &#34;The Tourist&#34; isn't perfect.  As I said Depp and Jolie never really connect as a romantic pair, and the ending is a little flat.  In an effort to make her glamorous, they put so much makeup on Jolie that she looks like a department store mannequin.  They could have wiped most of it off and she would be more beautiful.  With that said, &#34;The Tourist&#34; is a beautifully photographed movie, with great cast of characters, and enough intrigue to keep the plot moving.  I suggest watching &#34;The Tourist&#34; and &#34;Anthony Zimmer&#34; together, and enjoying how the same story can be told in such different ways.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This is a very informative and eye opening movie. I wish it was required that everyone in America view this so that they understood the importance of supporting small farmers and where their food really comes from.
B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|There was so much wrong with this book!  I think the most annoying thing was the Bridget Jones was not acting her age throughout the whole book.  The style of writing was also really annoying as there were a lot of conversations via text messaging/twitter and it just didn't flow nicely.  I disliked that Mr Darcy wasn't in the book and hated that the book was majority about Bridget pursuing much younger men.  Loved the first two Bridget Jones but I'm sorry to say that in this one the author just missed the mark majorly.
031623480X|5.0|Took me a few days to complete the book. Large print made it easy to read. Author is realistic which is what I like, he's knows what people eat and he understands how hard it is for us to change so he recommends small changes. The dr. Provides real life situations of how changing your diet can truly help. Recipes in the back and links to other valuable sites. Basically what I learned is that we are all in control of what we put in our bodies and what we do with our bodies... Eat healthy, exercise. Live in moderation and don't over-do. Now the biggest test for me to get off my butt and do something about David's recommendations. Good luck everyone... You can do it!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Would rather pay something up front than having to sign to junk or pay for coins. Game not worth downloading.
1416972250|5.0|I personally haven't read the book. My 12 and 11 year old are reading city of glass and city of ashes now. I'm just happy they are reading. The books are advanced for my girls... And what I mean the kids in the books go out at night, have tattoos, go to clubs, kissing, a few curses and there is killing... Basically everything they are exposed to in the local newspaper and tv news.  At this point I just want my daughter to read, the older one. So if you would like to keep your kids away from real world exposure, this isn't the book for your child.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Just watched this film for the first time, over the weekend. Hoped, hoped, hoped that Jimmy Stewart won an Oscar for his performance. Was thrilled  to see that he actually did win, considering he spends his first scenes in the Lord mansion quiet, restrained, and delays his speaking lines until the party. Brilliant performance. I know a couple of Mikes IRL and Stewart captures them flawlessly. Thanks, Academy, for confirming my first reaction.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is one of the truest and also saddest books I.have ever had the opportunity to read. We are of Jewish descent as such I thought it was all about the BAD Germans. I see now this is not exactly. So.  READ THIS BOOK and reflect upon what you have read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was interesting. I felt pretty quickly that Jacob was guilty but his parents and their feelings was hard to imagine. I cannot imagine how a parent would handle something like this.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|Good engaging story line. Some interesting characters set in a historical gold rush town. A good read for the summer
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great album. Every track is truly impressive. Not With Haste a hidden gem. Below my feet amazing track. Great for gifts.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just love being able to open the Kindle app, tap on the book I want to open, and voila, there on my phone is the page that I left off on, or a little box that tells me the furthest page read asking me if I want to go there.  Can it be any easier than that?  I don't think so!
B00G3P6VA4|4.0|A friend recommended this move with some reservations and I decided to purchase it and see what I thought about it myself. First of all, there isn't a Sci Fi movie that I didn't like at least a little. Also, I'll admit, that I am also a Matt Damon and Jodie Foster Fan. So, how did Matt do? His character, Max, is all grown up into a street thug on parole in a run down city of the future.  He clearly knows how to act the part and plays the role really well - that's the thing about Matt Damon, he never lets you know he's just acting. Then there is Jodie Foster. Clearly she is playing a sophisticated security chief and does it well with an accent and an element of sophistication and deviousness, which is a polar opposite of Matt Damon's role, at least from the space station perspective. The plot was just a tad bit thin, but it's enough to keep my attention throughout the movie. Its not one of those plots that jumps out at the last minute, or keeps you wondering what it is. Its like a rail road train, you know where you are going the minute the train left the station. But, if its a trip from one end of the country to another, what route you take is another story. And that is what Elysium is all about. There are really great special affects. Just how do you get an atmosphere that you can breathe in space without an airlock and have it seem possible to us Sci Fi movie buffs? Watch and see. And what will the rich do with all that money someday? Well, it just figures! This movie has heroes, and sacrifice. It also has crazy people working for the bad guys, and only slightly crazy people who are fighting for a better way of life for everyone else. Its a possible outcome of our own world, the separation of classes, if we keep going down the path we are going, or at least one possible outcome if we do. The movie made me think, and I like movies that make me think. Besides a thin plot, and supporting actors that are just a bit more than mediocre,  the 'aha' moment allows you to forgive the shortcomings of this movie and wonder what you would do. After all, its a wonderful life, or at least it could be. If you are a thinker, this movie is perfect for Christmas time!orgive the shortcomings of this movie and wonder what you would do. After all, its a wonderful life, or at least it could be. If you are a thinker, this movie is perfect for Christmas time!
B001RTSPVY|3.0|Even being an interesting serie, the image quality is below my expectations. I know it is just a DVD, but I have seen better quality in other series, like Lost or Prison Break. Besides that, this second season lacks spanish subtitles, a must for me.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I love Iron Man!! Honestly the reason I love this film so much is because they didn't just make Iron Man this dumb guy lots of money and he built a suit. They gave Tony Stark a possibly real back story with a realistic script making it a great film.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I like doing the puzzles while listening to Christmas music. It is nice and relaxing and I can choose the difficulty of the puzzle.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Fast and exciting but again you have to buy lives. Easier if I could just buy the game at full price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the challenge of this game that makes it so addictive. Don't expect to fly through levels. But do expect to fully enjoy and get totally hooked!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game has the cutest dragons! And the best part is if you get tired of it you can take a break for a while without worrying about losing  hard-earned progress
B000002OMN|4.0|Brings back memories.  The cd was in perfect condition.  The case was a little scratched.  The important thing is I can remember all the words to the 12 minute songs. :)
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I am a fan of the show! Great story lines and great acting. a follower since season one. I love the character development.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I wish I had never got this game. the game is so fun. my little brother adores it. one day it wouldn't allow me to open it. I unistalled and installed again only to find out I had to start over. I thought why not since it was one of the only good games I could find w/dinosaurs but not its acting up again. please fix this.
B007TK77QE|3.0|An interesting build up to a story. Asked on characters and a limited story line. A good mystery out of the authors usual mould.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Raunchy, not for family, but funny.  Glad my kids are grown so we could laugh but if they were younger would have been a problem
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|This book was OK, not bad but not great.  As the story went along I found myself disbelieving how K&M managed to &#34;best&#34; our top security agencies without ending up in Gitmo.  When the end game was revealed, I had a sort of, &#34;That's it?&#34; moment.  Also, the conversation between K&M was kind of stilted.  I'm thinking Baldacci does not do couples and relationships very well.  His books I've enjoyed most have lone protagonists for whom I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story.  Still, OK for a read on a cold or rainy day.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading until I finished the whole series.  Very clever, lots to laugh about and unique take on Vampires and werewolves.  The main character is  someone I would love to have as a friend.  Not just for YA.  I am 60 years old.  My youngest daughter recommened this series to me.  I can't wait for Gail to complete her new series.  I will definately buy it.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I knew nothing about this book when it was recommended by a friend, who mentioned only &#34;a hilarious scene in Texas&#34;.  And there was that!  But so much more, so much more.  I will not try to be a scholarly critic here, I will just say that it is an incredible piece of writing, deeply affecting, and the best book I have read in many years.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Espn the emerald city council of doing business and they hatch to get the emerald city council of the best years of the mincraft pe and full of a wi tank and yout the inc and a good idea to be
0380715430|5.0|I love words and this book is fascinating.  Mr. Bryson is an extremely good author and evidently  researched  heavily to tell us about our language and several other languages too.  This book is a very informative and enjoyable read, to be sure.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book was on a list entitled something like \\"100 Books Every Man Should Read\\", and undoubtedly I would have to conquer.<br /><br />The fierceness of life is an unrelenting force, but even more unrelenting is the desire to truly live.<br /><br />I'm glad this book was capable of getting me out of my reading slump. I encourage any adventurous soul to read this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had me hooked from the beginning; didn't see all the twists an  turns which made for great reading.  Must read!
B00CE03UOC|2.0|It was hard the first level then it was easy too easy. Plus the only thing special about our is its neon! If you want a game like this just get the regular flow! It's free anyway.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not much  of a book person but this book is outstanding. Keeps you on he edge of your seat the whole time.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is the best game because it is fun to play in car rides just sitting around any time any day I play it. I have all the flow like flow bridges and flow and now neon flow get the game and LOVE IT!
B006WZIETG|4.0|Who doesn't like Gizmo, and especially in this one. A good flick that I dig out around the holiday time.
B00DWHWOFC|4.0|Played this on the whole way on a 7 hour car trip. Like that it doesn't use the internet or kill my battery.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|It may not be for small children, but this is really good. If you are a batman fan, this is for you.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|If you really want to improve your photographic skills, this is a must read. If you don't understand exposure stick with a small point & shoot always on auto  If you want to see things in a creative way you must read this book
B000K7VHH8|4.0|One of my favorite movies. Sean Connery and Katherine Zeta Jones, you can't go wrong. Good plot and the ending was good.
0451191153|4.0|I find myself torn between a 5 star review and a 4 star review, so have gone with the lower. Rand does a brilliant job of framing up a cast of archetypes that serve to provide a literary backdrop for her philosophy of objectivism. The protagonist, Roark, is the superman, and is referred to as such at least once in the novel. Toohey, the antagonist, is the classic second-hand life - leveraging the power of society and not creating his own. Domanique is the archetype of the female power player - the perfect complement to Roark.<br /><br />The book itself is over 600 pages of sometimes very dense writing. I sometimes found myself a bit mystified at the meaning of elements of the story, and some of the dialogue is extremely long, and reads more like a sermon or a philosophy text than a conversation. Having said that, the book will make you think about the role of the self and the creator in society - and whether the self should ever be subjected to societal pressures. Rand's view of the individual as the primary unit of being comes through loud and clear in the book - and the extreme elements of the characters that make the book a tough read make the message an easy one to grasp.<br /><br />This should be on a short list of long books to read, and is worth picking up. Be forewarned, however. This book is heavy in terms of weight and weighty topics. Not a light or easy read at all.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Part two is just as good as part one. Both are great movies and must have for Batman fans. If you have small children, this one might not be for them just yet.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|pay close attention.  be careful how you spend. all in all just another rpg. it wont bore you but it wont thrill ya either
B0079KGAOY|4.0|Lethal Weapon in a great boxed set. You can't go wrong, and as a fan of the series I just had to get this.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|It is probably Stryper's best album since To Hell With the Devil. Every song on this album screams melodic heavy metal at it's best. Great job Stryper. I am going to enjoy your music for as long as I live.
B00AZ7V0W0|4.0|What can I say. All of the Nightmare on Elm Street films in one set is great. A true chiller thriller set.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Absolutely love this game. It reminds me a little of king 's quest. Nice simple game. My 3 year old and 5 year old love it as do I.
B004097IKW|5.0|Juan Diego Florez lives up to his reputation as a real lyric tenor.  His high notes are right on the money and his treatment of the role is very appropriate.  Nino Machaidze as Elvira is a joy to listen to and watch.  Her &#34;mad scene&#34; is absolutely believable.  This presentation by the Bologna Opera is out of this world -- the staging and lighting really add to the whole effect.  I'm really glad I bought this DVD.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a richly written fabric of a family's history. The words flow like a river producing one of the most sumptuous books I have ever read. Khaled produces poetry that shows the angle of the light, innermost feelings of its subjects and the taste of the air around them. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those who have read his other books. Be prepared to be transported!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|5 stars for the characters, plot, and twists and turns. I loved the references to the Hailey trial in A TIME TO KILL.  One of my favorite Grisham novels; reminds me why I am a fan.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Something I couldn't put down. As a high school history teacher I have used John Green 's crash course world/us history videos to differentiate my instruction, which has led my students to inform me of his literary works- well at least of this book.<br /><br />I read it and I couldn't stop. Lovely. Heartbreaking. Honest. Read it, you won't regret it.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Works great. First wine bottle cut into a drinking glass and drinking out of it as I type this - took all of 5 minutes - 12 seconds of actually using this tool, the rest heating/cooling and sanding/polishing. Couldn't be happier with this for the price.<br /><br />The construction is kind of cheap and the instructions for use aren't clear. So it doesn't get a 5-star rating. If you just look at the pictures in the instruction booklet, it's easy to figure out how to put it together. Once assembled though - completely disregard the instruction booklet. Check out youtube vids for better methods on how to actually score the bottles than what's in the instructions. Again, for the price, no major complaints.<br /><br />After looking at the Creator's Bottle Cutter, and almost getting that one. I figure I would give this one a shot for 1/4 the price.  Way better than expected. Until this one wears out, it does what it needs to do and does it fairly well.
B00CE03UOC|2.0|Not bad for mindless entertainment.  Besides, it's free.  Does what it says it does. Can't ask for more than that.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|it started out fun but then it became boring.  I wish I got more coins for the correct ones. I am glad it was free.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book keeps you guess what will happen next. Great love story , shows you love can help you over almost anything.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think this game is the best. I entertains you, and represents the movie Real Steel, fantastically. You can fight robots, have a collection of your own robots. You can upgrade you robot to the maximum and fight!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is super easy and fun!!!!! Also it is way more fun than temple run!!!!!!
0345803493|4.0|HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS LIFESTYLE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS A SUB. LOVED THIS SERIES AND FEEL IT IS REAL. I LOVE BEING DOMINATED WHEN IN PRIVATE.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|this is a really great cooler, it was very easy to install and it gets temps my old cooler could only dream of well below 25 degrees C, I am currently running a Intel I3 and this bad boy keeps it nice and cool!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's hard to find much wrong with this app. Perhaps forecasted radar and tropical storm forecasts could be slightly better, but they are as good as the NWS.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|this case has all the functions a gamming rig needs, super fast USB 3.0, cable management space, great air ventilation for multiple fans configurations with filters, just buy this case you will not be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put the book down! Even though I watched the movie the book was still exciting...can't wait to read the next book!
B00CHVJI08|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She saw the Croods in the cinema and was crazy about the film. She was so delighted to open the parcel and find the dvd and a toy of belt. Great value for money and arrived earlier than estimated date.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It's hard to believe that I have finished this great series!  I am eagerly awaiting the next book  from Roth!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really really cool app dose what it says on the tin and more best battery app you can get !!!!!!!Just download it and see for yourself  tells you all you need to know . Can't say anymore :))))))))
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|This is the story of a boy, and the relationships with the people that the boy meets along the way, as well as his obsession to kill a super powered being.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's has the traditional pacing and build of a western superhero comic book. I hesitate to say that it is an entirely original take, but it is certainly an entertaining one at times.<br /><br />However, It does drag. If you've read a lot of comic books, seen superhero movies, and have generally been exposed to a lot of adventure type of stories, you'll feel tired after a few pages into each scenario. A lot of elements could have been shortened, and tightened up, so that it doesn't last forever.<br /><br />Another thing is, the boy seems to gain new quirks as the book progresses. It's kind of like the author had no idea who this kid is and just kept adding things here and there that were never mentioned in the start. At one point he is suddenly terrible at making metaphors, yet it was never mentioned in the start, or even hinted at. I realise that it is common for authors to slowly build characters as opposed to giving the audience all the info in the start, but, in this case, it never felt like a smooth subtle nudge to help you get to who the character was, it was more like a kick in the rear and the author shouting &#34;OH YEAH, HE'S ALSO LIKE THIS!&#34;<br /><br />2 stars. The pacing bothered me. I won't be buying the next book.
1416936386|5.0|This is an amazing book, one of my absolute favorites. I highly recommend it. BUT I must take a few seconds to bash on this new cover, I absolutely HATE the new cover. The older one was a million times better. I honestly miss the old covers dearly. These covers are truly stupid.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|you should get this game it is awesome and cool so if you are reading this right now u should get this game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good<br />this game is great its fun and very realistic I think the animation is good too.<br />I love it!
0670022411|3.0|I'm not sure that people who value &#34;reading time&#34; would appreciate the time not spent reading &#34;A discovery of witches&#34;. First, it is a bit boring. There is basically no action. Second, descriptions are used to extreme, and not only are they irrelevant, they are also dull. Third, the strength of the historian is completely missing in the novel. There are no historical facts that enrich the novel. Fourth and most important, this novel is not even a novel, but a preamble to the second and third volume. Reading 800 pages or so, just to know that two more novels are waiting in your bookcase and that after spending all that time you will finally know what this is all about is just pure capitalism. I'm just not a fan.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|This game is great it's the real game from pc. The single player is great but when it comes to multiplayer that is the problem because I can't connect to someone who is sitting right next to me. But besides that I loved this game it is so addicting the first day I had it I couldn't put it down so I recommend that you buy this game
1623650003|4.0|I don't want to ruin any surprises!  This is a suspenseful book about kidnapping, torment, and revenge.  The characters are awesome and there are lots of twists and turns.  The author is so skilled that he can change your opinion of characters at will.  Read it!!!
1592407889|1.0|Zero stars for Ms. Parker, who suffers from classic Borderline Personality Disorder. Beware of contributing to her pathology in buying or reading this book. Her need for immediate self gratification is clearly displayed in her behaviors, as well as in her attitudes, her lack of integrity or interest in the truth, and the very malice and manipulation so apparent throughout her &#34;story&#34;. Quite pathological for someone her age to persist at such a toxic dysfunctional level.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Sequels can be lame- but this one is definitely not.  It takes twists and turns that were completely unpredictable.  Loved it!!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I just got my game today and I had to delete it after the second time I played it.don't buy it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Intriguing and not so difficult that you lose interest. Wish t here were more floors!  Looking f forward to an update- any day now guys!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Characters, there were many and sometimes hard to keep straight. I did like how they came together but especially cherished the way she gave the ending for each and everyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A tale wonderfully told.  The horrors of Nazi Germany are presented with touching, raw, gentle, and harsh narrative.  I couldn't put it down.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun item search game  lots of variety and a story line to go along with it.<br />Never gets dull.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|doesn't seem to provide clarity and separation I was expecting.  Sounds can be distorted on lower end and muffled depending on setting and type of music
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Everyone this is an awesome game, but people barely draw back. If you're active, draw with me! Me username is Karen2342
B00BD62X14|5.0|Heavenly and happy music.  This album has so much going for it.  Not sure what music you want to listen to?  This fits the bill.  Bruni is so talented!
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|Not bad for a free game. Cute characters. Simple to understand.<br />Just got it so don't know much more. Have fun!
B00FXEL00W|2.0|Perhaps if I would have examined the book information more thoroughly before jumping in, I would have noticed that this was &#34;YA&#34; and NOT an &#34;Adult Contemporary Romance.&#34; There was nothing &#34;adult&#34; about this book, this is a romance for late teens and 20 somethings.<br /><br />Throughout the whole story I was waiting for mature and adult responses to emotions and feelings but nope!  It was basic with no real depth, At least its not written like a teenager wrote it. The author does write well, the leads and their mindsets and attitudes were just too immature for me. I need leads over 30 with mature emotional responses and range.<br /><br />This actually reminded me a little of &#34; All that Lies Within&#34; just with a younger cast.<br />2 stars because the leads were from New Jersey, my hometown! Lol.
B001JIES4Q|5.0|An absolutely fabulous cast. I have given this movie as a holiday gift many, many times and everyone has loved it as much as I do.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think this is amazing. I have so much fun, and it entertains me and everyone around me. I could not ask for anything better. Seriously, not even if I tried. This is the best dollar I have ever spent.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|This is a big book - and a fairly thin story. Page after page, nothing much happens. The (few) racy parts just didn't connect with the rest of the story for me. The actions of the main character in particular seemed anachronistic. I loved Eat, Pray, Love, but this book was a disappointment.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|Present for My Nephew and He loves it He being 26 years old . Quality and finish are xlnt ..
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|If I could rate the special effects separately from the acting, I'd give 5 stars to the effect and 2 stars to the acting.  The movie itself is a banquet of sweeping, breathtaking scenes and effects.  It is well enough achieved to allow the viewer to accept these stunning images as real and become immersed in the picture.  Sadly, though, Tom Cruise - who is capable of some pretty fine acting - is just Tom Cruise.  He's wooden and predictable.  Even Morgan Freeman somehow felt like he was just being himself.  There was nothing unique or identifiable about the characters.  It really took away from the movie which at first had me believing I might see more by the end.<br /><br />I didn't.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|For a person who has spent a lot of time in the woods, I love the graphics, the challenge, and the absence of ads.  Just started playing and I am having a blast.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I can hardly stand the wait for this beautiful tool. Please, Amazon, see how far-reaching this app would actually go if you made it available on the Kindle Fire!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show rocks!! If you are a fan of smart and witty style of detective then you owe it to yourself to pay the mere dollar 99 and watch it on Amazon in your browser... You will likely get hooked and buy the whole season! There are not many shows that manage to have the characters personalities grow right before your eyes in the way this show has pulled off, that was the Elementary thing that I most got a kick out of.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It allows you to be creative on how to decorate your island and train dragons to earn cash adn race the dragons. In my opinion this game is epic!!!!!!
B004AQR24W|1.0|Just terrible and run of the mill garbage. Not even a B movie. This is one if not THE worst action movie I've ever watched. Arnold in his 80s would be better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've always heard about this game but I've never tried it. Now I know what people are talking about! And I didn't know that it was on the Kindle Fire. The only thing I don't like is that you have to wait for lives. But otherwise, great game!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|A slightly slow start to an awesome show. Once this show gets going though, you'll be addicted to it like millions of others out there.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is SOOO much fun but if you only like the sand box I HIGHLY reccomend the field of dreams. The 3 bucks is SOOO worth it because the level is HUGE and there is a lot of spaces to put stuff and there is SO much stuff to build with. But the levels are loads of fun too!
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|Great cd. The mother we share got me to buy the cd. When i bought it I realized almost all the others are just as good. I look forward to seeing more from this band.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great movie, love the characters the story is great, just had to have it in my DVD collection. Love it.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|The Lightning connector broke the first time I used it.  I use my iPad with the power connected all the time. I wanted a longer cable than the standard Apple cable, so I ordered this one.  I plugged the cable in and started using the iPad.  Shortly afterward, I saw that the cable was loose.  I thought that I just needed to plug it back in, but the metal tip was still inside the iPad.  The tip had dislodged from the cable and I had to use a pair of plyers to get the tip out of the iPad.  Fortunately the iPad was not damaged in any way.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Great movie, love the characters the story is great, just had to have it in my DVD collection. Love it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mahjong (Kindle Tablet Edition)<br /><br />I'm totally hooked on this game. I could play for hours. I also enjoy the design of the tiles.
B000683VI4|5.0|Great movie, love the characters the story is great, just had to have it in my DVD collection. Love it. It makes me cry every time I watch it that's a wonderful love story,
B007N8RULO|5.0|Enjoy having different levels of difficulty to fit my mood, and trying to better my time and number of moves. I like this far better than the basic Solitaire.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie, love the characters the story is great, just had to have it in my DVD collection. Love it.
B00FB0KYNM|5.0|It has been said that Sinatra was at his best live. This album is certainly a case in point.Especially when He is teamed up with the equally great Count Basie big band<br />with arrangements by Quincy Jones.<br />If you are a Sinatra and/or big band fan as I am you will love this album.
0394721780|4.0|Good cooking book but not for me, too complicated with lots of ingredients i prefer something simpler, but if you like to cook that's a great book.
B00GIZO674|5.0|I really liked this app a hole lot I thought that I had tons of stuff for you to do
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It manages to keep my brother and sister busy which is a very daunting task. Unfortunately they do not no how to save so they wasted all the blue crystals on reviving them selves simply because it was faster then waiting for the timer to run out which brings me to my next point could you maybe add a skip button there.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Pretty dull for a majority of the book and a terrible ending. Disappointing. I expected better considering how much I enjoyed the other books.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|ooooooh its free today so I guess like the show the price is right for me. what would you say?
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well it is obviously awesome but I want a minecart and Redstone other than that it's awesome! But needs an update at least once. Worth 7 bucks! 5 star I really recommend it to everyone.
B008NW67E0|3.0|A good second album, it suffers by comparison to the brilliant first work. If you like Mumford & Sons, you'll probably like this one, but it doesn't have the fire, the passion of Sigh No More.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is one of my most favorite games of all time and I'm so happy it's on Amazon. However, this game needs a version update and bug fixes I was so disappointed to know that I couldn't get info hard mode after defeating the wall of flesh. Also it needs to to allow players to have more health. 10 hearts isn't cutting it. But besides those things I absolutely love this game and will continue to love it forever.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|One of the best groups to come out of Australia in recent years. Saw them live in Columbus, Ohio, excellent live band!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is so amazing .This game has awesome graphics. It has the best DC characters ever. Cool game you should download it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book kept me reading until the end. Captivating first book I ever read by John Grisham will definitely be looking forward to some more great reads.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down. Just to read her transformation and the courage it took to just travel a year not knowing anyone or what will happen. I definitely recommend it!
0399255370|5.0|Way cute story about feelings and crayons. Bought it for each of my grandkids' families and it changes the way we look at coloring now
B00FHATBGW|4.0|I am new to big fish games and I am already a fan! Keep them coming!! I will certainly recommend these games to friends and family.
B007ZFZI8C|5.0|If you love the sea and everything done by melanie c. Stages is a goodie.<br />favorites like Another hundred people , Aren't you kinda glad we did , I knew him so well with emma bunton<br />& Only have eyes for you. Very well done and I just love perfection.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Got to 30 level and have been stuck for days. Don't like that you have to wait 30 mins to continue or beg friends on Facebook or spend money to progress. Think I'll stick with some other games.
0316776963|5.0|I loved this book so I sent it to  my daughter. She read it and she laughed and loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the technology but would like more options to stream to my TV.<br />Other than Netflix, I don't have too much to stream.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This was relaxing and fun, small logic puzzles but with numbers.  I used my stylus which made it even better.  I definitely recommend this game and might purchase the others on here.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Wonderfully written!  So loved the characters in the story.  From the minute I started reading I literally could not put it down.  Treat yourself to a wonderful experience and get this book now.  Kristen Zimmerman...can't wait for your next one!
B002ZG98FU|5.0|great movie.  great price as usual on amazon.  great cast and story.  gave this as a gift to my wife and she loved it
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I chose this rating because the video quality was great in a bluray format and the movie offered the same action and charm as it did when made in the 30's. I also believe I also saw the horse that eventually became Roy Roger's choice for Trigger for his TV show.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a must read for any fan of science fiction. It is not only relevant to the genre but to the state of many institutions in the world today. Enjoy!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The ending was a let down though.  I think the book would have been better if the ending wasn't so sad.  I don't see the purpose of the book ending like it did.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|While it's always a pleasure to read a Pendergast novel, this one is a little predictable. It's well written and worth reading, however, it's no Cabinet of Curiosities....
B0073QNIH6|5.0|Excellent detailed description<br />Its size is impressive and realistic.<br />Representation is somewhat lacking in the jaw joint.<br /><br />My son really liked it.<br />He Throws it. Tread it.<br /><br />She still alive~!!!! it is Very durable.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Been playing for 2 weeks.Love it!But now I go to load it and it freezes and I can't play.please fix issue.I want to continue to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent!  Now I must read the other two books. Too bad I can't loan this one to the world. Thank you.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good I learned  so much got a good grade on my test because I spelled  every thing right by direction
B001JNNE64|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my father who loves the movie.  Unfortunately, this is a director's cut...and ONLY a director's cut and it expands the movie in a way that doesn't serve the film.  I think my father watched it once and will likely not watch it again.  I wish they had seen fit to include the theatrical version as well to give viewers the option which version to watch.  If you love the film and a curious, go for it, but you may feel, as I do, that you should have waited for the definitive presentation...with the theatrical version intact.

0811875040|4.0|I saw this book in Barnes and Noble and was thoroughly taken with it.  Everything from the scalloped edges to the design to the recipes communicates the author's exacting sensibilities and, undoubtedly, the reason behind the success of Miette.  That said, once I purchased the book from Amazon and read it (literally cover to cover), I thought that I might not ever make any of the desserts in the book.  It's not that they're not appealing..but the book is designed to replicate the bakery recipes even down to their impractical scale which necessitate buying less standard sized pans, etc.  The detail that drew me in to the world of Miette is also what will likely keep me out of it because none of the recipes are for the spontaneous baker...they all require very deliberate planning and ingredients/equipment.  The size issue is one that the author deals with in her text, explaining that she feels the scale reflects &#34;an elegant sufficiency&#34; which I totally get...and that it uses far less ingredients (less, not fewer) that a standard 8 or 9 inch pan...also a good thing...but am I going to buy 6 inch pans to do it?...probably not.  If one runs a bakery, there is time to indulge in many of the eccentricities of these recipes...but for a regular Joe, it takes more of an effort and I'm not sure I'm ready to put that forth as a garden variety baker.  I'm glad I bought the book...but it will likely fall into the category of &#34;Food porn&#34; on my shelf.
B00GIGGS6A|5.0|I've never owned a graphics tablet and was a little scared when picking something out at random. There are so few reviews on the net that are for anything other than Wacom, but I found an artist on the net, Frenden (frenden dot com) who gives reviews to tablets that are &#34;off-label&#34; and he gave a good review for the Huion 610. When I searched for it I noticed the 610 Pro was coming out shortly and ordered it. I have never used another graphics tablet so there's nothing to compare it to, but I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed is that when switching between tools the tablet will read full pressure for a split second, but it's corrected itself immediately every time so far. I don't have wireless for my PC, so I haven't tested that out yet, The USB cable is relatively short, but it fits my workspace.
0062101897|5.0|I love the book.  It might be one of my favorite books of all time.  I was happy with the Film Wizardry book but that looks like kiddie fare compared to this tome.  Whatever was missing from that previous volume is present here with an series-wide look at the making of each film with all its attendant nuances.  I especially loved reading individual points of view from the actors for each of the films.  You get a distinct feeling that this book was written with an insider's perspective.  Having visited the studio in Leavesden, this volume remains as my keepsake for a decade's worth of Harry Potter magic.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've read a LOT of books. Great books. This book was so great, it makes me feel I was lying when I said any other book was great. It's a love story...not only of the characters loving one another, but of the reader loving them too. It is a life story...not just about peoples' lives, but about how to look at life. To live. As the title of my review says, this book was so amazing, no words of my describing it can do it justice. You will have to read the book.

1591396190|3.0|I had high expectations of &#34;Blue Ocean Strategy&#34;. The book never came recommended, but it has been a business best-seller... though I'm not quite sure whether that says anything about the quality of a book. I have to say that the book isn't bad but it wasn't very fantastic either. It had its good moments (earlier chapters) but also its bad moments (when it becomes too much like a recipe).<br /><br />Blue ocean strategy is about creating an organizational strategy that is not based on the competition but based on finding a new market. The book consists of three parts: 1) Overview, 2) Formulating a strategy, 3) Executing the strategy.<br /><br />The first part defines Blue Ocean strategies and gives several examples of where companies have created a blue ocean. It also introduces several tools that are useful for analyzing markets and that might enable finding a blue ocean (which they call unlock a blue ocean).<br /><br />The second part talks about how to formulate blue ocean strategies. It shows how to the the strategy canvas for mapping out the current markets and how to break out of these by eliminating or enhancing factors of the product. Also it covers how to look beyond customers and find out how to create new customers by delivering additional value (which is what they name value innovation).<br /><br />The last part covers the execution of a strategy (which was the part I liked least). The authors realize that a strategy without execution won't be too beneficial, but realize there are certain common obstacles for executing a blue ocean strategy, especially related to the organization. They give examples of how you can overcome these hurdles.<br /><br />The book was ok written. I felt it was a bit dry at times. The case studies were pretty good, but they were all retrospectively. That is also what bothered me most about the book, which is the authors have analyzed many cases and then created a process about how such a strategy could have been created. But in most cases, I guess, the tools from this book were probably not used as the road from strategy to execution doesn't go in the nicely defined steps the authors describe (at least, not in my experience). This caused a feeling that the book was too theoretical. It isn't a bad book but it was definitively not a 'yeah' book either. I wouldn't quickly recommend it except for people intensely interested in strategy. So, just three stars.But in most cases, I guess, the tools from this book were probably not used as the road from strategy to execution doesn't go in the nicely defined steps the authors describe (at least, not in my experience).

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is an interesting concept but fairly limited. The app has to be chromecast enabled for this to work. I wanted to use for streaming from a Kindle Fire HD, which can be done in a very limited way.<br /><br />This really is meant for people who like to stay in a Google environment. There was an interesting hack that allowed anything from a PC to stream, by Google disabled that. Too bad because that would have been useful.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The beginning of the story was great, if you're a reader, you knew what the twist was going to be. A little past midway was a chunk of reading that you knew was the 'key' but it took way too many pages to get there, especially from a great writer like Grisham.

1609611543|5.0|Good book, wheat is the cause of so many issues we all have, from pain to neurological. The wheat now a days is nothing like the wheat we had back in our grand dad days. Its all GMO'd up and full of crap, no wonder we have so many GI and neurological issues these days.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Like a majority of such teen heart throb books this had a story like a good stew but stretched to book, then trilogy length with the addition of water.  The book should have have been finished with all three parts rather than torn apart for money.  Then edited for content.  Cotton candy.

B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rankin's Rebus series is as good a police procedural novel as you can find. The Scottish location adds color and is still understandable, as gritty and realistic as one could hope.  It's fun to contrast this with Craig Johnson's Wyoming novels.<br />These days, Rankin is one of the UK's major novelists, someone who should be on the Booker list but is simply too good for the intellectuals.

B00G21YLF6|5.0|I expected a lot from the 50th anniversary special, and Steven Moffat delivered; The Day of the Doctor actually exceeded my expectations! We finally learned the truth about the time war and the terrible choice that haunted the doctor for so long. John Hurt was brilliant in the role of that earlier regeneration, his \\"older\\" and darker self. Tennant, Smith and Hurt were fantastic together, and bringing Billy Piper back as a manifestation of the sentient weapon intended to end the time war was perfect. The story tied up some loose ends and explained an inconsistency in \\"The End of Time\\" that had bothered me. It also opened a whole universe of opportunities for the future of the show.<br /><br />Oh, and it was great fun! I watched the television simulcast on November 23rd and saw it in the theater on November 25th. Strax the Sontaran explained what would happen to those who attempted to use their communicators during the presentation, David Tennant and Matt Smith did introductions ... and told us how to identify Zygons in the audience. I would definitely see it again.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I had the old two episodes per disc volumes 1 through 40 that I just sold on eBay and got more $ for those than I paid for these new  on Blu-ray!  I had been waiting for the right time to purchase these and at 66% off for only $69.99 I felt that the time was right.  I've watched several of the episodes since having received the set.  My ONLY complaint is that seasons 1 and 2 the cases were cracked at the top inside (not extremely noticeable, and I was able to repair with clear packaging tape).  I read a few others on here had the same experience with the &#34;cracked&#34; Blu-ray cases.  I don't think it was Amazon's fault though.  I chose not to send them back for this reason because the cracks are barely noticeable and do not affect the ability to store the discs.  Highly recommended.  The picture quality will never be better than on these Blu-ray discs.  Don't hesitate to get it at a decent price, and sell your old DVD sets of Star Trek on eBay as I did!
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The book provides some good insights on how habits form and how we can change them to our benefit.  It also discusses how the brain is believed to function on a subliminal level and how that relates to habitual behaviors being triggered and carried out automatically.  Those parts of the books are very interesting.  There is a lot of other material wherein the author applies these theories to some cases of individual and organizational behavior to try and explain things that happened.  Some of that seemed insightful and some of it seemed like a stretch.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|Good book to read to pre-k and kindergarten children to teach them to take care of crayons.  They take it all in.
B009LRE040|5.0|This movie doesn't need a long review: its thrilling. I am not a big fan of superhero movies. But the Batman trilogy by Nolan goes beyond a typical comic hero adaptation to bring on the doubts, lights and shadows, good and bad we see in our daily experience. Part of the amazing thing is he was able to discuss notions such as an anarchic society versus lying for freedom in these movies. If you enjoy good drama and action, watch this movie.

1451666179|3.0|I've had this book on my wish list since I first heard it was coming out. I finished reading it yesterday and it was much bleaker than I imagined from the reviews. Her drawings are hilarious, and I like the physical book: the paper is thick, the chapters form a rainbow on the outside of the book, and the back cover is very funny. Some of the chapters are funny, and the depression ones are spot-on, but some just didn't seem that interesting. Maybe if I had dogs I would be into those sections more. And maybe I'm just remembering the last chapter, which seemed dull and kind of a downer. I'll have to re-read it. I just remember receiving it a few days ago and thinking of cool people I know that I could give the book to as gifts; after finishing it I don't really plan to give it to anyone. I recommend the blog over the book.
0375842209|5.0|One of my absolute favorite books EVER. I tell everyone to read this book that will literally change you as a person.
B00F91H666|5.0|Very fast-paced, excellent effects, great actors (Brad Pitt - come on!) - what's not to love?  It was an awesome thrill ride & I just rented it again.  Will most likely end up buying it, I enjoyed it that much!

B00CE03UOC|3.0|So far the game seems to be working well without having to pay for anything. As for the in app purchasing I haven't had anything require it yet. For a free download it seems to be an okay game.
B005WMADYE|5.0|Funky and great animation. I cant believe this a was produced by cell animation only ...  no wonder it took them years to finish.<br /><br />The story was not bad for a racing type anime movie, but it reminds me of the old racing anime in the 70's ...lol.
0783219695|5.0|Definitely a great movie! This is even better in wide screen on a 45&#34; HD TV (as opposed to my old Sony 19&#34; Trinitron & VCR)!
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|I am an old Disney fan. Love the classics. My boyfriend and I (23 and 24) went to see this on Thanksgiving and it was better than I expected it to be. 3 days later and I am still thinking about the movie and singing the songs in my head-- &#34;Do you wanna build a snowman?&#34; I don't go out to see movies at the theater often because I think it is too much money, but I have been thinking about going to see this again soon. I know Shrek isn't a Disney movie, but Shrek is one of my favorite movies too and when we walked out of the theater that night, the first thing I said was, &#34;I loved that like Shrek.&#34;

0385537131|5.0|My usual rating for John Grisham's works!  Just fantastic!<br /><br />I hope that more of his books are made into movies!
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Jennifer's best movie in a while, it's pretty funny and is well worth a rental fee, the kids are very believable and great characters, half way through with Aniston dancing I could not believe brad maybe left her even if for jolie, if you love Aniston you will love this movie, it maybe is to much for conservative people, in it has profanity, but it's a great comedy and way better than any preconceived notions you might have about the plot, I thought it sounded to cleshay then the trailer sold me due to Aniston stripping but it is really worth watching, and she's not stripping to sell a movie it's her character,  the movie is really good, even the boner garage part, pretty good writing, and some time went into the script and casting, even the kid with tatts has it down how kids talk today sometimes, you know what I'm saying, again if you love Aniston you will love this movie, many different views and forms of comedy not just one type or format, I assume Kenny worked for free due to getting to kiss two chicks in a film one being, the hottest woman America has in the film industry, later, Eric

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really only read this book because I ALWAYS read the book before I see the movie based on it.  But now as my heart cries, I am so happy that its words are forever with me.  It's beautifully and sarcastically written and the voice of the book is priceless.  Every character is fleshed out and the ending did not disappoint.

B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie was superb! Had me guessing what was gonna happen next & was one surprise after another. I had not read any reviews about this movie nor did I know what exactly it was about. My initial attraction was the cast. The fact that the movie was so good and unexpected was simply an added bonus. Suspenseful & Thrilling it's definitely a movie I'd recommend. Enjoy!

B000FC1AOI|5.0|I didn't realize PS, I Love You was based on a novel until well after I had seen the movie. As most books are far better than the movie, I had high expectations for this book. It didn't disappoint. It was actually a nice addition to the book, having watched the movie first, because Gerard Butler's lovely accent was in my head :-) Well worth the read!

B00BD99JMW|3.0|Originally posted on Zemfirka Blogs.<br /><br />Mild spoilers ahead<br /><br />It’s been over a month since release of Allegiant and I’m still trying to write a satisfactory review, it just seems like an impossible task. In fact my original draft review is ashamedly sitting waiting for me to look at it. It wasn’t good, or honest, or raw, it was more of a polite reaction to the end of what could’ve been one of the best YA dystopian trilogies. At this point, I think I really need to learn my lesson and not expect these trilogies to end well, they all simply underwhelm and disappoint [yes, I’m looking at you Matched and Delirium]. But don’t get me wrong, for all its faults I still believe Divergent series is one of the better ones out there and definitely worth reading.<br /><br />  “I am not all right. I was beginning to feel that I had finally found a place to stay, a place that was not so unstable or corrupt or controlling that I could actually belong there. You would think that I would have learned by now— such a place does not exist.” Allegiant (p. 276).<br /><br />I might’ve not loved Allegiant and it wasn’t the greatest or strongest book in the series, but not because of the “shocking” character death that was causing so much backlash over the social media. Surprisingly, I found Veronica’s choice almost appropriate; this book needed it. [Yes. There, I said it – please don’t hate me.] I know it was a heartbreaking moment for a lot of fans out there, but not every book needs a happily ever after to be great, or even good and the world of Divergent warranted this sacrifice.<br /><br />However, my biggest struggle had to do with the characters themselves, their actions and the final reveal of the outside world. Halfway through I’ve struggled to keep myself reading; this, once creative world and idea of the story started to feel repetitive. The science tie-in, the experiments and hours spent between Tris and Four always fighting or making out, it was exasperating. We were stuck in a vicious circle of their broken relationship and there was no escape, things were falling apart, the cusp was so close that I almost wished for them to cross it.<br /><br />These characters were deeply flawed and I felt my love and investment in their relation deteriorating with each page, but perhaps it was also the glory part of Allegiant. Veronica’s goal was to portray broken people and see them improve and mend themselves in the process of their struggle and in that, she succeeded. There is clear character growth and development that beautifully underlines this harsh dystopian world, and at the end there is hope that something can be rebuilt but not forgotten, which I think is important.<br /><br />  “There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater. But sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.” Allegiant (p. 509).<br /><br />So whether you love it or hate it, this book certainly inspires enough emotion to make it worth reading. I loved both of the previous books and I thought this was a fitting end to the series, but weakest of the three. Still, Veronica Roth delivers a captivating tale that at the very least inspires discussion.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I've loved NCIS from the very first show on JAG. I enjoyed JAG too but love NCIS. This was a must to add to our collection so we can see the whole episode without the distractions of advertisments. And the extra interviews and comments are fun.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Awesome. I did not expect how funny this would be. The characters developed a very good chemistry with each other.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I  enjoyed playing deer hunter on my new Kindle. The color is life like and the action is great . This is a review from some one that has hunted most of my life.
006202406X|1.0|Much slower than the other two in the series, until the ending, which is the WORST ENDING I HAVE EVER READ.  I can deal with devastating, but this just made no sense at all and ruined what was, until that point, such a great series.  Don't read unless you want to be depressed and disappointed.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|The sound is so clear!  I can understand the people that I am speaking with better than I can when I am listening to them with the phone itself. It also sounds as good as the untis that are placed in new cars from the manufacturer. This unit far exceeded my expectations. This was worth the money!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Fun to play the FREE version &amp; not too difficult. As you play this game, you become more addicted to it.

0316067598|5.0|Riveting book.  No surprise they made it into a movie.  Since the book was written, LT Michael Murphy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.  The moral dilemma faced by the SEAL team, as described by &#34;Luttrell&#34; - that led directly to not only their deaths, but the deaths of the SEALs who came to rescue them - continues to plague our force in Afghanistan today.

B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game.  It's like a saga game.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Hopefully it doesn't go bad like other on Amazon have
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Great Novel by Grisham. One of the best together with Time to Kill, The Firm and Pelican Brief. Instructive at the same time for those who are not familiar with the U.S. judicial system, so clearly explained in a manner that keeps you turning pages and hoping it will continue. I have finished the novel and feel that something is missing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a very fun game and is good for kids of any age and helps you know how to take care of a horse if you own one. :)
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|My brother and I Bought this game when I found out it was on sale so of course we bought it only to find out multiplayer doesn't work on 2nd gen kindle and this problem also goes for mincemeat to. I hope it's fixed soon cause he was real disappointed about that.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|What an amazing book!  I can't wait until the next one comes out.  I am so sad that wont be until March 2014, but my goodness, what an amazing read.  I love Kaladin, Dalinar, and Shallan.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's really fun and addictive but whenever I buy a outfit for a character there are lines all over it. Fix it and it's great.
B00A757EFW|5.0|The kids (and my wife) love playing this.  My wife used to play this all the time as a kid, she just loves it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a nice implementation of Free Cell, a solitaire card game.  I'm not quite sure what the + is in FreeCell+, but it's a nice version.<br /><br />The cards might be a tad small, as a couple of reviews have stated, but you can change the face to have a larger font for numbers/ranks.  It seems the developer has been very responsive to other complaints.  There is a good tutorial, you can switch the free cell stacks from the left to right as desired, and it can be played in airplane mode, all of which are comments in the one-star reviews.<br /><br />You can play in landscape or portrait mode, in any orientation.<br /><br />Your best time is recorded and your time, number of moves, score and total score for all games.<br /><br />There is an additional submenu you can invoke by tapping anywhere on the background (or on the little arrow at the bottom of the screen).  When you do, you'll see Options, Themes, Game Hint and Undo.<br /><br />Under Options, you can turn on: sound, a status bar (on the Fire, this is the side/bottom menu bar), show score and time/moves in the current game, and autoplay.<br /><br />There are themes you can change--you have two options for the faces of the cards, and one of them has larger numbers, and you can change the backdrop to one of four colors or a picture from your photo gallery.<br /><br />If you tap on &#34;Game&#34; in the options menu, you can invoke a new game, replay the current game, see your statistics and achievements.<br /><br />When you have the submenu invoked, a small &#34;i&#34; appears off to the side.  Tap on that if you need the tutorial or rules.<br /><br />Tested on a Fire HDX7 and HDX8.9.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Must think in this game.  Not a typical hidden object game.  Lots of looking and following the clues given.  There have been very few glitches.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If I woke up in the middle of the night I would grab my iPad and start reading thinking I would get sleepy and go back to sleep but I was reading Sycamore Row and should have known I would not be able to put it down. John Grisham has a way of keeping your interest. Just one more page...next thing I knew I was finished with the book.  He's done it again. Great book!!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great story about a SEAL and the fight all Special Operators take every mission. This is mostly an in depth look into this mission and all the things that went wrong with it.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This was a very fun and entertaining game! It kept me intrigued the entire time and the mini games were difficult at times but it was well worth it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story line with some awesome hidden objects!
B00DTDFSES|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this romance Just the right amount of intrigue, twists and turns to make you keep reading. Well written, particularly the intimacy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The plot grabs you from the first page and compells you to keep reading until the last gavel falls.  Can't put it down, then can't wait for the next book.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great way to save data space on your device. It is easy to access picture, video and files when you need or want them..
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application is great in that it consistently updates weather in all regions, including videos, and storm watches. You can also add Weather Alerts in your locations, which alert you to rip tides, high winds, or even hot dry days. (It is also an mPoints Application, which allows you to gain points for all sorts of prizes. It works great on my Kindle Fire.)
B006LSZECO|1.0|I rarely finish a book with disgust, however the ending of this page turner was so unsatisfying I resent the hours spent reading it. My first Gillian Flynn novel and likely my last.
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|started slow and then caught up.  Story seemed a bit weak for Mr. Baldacci.  Plot a little too far out, but rather ingenious.  i did enjoy the read, but it wasnt a page turner.  I dont know what to say, maybe thats why I only gave it a 3.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Man...not only have I seen this movie a handful of times but it brings me to tears EVERY single time, lol. IF you are a football fanatic like I am, you will tear up.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Bought it for my 14 year old daughter. Our 19 year old son likes it. Parents love it. We crank it up on the house speakers so everyone can listen.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game it is just like real hunting. It helps you with the upgrade so that you can complete the missions.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|All you do is run, jump and tilt your tablet as you try to outrun a giant ape. The action gets repetitive after a while. Good for playing in short bursts, but not for longer play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This  is a very fun game  my cousins and I have a fun time playing this game and then when I told my friends about this game than we had competitions to see who could get more bananas and the farthest ... we all love this game &lt;3. :]<br /> From : a person
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This novel is one of the better referenced works I've read which explains DevOps and the concepts behind making it work in a down-to-earth way.  The author also engages the reader in a game to reach the conclusion.  Recommended.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think so far this is the best book I've ever read. Looking forward to the movie and the final book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. The beginning levels are really easy but you still have to put some thought into it. The larger boards get more challenging but are still fun. The game challenges your mind, even at the easier levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. I Love how u unlock different scenes. The costumes that u buy with bananas are so cute. I think this is perfect for any age. It's so funny and  it keeps me occupied for a long time. Even better cause it's totally free!!!!!!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Only free to a point, but a fun diversion. Don't give it Facebook access unless you want to spam your friends.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book, I don't like to read usually, was the BEST book I have ever read. When I was playing a game I was like eh this is BORING I think I'll go and read! I knew this was the book for me :D
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Piscing Molitor Patel, otherwise known as &#34;Pi Patel, had an inspirational story to tell a journalist about his life at sea.  It is one that can change any person's heart and make- or hope make them appreciate the finer things in life.<br /><br />The book and the movie are quite similar.  So if you watched the movie, then there is really no reason to read the book.  In fact, there may have been a couple more colorful additions in the movie.  Of course that is my opinion.  Yet there WERE some minute details that changed between the movie and the book, unless I wasn't paying close attention to the movie when I was watching it.<br /><br />Pi started his life in India, and grew very close to GOD.  There came a point where his dad thought it was necessary to sell the business, and they would be best to move the family to Canada, so they boarded ship, and this is where Pi's adventure began. The ship sunk in the midst of a storm and the only known survivor were him and Richard Parker- a Bengal Tiger.  He had to survive in a lifeboat for- I believe he said 227 days in the book. There are just so many details in the story that are so inspirational, and for him to be alive to tell the story to the journalist who is going to write Pi's story at the end of the movie is a story is touching and moving.<br /><br />There were moments at sea though where one would understand why Pi- a very spiritual, and God fearing, and God loving boy would have had his spirits &#34;dampened.&#34;  He saw  quite a few storms that could have killed both him and Richard Parker, a man eating island that he thought was his sanctuary, but soon found out if he stayed much longer, he would die there, so he had to head back out to sea- that being blind faith.<br /><br />Read the book or watch the movie, or both to see what adventure Pi wants to bring you on.  I guarantee you will be satisfied and touched.  In fact you will be happy with what you have in front of you and the warmth and shelter that is provided for you because you never know when something may be taken away.<br /><br />Happy Reading.  Things may be &#34;Irrational&#34; at times, just like the life of &#34;Pi&#34; and the number &#34;Pi.&#34;  :-)ovided for you because you never know when something may be taken away.<br /><br />Happy Reading.

B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Very interesting views and well worth reading to viewing a problem from a different perspective. Occasionally, some of the views are a stretch but still worth reading.
034580404X|5.0|This was a gift for my girlfriend, but when she was finished I read it too.  Interesting is the word I would give to the contents of the book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|we really like this game. It is fun to shoot things. Thanks for the free download. we love that the shot is really loud. The animals are really lifelike.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|It's fine WHEN it works. However, on my Kindle Fire, maybe 20-30% of the time, it hangs up at the 90% mark when saving documents (Word format), and sometimes corrupts my documents - they become unopenable by Kingsoft or on my desktop computer. I've lost hours of work to this malfunction. Of course, I shouldn't be doing Important Things with a mobile app... but it's worth noting.<br /><br />Apart from that, I have no problems with it; it does what it claims to do and is reliable apart from freezing upon saving and occasionally corrupting my documents. (Apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln...)
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Too short!  Not even a bonus chapter!  No extras at all.  For $4.99?  Wow!  I felt cheated, so played again to see the alternative ending.  Then I felt ripped-off.<br />Other than price/length, the game is WONDERFUL!  Very player-friendly.  The map is multi-function; it tells you when you're done with a location, where to go next, and GIVES YOU A SHORTCUT to get there!  No 'go back 14 times' to get to the next location. Just go to map, tap the exclamation point, tap the arrow, and you're there!  That cuts out sooo much of the tedium for me, and no HO scenes either, so I was really happy.<br />I would recommend \\"Twin Moons\\" to players new to the genre.  Hints are generous, the TONS of mini-games have good instructions, and the great map--you can't really get lost.<br />Played on Kindle Fire 2nd gen. with no problems.  Thanks, G5!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have not used it yet - have not made a long trip in the car where I would need to use it.  I am sure it will be fine!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is my second time reading this series and I love it!  Now onto the Lost Hero in the Heroes of Olympus series!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a visit into someone else's mind.  It is a glimpse of a thought process that isn't your own, and it shows you that not everyone is the same inside and out.  This book is a flash of an ordinary life, through the eyes of an extraordinary person.  This book was a good one.  Not because of the plot, or the writing style, or anything specifically, but because Yowalked away different.  I am not sure if that is good or bad, but it had an impact.  An impact that I will never forget.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great puzzle game; very challenging and fun; one of the best games that i have downloaded and has provided plenty of hours of entertainment
B008S80P38|4.0|Good album, honestly haven't had a good thorough listen to it yet. I think 4x4=12 is better even though it has a more commercial feel to it. Still a solid Deadmau5 record however and worth having in your collection.
B00BSDTG44|4.0|I just got the the Pure Blu-Ray Audio version. There are 3 audio formats available, all 2.0, 24-bit/96Khz. I compared a few tracks with the Bob Marley Gold double disc that I also own. The Blu-Ray tracks do sound more detailed and fuller. Not day and night, but an improvement. Interestingly, the mastering credits on both versions are the same, dating from 2001.<br /><br />I'd say they did a nice job remastering this music on the previous CD issues. If your sound system is good quality, you might want to give this disc a try to get a bit more resolution.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Didn't hold my attention.  Was a bad mix of Men in Black and Beetleguice.  Still van't tell you what it was about.  Just that it had Kevin Bacon.in it.

B00BI5IXL4|1.0|Right out of the gate I have to say I hated this movie.  I am a die hard fan of Les Mis but this just fell flat.  It's true turning a  Broadway musical into a movie allows for some interpretation but this interpretation just fell flat.  First off they took one of the greatest musical compositions ever but didn't worry about matching voices to the rich vocal parts.  Val Jean has so many beautiful songs that Huge Grant just couldn't hit.  It seemed the film makers were more intent on &#34;acting&#34; then actual concern over the ability to preform this beautiful score.  Star power does not mean quality performance.<br /><br />While each of the actors have proven their abilities in their own right it was not for their expansive musical talent.  I don't want this to sound like a criticism on any of the actors.  As actors I have liked them all in their various works.  However, it baffles me how everyone raved about how talented they are based on this performance.... as a musical ensemble it was lacking.  Anne Hathaway sounded like she was panting through her songs rather than singing.  She was just awful. Hugh Jackman, even though I have seen other musicals he has been in and other vocal performances, just didn't have the ability to support the Val Jean richness and breadth.  And Russel Crow (I have to admit I don't know much about his musical ability) was, sub par, at best.<br /><br />The Inn keeper and his wife were boring as opposed to roustabouts and comical, I didn't feel any relationship between Marius and Éponine,  And Enjolras did not inspire me in the slightest.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel I need to go watch the 50th anniversary (even with the little Jonas Brother) to get inspired about this great work again. Overall I was highly disappointed.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It's super cool when you finish the level it's all neon. I got it for free because it was the free app of the day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best game ever! I just love it! I highly recommend it!<br /><br />You must get it  because the horses are so cute!
B00EJU8ZIG|3.0|I loved her song Royals.  But almost every song on this cd sounds exactly alike.  She has a distinctive style, but needs to work on expanding it.  I wouldn't buy the entire cd again, just the song.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Top notch. Not a year goes by that I don't watch this. Funny from start to finish, a feel good movie that plays in heavy rotation in my player around the holidays. Seriously, why even read my review? You should be watching this movie if you are on the fence, if you have never seen it, just do it.
1594484805|5.0|This is fascinating discovery of human motivation and how it has affected our approach to business.<br />The scientific support of the ideas explored in this book is eye opening and confirming.<br />As I work in a consulting capacity with many businesses and had discovered some of these approaches to be true, it was wonderful to have scientific proof to support many of the strategies I have suggested to my clients regarding the creation of an internal culture for success.<br />I recommend this book to any entrepreneur no matter what the size of your business.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was surprised at how addictive it is. I figured it was just a candy version of bejewled but the different types of levels keep it fresh. However, I was disappointed that once you use power-ups, there appears to be no way to get more without spending real money.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I'm not at all the type who will shy away from a show if it's too slow and boring, and yet, somehow I kept buying the next episode. There's something about a show that's a bit slow, but you can't stop watching it.  Maybe there's a method to the madness - or the slowness.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game/ very addicting. Fun game to take your mind off things. challenging and fun/ got my husband started on candy crush.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I am still up in the air about this game.  I will revise my review when I am at a higher level.,
B005LAIII0|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  Loved every moment of it.  Leaves one with lots to think about.  Had me crying along with the characters.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Horrible set up support.  Ended up returning it.  Clearly states on chromecast website that my router is compatible with the device but when I call system support at Google they tell me there is a known problem and I need contact the maker of my router.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great on going game but you will either need patience or a thousand dollars... game maker is a little stingy with crystals and while you have 3000000 &quot;gold &quot; there isn't any way to get more then one crystal per level unless you buy them with real money.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|Very disappointed that you can only play a few levels before you need to buy the game. Why call it a free game?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this horse she is so nice so kind. so pretty the horse is fun to play with. She is so awome.

B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I would give it 4 and half stars. This album was a joke gift. To me and yes they bought it on Amazon. I was so surprised by the entire album. There's 2 songs I just skip and one is the Britney cameo I understand the cameo,but should have been more Miley and Brittney interlude.<br />With a few a people Adore You-My Darlin- Someone Else they have all thought it was other singers that they say can sing.<br />But, with all the albums studio trickery it's the music. Not her voice. Only on a few songs near the bridge or when the verse or coda taper out.But, it fits with the music and how the songs structure fits. From Simplistic bangers to all out ballads glad my friends thought it was joke gift without listening to it. Now my mom also is obsessed with Bangerz when she disliked all Miley put out before this.  Oh, and she's 67.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Makes me wanna dance. Really love it. Great sound. Great energy. Fun tune. Looking forward to the next. Love the video as well.

B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Good movie with an interesting plot twist, was much better than I thought it was going to be. Great movie to watch on a plane flight.
B00GYC8YE2|1.0|Written on about the 6th grade level. Episodes are intellectually unchallenging and boringly predictive. Characters are shallow. Strategies are unbelievable and simplistic. Plots have no depth, e.g., good guys kill/capture bad guys.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's a cute child series that 4th to 6th graders can follow and have fun with on a boring Sunday afternoon, if there is a blizzard outside or a tornado. Otherwise they would probably be so bored they would go outside and watch the clouds, which would be more exciting.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Very funny at times and overall good. The plot isn't too hard to guess but it's told well and it was a great watch on the plane ride home.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|John Ford is the ultimate director of American Westerns and in this 1962 depiction of life in the Wild West we have a wonderful display of iconic actors who were indeed actors whose very names exude what the American West is all about.  In this story we have John Wayne (Tom Doniphon) who in the beginning of this wonderful film is already dead and James Stewart (Ransom Stoddard) who arrives for the funeral as a US Senator.<br /><br /> The town is Shinbone and from the signs of Stoddard's arrival it had to be in the early 1900's as one scene has a public telephone being used.  Stoddard's wife played by Vera Miles accompanies the Senator back to Shinbone for the funeral.  It's at this time that Stoddard is persuaded to tell the tale of how he became the man who shot the evil bad cowboy Liberty Valence played by the iconic actor Lee Marvin.  In the telling of the story we see that Stoddard was a young Eastern gentleman who happened to be a lawyer who was not familiar with the ways of the unlawful West.  In the story, Stoddard friends Doniphon who happens to be smitten by Stoddard's future wife as the story proceeds to the inevitable showdown between the good guy and the bad guy.<br /><br /> As in all John Ford stories we have the classic showdown between good and evil and the ironic twists of fate which always will surprise the movie audience.  What makes this movie a classic lies within the consummate acting abilities of John Wayne and James Stewart along with the supporting roles played by Andy Devine, Edmund O'Brien and John Carradine.<br /><br /> Movies of this caliber come along rarely and since by 1962 most movies were in Technicolor, I find it a bit unusual that this classic was done in black and white much as the other Western classic High Noon. However at this time in the history of filmography films were done both in color and black and white and in retrospect these Western classics of the 50s and 60s seemed very right to be filmed in the unadorned black and white.<br /><br /> This Western film ranks in the top five all-time movies of its genre.hite.<br /><br /> This Western film ranks in the top five all-time movies of its genre.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is FreeCell, played the same way it's alwsys played. (Love it or hate it.)  The app is implemented very well.  Like the Brainium solitaire app, the game is visually pleasing with two options for card faces and a few different backgrounds.  Tapping on a card automatically places it, but not necessarily where you want it to go, so dragging is sometimes necessary.  Also, like other Brainium games, it has no bad permissions.  The game looks and plays great on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, though I don't know how it would be on a smaller screen.  If you've got a tablet and you just want to play FreeCell, this is probably the best one to get.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it make kid happy when they win or beat their high score it is so great for kids to be happy when they play the game

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I not only learned about this amazing child/adult but the historical background was fascinating except I would sometimes get lost with the names.  The questions I was left with were: Why was she allowed to continue her crusade for so long, when it seemed others were being punished or killed for lesser offenses. Also and maybe I missed it but why did they eventually stay in England?<br />The pictures were a real nice addition.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Enjoy using this app on my kindle. A kindle is perfect for me to use while I'm relaxing after work.
B00G4Q3NDA|5.0|12 Years a Slave is by far the best movie I’ve seen in a number of years. The movie is based on the autobiography of Solomon Northrup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery during the early 1800’s. While the subject of slavery is a difficult one for Americans, this movie shines a spotlight on the effects of slavery on both the perpetrators and the victims. While much has been said about the physical violence depicted in the film (which by the way is definitely toned done from what happened in real life), I found the emotional and psychological impact having the greater effect on me personally.  Perhaps because I had read so much about the graphic depiction of the film’s violence, I was better prepared to watch it unfold on screen.  However, what I wasn’t really prepared for was the emotional impact of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor eloquently conveys the main character’s emotional and psychological journey from free man to slave. His expressions and eyes make you feel the character’s despair and emotional struggle with what is happening to him.<br /><br />It’s sad to see similarities between Solomon Northrup’s era and our own.  The notion that an individual must always be in possession of “his free papers” demonstrating that he is a free person of color is eerily similar to current “show me your paper laws” meant to prove citizenship.  It reminds me of the quote “those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.” The messages and paradoxes presented in the film leave you thinking; for example, the use of religion by the slave masters to justify enslaving human beings and the slaves reliance upon religion to help them cope and get through their enslavement. The move is so thought provoking.  It makes you wonder about the hypocrisy of those who try to revise history and pretend the Civil War wasn’t fought to end slavery.  It also makes you understand why African Americans are insulted when told to “get over it” and “slavery endeda long time ago.” While slavery officially ended in 1865 with the passage of the 13th Amendment; slavery by another name (Jim Crow, segregation) endured until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.<br /><br />The acting, directing, cinematography and story-telling are excellent.  As others have stated, it is definitely a must see movie.  All of the actors give award winning performances and the film is just beautifully shot and visually pleasing. Don’t be afraid of watching such a well told film on American history. I encourage everyone to see this move.<br /><br />P.S. Another excellent film to watch is “Slavery By Another Name” ([...]
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Have been a daily player for a year. Game updated to London and all progress is gone. Missions up to 30 were done, characters purchased, gone,all coins gone. Back at the start of the game. Where is all my progress?
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is the best game ever I have always been a fan<br />of teenage mutant ninga turtles if you writ a bad review that is your opinioun
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is so nice to find a game with a challenge that is so much fun. This is my favorite game.  The second time around I couldn't remember how I got so far.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|this is one of the best first season on the tv history. The first episode is so awesome, scary and violent. I just love it. The extras on these blu ray are very good. I'm happy with these season on blu ray.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love how you can create on one device and use on several.  I use this app for my grocery list all the time.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|The Little Mermaid on HD and 3D. You will falling in love when you just play the movie on your Blu-ray. This is my favorite movie when i was a kid and I cried when finally have it with me.<br />10/10
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Johnson actually wrote the story with two lead characters with the stories running parallel and in the same space.  It made for a confusing read sometimes.  When a sentence began with &#34;I&#34; it was had to tell which character was speaking.  I read the author's notes after the book and recommend that you do the same.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I hope more of her third album. But it is ok. Are very amazing songs on these album like Venus, Do What U Want, G.U.Y., Sexxx Dreams, Gypsy, Dope, ARTPOP and Applause. The other ones are so weird. 7.5/10.<br /><br />P.S. I love the cover album and the art on the booklet. I love Koons
B00C061I1M|5.0|By far the best new album I've heard in a long time.  I just found my new favorite artist.  June is heavenly in all ways.
B00004X01U|4.0|One of her best albums. Short, but amazing. Don´t Tell Me is the best song on Music. But the rest are brilliant too. I love this album. 9/10
0761174192|5.0|I buy this calendar every year.  The photography is phenomenal and it is a joy to look at each new day's page.  Definitely a good purchase for the price!
B00ADQPA38|5.0|AHS: Asylum is the best season of these anthology. It's dark, it is claustrophobic, is violent, is depressive. Lily Rabe takes the season to herself with her character &#34;Sister Mary Eunice&#34; so acclaimed by the critique too. The photography on &#34;Dark Cousin&#34; is so amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just got my kindle and this was the first app I downloaded.  It's a lot of fun.  My son likes it as well.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|If I didn't have this game what would I do on Sundays when football's on. I love this game I just wish you could figure out a way to get more things without having to purchase stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they have this for the Kindle. Can never get enough of this game. Love the challenges each level offers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is AWESOME! Who would have ever thought that such a simple game could be such fun! I'm already on level 13 and the only time I get off of the game is when I loose all of my lives.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My wife and I love it. My wife and I just watched catching fire and can't wait till this movie comes out
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|I wouldn't give this a five star, because five star means absolutely flawless. This album is definitely really good, though. I preordered this on iTunes the day it came out, and I saw her on her stars dance tour. I didn't think this album would be as good as it was. I also didn't think she would be very good live. I didn't expect much, but I was really impressed. This album shows she's really grown up, here's my rating on the songs:<br />Birthday: a really fun and cute song. i'd rate it a 4/5, I wanna dance everytime I hear it.<br />slow down: I liked this song before it became a single and still listen to it when I go running a lot! a really up beat song, one of her best. I think it's better than come & get it. 5/5<br />stars dance: I've listened to this song more than any of the songs on the album. it's a slow song kind of. it's about growing up and about being productive, and making your dreams real life... like also letting go of the past, and doing what you never thought you could do in the past. (at least that's what I think) 4/5 or 5/5<br />like a champion: this is a Mediterranean sounding song. its interesting. I don't listen to it much, but it's pretty good. 3/5 or 3.5/5<br />come & get it: sorry, but I never really thought this was a very great song. its fun to party to, but not my favorite by selena. 2/5<br />forget forever: I never listen to this song 2/5<br />save the day: good song. I like the beat, lyrics, and the sound. (: 4/5<br />beat: ehhh. cute song, but I don't listen to it much. 3/5 or 4/5<br />write your name: I'm beginning to like this one more :) 3/5<br />undercover: probably my favorite off of the album since day one. (: needs a music video. hope it becomes a single! I give this a 5/5<br />love will remember: beautiful song about moving on from your first love... yeah yeah yeah. BEAUTIFUL. (: 5/5!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|As a lover of the first two books in the Divergent series, I was very disappointed in the final installment. Part of what I enjoyed so much about the first two was the world it created, which was very absent from this book. Additionally, the narration switching back and forth between two characters I found very confusing and often had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to see who's point of view I was reading. I didn't find the ending to be satisfactory and raised more questions than provided answers.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Moves right along.  Thought-provoking.  Entertaining.  Grisham continues to cast the legal profession in an interesting light, one that is not always flattering.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Loved the action and special effects. Daniel Craig and the full cast were great. Craig makes a great 007 for sure.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Veronica Roth best book yet with and amazing my tragic plot twist at the end. No doubt this book will keep you guessing what's next the entire time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Good read could not put it down. Renewed my out look on life and faith. Going to church again with kids and grand kids.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Awesome game love the graphics and game play, Alot of stuff to kill and alot of weapons to buy and upgrade.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|Best damn movie known to mankind! Excellent performance by the whole cast! Blu eay makes it so much better then it is!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and better than temple run it funny and very cool has many characters has many levels and bosses and its free so download it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is really fun and I enjoy playing it do much. The makers did a great job. Good game.
B00005BKZJ|3.0|This movie was not as entertaining on a recent viewing as it was when I first saw it, Now, it seems more overacted and slapstick that I thought it was. CC Pounder is way over the top as the proprietor of a rundown truck stop in nowhere California. Marianne S&auml;gebrecht is more successful as the German tourist with a need to clean. Jack Palance is also entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome my  sister and I love playing it on our kindle fire when we are board l
006224454X|2.0|Warning, if you're a guy, do not read this book. You'll get mired down in chick drama, chick issues, and chick relationship problems.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|This book was suspenseful and touch every corner of my heart. I just loved it. It made you love Katie and Jo along with the kids and Alex. Even if you watch the movie is still a nail bitter that will keep you begging for more.
0770437400|5.0|Good macro overview of what could happen to today's society in the event of a zombie attack.  The writer makes interesting points using today's geopolitical landscape.  Some parts read like the Economist, others are personal reflections of survival (sometimes on pure luck).  As a result its not a smooth consistent flow.  But if the underlying theme of a Zombie Apocalypse intrigues you, this should fill that need for a few hours.<br />I wish they did not make a 2 hour movie from this book.  It reads as a collection of different points of view before, during and after the war.  It would have been better as a series of episodes by someone like the history channel.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|You should update every thining even kindels please and I'm only giving you a great review is because I have hope  for a humvy
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A new game for me that is interesting and fun, not to mention addictive.  Time evaporates as you play!  A nice change from the &quot;match three&quot; games that abound.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|its great game to play even for grown ups and for kids to needs more guns and missions too its a good game to play .......................................... ..... .........<br />......  ...  . . . .. ..  .  ....  .... . ...
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|This book needs major editing.  Believe it or not, she doesn't actually get to examine the body until page 100 - so we have 99 pages leading up to it...  the book is repetitive and again, everyone is anxious and unhappy and miserable.  And yet again, we are supposed to believe that every major case Kay gets involved in mysteriously has some personal connection to herself or her family?  REALLY?  I'm so tired of reading about how unhappy and tense everyone.  Suggest the next book is a) 300 or less pages  b) About a real mystery story that is intriguing and has nothing to do with Kay's own family or a conspiracy and c) has some of the relationships in this long-standing series work themselves out in a positive way intead of constantly agonizing.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Another good book to add to the Percy Jackson series. I liked the plat theme and adventure in this book.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is a 2-D RPG minecraft like game and is very fun.<br /><br />I love this game I play this game with my little enderman doll and play until my kindle fire burn out and then I plug it in and keep on playing even after I done making this little review about it.<br /><br />this game is 4 kids. 1.99$ is a good price for it<br /><br />505 did a good job on this game!
0847842134|3.0|The contents are magical, intriguing, enchanting. No problem with the material at all. 5 stars.<br />The presentation and production, however, are flawed almost beyond use. 1 star.<br />The selection of a toned, laid paper for the interior is destructive to the images -- breaking them up, rather than reflecting them whole to the eye. I understand that the original was on this type of paper: it was a trendy choice in the 70s -- and quite the wrong choice for delicate images. Today it is more than wrong. And despite the texture and weight of the paper, there was still considerable &#34;show-through&#34; of images on the back of the sheet AND the next page.<br />The hardcover employs 2 kinds of foil, embossing, and 4-color on a linen finish, and it still manages to look cheap. The grey of the boards showed thru the wonderful yellow of the end papers. The corners of the cover boards came crushed, cause it was shipped in a padded envelope.<br />No dust jacket. No. Dust. Jacket. Even a simple paper sleeve, please. Something to protect it.<br />AND the much-mentioned sticky-mcsticky sticker on the back.<br />You *can* use Benzine to remove it, but i am leaving mine on as the only visual confirmation in the package that, yes, this is indeed a $125 book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it, what happened to the Capitol now, more explanation on her trial would be useful and would be beneficial
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Makes my down time a fun time. Thank you, Amazon, for making this available to us on Kindle! I hope to try out more games.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Yet another Great book as always with John Grisham with some excellent twists and turns. Hard to put it down.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This works great with my HP Photosmart printer and Kindle Fire HD.  Had been looking for something for quite awhile and am totally happy with it.  Even bought (free) for my husband's ipad.  Works easy there, too.  We are not big tech people, and this app is easy to set up snd use.
B00F8LPH90|4.0|great graphics.  lots of fun.  I waste too much time on it.  Looks a lot like being in the gunner's seat with an IR camera.
055358202X|1.0|The first three books took me about three weeks to read. This one took me more than a month....What a disappointment. I got same feeling as when I watched &#34;Lost&#34; - is this going anywhere? Should I read the next one....don't know honestly.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|locked up, and got a bit repetitive.  same games over and over, they just go faster and faster.  amusing at first, but got old quick.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|awesome game free now it is awesome i recomend it random stuff no more to descibe it lol nothing friend ninja kiwi words to be
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie was better then I thought it would be.  I have never felt good about the idea of people being in an arena that kills another to acquire an end.  This is not a healthy thing I believe.  The actors and actresses were very good, and I appreciate that.  I got this movie because a person I respect believed it was a good movie.  It was, but sad non the less.  It leaves little to hope or love.  They won, but to win others must be lost.  That really makes it a no win in the eyes of a person that believes in good.  A population that perpetuates such a scheme is lost.  It makes me so sad!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can I say?  This series is wonderful!  I have watched the series on DVD over and over again and never tire of it.  The show is so well done with marvelous actors, beautiful location, thought provoking story lines, and wonderful vintage costumes.  Of course, to get started watching Downton Abbey, you need to start at the beginning with Season 1 to learn all of the characters and their connections with each other.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I really like the game, if u like hunting &amp; searching for items in different bldgs &amp; places. I won't spend money so I'm kinds slowly advancing once i hit level 12 but I really enjoy the game.
1936891026|5.0|Quick easy to read tips.  Small chapters that are broken down to a page or two.  Perfect for helping you figure out what is holding you back in business and or life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game!!  kids love it even my husband dose also and he is not a game person. its different every time and its not to easy.

B00153ZC8Q|5.0|Classic Sci-Fi that started the whole cyborg genre. Once you wrap your head around the premise, the sequels are fun and exciting!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It was refreshing to see a book about a vampire that wasn't a sad excuse for a love story. Vampires are not supposed to sparkle.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Carefully researched, skillfully written biography of the complex, contradictory and brilliant Steve Jobs. This enjoyable book provides a detailed history of the important home-computer creators.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was ok but I actually hated it worst money ever spent reports reporting untruthful hiccup trust Bobbi indigo hobo though
B00F031X62|5.0|very good versions of the songs..the band is on a high,they seem happy to play together...this is a buy i will never regret.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|This is a fun game... the only problem I have with it is it never will connect to Facebook... I am looking for neighbors... farm I'D is FAUIVYJ.... I play daily and am looking for active players.
B00GX598FO|5.0|I don't buy too many movies, but this one and the first movie, I probably will.  This was a very entertaining movie.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|Martin does not disappoint in this third installment of his series. The characters live their believable and complex lives, the action moves forward, and new characters have been introduced for the most part seamlessly. The Red Wedding merits its attention as both a gorefest and a major turning point. Did not, for example, see Roose Bolton's treachery tied to this, though the author deftly plants the evidence along the way.<br /><br />However, there is a major danger sign. Point of view is becoming a weakness rather than a strength. The strength of multiple points of view is that the author can explore the same plot line through the perspective of multiple characters, adding or omitting information as needed to create tension. The weakness is that each new point of view character may launch his or her own subplot. It is in this second direction that I see the series progressing. The number of point-of-view characters seems to be expanding as the series goes along (I'm purposely restraining myself from looking ahead so that I won't see if I am correct or wrong in my guesses), and with some of these new characters, we are seeing new subplots and the creation of a whole new list of character names to memorize--a choice that invariably leads to uneven story development. Some of the storylines, such as Sansa's and Arya's, tend to go nowhere as a result. Some storylines, such as the fate of Theon Greyjoy and Rickon Stark, are completely ignored. Strange gaps in others, such as the omission of Samwell and Gilly's meeting with Coldhands, or Daenerys's capture of Meereen, develop as the narrative tries to bring itself back up to speed. These expansions and inconsistencies in the storytelling, if not curbed now, may lead to problems in the future books.<br /><br />It's also disappointing that the characters seem to have have missed an obvious clue to one of the mysteries threaded through the story: the ongoing subplot of the attempted murder of Bran Stark in book 1. Why is itthat no one has thought to tie Littlefinger to the attempt when it was his knife that the assassin used? No one believes any longer in Littlefinger's initial defense that the knife had passed to Tyrion Lannister, yet instead of suspecting the owner of the knife, Jaime, for example, actually entertains the idea that Joffrey, his nephew, may have been behind the attempt.<br /><br />I am looking forward to book 4 to see how the storylines continue.
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|Great condition, great movie based on Alex Haley's biography written from research and interviews with Malcolm X. Spike's best work.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I wanted to see this movie during its theatre running, but for some reason I didn't. Once it was available for rent I saw it. The special effects are very good. In fact I would love for some of those illusions to be true. The plot twist turned out to be entertaining, although the &#34;final act&#34; was very disappointing. Oh, and Isla Fisher looked super hot in this movie.
1451666179|5.0|I love this book.  I was a fan of Allie's website before I bought it.  It is a great read, and like that each story section has a different color set of pages.  A very fun read.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Action, thriller, with very good special effects. Can't wait for the second part, or at least I hope that a second part comes out. WWZ has the potential to be a very good series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great page turner and thought provoking work ! i couldn't put it down right from the minute that i started reading and honestly, the only book in a long time that made me think about it, the decision of the characters even after i finished it up.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent game really gets the mind thinking, doing the stages without making purchases even though it's getting harder sure it can be done.  Definitely recommend the game.
B00GIZO674|4.0|Have this game on computer and gave me hours of fun was glad to see it on the kindle fire. I hope that more games  Will be put out for kindle. This game is worth the money.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is a very fun and addictive game I love to play this game on long c a r rides I recommend this game to all ages and to everyone! Thank you GameCircus LLC for this amazing game
B008602KQI|4.0|Brilliant but very bizarre story. At first, I was skeptical about this film because I don't care for dark themes. Surprisingly, I was taken in by the storyline.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I got the game for free and I love it so far! It gets harder as you go, but so far is manageable.
B002LF2T4C|5.0|great movie, funny situations both actors should have won an award for their roles they played them so well, we cant stop here this is bat country lol
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Fantastic product, excellent customer service. Highly recommended!! This works great with my Nexus 5, and I can keep it in my pocket just like an extra phone whenever I'm out for a while. Also charges friends phones along with mine if they need a little extra juice. Get it!
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This is an excellent live DVD of Taylor Swift singing some of her hits. People use crossover or country. There is not much of a country sound to this girl. I would say she is a &#34;POP&#34; artist now.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive game! This game defjnately challenges you, along with banking on a little luck! Overall, a very fun experience and I recommend it to everyone.....as long as you have a bit of free time :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Intense, riveting, great entertainment!  Great special effects and acting laced with touching scenes that balance out the heart pounding script.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is difficult enough but still challenging. This game will get you hooked on trying destroy those pesky, little piggies.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a beautiful, simple story. A pure joy to read. It brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.  How did anyone allow this time to happen.  It's still happening today. What shame.  Read this book.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I loved this book. I read this a few months ago. I am only following the basic suggestions be and even this is making a positive difference in my tthinking, how I feel about myself and in how I behave. I recommend this for anyone.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|As always, Gregory brings these people and their lives to life. Vivid descriptions, exciting romance, and of course, a tragic end to the mysterious Anne Neville.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It had to many words .It almost made me pass out .It was also extremely boring. Who needs dictionaries.Well except if you need to spell a word . So no more dictionaries.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best books you will ever read!!! This is my third time reading them and I still get lost in them!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing this a few weeks ago and it is like the best thing that ever happened for me. As soon as I pick my kindle up, Candy Crush Saga is the first app I go to and I keep playing until I have no more lives left.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The ending left you hanging<br />Don't know how it stayed on the best seller list for do long.<br />Would not recommend to friends
B0090P98Z4|4.0|The game devours MINUTES!  That is a VERY good trait in a game.  I just cant stop playing.  Eternity Warriors 2 just might need a 12 step program.
1582406723|5.0|Amazing art work, great storyline.  One of the best graphic novels you will ever read!! Love this series, many more books to go!
B003XT603Q|2.0|Very slow moving and depressing. I never felt in touch with the characters; they all seemed so distant. I am trying to figure out how to delete it fro my itouch after forcing myself to finish.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really enjoy this to pass the time. I also like that I can purchase things using Amazon coins in the kindle version of the game. I like it a lot.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham writes in his usual style: slow moving at first, with impoverished lawyer in Southern town who gets caught up in a series of events. Then the reader becomes glued as the events unfold with some good surprises at the end. Reasonable character development, although the alcoholic sidekick is too much of the usual.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Well my sister and I love it and I think that this is the best game ever I mean seriously who has ever made a game as good as this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game a must play fun to the hole family it is a deleterious game about a grefette artist with a surf board
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was such a captivating and beautiful story. Heartbreaking and happy. The true definition of bittersweet. I was in love from the beginning and I did not want it to end.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The same youtube videos sometimes give the sharing icon sometimes they don't (running them from chrome youtube app).<br />Troubleshooting ?<br />No, the device is going back...
0811879542|5.0|This is a great book! I would recommend for 4-5 year olds. Maybe 3, but I started reading to my 4 year old son. He laughs everytime.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it in the theaters and then again on DVD.  I thought it was a really good zombie movie.  I haven't read the book so I am not comparing it to anything but other zombie movies I saw. I I hope they make a part II.
0062086529|5.0|Wonderful story.  My 2 year old and 4 year old both love it. I would recommend for toddlers and preschoolers.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Really enjoyed the book..kept reader interest, believable, everyday happenings with several twists mixed in, looking forward to next book too
0316228583|1.0|Stick to what you're good at. This was a waste of my time and yours, there is a reason it is already half off.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|i loveeeeee ittt sooo much its better than i thought it would be and i want everone to buy it now
0060594896|4.0|Very practical and it's a good reminder of the principles even if you know them already. I say read it when you want a boost or you are feeling the creativity slump.
B00003CXA6|5.0|First of all, WHAT KIND OF  BRAIN DEAD IDIOTS would rate this under 4 stars?!!!  This is truly the ONLY movie worth watching about the Civil War!!  This was done on the actual battlefield & is based of of Michael Shaara's hit &#34;The Killer Angels.&#34; worth the reading.  MOST of the dialogue  is word-for-word, right out of the book.  This is EXPERTLY done and true to the historic battle.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Probably the best Bloons TD game up-to-date! I played TD5 on the computer and once I saw this yesterday.. for FREE... I just had to have it! The android version of TD5 is different than the computer one. There are more towers and different courses you can play on. This game is extremely addicting --- moreso than candy crush!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone who had an android because it is free right now! You can just save 3 bucks right now! Go and get this before the offer is close!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|At . First I would always wonder and say I wish I could check my Facebook and one day I found this and it was amazing but the only thing bad about it is that if you have no internet you can't do anything about it so I'm going to make a promotion and I need 300 or more yes and I will make a Facebook with out internet thanks for reading!!!!! #1
B004SOR4H6|4.0|its nice and all but the 'interactions' doesn't show all of the activity, also the profiles on my time line doesn't update. Some tweets skip ahead or move around when i don't want them too ((i fix this by scrolling down)) whenever i sign back in it takes 2 hours so i re download the app and that works for a while.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Okay so what if the free version is exactly like the $1 one.  He just wants to get some money.  Also does the free version have shop or the coming soon?  I'd like to know that people that gave it one star because of the &quot; Oh it's the same bla bla bla!&quot;  CAN'T YOU JUST RESPECT THE GAME!!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really enjoy this hidden object fake because it changes the scenes up with different ways to find things.... silhouettes, darkness, jumbled etc
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I mean WHO WOULD OF TOUGHT!!!  A dude flying in a jetpack trying to get coins.  Better yet you can spend those coins.  Not going to tell you about the hole game, cause that spoil the point.  Have fun playing
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I was about to drop this book and move to the next several times during the first half of the book. First half is long and tedious.<br /><br />HOWEVER, once you're done with the first few chapter, the book is just amazing. It is inspiring for all kind of runners. It is a must if you're serious about running.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|A great parody of Star Trek and the Star Trek Conventions. Tony Shalob is great as Staff Sargent  Chen. Funny without having to resort to potty humor.
B00F2362IE|3.0|Only issue I have is how do you exit the game. I have to just go to my home screen and force close
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. These men endured the most harrowing of conditions and persevered. It's hard to imagine anybody could go through what they did and live to tell about it. If you like true stories, put this one at the top of you reading list.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent, gritty acting by Denzel! He never seizes to amaze me with his acting skills and how he immerses himself into his characters! Although I'm a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis,  Denzel deserved the Oscar this past year. Although the movie is considering glum and depressing by some, it was handled in a realistic manner. Well done.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game a lot of fun. Very addictive I play it everyday several times.  Day. You can play for hours
B0015AARJI|2.0|I bought a controller about a year ago... the controller definitely does not feel like the one i originally had... nor does it feel like the brand new one which i bought at best buy...<br /><br />it works fine, i till use it... but the plastic does not feel the same.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|What more can one say: If you're a Trek fan, you'll love this. The digitally enhanced picture is much better than a standard DVD. I don't have a Blu-ray player, so I can't compare to that, but I can't imagine the improved picture quality, if that is the case, would be worth the additional cost of Blu-ray discs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has several levels, some more challenging than others but you will get lost in it. Hours of fun for me and my family.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|It will not download! I have a kindle fire and more than enough space, but it still won't download! It has restarted 3 times. So much for kindle fire edition.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|A very nice follow up witin the new &#34;timeline&#34; a retelling of the Khan story (spoiler).  I really enjoy the new cast, get some more of these in the can before people start heading their seperate ways.
B00GRVEDCM|3.0|It was ok. The battle system itself was great, new, and interesting but it was the tedious wait for energy and system of getting new cards which made this game annoying. First each energy takes a half hour to charge and you can only have 5. Secondly, getting cards from packs is annoying because you constantly get the same card over and over. All in all, this app was ok, fun when playing but tedious to obtain new heroes and to replenish energy.
159514188X|4.0|The idea with this story is strange with the different tapes. It is fun to find the tapes being read on YouTube and makes a fun way to read this book.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This was great movie with an interesting plot. Also had great acting.  I would definitely recommend it and watch again.
B004WB0RWE|1.0|This seemed like a fun way to treat my mother with one of her favorite movies. I thought that she would be able to have a sort of special edition of the movies as it had everything on it in Italian and the package came with different stamps from the Italian mail and customs. However, once we tried to watch it, we discovered that due to different laws and formatting of discs, there is not a way to play the DVD in an American DVD player. A computer can play it if you change the regional settings, however you are only able to change it like 3 times for the life of the computer so that is not an option. This seemed like a fun idea, but after waiting for it to arrive for like 3 months, it would not play and had to be returned, and I ended up ordering a normal American version.
B000056VJ7|5.0|I loved it,!!! Very excellent cd...will defiantly buy the rest of his music they have to be as good as bat out of hell.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|From the trailer I had no idea just how good this movie would be. In fact I didn't expect much from it, but in fact it definitely belongs as one of the top family films I've ever seen. I would say it's the best family film I've ever seen, but I can't think of another movie right now so I can't be sure.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|This card holder holds the microSD and SD cards securely.  It is a good way to organize your cards, and maybe even an adapter or two, while maintaining portability.<br /><br />Jim
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just love it. I can track weather of my family, who are spread across the country as well as my local weather. It graphs weather, has extended forecasts and gives me weather alerts. What more could you want and free too.
1441761268|5.0|This was one of my all time favorite books, it really brought me to a part of history I hardly even knew. It was illuminating.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves my little pony. I let her get this app and now i cant get her off of it
B00GM9Q9U8|4.0|Okay...I gave 4 stars only because it's not the best of the Wong Kar-Wai movies.  There's much dialogue/monologue attempting to propagandize some sort of philosophy of martial arts--but way too much and unnecessary.<br /><br />For those who're fond of Kungfu/martial arts movies or simply interested in the life of Ip Man, you might feel disappointed as this is not a typical Kungfu movie.  The story is very much fictional and not at all a documentary of his life.  Cultural gaps might impede understanding also: all those historical events (e.g., republic, warlords, anti-Japanese war, civil war) caused tremendous changes to Chinese history and culture.  Individuals were so powerless and resigned to the arrangement of fate.  When those characters had to flee from the mainland and &#34;disguised&#34; as a barber or a doctor in a new place, I feel it's a sad salute to their glorious past.<br /><br />The key word of martial arts has always been &#34;arts&#34; in literature and movies, so the movie incorporates lots of cultural and aesthetic elements which may not seem martial/action at all to some audience.  I like what Gong Er said in the end that what she saw in her father was rather &#34;a code of honor.&#34;  She was the one who refused to move on with time, obsessed with the elegance and decency of the past time.  I bet you find people like this in every place and every generation, like Miss Havisham's clock...<br /><br />Wong Kar-Wai's romances are always about missing out the person/time/opportunity, and that's still my favorite part (e.g., coat button).  A good movie speaks of your unspoken pains.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed that the movie is titled &#34;The Grandmaster&#34; in the US instead of &#34;The GrandmasterS&#34; (the original English title I believe).  Like I said, it's a salute to a generation of people, to their spirits, passions, code of honor, and of course, the lost love.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This game is awesome any one I know would love this app my dad sure does!!!!!!!!#love this app! # best game ever!!!
0812416694|4.0|I can't add anything to what the critics and other readers have already said.  It's  a classic, and I had an impulse to re-read it after 40 years.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|This game sucks when it's all done downloading and then when you want to play it  it takes a very long time for the game to begin so  say thank you to me for helping you not waist your time on this stupid game.<br />Love Karisa
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good for the price. Only thing as of now - casting chrome is not avalible via iPhone iPad . Also - wish it can support more apps
6304711891|1.0|This review is on the DVD product and not the movie:<br />The DVD died after a few years of light use. I keep all my DVDs dust free in the original jewel cases in a cabinet with doors. There is no obvious scratches on the disc. Washing with toothpaste and water didn't save it.<br /><br />I love this great classic movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Heard about this book on NPR. I am so glad I read it. Now to read it with my kids. The lessons are countless!
0679720200|4.0|I didn't buy it for me. My daughter needed it for school.  It was a great price, so I liked that.
B007RTAR64|4.0|I love the figure itself.  I think it looks a lot like Katniss/Jennifer Lawrence.  The only issue I had was with the packaging.  I collect designer toys so keeping them in the box, undamaged is very important to me.  The box not only had an entire corner crushed, there was also some weird sticky residue on the top right corner.  It makes the whole thing look very unsightly and definitely not in display condition.  I attached photos of the damage to my packaging review (as I believe it happened in transit) and also sent them to Amazon.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|This was a page turner, with twists and turns that we're totally unanticipated. I read the book on BART while going to work in San Francisco. Several times I almost missed my stop!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved reading this book. I stayed up to 3am to finish it.  Sad its over.  Hope she writes another one soon!
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|Waiting for the theatrical version... What the -----, George. Fans want the original experience that we watched hundreds of times, not a re-interpretation...
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|The story was goof but it should have been completed in half the number of pages. It was very draggy with way too much inane detail..
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Good in spots.  Large sections were tedious.  Too much about drugs, alcohol and art.  I forced myself to finish it.<br />Especially disappointing because I thought her first novel, The Secret History, was great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't stop. This game is a total tunnel vision involved sequence of masterful moves. If only I was more masterful Maybe I wouldn't be stuck in certain levels for so long! &quot;Love it&quot; though!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am a power Dropbox user who stores important documents there and for whom dropbox accessibility and functionality is a top consideration for the purchase of a phone or tablet.  Lack of dropbox compatibility has been my number one complaint with Kindle Fire, thus far.  Office Suite fixes this issue and goes beyond.  The app not only provides a link to my dropbox documents but gives the ability to edit existing documents on dropbox and create new ones.  You can't edit dropbox docs/create new ones in iOS - you can only open existing files.  Great job Mobile Systems and Amazon.  I'm not sure I need to buy a new iPad Mini any longer.  Great app.  Thank you.
B003NGTYPA|5.0|a timeless classic ... no remake could ever be as good (including colorizing!). A winner for Christmas movie junkies of all ages!
B004UID2LC|1.0|It gave my kindle a virus and crashed it. DO NOT GET IT IF YOU PLAN ON KEEPING YOUR DEVICE!!!!!!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Always a fan of Malcolm Gladwell. I've read all of his stuff. Gives a plain and concise insight into a lot of pertinent questions for today
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I just finished this book amidst tears. It was our library book club read and not one I would choose. I am very glad I read it. I liked knowing more about the pilots and their experiences during the war. Although there were many parts that were difficult to read. Gave me a new understanding of the German people and what they endured too at the hands of Hitler and the SS.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|love this app! cleared up so many unused files and created more space on my kindle fire. I recommend it to everyone
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Generally boring - maybe since most of it was set in middle of no where Ohio. I also had a hard time &#34;buying&#34; Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Fianlly, hard to believe that things could really turn out this way in real life.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It sucks Jack I like biking  hiking trails and making songs b b in the w.  Minecraft  as  d  d d
B00EVW0VTI|1.0|I still haven't received my movie. Been 6 weeks. If it's going to be much longer the least you can do is sent me a notice letting me know that you haven't forgotten me.
B001IYCMNA|2.0|Great feature set and coverage, when it works. A &#34;stuck beacon&#34; problem started occurring more frequently since the last firmware update that causes the AP to hang several times a day (because it reboots automatically), whereas it required manual rebooting in the past. Very frustrating. Cisco support threads are awash with the same issue, and their solution to this &#34;known issue&#34; is to reboot the device. What a waste of money; and they have the audacity of classifying this as an ENTERPRISE class product. This doesn't even qualify as a reliable SOHO product.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|Dramatic movie that is on the dark side like many of Sean Penn movies. Lots of plot twists to keep it interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The suspense is amazing. I would recommend this book to my friends and family. Now, onto to the next book!
0393343405|5.0|A stark reminder of how religious oppression has set humanity back so long.  The key ingredient lacking over the past 2000 years was information.  Now that we are cracking that limitation, it may be possible to let great thinkers like Lucretius shine through again.  This should be in every hotel bedside drawer......Gideons, take note!
B00E0P8VOS|5.0|Sunshine Daydream<br />Excellent price, availability and shipping. Product is as described. I was able to find this vinyl set that was sold out on other sites.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Very scary. Love movies based on true stories. Could have been done a little closer to the actual story. Too satanic.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I have not quite finished the book at this time. I felt it took a while to get into the story.  But it &#34;grows&#34; on you.<br />I am not familiar with J.K.Rowlings other books. &#34;Harry Potter  series.  But this I am sure is so very different.<br />It will be interesting to see what other readers think of it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is captivating.  It is difficult to put down once you start reading it.  It  points out once again the strength of the human spirit.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|awesome.  on the side of your seat thrilling and all the characters are super.  i would watch the season again.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very poor product google. Does nothing more than stream Netflix and Youtube from mobile devices. You can apparently do more  with a pc. If your pc has hdmi, you can cast anything the pc has with just a hdmi cable, no reason to have this piece of hardware. Very minimal functionality. If you fancy doing more than playing netflix or youtube from this device, please save your money
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Unfortunately, I have to say this is my least favorite Lady Gaga CD to date. It's good but doesn't measure up to her previous releases.
1609611543|5.0|Good info for today's diet.  I have been bloaty and itchy for a few years now, plus packing on tummy fat.  I think this is the answer!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Seems to work quite well and gives you much more functionality then the FACEBOOK for LG app that was on my phone, which had serious limitations.  So for free, I'm happy with it thus far!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Enjoyed the game as a child with the felted case and special dice... This digital version is good mindless entertainment!
0547884591|5.0|This book is incredibly full of useful informations and tactics and recipes.<br /><br />It's really a great system for gaining knowledge and helping you to change habits acquire new skills and grow immensely in whatever focus it is you choose to apply yourself in.<br /><br />Definitely pick up a copy and keep it close. Read a bit of this book every day and work towards becoming a master chef or anything else you choose to study.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read this in one day. I laughed, cried, and enjoyed it! Lots of characters and it gets confusing at first but stick with it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works exactly as described. It's so nice to be able to watch whatever we want on the big screen without wires.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Shockingly good.  I hesitated to read what I knew would be a terrible evil injustice - as horrible as one could imagine, especially with the length of years.  I read a sample out of curiosity, but then purchased the book and I'm glad I did.  It is well written, balanced, descriptive in ways that are quite engaging.  The key for these types of books is not to feel invasive when try to understand something beyond human comprehension.  You could feel empathy and sadness, but still have objectivity to get the full picture. Kudos to Jaycee and the help she got with this book to tell a modern day tragedy.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|Not quite what is expected when you read the title.  Malcolm starts with a great analysis of David v Goliath.  From there he takes that story, for it it just that, and applies this to real events across time. The analysis was very good but it lacked a finish to bring it all together, such as helping each of us to understand how to handle these David v Goliath moments.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was really good I loved the whole entire series I wish that there were more though good read
B008FRFN7A|1.0|They just changedit so you have to upload file to net to 'process' it. What a crock. It worked just fine with out uploading in previous version.  I refuse to upload everything I print. My internet is slow and they don't need to keep a digital copy of everything I print

B00G32OER4|5.0|My wife and I were sitting at home one night without the kid and decided to watch The Conjuring. I am not much of a fan for scary movies because of the quality of most of them. However this one seemed to get good reviews so I said what the heck. It was the best freaky movie I have seen in a very long time. I suggest it to all my co-workers. It is a must see.
015603252X|5.0|One of the most beautiful books I've ever read and it helped me prepare for my first trip to Israel last year in many years.  While I read a lot, I don't know a lot about true literature.  Page after page was simply beautiful - the actual words, the writing, the story, the depth, the honesty, the historical context.  A rare, memorable book that i truly did not want to end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVE IT! This one was great, I cant wait to see the movie and read the last one! After you are done with the book you have to get the next one right away. I just hope the movie is better than the first one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Lots of tangled plot lines .... Vintage Grisham.  Although you begin to suspect what's going to happen, you are not sure until the end.  It's fun reading, quick, and interesting.<br /><br />There's an author's note at the end that states that nothing in the book is asked on any reality.  One has to marvel at his imagination!<br /><br />Enjoy!  Great book to lose yourself in!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|here is a tip don't slow down and I love the game and just so you now it is so great
0525478817|5.0|i love this book its so good i was reading it on the plane and i got to the very sad part towards the end (anyone who has read this book will understand)  and i just started crying next to two complete strangers but it was worth it such a good book
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|...This book brought me back for a glorious visit!  I lived in NYC for 6 years and then moved back to the midwest after 9/11.  All the things I love and miss about New York City have been captured in this small book.  What a treasure to remind me of the the color, the culture and sweet humanity that exists in this very special city. Powerful pictures, powerful book! Great price, perfect gift to give!
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|Fantastic - prepared me for a trip to Israel and to understand why Israel is so successful related to technology and entrepreneurship.  So appreciative of the details and the accessible writing.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A well thought out alternate future of the Zombie Apocalypse, thus book isn't a breathless page-turner, rather it's a thought experiment that has obviously been given time to percolate and mature. Mr. Brooks writes dialogue well and convincing, but the star of he show is the amount of time and energy in asking \\"and then?\\" Analyzing the consequences of a global scale outbreak is no small task, but Mr. Brooks has obviously done his homework, and it shows. Even knowing it was fiction, I couldn't help but think about preparedness for disasters and play the \\"what if?\\" myself, no matter how silly. This book is that well done.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|One of the best movie ever<br />I really like this movie and I wish see more like this movie off 007
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Great actors and so much potential lost in the fog of tedious and constant special VR effects. I think movie studios are trying to capture the young video gamers by making movies feel like first person shooter games. Special effects should be limited in there use and never replace good writing and character development. This latest installment of Superman is no threat to the earlier version. Not a good movie in my opinion. Way too long and entirely too much violence.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This is a ripoff and it won't let you play anything it's stupid and it gives you a virus and takes over everything that's why I hate it
B001LM1456|1.0|Never did get to watch this  it would not stream without stopping every three or four minutes. We finally gave up.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book, read it in 4 days, couldn't put it down! Thoughtful, sad, exciting, happy, everything you'd want in a book!
B0060YIBLK|4.0|Only about an hour to an hour and a half to read, but has some really interesting thoughts and techniques for use in both personal and business situations. I'm looking forward rotating their validity, but if you're interested in a light, quick read that might improve your inter-personal skills, I'd certainly recommend you give Mr. Dreeke a chance.
1250038820|5.0|I absolutely adore this book! I'm a New Yorker, born and raised and Brandon couldn't have done it better.  I'm back at Amazon for my 4th copy, to give to my friends who don't live in NY but love the NY spirit.  I recommend this for everyone.
044024613X|1.0|Isn't anyone bothered by the erroneous premise that Jacob could have inherited a gene on the X chromosome from his father???
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Nothing more than a politically motivated attempt to prop up our Dear Leader. Oh, I almost forgot to mention; the acting was really, really bad.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I'd hate to open this up vertically and have every thing fall out, it's fine for storage. Lay it down to remove stuff, it can hold all kinds of lenses or other, and you can put a tablet in it. everything works great but it needs more straps to hold your gear in.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I loved this game but when I updated it will not run and freezes and exits automatically every time! so angry!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is great for car rides because I is so fun! and it passed the time so esily<br />it is one of the best td games ever. atleast I think
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Entertaining and engrossing, totally holds your interest, the first 10 minutes alone make it worth watching, Denzel Washington was great.  Mixed thoughts on the ending but definitely see this.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I got this app on my kindle fire and I LOVE IT. I played it on the computer and now I can play it wherever I go. THIS IS PERFECT!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Visuals are of high quality.  There many games within the app to keep you interested.  Highly recommended for Majhong players.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|So far I am liking this game. Love that you lead men into battle. It also has a ton of upgrades for powers, weapons,  and allies. Wish you did not have to buy everything with you that is annoying. Coll game and would recommend this to anyone.
B000W178XO|5.0|wonderful, one of the best alums I have bought. His best songs and I can play it any time.  Thanks
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is very fun and asom its my upenon I love it its grate I plade it its relly cool.
B002ZBPPJ8|4.0|Engaging story and kept my interest based mainly on the stars, the plot had big holes in it and the timeline didn't make sense, kept thinking &#34;what, how could that happen&#34; etc.  Liked the architecture theme, the house itself and shots of Chicago.  A little slow.  My wife loved it so giving it a 4 despite the plot holes.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Stephen King's writing has had such an impact on my life. Most of my nightmares have been generated by him and the images he's created, but there's always an element of hope in his work that is worth so much more than the cheap thrills. However, I read a Stephen King book, especially a sequel to The Shining, because I want to relive some of the horror. Sadly, King did not deliver on the chilling promise of revisiting the Overlook. It had so much potential. I was maybe a third of the way through the book when I thought to myself, \\"He's still got it. After all these years, he can still scare the pants off me.\\" Then the True Knot started playing a more dominant roll in the plot and things started to go rapidly downhill.<br /><br />I really think Dan (Doc) Torrance was an interesting and heroic character but his most fascinating moments were when he interacted with the \\"ghosties\\" from his past, rather than the True Knot. I would enjoy seeing him again but he deserves a more worthy adversary.
0066214122|5.0|Loved it.  Not my favorite Crichton, but it ranked up there near the top and was a page turner.  I recommend it if you like Crichton.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Em is back. Back again. After relapse and recovery, it's good that this album came out when it did so it could help with damage control.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I have owned a px21 headset on 2 occasions both of them broke in different ways, the first one broke with in a month and the second one with in 4 months. These headsets are in no way durable whether it be the the swiveling area that breaks so so easily or the wires at the amp shorting out causing sound to be worthless.<br /><br />Other than all of the problems i had with this headset i did enjoy it for the time being, the sound is clear, mic is good for  awhile you just need to not move it around too much or it shortens it's life span.<br /><br />Overall im giving it 2 stars because it is an OK price and there are much better headsets, it doesn't have the longest life span, heck my headphones that i used since 2007 to now still work better, no where near the sound. There are many better headsets over this one, that are cheaper and more durable. I would not recommend this to anyone
1476747016|5.0|The Pusheen book is a worthwhile purchase for fans.  A lot of the comics are retreads from the blog site but there is enough new content in there.  I would say it's about 50/50 old to new.  How can you say no to the loveable grey cat.  Wooo I love Pusheeeeeen!
1603425381|5.0|Oh, this book is more tempting than a dessert cart in a fine restaurant! The eye candy is eye-popping! I keep going through it again and again, and can hardly wait to get started on some of these wonderful designs, which have applications for almost any shape of work. I simply love this book. It's also put together very sturdily, so you can use it and use it without the frustration of tearing the book up with frequent use!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|only on first level.  it has been easy so far but I'm. sure it will become more of a challenge as you go along.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A truly wonderful series. Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock. The cinematography, writing and acting are all superb. I am so very excited for Season 3 to begin.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|Orgaasmstein!!!! Yes, you heard me right. I am not a metal-head, or any &#34;head&#34; for that matter. But I like this DVD: excellent production inside and package graphics is also unique. They included multiple versions of two of my favorite songs. If you enjoy powerful music in any form, you will appreciate this work.
B00BATG18K|1.0|It was af the author lived the story from another book I had read many years ago. I'm usually a hugh Amy Tan fan but I have decided not to even finish it.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Very easy to install and use.  New printer set up and first time setting up print ap on smartphone. Great easy to use ap!
B006BFK5DK|5.0|If you love Earth, Wind and Fire, you're like everyone else in missing their fantastic sound. It's back on this album in spades. Phil Bailey's soaring voice is there, and their big, sweeping jazz/soul sound for which Maurice White was largely responsible in their earlier albums some decades ago, is still there. There is a sensual element to their use of orchestral and brass - as well as soul - qualities that really makes them irreplaceable. I was really, really glad to see this album, and they still live up to their reputation.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run1 and temple run2 are both really fun and challenging. I also really enjoy playing them on my free time.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is very much worth the 99 cents. Once you get involved in the puzzles, you won't want to stop until the story is solved. I did have to check the hint page once or twice, so you really have to pay attention to details. Graphics were good, music soothing. No glitches on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This movie is unique in the way that it was not only about flying, not only about addiction, not only about getting sober. It's a story about all of the above, and after all said, it's a story about hope. Although tragic and legally defeating that the pilot has to go through the stages of trials and tribulations to reach his shore of peace, there was a morally uplifting and liberating aspect about someone's being honest to himself and moving forward. The flight scene was awesome and I find that critical moment of controlling the descent a technical marvel, seems very plausible.<br />Even if you not into flying, you will enjoy it. Good drama overall.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Doctor Who Season 1. What a way to refresh an ailing franchise! Christopher Eccleston infuses the Doctor's first appearance on screen in about 10 years with his own brand of intensity and charm. He is a darker, more alien Doctor, changed by events we humans cannot begin to comprehend. Though the effects are a little rough and the story sometimes wobbles on the edge of farce (Mickey and the anthropomorphic rubbish bin...ergh), the Ninth Doctor is laying the building blocks for a sustainable and wildly popular modern Doctor Who era with standout episodes such as &#34;Dalek&#34; and &#34;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances&#34;.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Classic Eagles.  Great new songs.  We have enjoyed listening to our favorite band of all time and glad they are together!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a cool game... I wonder how people could invent so many things in there time period. I give it a 5 star rate.
B0071UF9TE|5.0|What an interesting peek into the world of a famous rock and roll icon.  So honest and open.  It's very well done.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I enjoyed the beautiful graphics and soothing music. I have to admit, some of the puzzles were a bit challenging. A good way to relax for a couple of hours.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I just wish I had read the appendix first.  It's hard to keep track of all the characters,houses, and relationships.
B001BANK32|5.0|For fiction, my 5-star criteria is how much I look forward to reading more. For The Shining, I could hardly put it down before I was anxious to pick it back up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I put off reading the second book of The Hunger Games trilogy for over two years because a number of people told me they felt it was weaker than Book 1... That it even hurt their love for Book 1 because the quick continuation of the plot went in new directions that they didn't like and wouldn't have chosen if they'd been writing the story themselves. Well, I couldn't disagree more! Thankfully, Suzanne Collins in the one writing the story (sorry, friends!) and she's woven an amazing yarn, another truly enjoyable and thrilling adventure that is best read in one sitting. I was silly to avoid reading this second installment in the trilogy for such a long time. Dig in, readers! As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm starting Book 3 (Mockingjay). Cheers!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Awesome book<br />This book is so good that every one should read it<br />I would recommend this book because \\"Wonder\\" really is the best book ever
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Graphics are great, and fairly easy to use.  Don't like how it suggest upgrades often.  Though you can try to go without them, it's more challenging that way.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome and it is a wise choice of Time and its so much fun for  my kids. They just love it and they do not bother me anyone I totally recommended this game
B009D7CP2M|5.0|amazing. it is a little slow reading but it is really a great book, it became one of my favorites. i coudnt stop reading. the only bad part was actually to finish the book because it give me the sensation of a lost, just because i enjoy so much reading it
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|I was intrigued by this novel from start to finish. I only wished it could have ended in a cliche happy ending. I am not insinuating the end is not happy but it certainly pulls at your heart strings. I recommend it to everyone interested in knowing about love .The good side of it and the bad side of it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Basically, it does what Google let's it do.  That's okay.  I ordered it mostly for YouTube and Netflix.  It works GREAT for those two apps.<br />Pandora is a nice plus.  I love walking into my home, and within a minute, connecting to my WiFi and casting Pandora through my sound system.
B003B02PFO|4.0|Quick read for Christmas book club. I have never read a John Grisham book before but I am not thinking all his books are this light and pleasant.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had heard so much about this game that I had to try it. Now I'm totally addicted to winning each level.  I love that each game brings it's own challenges.  Unlike other games - I'm never bored.  Play on!
1449410243|5.0|witty, dark humor.........If you have a cat you'll be shaking your head in recognition........not cutsey at all.........but, I wouldn't buy it for the cat person because they probably have a large number of cat humor books, cat knick nacks, cat figurines, etc. Buy it for yourself to chuckle over
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|To say that this album is somewhat okay is being too kind. I think I have decided to pretend that this noise does not exist as it does no justice to the talented band and is rather aggravating to listen to. As Icarus was hubris and foolish enough to think he could fly to the sun with his wax wings, Arcade Fire decided that tunes, tone and structure are not really all that important to music - or at least not important to such a band. The results are tortuous and tedious. I was never so pleased as when a song ended - -  only to be quickly checked in the hope that next one might actually be a song of good music.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give this a one star is because of the band. I know they are talented and I really like their music.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I couldn't put this read down. I kept reading and reading. I was reading to download Winds of Winter after reading the last word in ADWD. I am hooked, can't wait until the next installment.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was one of the best thriller/psychological suspense/family saga/mystery I have ever read. Ms Flynn has a terrific ability for description and development of very interesting characters.  She puts you right there in the middle of the story. I couldn't put it down.  It has twists and turns and a double ending.  As much as I enjoyed this book, there was much dark and depressing elements of the story that I cannot forget.  I'll wait awhile before I read Dark Places, the only other novel I have left to read that she has written. It's not that I don't want to read it.  I just want go save it and let the novel just finished digest a bit.  Actually looking forward to Dark Places.  Hoping she will have another novel published soon.  She is one writer that I intend to keep reading. I did read Gone Girl last year and loved it. But somehow it did not have the same kind of experience for me. It was a great novel but very different .  Highly recommend this if you like real psychological thrillers.  And some parts require  a strong stomach.  But so filled with dysfunction and disordered lives that are wonderfully written, no matter how difficult it may be to read. It is a unique kind of book. Not for children and adolescents in my opinion. Some very heavy material and necessary but ugly descriptions of things better left for mature adults. It all comes together and leaves you breathless.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|As battery managers go this is definitely the best app available. It appears to be accurate and completely reliable. There's a no nonsense feel to this app that is easily adaptable to the individuals needs. If like me you want to know how long you have left browsing on the internet or how long you have to download the latest album via iTunes then Battery HD Pro is the only battery app you will ever need. Graphically it is very nice and I like the way the large battery screen saver has coloured bubbles that slowly float up the height of the battery. Simple enough but satisfying. It's more than you get from some battery apps and less than others so this is purely an individual choice. So I hope you agree with my choice and go on to enjoy this app as much as I do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great thinking game to sharpen mind power. I found it slightly challenging. And a little frustrated when tapping item would not recognize.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This movie is beyond wonderful. I can't even count how many times I have seen it. I fell in love instantly. Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig do an EXCELLENT job!
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|it is fun and entertaining and good for all audiences. I will recommend it to my friends. Nice to see some good movies.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We are so happy with this purchase and cannot recommend it highly enough for parents needing a console on their child's stroller. We attached the Diono stroller organizer to our City Mini GT and it has not disappointed. The small zipper pouch on the inside is perfect for keys or ID and having two cup holders is great. It fits on our stroller very well and isn't bulky or difficult to access as others we researched. You won't be disapointed!
B00ENIR864|5.0|So easy to use and very helpful.  I have seen it on merchandise, but I didn't have the app, but now I do.
0307456625|5.0|I love this series of books, very charming.  I bought a copy for my Grandma for last Christmas, and she loved it to.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. But I seem to run out of free time and I had to give it up. Dang it. It is so cute and fun.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Recently, I purchased the free version of this game for my son. He was so obsessed with it I had to buy the full version. Now instead of just a few letters—he has the whole alphabet to play with—and he couldn’t be having more fun (or learning more).<br /><br /> I frequently use the parental control function on my Kindle to restrict the amount of time Elliot can play games—but with Alphabet Aquarium, I let him play as long as he wants. There isn’t one activity on this app that doesn’t teach him something. What I enjoy most about it is that the app offers a range of learning activities beyond just learning to speak and recognize letters. He is learning to match shapes, identify different types of animals, and learn his letters.<br /><br />Alphabet Aquarium is a great learning app for kids—it entertains and educates. What more could a mom ask for?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It definitely has enough twist and turns to keep it interesting. Very addictive. Hate the chocolate pieces also cherries and nuts. Lol  accidentally removed from device and had to reload from cloud and start over when I was on level 63. Lol
B003O86FMW|4.0|Thrilling Sequel - I started reading Catching Fire, but didn't finish the book before I watched the movie. However, I'm glad because the movie helped me visualize the rest of the book as I read.  I thought the book was great, but it didn't hold me quite as strongly as Hunger Games did.  I always feel a bit of a sag, when I am in the middle of a trilogy, knowing it is a book to get through but won't have an ending to wrap up. The characters of Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch  as well as the others have all been developed quite nicely. I am looking forward to Mockingjay and will start immediately, as I do want to finish the trilogy. It's a great trilogy, but don't read Catching Fire if you haven't read or seen the Hunger Games or plan to finish the entire trilogy. It's either all or nothing at this point. The movie is slightly different but does not detract from the book at all, and makes some of the themes easier to understand for the younger crowd.<br />Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the annual Hunger Games with fellow district tribute Peeta Mellark. But it was a victory won by defiance of the Capitol and their harsh rules. Katniss and Peeta should be happy. After all, they have just won for themselves and their families a life of safety and plenty. But there are rumors of rebellion among the subjects, and Katniss and Peeta, to their horror, are the faces of that rebellion. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|It was a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it.  I will watch it eventually but I had already seen it on TV and loved it.  I love the show Elementary so you know I am going to like Sherlock Holmes no matter what the story line is.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Love their radio songs, so purchased this album.  It is amazing.  Make sure you buy all the songs, and not just the radio hits... you won't be disappointed.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This has become one of my favorite (some of the language is a little much but other than that) I loved the concept, it remindeds me of another favorite of mine, The Brothers Grimm, (without all the language). I hope the do a sequel or that someone else would take on another fairy tale for growups!!!!!
B00G32OER4|4.0|was not as scarry as i thought it would be, pretty good movie. i'm sure they will have a part 2.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought this was an amazing sequel to the shining. The shining has always been one of my favorite Steven king books and I want sure what I would think of a sequel. Especially all these years later. It definitely doesn't disappoint! I would recommend this book to any Steven king or horror book fan. Great story, I couldn't put it down
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Fun and easy read. I did expect a more creative and origional story.This is just another romance with a happy end. This is the perfect book for a summer read: hollywood, light and fun.
B003U74NQW|2.0|strange, sort of disconnected. I wanted to watch something else, Patty wanted to keep watching it to the end. We did.<br />This is one of those things that we won't do again.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love their radio songs, so purchased this album.  It is amazing.  Make sure you buy all the songs, and not just the radio hits... you won't be disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|When I first finished this, I was furious and I was very angry and upset at the ending. I am still upset and cry every time I think to hard about it. I also have a better understanding of the book and honestly would not ever change the ending.<br />*************************************<br />************************<br />****************<br />******<br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Okay so, basically, I really liked the way Veronica set up this last book. I think a lot of the hate on this book is not only from the ending, but the way everything outside the fence played out. I, personally, really enjoyed the whole GD GP thing. It was compelling and I loved getting a more scientific and prejudice based dystopian world. If you didn't like that, then of course you wouldn't enjoy this book as much. Its like reading a fantasy novel when you only like biographies. I think the fact that most popular dystopian novels don't take this route angered people since they were not expecting this at all and it is completely new.<br /><br />I liked the new POV. I love getting into Tobias's head. Especially since he has more of a poetic way of speaking which produces some of the best quotes in the entire series. I did get a little confused at times as to who was speaking in the middle of a chapter but I do that with all books with more than one POV.<br /><br />Deaths<br />-Edward this was actually one of my favorite scenes because he just randomly shows up and gets shot in the stomach which I find hilarious. BUT WE NEVER FIND OUT WHO THE SHOOTER IS UGH<br />-Tori I wasn't really upset about this one since I didn't like Tori all that much. She was cool. Then she was obsessive and wouldn't listen to reason in Insurgent so I was mad at her, then she died. I never paid much attention to her and she was never one of my favorites. BUT THEN HER BROTHER WAS ALIVE WHAT NOT COOL<br />-Uriah I was upset about this one. Was it really nessecary? Uriah is one of my favorites and I just love him. I don't understand. The more I reread, the more I remembered how much I loved Uri and the more mad I got. I didn't cry at first because it was gradual but when they unplugged him (I was already sobbing) I started gasping for air because all the grief was too much of both Tris and Uriah's deaths.<br />-Tris I will never get over this death. This was the most devastating character death ever. Before reading Allegiant, I would have rattled off thousands of other endings I would want. After, I don't think any other ending would do these character justice. The one regret about it is Tobias. I am really conflicted because I don't think its fair for Tobias to be alone now (he has his mother but idek about that) but also Tris's death was just so...right. So satisfying. I LOVED Tris but I know that this was a good ending.<br /><br />But was I literally the only one who was completely clueless, like I had no idea Tris was gonna go in there until she did it. Then, I didn't believe it until Tobias came back and I broke down and cried for the last 50 pages. The entire time, I truly believed Veronica was gonna stop the book and say &#34;jk that didn't really happen, here's what actually went down&#34;. Also, with the plan everyone was like &#34;omg so obvious tris&#34; but I was just like what? No Tris be quiet that is a stupid plan how are you any better than them blah blah blah.<br /><br />FAVORITE SCENES<br />-Tris and Tobias gettin it on (OTP OTP) (at least Tris didn't Divirgin -get it?)<br />- Edward showing up randomly and getting shot<br />- THE SPREADING OF THE ASHES<br />- &#34;I guess a flame that burns that bright isn't meant to last&#34; -Tobias (*SOBBING*)<br />- PLAYING CANDOR SO CUTE AWWWW<br />- I DON'T KNOW WHEN BUT CLOSE TO WHEN WE FIRST MET HIM I KNEW AMAR WAS GAY I CALLED IT AND IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF AND THE FACT THAT WE GET MORE DIVERSE CHARACTER IN THIS SERIES YAY<br /><br />So yeah. Overall I loved this book. Not as fast paced as the others but still amazing.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|A visual and sonic blast. Great story and actors. Probably the best surround sound track of any film I have ever seen. I t puts you there right in the middle of the action.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|We love it!!!<br />My son and I have a blast playing. We both like keeping the horse going : )
B009NY43NY|4.0|I good read. Happy with the ending. Kinda wish the story could keep going. but something's must come to an end
B00EUM6WI8|4.0|This album is a road-map of where Mark Knopfler has been, recently. I may not know him, but I know where he is. I like it.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Don't mind the critics and the haters. The album is pure fun and that's exactly what I was looking for. Great job Gaga.
B008JFUPPI|1.0|We expected a good movie from these stars.  We were instead surprised by how bad this movie is.  Still love these stars but this movie was a waste of their talent.
B00F0AAC26|5.0|I started listening to Elvis back in the summer of 1977, before entering college.  From that very first album, I was a huge fan.  Elvis is one of those artists whose Aim is True, in the sense that he seems to be honest and true to himself.  David Bowie, Van Morrison, John Lennon, Sting, and Frank Sinatra are/were those kinds of artists.  They weren't afraid to re-invent themselves from time to time, often pursuing sounds radically different from what they'd previously produced.  I admire that kind of courage and integrity.  I've not liked everything that Elvis has recorded but I've always respected his efforts.  I'd read a number of reviews of 'Wise Up Ghost' that rated the album highly yet still expressed disappointment.  It made me hesitate to purchase the CD.  But then I thought, &#34;Hell, this is Elvis!  You love Elvis.&#34;  I'm pleased to say that I love this CD.  It challenges my ear in places, but good music should do that.  It should give you some sameness, some familiarity so that you're not totally anxious.  But, it should also provide some unfamiliarity, to take you to new acoustic territory.  I enjoyed this new journey with Elvis and I'm grateful for being introduced to The Roots.  Elvis has previously helped me to appreciate Anne Sofie Von Otter, the Brodsky Quartet, and Allen Toussaint.  I'm eager to see where Elvis takes me next.  I trust him.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Very good lighthearted action film, and I tend to like anything Mark Wahlberg is in, he doesn't do many bad flicks.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|PowerMate delivers the program-ability and performance that I'm looking for ... and also makes my clients very happy. Enough said.
B0035QUXWQ|4.0|This is an interesting way to review history.  A few more films like Forest Gump and we may be able shorten the attendance requirements for High School.
0394800184|5.0|This is a great story about a baby bird on a search for his mother.  It's very cute and my son loves reading the pages with me.  PD Eastman has several great books, and this is a classic.  The book is hardcover and the same size as the Dr Seuss series.  The books is similar to Seuss stories, but Eastman doesn't rhyme or use made-up words like Seuss.  I really like his books.  Great for girls and boys.  My 4 yr old son loves it.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I found the book enjoyable. This is not my usual genre so it was sort of an experiment.  Vivid descriptions and believable action kept me turning the pages.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the series and am so glad I read it. I've seen a lot more negative reviews for the last book than the first two, so I suspected it's ending wouldn't make everyone happy, like some of my ultimate favorites, it WAS emotionally gripping, but so very worth it. Definitely read this series!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Author Todd M. Thiede plunges you into a murder scene from the beginning of this mystery thriller.  You will enjoy this author’s unique writing style while following the detectives as they sort through the trail left by a serial killer with a cause and a message for his victims and others.  Being a writer myself, it is usually easy for me to figure out a plot and character twists within a few pages of beginning the book, but Mr. Thiede keeps the reader wondering and guessing what will happen next as he builds the profile of a killer whose passion is to wake people up to the amount of time being wasted each day.<br />This book reminds me a bit of James Patterson and his Alex Cross books.  You get a glimpse into the mind of a serial killer who gets so caught up in his work that he begins to toy with the detectives, leading them on a chase that has a surprise twist that even the killer himself couldn’t guess.  This book is a must read for the action loving murder mystery reader!
B000NY17J6|2.0|I was told this would be a brand new CD, still in the wrapper. When I received it, it was not in the wrapper, just the plastic case, which was cracked!  Don't think I'll buy again from here.
144234430X|5.0|This book makes you start to thing about alternatives and the little things that may have made a big difference in time.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Love the case but the stand up on the old one I had was easier to use. The price was awesome.
B003DS9ECQ|1.0|My rating is not of the actual movie, but the quality. As usually happens when I purchase an Amazon Prime movie, it froze and restarted several times. Eventually we got fed up and shut it off.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This awesome game is in line for great reviews. The shortest distance between two points is not what it seems when you play the dots. If you wish to exercise the mind to a path less traveled, then download and walk the fine line between here and there. You will not be disappointed. Go with the flow and join the one liners today!
B008JFUPZI|3.0|OK movie, not that great, would wait to see on showtime or HBO. Movie is not that interesting, the plot is not the best plot ever conceieved!
B00B19GKI0|2.0|Number of times I would endure watching &#34;Breakfast at Tiffany's&#34; to avoid watching this movie full length = 3. zzz...
B000O8OTNC|4.0|sharp. keeping it that way makes things predictably easier, especially in a world where there are dullards who take the edge away form your knives.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|This is EASILY the BEST show I've watched in soooooooo long. No comparison to any other shows.Hands Down... Bar None.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I ordered the Chromecast on 7/26/13 when I first heard of it. I finally received it on 9/12/13. I have been using it since and my overall impression is that it is a great idea but needs further development to truly live up to its potential.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Set up is very easy. Connected to my wifi network and we were off & running.<br />Works really well with Netflix & YouTube. Since it is streaming the content itself, you can use your phone/tablet to do something else.<br />It works with my Samsung S3, wife's iPhone 5S and LG G-Slate tablet running Gingerbread.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The biggest issue that we had is the inability to quickly access control of what's playing. In the Netflix app, we would start watching. If I need to get up & want to pause Netflix, have to unlock the phone to see the app. You then have to wait for the app to reconnect to Chromecast and have the blue &#34;Now Playing&#34; bar to show up, then click on it, THEN pause. This happens with both the iPhone & Samsung S3. It could take anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds before you could actually pause the show, which seems like an eternity. Surprisingly, the old LG G-Slate was the easiest as the lock screen itself displayed a still of what was playing with a pause icon in the middle.<br /><br />What's worse is that in the last month, the above problem has reached the point that now, once the mobile phone has gone into standby mode, when you go back, the Netflix app will no longer show the small Chromecast square at all. The only option is to completely close the app & restart. Even then, it may or may not work. Again, this happens on both phones and now even the tablet. This resulted in us going back to using the Wii for Netflix and look for other solutions.<br /><br />The YouTube streaming worked better than Netflix but also degraded as time went on. Now, 3 out 4 times if you went back to the phone, the app no longer displayed the Chromecast square symbol & the app had to be shutdown & restarted.<br /><br />The mirroring of Chrome did not work as well as I was hoping it would. Video for which there is no Chromecast-compatible app (such as Hulu) suffered from severe lag & was unwatchable. This occurred from both my Dell Win7 Laptop & my wife's MacBook. Pictures worked ok but with a 1-5 second delay between doing something on browser and seeing the result on the TV. Watching videos stored locally thru Chrome was a little better then streaming but would have 30-45 second pauses every 4-5 minutes of video. Displaying static sites worked fine except for the lag in what you did on the computer showing up on the TV, such as scrolling. In all cases, the wi-fi network in the home is strong, with a current router, no cordless phones etc.<br /><br />Conclusion: I was incredibly excited when I originally read about Chromecast. In my experience, it did not provide the type of experience that I was hoping for. The development of more compatible apps has been disappointing but the worst aspect of it is the degraded performance over time which pretty much has made the device unusable for our household. We are once again thinking of possibly getting a Roku box or getting the PS4, now that the kids are 9 & 7. The Chromecast will be sitting in the garage & I will bring it out again once it seems Google has developed it further.
B001MM28JG|4.0|I loved this movie since it first released when I was just a kid. Still love the story and the actors, especially Alan Rickman. Alan is a god =)
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|Dumb movie, poor plot, would not purchase, would wait for HBO or Showtime. This movie really is just a poorly made repro from other movies
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Admittedly, I saw the movie before reading the book, but the movie made me want to read the series.  I found the book hard to put down, better than I expected.  I plan to read the rest of the series and so I definitely recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game but incredibly frustrating waiting for more lives. I would rather pay $5 and get unlimited Lives. Please make a paid version!!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I purchased this album just randomly. This is definitely one of the top albums I ever bought. There's like easily 4-5 really good songs and you can almost make a case that there's not one bad song here.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Best app for youtube on kindle fire hd. Unfortunately it lack certain features to make it as<br />convenient as it could be
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire and Mockingjay both keep you on the edge of your seat. I have read both books three times and just saw the Catching Fire movie which stayed very true to Ms. Collins characters and storyline. I so far have not found any books that I've wanted to read since reading these. I'm 44 yrs old and only began to read the Hunger Games just to see what my teen was reading. I finished each book in less than a days time because I couldn't put them down once I started.<br /><br />Awesome!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|We all have read and watched and wondered about the people and events during the time of war with an inordinate amount of study and analysis done about the second world war. Never have I read such a masterpiece as this book is. A totally different and powerful perspective that captured my attention so,that I read it in one afternoon. The unique point of view of the narrator will take your breath away.
B00A6QPQDO|4.0|The movie is a visual feast, a tableau painted by a great master painter, Ridley Scott.  In scene after scene, the ambiguity of Christopher Columbus' character and the tone of the movie is heightened by the mores of Spanish society that is being overtaken by religious zealotry and any alternative thoughts or aspirations are punishable by death.  Columbus' portrayal by Depardieu sets the tone for us, he convinces us that Columbus was a deeply flawed man and yet a man of Science and a man who felt constricted by the social mores of Spain and wanted to break free from those constraints especially religion.  So against the back drop of Christianity and great oppression we see Columbus set sail against all odds into the great unknown leaving behind family and all he has known.  The ocean voyage is fraught with uncertainty  to the point of mutiny because the crew begin to feel that Columbus is lost and the voyage is cursed, however Columbus prevails and land is sighted.  It is perhaps the best scene in the movie of a lush tropical virgin Eden, as Columbus and his men first land, greatful to feel land they fall on their knees kissing the ground in relief.  However, a few moments later we see Columbus re-naming the Island San Salvador and claim it in the name of Spain, the Monarchy, and the Church as we see a snake slithering across a branch of a tree.  The biblical symbolism of that scene sets us up for the second half of the movie where soon after the preliminary friendship with the Indians, Columbus begins to break his words to the Indians and mayhem ensues, ultimately setting up for the conquest of paradise and the denial of the legacy/acknowledgement of discovery of Columbus by Spain. Interestingly enough we see in Spain, Columbus upon his ordered return  stripped of all his powers and held accountable for the murders of the Indians, failure to govern, and his execution of fellow Spaniards which ultimately land him in jail.  You will see in this move, a bit of the manbehind the myth, that is Columbus played by Depardieu magnificently. There are moments of uneven pacing in the plot due to historical omissions and time limitations and yet I am a bit disappointed how Columbus' true intentions have been downplayed or totally whitewashed.  However, do watch the movie because it has grandeur and an epic feel to it which is lovingly painted by Ridley Scott with strokes of yearning and desire for riches, exploration, and discovery.  The whole tableau comes to life by a great cast of characters such as Gerard Depardieu, Sigourney Weaver and especially Michael Wincott whose elegant evil personification imbues a bit of passion into this rather dull movie.  I will warn you the movie is a bit dull, but do yourself a favor watch it because this movie is an ambitious overtaking and will transport you to a different time and place, and isn't that what movies are supposed to to do?
B009IU6BIS|3.0|My age, I guess, as I don't seem to appreciate no-brain comedy anymore.  For what it is, they did it well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is great. The gameplay is smooth with no ads in the way. It doesn't force you to buy anything, and I've noticed that bananas are very easy to collect. I love that updates come out often. I'd say it's great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app soo much gosh I cant even express it.its fun people I love it but I wish we could choose the type of horse we wanted and I wish it would ummmm restore energy in less time.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I love this band and this CD. The CD came quickly and was packaged nicely. I have not had a problem with it.
B008JFUS8M|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence was amazing in this movie.  Her ability to convey emotions simply by facial expressions and body language is one of the best in the movie industry.  My wife and I were a little concerned after reading the books that this wouldn't be a good movie but instead it put things in visual context that made the story more understandable and also provided a much needed filter for the negative thoughts of Catness.  The whole cast did a wonderful job and bravo to the director for bringing this masterpiece to life.
B00B0U2SEA|3.0|I didn't see any difference between the original and the Blu-Ray version. After all these years, the movie should have been shot in German with English subtitles.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Only 2 Chests into this But LOVING it so far. Hope there's more levels to come with out another payment.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Entertaining, fun and fast-paced.  Easy to watch and light and in my opinion the best one of them all so far!
B0049H9NVW|5.0|YEEEEAHH! This game is the bee's knees. It has quickly become a top choice on my group's board game night. It is fun for all ages, easy to pick up, and hours of great fun! I highly recommend this game! Top choice!
B000ZP6MIY|5.0|- I love that they don't have any holes on the top or sides.<br />- I have a narrow foot and they stay on my feet well.<br />- The sole has better grip and traction than other style Crocs I've owned.<br /><br />- I don't like that my feet tend to get a bit clammy in them<br />- And, it's a bit annoying that I'm constantly getting gently shocked when I touch metal things (while wearing Crocs).
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Amazing movie!! I watch it multiple times each year and I love that it's a Prime movie now so I don't have to keep up with my DVD
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Good visual and an interesting interpretation of the comic universe story of Odin and the others of Nordic gods lives.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is good for horse lovers and the images are pretty good but the only thing that bothers me are all the ads. There are way too many and it gets annoying. Overall it is a fun game but ads need to be cut down.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Just awesome! Kept me wanting not to put the book down.  Wish I could know what happened once they reached Elsewhere.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was an awesome book! I really enjoyed it! I don't regret getting this book! Awesome book for the children!
B005GCCJME|2.0|These shoes are nice a cushy and comfy in that regard, but they're wider than other Crocs I've owned.<br /><br />I wear a women's 9 and have somewhat of a narrow foot, but I wear other style Crocs every day and they fit fine; roomy but they stay on my feet.  These are much wider and my foot really jangles around inside of them.<br /><br />To me they seem more of a guy's shoe.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|As per usual Nalini Singh draws her reader right into the story. Her realism is felt all through her writing. This particular story was both touching and suspenseful.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I think that the meal plans, and explanations should have went hand in hand.<br />Finding it hard to finish the book.ting
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I needed a pair of reliable headphones for my studio work. After doing a lot of research, I decided on these and am so glad I did. These have crisp, clear mid-range sounds, perfect for vocal work. They are light, too, a huge help when you've got them on for hours during recording/editing. Most importantly to me, aside from all of the above? If you wear glasses, you'll love these. They cup the ear perfectly, but the cushion is soft and doesn't drive your glasses into your head, nor do they make your ears feel like they're on fire.<br /><br />These are a solid pair of headphones that I know will get many hours of use in the years to come.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this trilogy so much I read it twice,just to make sure I didn't miss a thing. I recommend it to everyone.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|What can really be said about a book set in Nazi Germany? It was a beautiful read & a difficult read at the same time. Most interesting was that the author decided to narrate from Death's point of view. It's hard not to love each character. Mourn with them. Celebrate & cheer them on. I would definitely recommend to someone looking for a captivating good read.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This app is better then the one on Facebook.  Love it and can't put it down. I would recommend this app.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|This app would be great if it could just have a refresh button instead of constantly updating. It bogs down my phone and uses up my mobile data if I'm not very careful.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a great book! Can't wait  to see the movie! Totally recommend this! I wish the book went on forever
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This work of art is simply beautiful. It is a masterpiece and divine in a way that I have never seen before. I would read this novel as the sun was setting and still be reading as the sun arose. The lovely characters never mangage to fall from your approval for long, and the dialouge and scenery paint a world that is so real that I find it stunning that the gods would rather make our world than that of Scott Lynch. Bravo.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Good luck with that in the yahoo types of this year ago by the song and knuckles play in the yahoo dot org and
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Exactly what I wanted! Does what is suppose to do and more. Very user friendly. A must for every android/kindle user.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I actually completed reading this tome - yes, I called it a tome for how long it is - before I watched the 2013 movie musical starring Russell Crowe, etc. I was fairly entertained by it, but there were many parts that it felt like I was reading a textbook that dragged on and on. I did appreciate many of the contextual things that Victor Hugo wrote about at length, but there were also many times where I wanted to skip to the story instead of reading another 50 pages about the history of a particular order of nuns.<br /><br />I would recommend young adults (middle school and up) to read it once, appreciate the good parts, and then resolve to never put anyone else through that suffering again. There is a reason we don't pay authors by the word.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|By far the best angry birds game I have ever played. It has fun birds, it starts easy and works up the difficulty and has plenty of content and levels. The new star wars ones are too short.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I bought this game a couple days ago due to mild interest in the Build Your Own Robot, and I've had a lot of fun with it. Definitely recommend this for fans of fighting games. 4 stars for the amount of in-app purchases and low quality paint job for BYOR.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love it, but you have to have  patience. Because when you go to search it, it will close. Just reenter, and it will be fine
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I really liked this series. But then again I also read Dean Koontz. I wish there was going to be more from this author.
1451683405|5.0|Very well written and easy to understand.  Sam Harris presents the problem of free will and demonstrates why we don't have free will with very sound arguments that aren't easy to refute. For anyone interested in the question of free will, this book is a must.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As usual with books, this book is so much better than the movie!  The details that are left out of the movie aren't hugely significant, but they sure make for splendid reading.  Bought the book after reading this sample.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This was a life changing book & I keep it nearby at all times. It's  a whole new way to look at the way you react & think about everyday events in life & how your thoughts alone can change,  your life. This is a very simplistic review of the book, but don't be fooled, the four agreements are not easy to follow. I refer back to it &#34; often.&#34;, to remind myself of the way I strive to be. I would recommend it to everyone! just wish I had read it earllier, but I'm not sure I was ready for it.
0321811984|5.0|Wonderful concept and great book. Easy to follow. You are often told in business that if your idea can't fit on the back of an envelope, it's a bad idea. How many times are we subjected to Death by PowerPoint? Way too much copy, boring boring boring. This book helps you to break free of the copy-laden PPT's of old. Get Presentationzen...zen get going!
B003XNTTYY|5.0|Its the last book in the series, all little things came and fell into place. At the end each, small detail mattered and added  value to the ending :)
B001NLKT60|4.0|I really liked the way Stieg Larsson wrote.  You get attached to the main character then get you are dragged down this path of craziness.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved  The Hunger Games Trilogy.  Once I  started reading, I didn't want to stop and was sorry when I finished.  I want more.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I was so disappointed at the end of this book. Main characters are so blah. No personalities at all. Storyline is confusing and vague. I kept thinking that there would be a twist in the story where everything came together and made sense. It never did happen and I was left thinking...is it me? This book received outrageously good reviews, but the plot was so abstract, that I never made a connection with it at all. Really sad and disappointed. :-(  On to the next book
B0090SI460|5.0|The original.<br /><br />A wonderful romp into the world of the monsters under our beds, and in our closets.<br /><br />A definate tear-jerker for most.<br /><br />You'll laugh, you'll cry... Bust most of all you will fall in love with monsters.<br /><br />The bonus material on this collection is a wonderful bonus.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|What can one say.  This is a part of history that is only recently receiving acknowledgement.  These brave men deserve the praise and respect that earned.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I actually bought the game and it was worth every penny it's a nice passed game where it challenges your strategic skills great to play with friends and strangers would absolutely love it if they had some new balloon poppers but definitely get it specially now that it's free
B0015DROBO|4.0|Dark but I liked it.  I had to read them all!  This is the one that starts it all craziness, it is only beginning. One just is not enough.
1400052181|5.0|Fabulous story about the woman behind the &#34;gene&#34;.  It reads almost like a mystery. I grew up in Baltimore, not far from Johns Hopkins Hospital and found the book well written, riveting and intriguing. It was a story I never knew.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|I loved the first movie and couldn't wait to see this one. It's not quite as good as the first, but I think mostly because the first was such a unique story. I really can't complain about anything in this movie. It was funny, cute, my oldest granddaughter loved it. The youngest is a little to young. She seems scared of monsters of any type.<br /><br />If you liked Monsters, Inc., you'll most likely like this one as well.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|A wonderful movie. Made me fall in love with both Sully and Mike all over again. See how the two orginally teamed up and eventually found themselves working at Monsters Inc.<br /><br />Some have told me that they didn't like it, that it was a reach to just cash in on the orignial. But, I found this to be a wonderful movie and after having seen it in the theaters, I knew instantly that this was one that I wanted in my collection.<br /><br />The bonus material on this collection is a wonderful addition. Get to see and know the people and company behind this and the other wonderful movies that have come from Pixar.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|is a great read different take on things like that and can not wait to get the next one. telling all my friends who like these sort of books .
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is super super fun , it is a great strategy game . I believe it is better than than the original game. This one has sound unlike flow free. Super good game!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I played this online. When I found it here I had to have it.  It is the best game on my phone
031623480X|5.0|This is a well written account of why gluten and other sugars and starches may be adding to the number of cases of Alzheimer's disease.  I do not, as a rule, read self-help books, but because my mother died of this devastating disease and it was highly recommended by someone I know, I took the plunge.  I have since sent copies to our children.  Whether there is a direct link to Alzheimer's is not, we may never know, but cutting down on many of these foods can't hurt.  It is also a good guide to the connections between gluten and migraine headaches and childhood ADD.  Anecdotally, I can say that my daughter has not had a migraine since she cut most gluten out of her diet.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Some books grab a hold of you and linger long after you're finished. This is definitely that type of book. I really loved it.
B005603236|5.0|Love this movie. Clear picture and sound. No special features found on the disk. It says to access anything extra, go to pbs.org.  Great price!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great story told from so many angles. Well written, thought provoking and unique. It's a story that everyone should read from kids to adults. Well done, R.J. Palacio!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It is a boring game all you do is hair toca Boca hair salon is a lot better hope it helped
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is awesome and safe. to use it is a great game try it.real steel s the perfect game for kids.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|could not have expected more  This was fabulous.  don't doubt this.  it's great.  and i'm all fingers and never know what I'm doing.  even i learned it.  so very happy
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Fessing up - I am a trekkie - but this surpasses all previous Star Treks. Loved the casting choices! You don't have to be a Roddenberry fan to love it.
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|Game will not work properly. Does not allow you to move cards to playable spots deleted game and reinstalled no luck. Bugs need to be worked out before I will try again.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|And  the mountains echoed - and they still do, fantastic language, catching story from the country where the boys fly kites in spite of endless years of war.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Originally played this on the Wii U and had to get it when I saw it on the Amazon App Store.
B00EEPFLHE|4.0|Great Album, since TO HELL WITH THE DEVIL and IN GOD WE TRUST, this is STRYPER BEST!  Amazing Music from Stryper.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Not having read the novels, I happened upon this movie because 'everyone else' was watching it at the house for a reunion.  I'll be honest, the story's compelling and I was pleasantly surprised with the pace of the movie, the action sequences, the character building.  If you have to be spoiled, if you saw the movie The Running Man...along those lines but definitely less cheesy and a more serious movie by far.  Highly recommended to add to your watchlist.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|Massive amounts of airflow, plus i can barely hear it, it is quite literally the perfect computer case fan for the size. The only downside i have with this fan is the rubber anti-vibration mounts are quite challenging to get on if you dont have a lot of space for your hands, however its definitely worth the effort.
B00F2J2LRE|4.0|Just keeps on ticking. Man can she still sing. With allot of older singes that should of retired she still has it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use, detailed information and fluid graphics. When all aspects are considered, this is a five star application. Definitely worth downloading
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Nice follow up to the Enders game.  Middle sequels can sometimes be bridge books but this one was not dependent on Enders game or the one to follow.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a great book! this book is about child soldiers in Sierra Leone. These people who make them do this brain wash them, give them drugs, and make the fight for them. I would recommend this to any boy who is a teenager and who wants to learn about child soldiers
B004SDSSFY|3.0|a couple of missing features lead to this rating. first, and most important is that the device on which I usually use docs to go, a Samsung galaxy2 7&#34; tablet purchased through amazon, does not pair with the desktop version on my HP laptop. I don't know if this is a Samsung, a docs2go, or an HP issue, but it complicates the use of an otherwise satisfying product. also, although Times Roman, at least, is an available choice, a fuller fonts plugin could greatly enhance its utility.
B00F5F140U|2.0|Was disappointed in this album. Only really liked on song. The rest seam mundane. There was just no zip to any of the songs, its like Elton was tired when he wrote and sang this....To bad, should of stayed retired.
B003ES61EE|5.0|I got this after I saw professional photographer using this to clean the lens and it seems to be better than what he had. The base is a little bigger than what he used and it helps in cleaning a bit well. I was worried initially to buy a cheaper product compared to the ones which sells for $30 but I am pleasantly surprised that it does a better job than the one for $30. I would strong recommend this.
B00BATG18K|1.0|I thought this was a poorly written story.  I didn't care for the characters at all and was disappointed overall.  I have read all of Amy Tan's other books and am really a fan, so I wouldn't recommend this one at all.
B00130VLZ4|4.0|very sturdy and does really protect your camera.. very handy when I just wanted to bring my camera for a short walk and doesn't want to bring the hall camera kit!
0804161380|5.0|Unlike the packing for the seperate collectors guides(crappy amazon book envelopes that get into bear fights with ups and ends up on your doorstep in \\"used\\" condition) this set comes protected to the hilt and looks great. Kudos to prima for the set AND for making sure we got it in great packaging!
B004EPZ03E|4.0|Love Alvin and the Chipmunk! I can watch the movies everyday. They always put me in a good mood no matter what :) Not as good as the first two but still a cute movie
0887081770|1.0|This book is very small and pages are sensitive to tear. Definitely not one to use around toddlers who are not gentle with books!
B00F2362IE|3.0|I have the game on my fire and my galaxy s3.  the long load times are on both but only on my fire does the game freeze but it only ever does it after the turtle time game.  I did both in my phone and on my fire and I thought the phone was going to lose the gameplay like the fire. on the fire it will send me back to the home screen and I have to restart the game.  I like the game but its hard to play when I get reset from ling runs cause the turtle time back to the run kicks me out of the game.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Well written with good story telling. The narrator twist provided a depth of perception that was both surprising and enlightening. The timelines got confusing in parts, and some of the instances chosen for translating German was mystifying, but overall very entertaining. People do amazing things in all sorts of situations. There is beauty present in even the utmost despair.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Love it the game is so great. I would recommend it to any one who is invested in this like this.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Yes finally this game is free!! I have been wanting this game for sooooo long and now it is free, get it and you won't regret it
B00942G4UA|1.0|Quite biased and very one-sided.  There's a political agenda here using scare tactics.  I quit watching it when it became apparent that it wasn't a real documentary.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|.This game is awesome. Love playing it. Wish the booster packs aren't so expensive. They have to make money some how right.
B008NMT684|5.0|It's perfect for my son. He loves trucks and building puzzles.  He doesn't stop playing this game all day long.
0486275590|5.0|PERFECT!!!! Bought this for my boyfriends son for his birthday and he loves them. Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was an awesome book. Michigan Sparks really knows how to write a novel that is entertaining, hold your attention, and relates to real life situations. I highly recommends this book!  It will bring you laughter and sadness. But, most of all it will bring you pleasure and hope to believe in the impossible things in life!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|There are so many parallels between what the world is experiencing now with the ending of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't know how she did it but Collins captured the shear pain and anguish one feels when one returns from war. Loss, despair, hatred, anger and a rebirth. It's a great series to read and hard to put down.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|This is a great book..  I highly recommend this to anybody.  Especially if you have lost a loved one.  I have read it a few times over the years.  I have replaced it twice because I seem to have issues getting it back after I let somebody borrow it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So much story and emotion were waiting on each page that it was very difficult to put this book down. It was written so the reader can picture themselves in the place of Katniss, can actually feel her pain. Overall interesting plot, excellent beginning and ending. I miss reading it already ! ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and a good way to waste time...the updates make the game more interesting...and it is fun to compete with Facebook friends :)
B0086700CM|5.0|The name explains it all. You're running through a temple. Along the way, there are monkeys or apes chasing you. You also collect power-ups that you can upgrade in the shop. There are in-app purchases and you can buy coins with real money. I recommend this app to anybody.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game. Very addictive.I  love that you only get five lives,that way you have to walk away so you can get some work done.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting unique story, about a husband that is holding a lifelong secret. Good read and quite a secret. Great characters.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|a great feat in movie-making, lots of action without being overwhelming, the director really captured the energy of the characters, of Superman; the special effects are awesome and the story had real emotion.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|The reason I like it is because now you don't have to clear search history or any of the other pains!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is good but it sometimes lags you out but that's the only problem I think it is one of my favorite games on Amazon
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|It works just fine. I wish the cord was a little bit longer and the plugs were on the short edge.
B0010K83U8|5.0|Iron Maiden at their Best is the only way to describe Powerslave , front to back this recording mastery will keep your ears pealed back and your heart pumping faster and faster with every beer. Buy it !
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Too much fighting, not enough plot. 75% of the book details fight scenes. Not as well written as the first 3 books.
B00F2362IE|1.0|It's a good app but it's always freezing not hard at least but not the best<br />so next time I have to tell you try harder
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really like the game and I just got a hammer head shark get this game you won't  regret it the game is awesome you can eat almost everything  it's free ya
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Sycamore Row Is a typical Grisham novel.  The characters are well drawn and believable and the story is well told and suspenseful.  It held my attention from beginning to end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging and fun. Some levels take seconds to pass, others take DAYS!! But it's great!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story line but a bit overwritten with too many details.  Need less description of all the characters and the geographical locations.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE every single part of this game. Yeah, it's 7.00$ but it's ABSOLUTELY worth it. I play this every day!! ADDICTING!!  LOVE IT!!!!
1451666179|5.0|It's just like the website, but in the palm of my hand. I had wondered where Allie Brosh had disappeared to and was a little worried. I'm glad she's back with this book. There's plenty of new stuff and reading the stuff from the web is just as funny as when I read it the first time.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I remember playing FreeCell on my windows PC as a little kid, and this game is a faithful take on a classic time killer. If you haven't played this before, the developer included a nice tutorial and rules section that should get you up to speed in no time. The graphics looks nice - it has that basic, classic look but with some nice additions such as drop shadow and options to customize the cards. You can choose different colors for the background, or even customize it with your own photo.  The cards might be a little too small, especially on phones with smaller screens. Rotating to landscape mode should help make things a little bigger, not to mention make it easier to play by giving you more room select the cards. If you get stuck, there is a hint function that will show you your available moves.<br /><br />I didn't encounter any ads while playing, and the game was stable with no random crashes or force closes. The game does include Flurry Analytics, however.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun classic game that will keep you entertained while killing your productivity without prejudice. It's well made and I wouldn't mind paying the $0.99 asking price. As today's free app of the day, it's definitely worth checking out.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|THE REASON I AM RATING IT 4 stars is because it takes forever to load but other than that it is a fun game
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|This movie for me is about to over take my love for LOTR. I find you get more of character development and story content. Even though the book was like a children's story it has great pace for fantastic events.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My child loves this app! I can't get my child off this app! But there is one thing I don't like about this is that she keeps asking me to buy stuff that's on this app. At least that's the only thing
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really like the storyline and the flow from his other book to this one...kept one informed of the characters and the locale.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Addicted to this game!  The graphics and sound are great.  Interesting puzzles, some are harder than others but not impossible. When is The Room 2 being released?!?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft pocket edition because you can do any thing. Ps I bout this game to play with my best friend
B007FTZDN8|4.0|Great information that gets you thinking about what you learned along the way. Good speakers, interesting subjects. Enjoy that I get to hear about what they think & believe
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book truly enlightened me on the genius that was Nikola Tesla. He is a true living story of pursuing your dreams no matter how crazy they may seem. Underdog stories like this don't even occur in the movies. Truly an inspiration to readers of any age.
0385344333|5.0|I LOVE the Jack Reacher novels.  They go too quickly for me...like eating a bowl of popcorn.  However quickly the story goes, I love the action and the storylines.  I look forward to each book in the series.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|At first I thought this game had glitches ...until I figured out that it is simply designed for more advanced players. If you need you're hand held all the time you might want to sharpen up a bit before tackling this. Excellent graphics and sound. The story is compelling and I kinda feel for the hero (?) as he almost remembers. this is more of a point and click adventure with mini games and puzzels than a H/O game but, there is some finding the pieces and look for this or that bit you need ....no real H/O scenes so far though. I paid $4.99 for this so I am counting on it not being over in one sitting but, I am not very far into it yet (I hope) . lots of back and fourth as you find things you could use elsewhere. some folks don't care for that but, I don't mind it.Makes you have to remember what you have seen and where.There is a map available in game to help with that as more and more places open up. The puzzels can be quite the brain sqeeze but, if I can ....so can you. If not,  hit the skip button. I like a good mystery / adventure game and this one is feeling pretty good. Thanks to G5 entertainment for continuing to bring out games for grown ups on the kindle.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|My kind of music. It does, however, have some dead tracks at the end. These &#34;dead tracks&#34; keep the CD from closing and allowing the player to move onto the next CD.
1609613937|5.0|Love this book.  I can eat without worry. This is a simple informative book to food. Food is staple and should not be so complicated and McDougall takes and makes it so simple to eat the old fashion basic Bible way! Reach for the sun in morning (fruit on trees), grain in afternoon (run through the fields) and roots, potatoes etc. at night (like covers on your bed) to keep you warm.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun game that is challenging and addictive to play. You play for hours on end as you try to get all the achievements and to try think of new was to infect the world!
0553801473|5.0|I have read all five in this series by George R.R. Martin and surely look forward to the next.  Each book is a huge read...I never want them to end!!!  They are exciting and complex with an outstanding cast of charters and locales.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good story. It was somewhat predictable, but I liked how the author tied everyone together. If you pay attention to the characters from the beginning, you will see the pieces fall together.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An entirely new world where a poor fatherless 16 year old has to fight to death for the Capitols entertainment.<br /><br />Once you start, I mean it'll be in your life for a loong time. You won't put these books down believe me! I think I am addicted to these books. I even have a page on Facebook!<br /><br />But really if you haven't read you're missing ou!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An amazing web of stories interwoven & overlapping in true life fashion.<br />Appropriate for anyone wanting a real glimpse of  survival through Nazi Germany.

1451626096|5.0|This book, the last in the series, did a lot to provide explanations from the other 4 books.  loved the read...
B002NUULNG|1.0|This is a remake of the original with awful English dubbed audio  sounstrack with abysmal acting. My daughter loves the orginal - even she couldn't watch after half hour ! Don't waste your money, buy the original !
B00B3VB9TQ|2.0|At first it didn't grab my attention, but I kept reading because I knew it had to be good to be a series. And then I fell in love with it. At school I always carried it around in my hand and in cross country. Everyone always asked what it was about and asked me about it. I really recomend it, especially to highschoolers/ teens!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Really like this magic jigsaw puzzle game....I don't have to take up space on my table to put together the puzzle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had this app for awhile, purposely waited to use it enough before writing a review. I must say, it is an excellent app. It is easy to use, easy to navigate, and it can even read out loud for you. You can write notes. Highlight, etc...Great. I recommend this all the way.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan tells a wonderfully rich story. The dual storyline was complicated, but easily followed.  I did not want the book to end...
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|A wild ride of musical flavors. &#34;Wake Me up&#34; gets you moving, &#34;You Make Me&#34; keeps it going, &#34;Hey Brother&#34; is an absolute earworm, &#34;Addicted to You&#34; is quite trippy, and &#34;Liar Liar&#34; is a psychedelic retro spin if Avicii was spinning in the 60's.  Overall, very impressive!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Extremely funny!  Full of action.  Great acting.  The best sci-fi comedy that I have ever seen and it is certain to become a cult classic!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great scenery and graphics.  Lots of different animals and challenging hunts.  Watch out for the predators--they will hunt you!  You will see blood and wounded animals sometimes escape.  May be too realistic &amp; graphic for youngsters.
B004WR125O|3.0|Lacks range. Resulting in severe limitations. Onkyo should have tested the range on this unit, before release. Manual could use more information.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I hope Susan Boyle makes the Queen's biannual honours list one day to be the icing on the cake of her life. She must love Christmas because she always manages to release an album around the holiday season for the season.<br /><br />This compact disc features her voice singing classics. Johnny Mathis and her perform a duet. She has even managed to make history by performing with the late legend Elvis Presley with technology today.<br /><br />Sure Susan can give us more and I expect more in the future but this cd would be a great gift this holiday season.
1401938906|5.0|Fantastic book - a lot of things I knew already - but put into a framework that was a lot easier to actually implement in my life! Giving this to several people. Very happy I got this!!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is so fun i love it! it makes nice sounds and has nice colors! pretty easy and enjoyable! im a kid and its a grrat time passer!
0446547573|3.0|It was an OK book. The main characters were not believable, in that they were perfect- they had no flaws at all. They were completely one-dimensional. That really annoyed me. He could have put more effort into the book and given Katie and Alex more depth and made them more real. (I also think the whole \\"she was so gorgeous, every guy noticed her even without a stitch of makeup on and a bad haircut\\" thing is very cliche).<br /><br />The writing was quite good, I thought. Not amazing, in that I did feel bored a couple of times, but overall it held my interest and was easy to get through.<br /><br />The plot was pretty predictable. I definitely figured out how things would turn out before they happened.<br /><br />The twist at the end was silly and simply not believable. It just turned me off to the whole book. It seemed pretty ridiculous, and did not fit into the storyline well.<br /><br />So, yeah, I'm surprised that this book has such a good rating. Its an OK book, but lacking depth and believability.<br /><br />I think the main feeling I got from the book is that it was written to be made into a movie. And I do think it would make a good movie. In fact, I think it could be a really great movie if done well. Just not such a great book.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Description of movie was way off.this movie is based on a alcoholic and drug addiction. It should say that when describing the movie.
1451695195|4.0|Eben Alexander III is an American neurosurgeon who, in 2008, became deathly ill with a rare case of bacterial meningitis.  Within hours he fell into a coma during which his cerebral cortex shut down.  Sometime during the week that Alexander was in the coma, he claims to have experienced a near-death experience (NDE) that was hyperreal (from both sensory and epistemological standpoints), and that proved for him the existence of an afterlife and of heaven.  He asserts that because he is a neurosurgeon, his personal and yet also scientific testimony that his NDE was beyond the mind and not simply a hallucination might carry more weight among skeptics.<br /><br />This testimony, “Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife,” is brief and lively written.  The narrative alternates between an account of the progress of his illness, partly as recalled and told to him by others, and his NDE.  The sections that deal with his purported experience of the afterlife recall a disconcerting yet also familiar darkness and dankness leading to light, color, and a sense of well being and being loved.  It is a good story, however factual it may be.<br /><br />If we define biological death as being final and irreversible, then the problem with NDE accounts is that they are told by people who come back from the verge of death, and so ipso facto weren’t dead.  Such claims to NDEs are thus vulnerable to the criticism that they are actually hallucinations as the brain grapples to interpret a traumatic experience.  Alexander anticipates such criticism in three ways, one, in noting that there was no brain activity during his coma; two, by suggesting that through deep meditation one might gain some limited access to the other world that he experienced and so it really isn’t dependent on being dead so much as overcoming usual psychological and physiological obstructions to entering into the other-worldly experience; and three, by defeating all the scientific objections he thinks could be raised (see Appendix 2).<br /><br />Alexander describes the period immediately following his waking up from the coma--we don’t really learn how his body defeated the E. coli bacteria without suffering brain damage--as one of confusion and hallucinations.  Alexander is unable to completely dismiss the possibility that his NDE was borne out of this period in which his mind is trying to reconnect with his pre-coma life.  He posits that his NDE could not have been a post-coma experience because the NDE visions were so tangible while the hallucinations he remembers having were so confused.  There seems not to be a scientific reason, though, that in the midst of this confusion he may have had some sort of ethereal and hyperreal vision.  On the other hand, that he may have had this vision in this post-coma state does not preclude it from being a religious experience.  Thus we return to the usual chasm between what’s scientifically verifiable and what must be taken on faith.<br /><br />To sum up, then, as an NDA account, what “Proof of Heaven” describes is no more scientifically proven than other cases, albeit having a scientific bent, but as a story of faith it is incontestable.<br /><br />Audio version: The audio version is read by the author.  His soft Southern voice is easy to listen to.  At the occasional poignant moments, his voice drops low, and if you’re listening in a high ambient-noise environment such as a car, you may now and then have difficulty hearing him.  Alexander reads the appendices as well, making the audio version complete.  Given the appeal of the author’s voice, and the highly personal narrative, I would purchase the audio version over the written text.he thinks could be raised (see Appendix 2).<br /><br />Alexander describes the period immediately following his waking up from the coma--we don’t really learn how his body defeated the E. coli bacteria without suffering brain damage--as one of confusion and hallucinations.

B00499NHLC|5.0|The two actors are a great team. Funny but serious. Quirky.  And Cumberbatch especially is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes!
B00GQ7OZR0|1.0|So depressing to see such a great TV series end on such a disappointing note!  Still shaking my head.  Thanks for the years that it was five star.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun addicting game. Can't stop playing till I'm out of lives no matter if I win or not. This game is a good time eater.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Book moved between London blitz in WWII 1941 and family home outside of London in 1961 and 2011. Back in 1941 Dolly was in love with Jimmy- both were young and poor, wanted to get married when they had more money. In the meantime in 2011, Laurel and siblings are visiting their sick mother, Dolly, and are intrigued by a photo of their mother and her friend Vivien who they never knew of along with Dolly’s mumblings about a mistake and tragedy in her past. Laurel becomes fixated on finding out her mother’s secret and thinks it has to do with a murder she seems to remember witnessing in 1961. Following their story and the many twists and turns it takes is very exiting.  Often I find that books that jump between time frames can become annoying to read because as you get involved in one story it jumps back or ahead to other stores.  But this one does it right and its quite a good book as a result.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Disappointment after the first two books! I guess the author wanted to milk the success of the first two, without having any real plot to do this with. I managed to read the first 2 without considering them YA novels, but it seems like the author wants to remind you that they are, in fact YA novels. Anyway, it was a struggle to finish this one, mainly because after the investment of reading the first two I just wanted to get to say I completed all 3.  Please Ms Roth, no more from this series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a very good read.  I had to know the ending.  My students at school were reading these books and I knew I needed to read them also.  I needed to be able to discuss with students what they were reading for fun!  I enjoyed the books and loved discussing to students about the books outside of my classroom.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Super fun! You can build whatever you want to! You can also find stuff and join game with your friends!I hope you find this review helpful.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Slick graphics and sounds! Gets progressively harder till it becomes a real challenge! Fun  game, anyone can play without much effort!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is an awesome addictive game! Unfortunately cant get anything else done once I start until I run out of lives.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|A great movie, of course. The &#34;Special Features Disc&#34; is very good. A good quality set to have. This has some great scenes of Bella and Edward.
B00G5G7EXY|3.0|(I have some spoilers in here, so be warned)<br /><br />First off, I thought the movie was cute but more for children. I enjoyed the characters of Anna and Olaf in great measure. I thought the kingdom was beautiful and the snow flurries that Elsa would make were really fun and pretty (the ice castle scene was amazing!!!).<br /><br />Two songs made an impression on me: &#34;Love is an Open Door&#34; & &#34;Let it Go&#34; (both movie and pop versions).<br /><br />I liked the plot up to the point when Elsa, the ice sister, finishes making her ice castle. After that, the plot on Elsa’s side drooped for me. I would’ve liked to of seen Elsa spend more than one day away from her kingdom and build more of her own, see her develop her powers further, and possibly make more ice friends or something so we can see what she's like when she doesn't have to fear &#34;icing&#34; people.<br /><br />As for Anna’s plot, it was predictable but good.<br /><br />The trolls were a so-so thing for me. They had potential, but I would’ve liked to of seen them be involved more with the story. Like coming down to help Kristoff at the end.<br /><br />The story did have one plot twist that I didn't see coming. A good move, and it solved who Anna would be with, but I gotta say I was disappointed in what happened. I can see why they did it, but still…I wish it were different.<br /><br />There were some laughs and some beautiful/classy outfits for some of the characters. I really liked Elsa's snowflake cape and Hans's prince outfit.<br /><br />All that being said...I felt like Disney was grasping at straws here. The story had wonderful potential and I feel it could've been better, but it missed the mark. Mostly it’s because I wanted to see Elsa get a happier ending. She needs to be rewarded after the loneliness she put up with for all those years to keep her family safe. Poor kid.<br /><br />I'd probably still buy it, but I wouldn't watch it 3-5 times in one day (like I've done with other Disney films).<br /><br />Tangled is better to me.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I got this mostly for my children. Once in a while it stop when you go do<br />another puzzle. So far not any problems yet. Not too bad if you don't mind the ads.
0345529057|2.0|I love the series but the type in these books is too small to read comfortably. I've kept them in case I get really motivated but I wouldn't buy them again in this format.

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|As real as it gets, real small arms action. Love the choices, but keep it coming. Over all great game.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Long, long ago…there was a special time when music took you to a special place and left you with a few good memories…the music reached you so deep into your soul, that it literally changed your life.  Now, in the world of instant gratification and boy bands, music is so mundane and thoughtless.  Musicianship, orchestration, composing something of artistic value and a piece which can stand on its on merits and values are gone.  It's been 35 years since I've taken time to listen to Deep Purple, and here I am again…scratching my head, going…wow, it really was that good. I've experienced it all as musician myself, from acid rock to acid house and everything in between, and nothing comes close to the magic that happened in the 60's and 70's and Deep Purple created.  The 80's were ok, but everyone, including Deep Purple, felt this need to change with the times.  What ended up happening was many of us moved on searching for that &#34;goose bump&#34; feel we would get when we use to hear that power riff, repeated, over and over, measure after measure, leaving you lost for a moment, then bam, it would bring you back again.  But we didn't find it.  Soon DJs figured it out and began to program their sets in the same trippy way in the 90s. So what makes this record so special?  The attention to detail and the ability to combine the old with the new and pull it off successfully.  The soul of Jon Lord is definitely heard on this album.  The band's professionalism as seasoned musicians  and the looseness of just being  rockers are all apparent here, and work in harmony.  The energy is Deep, as Deep Purple is,…and the soul is flowing with the winds of the past, present and future.

B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like this game. I don't like having no opportunity's to raise my coin level except to purchase them. I am on a disability income and joining your G5 site and purchasing the game is all I can afford to spend every month. I can't play many other of your games because I have on other game site. I just ask that u keep your disability income and Social Security income players in mind when u think of games where u need things to advance levels or need things to advance
B000065K6N|5.0|This is one of the most amazing and moving movies ever.  It's not even that it is animated, it's just that it is deep and rich and life-changing.  NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS.  It is a movie that requires a mature mind to appreciate, and little children will find it too scary and intense.  It's not a cartoon.  It's a serious and beautiful movie for serious minds.  Very worthwhile, don't miss it!
B0006J28BO|5.0|The movie was flawless. Nothing wrong with the DVDs. Came with the sleeve as noted. Shipped very fast. Kids cannot stop watching it.
B00FPX54DA|4.0|The Piano Guys are always good. When teamed with a Christmas theme, even better.  Sharing with my family, the best!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was expecting this device to make watching programs from my laptop better. What I learned was this seemed to do no more than what you get when connecting via an HDMI cable, which is what I had been doing.<br /><br />Set up was confusing on my set. Device had a hard time finding my very (very high speed) network. No help or support available expect for long, tedious and very &#34;general&#34; help pages.<br /><br />In the end, I'm no longer even sure what benefits this device claims to offer overy what you can already get with network ready TV, an Xbox or an HDMI cable. If anyone can provide that piece of the puzzle for me I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />I did return the device as it seemed more complicated than just using the HDMI cable.

B003YV64OI|4.0|I bought this for my first rig that I was building with my dad. Paired with an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 650 1 GB GDDR5, I was pleasantly surprised when I did my first fps check in Minecraft on one of the slowest servers in the game. I was running at a solid 100 fps. On other servers and in singleplayer, I was getting 200 or more at times. I am able to record at 75 fps and above. I haven't tried to push the limits of this processor yet, but I am sure that it will take a lot to make it overload. I am still using the stock heatsink and fan. It actually runs cool and quiet. This is a great bang for you buck processor! I recommend it!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|All I can say about this game is Downl;oad It it's excellent. I love the sharp colorful graphics and the sounds it makes while your playing.. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing colorful match 3 games..
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|A wonderful read. All about young all consuming love. Filled with ups and downs turmoil and happiness. I will definitely read the next book.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I can't understand why so many people are saying this movie is slow or boring or even &#34;not for kids&#34;. I very much enjoyed this movie. It has a great sense of classic references. The biggest classic movie reference is &#34;Frankenstein&#34;. There is also &#34;Bride of Frankenstein&#34;, Godzilla, and several others. I love how it's in black and white. It gives it a nostalgic feel. This movie has laughs, tears, fear, and plenty of enjoyment in it. I would most definitely recommend it to everyone of all ages.<br /><br />Good work once again by Tim Burton. And in case anyone is confused on what the story is supposed to be: A young boy's best friend is his dog. One day, Sparky the dog runs out into the street and is killed by a car. The boy is devastated and while sitting in Science class, he learns of how electricity can jump start the nervous system. He figures if it can work with a dead frog, why not a dead dog? He brings Sparky back to life only for him to start scaring everyone he meets when sneaking out of the house. After a few classmates find out about what's been done, they try it themselves. All chaos breaks loose from bad students trying it.<br /><br />I won't ruin the whole thing but that's about most of the story-line.

B00B5HQLMI|2.0|It was a middling spy thriller but it wasn't James Bond. Did they finally give the role to the loyal stunt double??? Some people liked it but I assume they weren't around for the first 20 or so Bonds!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I reaally enjoyed reading this book.  Although I have heard about orphan trains, I had never read a book about children that were sent west on the trains, and it was very interesting.  I have recommended it to my teen-age granddaughters.
B00EVW04PE|5.0|I actually expected this to be not a very good movie bc of the ratings. But it actually was an excellent action flick. Showed morals, values and American pride. Jamie Foxx did a good job as being the president, even though was more of a secondary character. Tatum did a good job as well but the real star was the actress that played Emily. Bravo.

B001EBWING|5.0|Classic. Wonderful acting, music and shooting Nazis. What more can one ask for? I would recommend this film to everyone.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Better than Bing. Way better! I promise.  The Piano Guys are famous for taking ordinary tunes and transforming them into deliciously complex, richly layered musical experiences with creative rhythm patterns and unexpected harmonic shifts in color and instrumentation. They gleefully juxtapose traditional and classical with popular and contemporary styles. If you were oppressed with classical music as a child, this is the cure. If you've never been able to &#34;get&#34; the music your kids listen to, this is your bridge. If the elevator-music version of Christmas wears you down, this will lift you up again and remind you what's special about the season.  I haven't bought a CD in umpteen years because I usually don't want to listen to the same pieces of music over and over again, but I keep spinning this one and I think I'm going to wear it out. Also, I don't ever write reviews (how am I doing?) because who has time and who cares what my opinion is? But, honestly, The Piano Guys are phenomenal musicians. This is a quantum level up from the cuteness of Mannheim Steamroller and the comedy of PDQ Bach.  These men are unafraid of beauty and fearlessly emotional.  Funny, sweet, offbeat, magical, wistful, playful, deeply inspiring and absolutely delightful.

B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|This is probably one of the best - if not the best - albums of Cher's entire career. The production is top-notch, her voice still sounds amazing, and the variety of the song styles is stellar. Favorite tracks include: Red, I Walk Alone, I Hope You Find It (this should have been a huge hit on the hot 100 - what is the matter with US radio?!), Lie To Me, and the haunting &#34;Sirens.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Closer to the Truth&#34; is that rare album where you can play all the songs - and really love all of them.  It's got every mood and genre - dance, rock, ballads - and Cher proves once again why she is a true legend.

B000062YB1|5.0|For a lot of Slayer fans, Seasons in the Abyss marked the end of the band’s classic period, while others contend that it ended with the next album, Divine Intervention.  Without question, “Seasons” was the end of an era, as it was Dave Lombardo’s last album before leaving the band for about fifteen years.  “Seasons” is interesting in several ways, with a mix of old and new elements.  One thing it does is bring back some of the speed from “Reign in Blood” after the big slowdown on “South of Heaven”.  When the opening song, “War Ensemble”, storms out of the gate with blistering thrash guitars and thundering drums, the tone is set.  Other than that though, this album sort of begins a new era of Slayer, using several new features that would become hallmarks of their subsequent output.  Noticeably, on “War Ensemble”, Tom Araya wields his new super-yelling vocal style, which he began to use way more on later albums.  Slayer also begins to groove a lot more on “Seasons”, with songs like “Blood Red”, “Expendable Youth”, and “Skeletons of Society”.  And finally, they started writing songs like “Dead Skin Mask” and the title track, that are slow and eerie in the style of the beginning of “South of Heaven”, and every Slayer album since has had a similar song.  Even though “Seasons” is always mentioned alongside “Hell Awaits”, “Reign in Blood”, and “South of Heaven” as one of Slayer’s big four, it showed new elements to their sound and laid the foundation for their next few albums.  It’s a tremendous release by one of metal’s most legendary bands.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So high quality that it's difficult to tell that it's free! My favorite detail was making big Macintosh fly around with tiny butterfly wings XD. My only complaint is that between updates, it shut down and I started from da beginning.... BUY THIS GAME!!!

B00AFQC4QC|4.0|This was an exquisite depiction of one family's point of view on there journey through World War II.  I love the journey Christoph takes us through with this family and there heartbreak, triumph and &#34;luck.&#34;<br />The only part of the book I wish was different is the sub characters, there are so many of them and the author dives into each one of those characters history's as well.  With so much history going on in the story I wish those characters would have been a little quieter with there story.<br />I couldn't help but fall in love with Greta, Jonah, and even batty old Wilma.  Greta's calm and strong demeanor really proves how strong a woman had to be in those times.  Great story Christoph well told!

B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|I have to admit, the felt bag put me off. The name itself kinda doesn't lead to you the game, as a man. However I gave the game a try. If not a bit begrudging. I mean come on the game's name is Love Letter.<br /><br />Play is simple in this four player game. The cards are shuffled, a card burned out of the deck, and one card dealt to all players. Players on their turn draw a card and play one of the two cards in their hands.<br /><br />Cards have effects on players.<br /><br />Guards allow you to call a player out on having a specific card, and they must discard it if they have it. Priests allow you to see another player's hands. Barons allow you to compare the cards with another player, players with the lower card value discards their card. Hand Maidens make you safe from being attacked. Princes force a player to discard their hand and draw back up. Kings make you trade hands with a player. Countesses must be discarded if you hold a Prince or a King, and Princesses cause you to automatically lose the game if you discard it.<br /><br />If you ever discard the card in your hand (without redrawing) then you are out of the game. If more then one player lasts till the deck can not be drawn from, the player with the highest card value wins the round and gets a favor point.<br /><br />First to four favor points wins the game.<br /><br />WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME:<br /><br />I really like the five Guard cards in the deck. It can make the game a little dangerous, but also you can rest easy when they are all spent.<br /><br />I also like how the game specifically is helping you count cards. It shows you on the turn play card how many of which cards are in the game. Then players play cards out in front of them as they discard so anyone can see them.<br /><br />WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME:<br /><br />I hate getting the king as the last card from the deck, and having to then trade the highest card &#34;The Princess&#34; because it's my only option, and therefore losing the game.<br /><br />WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR?<br /><br />This is a pretty fast paced, easy to understand game for four players. If you ever forget, or have any problems, just look to the turn order card and you know exactly what you are to do.<br /><br />For these reasons this game is designed for beginner games, for easy pick up. It can be a bit boring and a play every once in a while for a serious gamer, but worth at least checking out.<br /><br />RATING!<br />5.9 out of 8. It's fun, but it's simple, with no real factor but luck and minor strategy, so I don't feel the urge to play it. I would play it though if offered.

B0029VUV70|5.0|What is the power of written word? Like most good films, this asks more questions than it answers.<br /><br />Hanna is illiterate.  During the war, she was SS. She was one of six women who locked three hundred people in a church during the war, and burned them alive.  One of these victims survived and wrote a book. Twenty years after the war, Hanna was given life in prison when the other five women received four years each. She accepted the greater punishment because she was too embarrassed to admit she was illiterate. She spent 20 years in prison, never married or had a child.<br /><br />Michael read to her.  Michael taught her how to read.<br /><br />The film explores whether the crime is forgivable? Can survivors forgive? Can Michael forgive? Did Hanna deserve the greater punishment she received? To what degree can we forgive someone who does not know what they do because they cannot read or write? Is it an explanation or an excuse for her actions? Are human crimes ever forgivable? Is &#34;wartime&#34; an excuse? Is forgiveness what makes us human? Hanna could not forgive herself after she learned how to read and realized what she was responsible for.  For her, responsibility was everything. She could not accept responsibility until she could read and understand...and then she did. Is this justice?<br /><br />I myself am the only child of a WW2 holocaust orphan. My father, as a young boy of 17, arrived in Chicago before my five aunts, uncles and two grandparents were taken to the same camp Michael walks through in one of the scenes of the film. Perhaps I am alone now because of what SS did over sixty years ago. My relatives don't know me. Too much time has passed. Too many generations in between. Yet I feel no anger toward the character of Hanna.<br /><br />Can I forgive? Perhaps by contributing to literacy, we forgive a little.  It's not absolution. That, like the survivor says in the film, is not forthcoming. But illiteracy can be cured by reading, by learning how to read. And that's a start toward healing. With understanding comes healing. Forgiveness perhaps is down the road a bit from healing.<br /><br />In a strange way, Hanna is every girl who wants to hear a bedtime story.  And do we not all do this now when we point, click or push the button to start a film? We ask the universe, please, tell me a story. And we attend, we listen. Until we ourselves become the new story.how to read. And that's a start toward healing. With understanding comes healing.

B0070Y46UY|1.0|I never managed to connect to the main character. He remained pale lifeless and constructed  throughout the whole book, to an extend, that I really couldn't care less about his faith. However the philosophical aspect is packaged clever enough. He almost had me there. Yes we are yearning for something else besides this material world with its institutionalized religions. Yann Martel is not the first mediocre minus author that earns himself a golden nose riding on that wave.<br />So while this might not be the worst of its genre I am still mildly ashamed that I worked my way through, believing in a perverted obligation to like it, just because it somehow pretends to be spiritual when it is actually just an empty, shallow waste of time.<br /><br />Ps after I learned that Martel is a PLAGIARIZER I would be withdrawing another star if I only could!

006202406X|1.0|I was looking forward to this book with much anticipation. From the first moment I started reading and realized it was written as a two voice dialog I was not impressed. Why change at the end of a series what had worked so well to begin with?  Not only were the characters indistinguishable from each other, but the character of Tobias was completely transformed into a whiney insecure baby. The \\"big\\" reveal of what was beyond the fence was equally as disappointing. Keeping the series within the confines of the factions would have been a better alternative.  I cannot  recommend this series to anyone no matter how good the first two books were. I'm not sure if I will even watch the movie.  There were numerous other things that disappointed me about this book, but other reviewers have covered them more adequately than I ever could. I also have to say that I'm not sure if I will ever read another book that Veronica Roth has written.  She has let her readers down on so many levels and quite possibly ruined her writing career.

B00C5R8364|5.0|Peel away the thin veneer of our comfortable ordered existence to reveal a dark underworld of bad actors who mix power, ideology or religous passion with ammunition. A world where trained professionals in the military and intelligence fields stalk these actors in the shadows in order to keep them from our doorstep. Few novelists are as skilled as Frederick Forsyth in negotiating this dark landscape and its associated states of nature. With his latest novel, The Kill List, the author spins yet another trademark yarn of espionage, murder and deceit, one that will have readers racing to the end and wishing for more.<br /><br />With the Cold War having faded into history, and the KGB only a dim memory, writers in the global espionage genre are faced with a unique challenge. Where will the next stories about the heroic battle of good versus evil come from? After having mined the international drug trade in his last novel, comes now a new look at the scourge of global Islamic terrorism, a topic Forsyth probes with the same level of panache he demonstrated with Soviet adventurism and reprobate Nazi SS officers. Once again, Forsyth summons an otherwise anonymous military figure into action against powerful, evil forces half a world away. Drawing upon his training as an RAF fighter pilot, Forsyth spins his story with his almost encyclopedic knowledge of military tactics and intelligence-gathering practices which readers recognize and enjoy about Forsyth. Better yet, unlike, say, Clancy, the author renders his stories accessible on a human level even if you're not a military enthusiast or veteran of uniform service.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I was a late arrival to Forsyth. A former roomate left a dog eared copy of The Fourth Protocol laying around my apartment after vacating (thank you! Jack). The year was 1986 and the author was well into his collection of acclaimed novels. Protocol changed that for me. I was pulled into the Forsyth wake with the author's story of a tension-filled race to foil a staged atomic explosion on British soil. In Protocol, Forsyth also invited us to contemplate the cruel hoax that was the Soviet economic system. An insight that turned out to be quite prescient. After Protocol, I worked my way through his back catalogue and have followed him ever since. His knowledge of the spy game and military strategy and tactics is well documented. His command of the broad sweep of history is well appreciated. Above all, his ability to spin a crackling great story of twists and turns across continents and nations makes his books exceptional. He is one of the finest writers in this genre if not the finest.<br /><br />Forsyth does not equivocate or wring hands in his tales of good and evil. He casts his characters squarely on either side of the line with an unwavering moral compass. Readers will not be challenged to understand who the bad guys are, which is important in this genre of storytelling, as Kill List hurdles toward its gripping conclusion.<br /><br />The author also reminds us - refreshingly - that the uniform military is not a social welfare or humanitarian relief agency, notwithstanding recent recruiting ads on American television showing the U.S. Army delivering relief supplies in the manner of a latter day Red Cross. In Forsyth's telling, soldiers breach borders, shoot bad guys and break things, and they do it with alarming efficiency and crisp discipline - at least at the elite special forces level. But might never makes right Forsyth's world, and this understanding that military authority flows from legitmate political and even moral authority keeps his stories from spinning out of orbit. He keeps his characters grounded, centered and keenly aware of their limitations, and the permutations of political decision-making as well. This is unlike lesser novelists in this genre who spin comic book fantasies populated with cardboard action heroes (are you listening, Baldacci?).<br /><br />Perhaps the best measureof Forsyth's strength as a novelist is just how poorly his nuanced and textured stories have fared when adapted to the big screen (with perhaps Day of The Jackal the one notable exception). I doubt seriously we will ever see The Kill List on the local mall octoplex anytime soon. Perhaps just as well. Even though he gives voice to Islamic scholars who poignantly rebuke those who would pervert one of the world's great religions, Forsyth's portrayal of murderous radical Islam is uncompromising and unwavering. Readers will be reminded in quite graphic terms precisely what western civilization is up against. Readers will also be reminded to strike 'visit Somalia' from their travel bucket list.<br /><br />Forsyth is getting up there in years and fans don't know how many more novels he has in him. Here's to hoping for many more. The world of books and literature is a poorer place every day Frederick Forsyth is not writing.
B00GI13VYW|5.0|The much awaited second album from Jake Bugg delivers one of those rare CDs that's good from beginning to end! Jake has an unusual, but entrancing voice and his guitar playing is wonderful!

B00BWQW73E|4.0|Good business strategy book. Lots to learn from the scaling of Amazon story which wasn't easy or fast. Bezos always focused on providing the best price and order experience for the customer at the cost of business partners and providing work/life balance for employees. I found it interesting to read about the development of the Kindle in terms of releasing a minimal viable hardware product that made it easy to download & read books. Nothing else mattered, even appealing gadget design. Also Mackenzie Bezos' review made me want to read this book more not less.

B00BAXFECK|4.0|A bit long winded, a few too many descriptions of the after effects of drug and alcohol abuse, but interesting well fleshed characters. .Hobie, a wonderful old Curiosity Shop kind of gentleman, who is Theo's substitute father and benefactor. Boris,Theo's best friend and accomplice in crime, another orphan, a crazy out of control mixed up kid, a contemporary Artful Dodger. Many fascinating details about antique restoration, New York Upper East side society, the seamy side of Las Vegas, how family and art affects our lives and so much more.<br />Theo Decker, whose adolescence and rise to maturity is the main subject of the novel,  is an interesting combination of Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye and of course Pip in Great Expectations. His mother is killed in a bomb explosion at the Metropolitan Museum, and he suffers from an unrequited love for Pippa, a red haired girl who was also involved in the same incident.  The book is well written and holds your attention, the final chapters set in Amsterdam just go on a bit too long.  Ms. Tartt could have done with a stricter editor.  Overall I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to actually seeing The Goldfinch, the eponymous Dutch Old Master painting which is the touchstone of Theo's life and currently and apparently quite coincidentally on loan to the Frick Museum in New York.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Love the game. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that in the final chapter it kept crashing so finishing was VERY frustrating. The gameplay itself though was awesome

The finish is flashy and will wear off quickly, this knife is great for chopping wood im sure it can do most things a camp axe could. It arrived before delivery date and was very sharp. after processing enough wood for a small fire the edge was farly worn but i didn't hold back on this thing, theres no need, its about a quarter of an inch thick. I got it for it's ergonomics but unfortunately it does not fit my had at all but i still love it. sheath is ok but beware it DULLS THE KNIFE.

0316055433|5.0|This is the type of book that I didn't want to end.  Donna Tartt opens a door to her main character young Theo's thoughts, feelings and world, and that world is so real that I lived Theo's life wth him -- for good or for bad.  Often, I know a book is a book when I'm reading it and am critiquing it in my mind as I turn the pages, but the best books are different:  they are like holodecks in  sci-fi movies -- I am present with the characters (happy along with them and frightened along with them) and not at all a separate person considering their ideas and actions until perhaps the very end when the last word is read.  That is what Dickens and other great novelists do for me.  So does Donna Tartt.  Also,  I suggest her first novel The Secret History, one of my all-time modern favorites.

A very powerful and emotional (but surprisingly light and humorous at times) book about growing up and accepting others and yourself. Highly recommended to all readers and story lovers!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The ages old tale of human conditions in a historically accurate setting, enhanced with intimately drawn characters who weave their lives into your heart and soul.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I have been waiting for it on kindle and it's finally here!!! This is a great game and I think everyone will love it!
B00BYCT3T2|2.0|Again the powers that be believe that we all will buy into a new format with almost the same sound as the discs we have purchased in the past, I have tried many of them SACD, DVD-A, DUAL DISC, SHM-CD, SUPERDISC etc.<br /><br /> And now comes Blu Ray Audio from Pure Sound. As you try to find information on these disc, you will note that there is a general statement that the program has up to 5.1 sound, but they are clear to stay away from saying which disc has which sound on it, I was going to order 5 of them from this wave but as I have been burned by some of the other formats, I only ordered one title and I am glad I only orderer one.<br /><br /> As I look at the back of the case to see what sound is on it they do there best to hide that it is only 2.0 sound, but BOLDLY point out &#34;ULTRA HIGH QUALITY AUDIO. This is my first and most likely will be the last one of the Pure Audio  / Blu Ray disc as most of the titles have all been released  and have remastered versions avilable.<br /><br /> Why pay these high prices forsuch a small upgrade, but if the disc had better than 2.0 sound I would buy more.<br /><br />  I now will monitor these just like I do SACD 's to see what is released in the future with MULTI-CHANNEL sound. unless I know for sure of the sound I will not buy another 2.0 disc.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am having a blast playing this game. The drawing and backgrounds are wonderful and have a lot of depth. Lots of waiting but there is not an actions bar to limit how much you can do in the game. 5 stars.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Well written. Interesting stories. History is good. Descriptions bring to mind the area and the cathedral which I visited several years ago.
B00F88U4J6|1.0|There are better apps for looking at Epubs. I stopped using this app and started using Aldiko. It doesn't lag like Moon Reader.
1400069807|5.0|If you want to know why you are struggling with your weight.  If you would like to know why you have massive mood swings.  If you would like to know what to do to have a healthier, happier, longer life that is full of more energy and less illness, then you want to read this book.  Fantastically written, easy to understand for anyone.
B00FP1NNJY|2.0|a culture is made up of a thousand tiny ideas, phrases, songs, habits, words that weave themselves together into a mosaic of everything we know and think to be normal. This is why NO, I will not ¨lighten up, it is just a song¨. I believe that it is important for a thousand voices to speak up about a thousand tiny things in order to create change.<br /> I think we are in a day and age where we can all have fun and party responsibly, and music shouldn't have to debase women to be popular. I really worry about the idea that partying till you cant even remember what you did is a good idea, while spreading a really strange idea that somehow, a guy who cant remember ANYTHING about the night before will somehow remember the random tramp who took his anonymous dna donation while she was so drunk she also cant remember anything. girls you can have so much more than that. dont settle for being a dna dump at a random party. love yourself. treat yourself right. demand that others also do so. and for the love of all, dont support artists who are helping create a new generation of misogynstic, patriarchal, dubious consent culture.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|In my opinion this book wasn't as good as  the  first two books. It felt rushed and thrown together not to mention that I really wanted to see what Tris and Tobias could have been.  I had to force myself to finish it. I patiently waited for its release and I just felt so let down.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It's so fun you can feed him make him go to the bathroom you play mini  games to make him happy and at the end of day you put him in the bed just by turning off the light so thank u for reading this article about my talking tom it's kinda like a virtual cat you take care of in real life
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun but hard to gets can be a pain to get but there is loads of helpful ppl very addictive
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I wish all America could understand more about the members of our armed forces.  Unfortunately, the media and others have forgotten the lessons of Vietnam.  The government needs to tell the military the goals and then get out of their way and let them do their jobs.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing my horse everyday. It is really fun and exciting. I haven't found another game like it. Go  horses
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like the game because I like earning stuff like bow and arrows and torches. I also like watering the Apple tree. And getting water from the pond too.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I chose one star because I do like Patricia Cornwell, but, I hated this book. I feel she's lost her touch. I found it hard to stay interested in. Too much time spent STILL explaining the past and not enough time spent keeping the reader in suspense!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's typical Grisham to bild up the story, and make it beliveable. I'm not done yet but lokk forward to an surprise in the end.
B007EECSFA|5.0|There are some parts of the book that employ &#34;filler&#34;, which I always deplore, and I found the ending, while a surprise, to be unlikely.  What the original heroine of the novel does midway through the tale is very much out of character for her, and, too, one has to be prepared to switch to an alternate heroine at the end of the novel.  I consider both of these facts to work against the book's rating; however, it is a novel, so I grant the willing suspension of disbelief.  It held my interest sufficiently so that I read through to the end.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I LOVE IT!! I enjoy it a lot due to the challenge. I have been playing it for years and still enjoying it!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Very nice and love it, worth the money 100%, without power does great job, no more switching back and changing
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with a nexus 7 tablet....lots of more features in the netflix app...this seems to be google's best kept secret. It would be nice if they started opening up the development on this peace of hardware. Would love to have more options and start taking advantage of it more :)
B00C6Q6OAG|4.0|My niece loved it for her birthday. Any &#34;set&#34; of monster high dolls is worth it. Reasonable price for TWO dolls. Good deal.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It could have screen options and it would be a great buy. It is a very simple dvd. It could be better
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The plot is very good and the pace is extraordinary.  The only thing I would fault on this one is that the timing and the math on some details just don't add up.  Some things that supposedly take a day could not possibly happen in that short of time -- usually dealing with distances between objects and the time it takes to get there.  For instance, there is a hint that the main castle is up to 250 miles from the crater, yet the hero and friends walk there in an afternoon.  The hero and friends walk a perimeter patrol at night and get back to their base camp in plenty of time to go to sleep and then be aroused before dawn.  Walking nonchalantly, a person can walk about 20 miles in about 5 hours -- on a patrol, 5 miles in 5 hours would be doing good.  A mile for doing it for the first time would be more practical.  Those kinds of things distracted me from the reading, so I just adjusted the story timeline in my head.  I was reading in a start of a new week for every start of a new day and I was feeling much better about it.  The hero is supposed to also be 14 -- came across as about a 17 year old to me.  I can live with that -- he is just extra mature for his age.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Engaging...Denzel Washing  always good.<br />Fast passed. Not intellectually chanlling,<br />but worth a watch. Chill out with an &#34;intertaining&#34;<br />Move I would recommend
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I'm loving every minute of this app.  I am amazed by this game I'm addicted to this and the console versions.  The Wii u version is amazing!!!!!
0345525558|5.0|Such a sweet book.  My daughter has had it on constant checkout for the past six months, so we decided to finally buy it.  A beautiful, hope filled story.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|a little to short. definitely more aggressive than his other work. The tone of this album will shock some people. But, If you listen to some of the interviews he has given and understand his mind set, then it make sense.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book that was written for young adults and I am not a young adult!  It is a most enjoyable, informative book.  Grisham has truly filled a niche for educating the reader on many legal terms.  I have  recommended all the Theodore Boone books to many other readers.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So  I think that this game is fun and all ages would enjoy it over much so go out and buy it
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun game but it keeps freezing and crashing on my kindle and then makes me lose coins when I didn't even use them to play so that's not fair to deduct my coins because of a game crash when I didn't even start playing the game... plus I even bought some coins and some of them were lost because of game crashes so I won't buy anymore since it is not stable...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I got immersed in the peculiar world<br />couldn't put it down. totally captivating and memorable. I look forward to reading more books like this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's finally on kindle fire HD! Yay!!!!! I'm on level 22  but it's SO AWESOME I recommend this if you like matching games. It's fun for all too!
B00BXDOSXS|3.0|How do I use this app? I can't seemed to play my videos. Or network, or Netflix, face book pics
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|By brother always gets the update on time on his Iphone and on my Kindle Fire HD i never gets the updates so i would delete it if i could and since i dont get the updates and the updates are really cool!!! So if i dont get the updates, i am not playing the gsme
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie sits on the shelf right next to my copy of Rudolph and Charlie Brown. I watch it at least once a year. Hard to believe I've been doing so for almost 10 years (and I'm still in my 20s, so there are very few things I can say I've been doing consistently for that long)! Always witty but cute and it never gets old.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Best literal Bible for enjoyable reading<br /><br />Excellent App that does exactly what I need. The best literal Bible for enjoyable reading ever.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It's a lot better than watching them on line through your kindle fire but is keeps crashing whenever you turn it the other way when coming out of a video
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is fun and enjoyable , I liked the change from Farmvill the fact that the<br /> surrounding land had interest instead of flat space made me like it more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of it.  The sex was sometimes over the top for me but otherwise  a great read. Like most others, I fell in love with Christian.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book and great ending. It has a lot of exciting moments and you will never know what will happen, who will get killed, or who will be kidnapped.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game needs multiplayer so it can be more fun.I want multiplayer I don't know about the other people how they can play without multiplayer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game can be very challenging but is fun at the same time. Can't stop playing it. Hard to put it down for sure.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot.  There were changes, but that is going to happen in almost any adaptation.  What I really liked about Percy Jackson is that is actually made and appropriate for kids.  The movie is sincere, respectful and not constantly winking at adults.  At the same time, it is full of adventure and humor, fun to watch.  There is a little bit of a love story, but it is low key and innocent.  My son, a Percy Jackson fan, enjoyed the movie very much and was able to understand everything that happened.  Is it perfect? No.  But it is an enjoyable movie that bears repeated watching.
B00FKPQHMU|4.0|I have the wired version and love it for use with Solidworks and Sketchup. I recently picked up a Surface Pro 2 and when I saw a wireless solution I jumped right on it. Works just like the wired version, I don't notice any delay which was my biggest worry.<br /><br />I took one star off because I hate that I need to use a dongle this day in age when it could have been a Bluetooth device. Surface only has one USB port so it can be annoying to unplug this every time I need to plug something else in.<br /><br />With that being said... I would buy another if it came in bluetooth - or if a competitor made one I would certainly pick it up,<br /><br />Haven't used it had it long enough to need to charge it yet. Feels just as heavy as the wired version which is a MUST.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is addicting and I can never stop playing it.I never thought the game would be like this.It's basically levels ofcandy
B00FB029IU|2.0|Agree with cybernaught. Huge disappointment after spectacular debut album. Is this what happens when a promising British talent moves to America too soon ?<br />Who told him if wants the big money he has to become a rock band ? Do we really need another Bon Jovi ? What happened to the great acoustic guitar work of the first album, and as displayed on his PBS Front and Center performance ? Giving credit to his Rock abilities, where is Rock and Roll is Here to Stay,one of his very best songs ?<br />I was angry when I read the very negative review in The Guardian, before I received the album, but now having heard it, I agree with the review. Oh well, most hopes get dashed.<br />Tracks 4, 8, and 12 are, however, quite nice. Two ballads and one Country Western.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This is a very good game but it took forever to download so I give it 4 stars I need extra words shabby heh shenanigans  Bernanke
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading this story through the lead characters perspective.  Even though I had seen the movie twice, the book is so rich with detail and the main character's voice that I found myself incapable of putting it down.  I highly recommend this book even if you have seen the movie.
B00FQPHOPI|4.0|I agree with the post saying needs more respect. This was a solid movie and I didn't want my money back after watching.  The pace was consistent and the eye candy for the ladies is an added bonus.  Yes there appear to be heavy biblical themes but it was more than watchable.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Action from beginning to end, a lot of background on SM's planet of origin which I quite enjoyed. The beginning half of the film was all on krypton and was a fascinating story on its own. Lots of great special effects. This version left out all the growing up in Smallville and got right to the serious action. A great rental but I would not buy it as one will most likely enjoy this but once.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is excellently. I now have  space on my Kindle! Download was easy and it cleaned files I didn't know I had.<br />Thunderchild
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I'm fifteen and I like this game. It is fun for kids of any age if u are looking for a game for it little girl this is the one for u.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Nice follow up to his earlier book,  which takes place In the same town but 100 years earlier.  Author creates the 14 century in great detail , loved that part of the story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the first two books and my sister who read mockingjay before me said it was really hard to understand. The first time I read mockingjay there were lot  of details but when I read it the second it cleared it all up. These are definitely the best books ever!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great details and great to read before u watch TH movie<br />It's very very good for teens and many other people
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Enjoyable, quick read. Draws you in immediately with light hearted quips. Gets serious and hard to let go of. Unfortunate how children need so many means per day.
