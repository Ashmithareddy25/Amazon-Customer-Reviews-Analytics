B0095ZQ36G|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT book!  I would highly recommend this book especially those who love history, war, and suspense.  I loved it!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a awesome book because it has meaning to it.<br />The only meaning is it tells word's and the meaning.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app. allows me to read pdf books (of which I have many) on my Kindle Fire.  It also allows me to make notes and higlight areas of text.  Since some of my pdf books are rule books for games, I find these two functions very handy for typing in errata for sections of the rules that have changed or been corrected for typos, formatting errors, or misprints.  When reading a novel these functions come in handy for keeping track of bits of text that I want to analyze or quote.
B0063IH60K|2.0|You cannot  choose a winning game.  All games are random play.  I didn't like that.  And the cards were hard to read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've been using this application for about 2 months.  I find it to be generally accurate and easy to use.  I like the automatic updating it will do when I've got access to a WiFi network--though I do use my battery a bit faster with the updating function turned on.  Overall I'm quite pleased with it.
B001GLX74I|5.0|If you enjoy the 'Clone Wars' tv series then get the movie. The grandkids love it! (Granpa likes it too!)
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I loved the game for the week that it worked; it's fun and addicting and really it is easy to get away without spending money. After a few days there were annoying ads that slowed down the game and eventually it lost all of my progress and started over for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Recommended but don't get too attached.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you don't have any of the movies, or have DVD and wish to upgrade to Blu-Ray then this is a good deal (8 movies for $60 is only $7.50 per film, a good price for Blu-Ray. I didn't think the special features were that great, but the movies rock!

B000056QE5|1.0|Mary Poppins soundtrack was the BEST purchase I have made so far.<br />I bought it for my granddaughter's birthday because she loves Mary Poppins.<br />She can sing all the songs in the soundtrack and I love hearing her
B001HN697M|5.0|She loves this movie and I found for $3.99 at Amazon, so I snatched it up as part of the goodies she got for Christmas. I really enjoyed it too.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very long, yet very good book. Brings you back to a time when every political decision was the potential end of the world. A gripping story that mixes fiction with history and an unexpected love story.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters when it was first released and loved it. I had no idea that this movie would be the beginning of how movies were to be made in the future, regarding special effects and such. Of course, it may look cheesy by today's standards of effects, but you have to start somewhere!
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|Just plain fun to watch. Duran duran got their name from a line in the movie.  Jane Fonda  pulls off a tongue in cheek acting.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Just as we expected! Movies were included! This may be the best way ever to watch a tv series. No waiting! Awesome family show!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I got this for my phone.  It makes it so easy and I don't have to worry about missing any items.  I love it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading a book through a dogs eyes let alone how someone would write it.....I was wrong.  This was an amazing book.  I kept looking at my dog wondering if she thinks like this and really wants to talk.  I had been told by many people to read this book and I wasn't disapointed one bit.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Its amazing to be able to get this entire collection on blu-ray was extremely excited when i got it. Been waiting awhile for them to put it on blu-ray
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Pretty usual with DVD's to get exactly what you ordered, and that's exactly what you get with this. DVD's come original in package and play perfectly, I was surprised that this actually came with a small booklet with pictures from the filming of the entire trilogy which was sort of cool.
B008HK3XKO|1.0|This cover does NOT fit the Kindle Fire HD.  The case is too large.  The Kindle is NOT snug in case. There is about an inch excess space both height and width.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Tons of reviews of this already so I'll just skip the plot synopsis and get to my main points:<br /><br />As usual, the plot revolves around a group of late teens/early 20's college kids who listen to music that 15 year olds would be into but are in love with movies that 45 year olds would be into. hard to reconcile that, if you're even bothering with the plot. Said plot is paper thin, and involves a cool girl who is an awesome DJ losing some sort of bet with her strict Dad and being more or less forced to join an acapella club? Even as mindless musicals go this is pretty dumb<br /><br />All the song numbers are well done and I have no issue with them at all. Obviously most of the actors were chosen for their singing ability and not for their acting ability<br /><br />All the non-singing scenes are more or less ridiculous. So if you can tune those out you'll probably enjoy this, if not then not, i guess. Frequently a group of kids will walk for what must be 20 minutes to get to the perfect practice location, then sing literally the first 30 seconds of a pop tune, go \\"ok that was great (or terrible)!\\" and then they all leave. Just stuff like that<br /><br />If you don't mind that then whatever. I checked this movie out mostly because I like mash ups and because I like Elizabeth Banks, and the mash ups delivered while Elizabeth Banks basically serves no purpose at all in this film. Her entire part could have been cut and it wouldn't have mattered, at all.<br /><br />So anyway, those are my thoughts on it, more or less. Check it out if you really like songs, don't if you expect any plot or acting or character development or anything but songs.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|First book I have read on my kindle.  This story had so many secrets and twists and turns in the plot, I had no idea what would happen next.  I thought everything was coming together towards the end then yet another secret was revealed!  But all ended well in the end.  I loved the way story went back and forth within the lifetime of characters in war time and characters in the next generation and told from different characters' perspectives. Can't wait to read another of her books!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I'm hooked on Downton Abbey.  This is a very nice set, beautifully packaged in a slipcase with seasons 1 and 2.  I'm enjoying watching again before season 3 comes out on blu-ray in a few weeks. The cast is extremely talented, wonderful storyline and beautiful costumes and scenery...a real pleasure to watch with the family.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think it is a good. Game that helps the waiting for your time in line for your turn  . To come up.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|A pretty good read about Pete himself. Wish it had been a little more in depth about the other band members, but I guess that's why it's called a memoir
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This story revealed a part of French history that I was ignorant of! Switching between WW2 era and modern times and following the story of one family for generations of time helped pull the puzzle pieces together and showed the huge impact that Europe's treatment of Jewish families had in shaping European history. The characters were believable and it was easy to become a part of their lives.
0345529057|5.0|Best series I have read since Lord of the Rings. I can't wait to get to it when I am doing other things, and don't want to put it down when I am reading. Will definately buy the remaining books in the series as they are available. Highly recommended!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|My hubbie and I are big Susan Boyle fans.  Her voice brings healing and comfort, especially to my husband who is a very sick man.
0765325950|5.0|I think everyone had their own ideas of how this would all end, myself included. All I can say is WOW !! I was blown away page after page.... it was amazing. So many emotional scenes, so many things going on at once, so many characters we have come to love or hate being pushed to their limits.......... and then pushed some more !!!<br /><br />Like others I wish there was more post-battle follow up with all of the characters that survived. But that probably could have added another 400 pages !=)<br /><br />Thank you team Jordan for bringing his wonderful tale to an end for his fans.
B005LAII94|4.0|Great movie unexpectedly good best movie you will love it proof that a 3 way works lol I really like this movie highly recommended

B0061JPYX2|1.0|back to black is a good album. Not this one. It is very comercial. I put it in my player and could not listen to even one song in it's entirety.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Of course the acting is fantastic but it is also very interesting to see how Shakespeare fits in to this time period. Lots of funny cameos ie Robin Williams
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is fun and most the games are neat little time wasters. You need to play a game and reach a certain score to unlock the next game, so the app only starts with like 8 games but the scores are not too hard to reach and they give you so many points towards other games that you don't have a problem unlocking New ones.
B004F4HWPS|5.0|The &#34;Live Forever: The Stanley Theatre, Pittsburgh, PA, September 23, 1980 [2CD / 3LP] [Super Deluxe Edition]&#34; is a true gift for all of Bob Marley´s fans, a true treasure chest. Beautiful. A Must have.

1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander's tells of his near death experience clearly and passionately. By itself, his story is medically amazing and his powerful and vivid NDE is at least partially unique in that he has credentials that make you take a second look. The book is sometimes surprisingly personal, but complaints of too much detail can be forgiven for what the implications of his experience and writings mean for science and our understanding of the world.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|I've used it for about a month now and it's starting to get a little wobbly and has lost that &#34;newness&#34;  When I sit it up on a table or desk to watch something it slowly slowly slowly starts to sag.  It has to be almost vertical to not sag, however when it was new the screen would hold its place at virtually any angle.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|the level on the easy mode that is supposed to be easy its really hard and I never win. I just wish it was easier.it also gets boring. but its chess so it can get a little boring.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Violent. true. This movie was not widely released so didn't get the accolades it deserved.<br />Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Shia LeBoef, Tom Hardy give this movie star quality!<br />The true story paints an interesting picture of the &#34;wettest County&#34; in the country!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This show never gets old.  My wife could shoot me for watching these over and over again.  Great ensemble cast.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The characters in this book lack depth.  The plot (Is there one?) is a flat line.  Even the supposed eroticism of the sex scenes is lacking. I did not finish the book; I was totally turned off by it. This author has a best selling trilogy.  Perhaps she can take some writing lessons with her royalties.
B003521R6G|4.0|We watched the new and old version back to back.  I'd apparently only seen the G-rated (for the 80's) version of the 1984 movie.  There were a few surprises.<br />Of course there was Kevin Bacon in the first movie which enhances it.  I'd compare the new I-can't-dance sidekick well with the old one.  The bus race was exciting, but not plausible, unless the adults in the town were deaf, dumb, and blind.<br />Otherwise, the 1984 version was better for me because the critical music arrangements were just more stirring--more base and drive.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son found this game and now every member of our family that has a Kindle has the game and competes for high score in the house!  We even downloaded the game on our cell phones.  I am proud to currently have the high score at 189K, but I'm sure one of them will play it religiously until they beat me.  It is so addicting.  The only thing that gets me away from it is when my battery dies.  I have to limit the kids' time on it too, which means I can't play all the time in front of them either!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I will let you know how I feel after I watch this movie , I have hear a lot about this movie

B00APUQT7I|3.0|The plot was too predictable. (Oh, except for the climax),  but the antics of the characters holds to the Ice Age tradition.
B0019IB0II|4.0|There is still so much to know about the brain and the mind. I found this book interesting because the author is a scientist who was able to use her specialized knowledge about the brain to relate and tentatively explain what happened to her during a severe hemorrhage in her own brain and during her amazing recovery.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Probably best viewed during the Halloween season, this movie is a hoot. whoo, whoo whoo. I viewed this movie while down with the flu, it made me laugh and cough. Oh, and maybe leaky in the eyes.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|really action pact and lots of humor really liked it and would recommend any one who watched the first one to watch this one
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Heartwarming, dramatic, and a glimpse into a lifestyle from another world and time. I love it and eagerly await more episodes.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book brings a fabulous storyline and detail to life.  This is my second read read thru and I still can't get enough.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I've loved this film since I first saw it as a child.  Astaire and Crosby are perfect here and as many times as I've seen this it never bores me for a second.  How can anybody be bored by Bing singing White Christmas or Fred doing that 4th of July dance with the firecrackers.  Just a fabulous film.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It really helps me to let me know when I need to charge my Kindle Fire. I like it. It also tells me not only how much battery is left, but also the battery life when I use internet or music. Get it!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My dad had this game on his smart phone and I found my self asking him to play it all the time. I got my kindle fire for Christmas and my first app that I got was subway surfers! Its fun and I can't seem to out down! Get this app it is a well invested app that after all was free!!!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This isn't the best movie, the plot is nothing to brag about. But man, the cast of this movie is enough for 5 stars. I really liked some of the lines and the combinations of personalities.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|The Duchess War is a beautifully written book about the unlikely romance between a Duke and a woman without hope for her future. Especially a future with a man she loved.<br /><br />That's not to say that parts of it didn't frustrate the heck out of me.<br /><br />Robert, the Ninth Duke of Clermont, was simply trying to escape the crowds by hiding out in the library curtains when Minnie Pursling accidentally joins him. The scene is embarrassing for her on many levels but it was quite funny for me. Robert finds Minnie interesting. She hasn't a clue who he really is and calls him out on his \\"skulking\\". He is transfixed by her sultry voice and realizes there is much more to this woman hiding behind a mousy appearance and persona. And he's right.<br /><br />Robert is attempting to right all the wrongs perpetrated by his father. He is distributing flyers on the sly about worker's rights that are getting people all riled up. He also doesn't believe The House of Lords should have as much power as it does. And Minnie is on to him. She demands he cease his activities at once because they are putting her in danger. Minnie has spent a good part of her life hiding a painful secret and Robert's antics worry her more than she can let on. When he refuses to stop, she declares herself at war with him.<br /><br />What follows is an almost overly complicated but still lovely romance. The \\"overly\\" bit is the reason for my frustration. I enjoy character driven romances and this is one, don't get me wrong, but the road to love, happiness and forevermore was filled with too many obstacles and even an out of character move or two that caused me great distress. In the hands of probably any other romance writer, these plot moves would have been a deal breaker for me. Still, something always made me keep chugging along every time I was about to put it down unfinished; the witty banter, the interesting secondary characters, the clumsy and realistic sex, or the connection between Robert and Minnie. I'm glad I stuck with it because before it was over I actually got all teary eyed by the beauty of some of the final scenes. This so rarely happens because I'm a jaded, black hearted grouch when it comes to romances. So if you're anything like me and choose to pick this up and get so frustrated you want to quit I recommend you keep on going to the very end. I'm not going to lie and say I wish some things had happened differently and that the two had functioned as the \\"allies\\" they kept saying they wanted to be but I can't say skip it either because then you'll miss out on the really good stuff.<br /><br />Despite the plot complications, twists, betrayals and non-communication mucking things up I still very much enjoyed the characters of Minnie and Robert. In Minnie's presence Robert gets all fumbled up and says and does foolish things that charmed me. Both felt undeserving of love and were broken in different ways by their early years but together I thought they fit perfectly. They have faults, fears, phobias and insecurities that cause them to make some frustrating choices but they're not a hopeless mess because they also have big, forgiving hearts. I have to say all of this strife made them really work through their issues and work to stay together so when the book ends with an HEA I believed in it.nnie.

B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn never dissapoints with his storyline and characters.  As usual, it was great seeing Mitch Rapp in actions.  I totally recommend this book.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Yay!  Christian Bale as batman!  I think he does an awesome job!  Considering all of the violence in this movie, I still think it was well done.
159315724X|5.0|As a Darren Hardy junkie, I dove into his book just about as soon as it showed up at the front door.<br /><br />His focused, friendly, writing style, reveals the true \\"secret\\" of success; his million-dollar advice and ideas, make the book incredibly practical.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Sorry, but that was pretty disgusting....not something I would want to watch again, let alone pay to watch.  Too much cussing and stupid behavior for me!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I've chosen to rate the movie, not the digital copy. I haven't used any of the other ultraviolet codes for other movies I own; I simply ignore them. On the movie itself, as I said its my favorite of the eight.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This was enlightening! Really different.  I like the setting and all of the different people and how they interacted with one another.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|First of all, I love Kiss.  I think they are the greatest band ever.  BUT!, I don't love this CD.  I have read many of these reviews, and many of the people with negative comments, I think missed what was wrong.  I don't think Kiss should hang it up, nor do I think this CD is all garbage.  I think the reason there are so many negative comments about this CD is.... THE PRODUCTION!  It is horrible.  I gave this CD 2 stars, and I really want people to realize what is wrong with this CD before they spend their hard earned money on it.  The best review I read on it was one by Bobby.  He seems to be the only one who understands what's wrong with this CD of all these reviews.  These songs have some great potential to be HEAVY, hard rock jewels, but they sound is terrible.  I feel the best way to describe it is to say, \\"If these songs were recorded in the 60's with 60's equipment, they could be made great if re-recorded and re-produced by someone in the 2010's.  Sadly, it was recorded now, and sounds the quality of an early Beatles, or other 60's recording, but not just that, some other things done in the production make it even worse.  As Bobby said in his review, \\"the guitars sound flat with no punch,\\" and the edge is taken off so many licks through the songs, that sometimes you can't even hear the rhythm of the song.  That is the part that is supposed to PUNCH!  It is if they deadened all the parts of the guitar that is supposed to scream!  If these songs were recorded and produced by a modern heavy rock producer, this CD could be a real MONSTER, but with this production it is as weak musically  as a mid 60's pop album. I can only imagine some of these tunes such as Wall of Sound, or The Devil is Me with the hit of a Nickelback riff done with modern recording equipment!  What if?....  With a better quality of recording and production this CD would have everyone from your Metallica fans to your Aerosmith fans screaming, \\"WOW!, that is one heavy rocking CD!\\", but the production of this CD the way it is now will make them laugh and say their band's old stuff is more rockin than this weak, and flat sounding album.  Such a shame to have a CD with such great potential be such a huge miss because of it's production.  For the fans of other bands that are jealous of Kiss, this one's for you.  You have never had a Kiss CD make it any easier for you to make fun of them and claim your band's stuff is better and more rockin.  For the Kiss fan, this is your most frustrating CD release, because it could really rock had it been better produced.  I guess all you can hope for is for is that the original tracks were digitally recorded on some better equipment and will be re-mixed and re-produced and re-released as a truly heavy rock album someday.  Sadly to say, then it won't be new, and no one will care except for the Kiss fan (like me), but I can't wait!  I hope it happens one day.  It truly could be good.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love the music on this soundtrack. It takes me on an emotional journey. Jackman performs a lovely original song entitled \\"Suddenly\\". This song fills me with hope. Crowe makes me believe that he is a conflicted and tormented person with the song \\"Javert's Suicide\\". I love the violin playing on this song. Samantha Barks performs the \\"On My Own\\". This song is about loving someone who does not return the same feelings.Even though this song is performed by a woman, I can relate to the words of this song. \\"Master Of The House\\" is the one happy song.  There is a sense of levity and humor in Sacha Baron Cohen's voice that I find enjoyable.I like the accordion playing on this song. \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" is a somber tune about lamenting the death and loss of friends. I can feel the sadness in Eddie Redmayne's voice on this tune. Anne Hathaway gives an equally moving performance with the song \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\".  All of the actors and actresses do a superb job of singing. The music on this soundtrack is excellent.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|After watching the second movie (The Dark Knight) in this series, my reaction was, &#34;this is the best Batman movie ever made.&#34;  Now I must say, &#34;The Dark Knight Rises is the best Batman movie ever made.&#34;  While I wish there were more installments in the series, DKR brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />If you have not seen the first two, I strongly recommend that you not watch this one until you have seen both of the other two.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Of all the recent series I have watched American Horror Story is by far one of the most unique and well done. Every episode is full of twists and turns that will leave you with more questions than answers and waiting to watch the next episode. The constant sense of anxiety and confusion it puts you through is an experience and delivered excellently. It is not so much a horror show but a drama-- it tells an elaborate story through the cast and the scary aspects are an added bonus. I have recommended this to many friends and have watched it with friends, it's excellent and I loved every episode.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What a fitting end to a great, dark, complicated trilogy. I can't say enough about Christopher Nolan's vision of the world of Batman. I only wish they were going to continue it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love period pieces.  I'm in season two, catching up so I can watch season three.  It's a nice break.  Doesn't work so well on my computer, but works great on my Amazon streamer on the ipad.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is based on a true story that happened in another country. I loved the movie but it broke my heart. It did end well though. I recommend it highly but I don't think it is for children.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but not as much as Matched. The ending does make me want to read the next book in the series. The idea of the Rising reminds me of The Hunger Games.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Abercrombie managed to integrate the sense of a boundless Western frontier into an epic fantasy world without seeming jarring. There has always been a touch of western to Abercrombie's other work, IMO, and the classic revenge journey really works with these characters and this world.<br /><br />All in all, great book. It's not the best book set in the world of the First Law, but it's a worthy entry in the series. Can't wait for the next one.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I liked everything about the book.  I could't put it down until the end.  Every time when there is something in the newspaper about his company I wan't to know about it.  It would be nice if it had more photo's.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the HBO series before I read this book. It totally helps you picture the characters and hear their voices.  The series follows the books almost exactly.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd Is Good.The Movie looks Like Its Straight From A Comic Book.I Like this more than the original.Two Thumbs Up.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|You gotta read the previous books to keep up with the storyline, loved it! I'm already on book four and almost done with that one too!
B00005KARK|5.0|This is what the 3 year old wanted for Christmas. I have not viewed it....but I am sure she loved it.
0061537969|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.!  Enjoyed it so much I bought it for my daughter.  Highly reccomend it for anyone who needs a pick me up.
B0099114WO|3.0|Was nor really crazy ofver this movie.....but got good reviews. Will most likely sell for someone else to view. Some humor.
0765325950|5.0|tying up threads going back 23 years and introducing a few ingenious new elements; this is a fitting end to the greatest fantasy epic ever written.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My headline speaks for itself.  I've read many military books written from combat vets, and this is one of the best.  Mr. Owen doesn't bore you with bureaucratic/political details of DEVGRU, he talks about the nitty-gritty details of his amazing and heroic life.  I will admit that I was skeptical that this book would expose military secrets but it seems not to have done so.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I think this is the best one yet.Josh Brolin could be Tommy Lee's son.......This one is great and maybe there will be another one.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I watched this movie online through Amazon Instant video by myself before letting my 13 year old daughter watch it. I admit I am kind of strict with what I allow her to watch, and even some PG-13 movies can be a little over the top for my taste. However, I was so happy to find that this was NOT the case with Pitch Perfect. I'm not going to bother going into a plot recap since so many others have done that. But if you are looking for a movie for your teen or tween, this is a good pick.<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" language is pretty minimal. I don't believe the \\"f bomb\\" was used at all. There are some comments about one of the girls being a lesbian, and some sexual innuendos. No nudity at all, or sex scenes. There isn't even making out sessions. (A kiss at the end).<br /><br />There is teen partying/drinking shown. They are in college after all. No drug use shown.<br /><br />The singing is AMAZING. I thought all of the kids in the movie were incredibly talented, and they manage to completely make acapella \\"cool\\" and fun to watch.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a clean, fun movie about singing. My daughter absolutely LOVED it (we watched together after I watched first), and we are now buying the DVD. She plans to have a \\"Pitch Perfect\\" sleepover party with all of her friends who want to see it too.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So addicting and so fun!  Easy to download and play.  Lots of games for hours of fun.  A great app for my Kindle Fire.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I raced through season 1 and 2 but couldn't wait and had to purchase episodes 1 and 2 of season 3 best $3.98 I've spent on entertainment so far this year.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I enjoyed the series when it was on TV. Now I can enjoy watching it anytime I want a good laugh. Great product, great service.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I really enjoyed this film although there wasn't much talk about it at the time of release it is definitely worth seeing and I will no doubt watch it again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book kept me awake almost all night. It mixes a divided futurist country, a rebellion and and the deepest thoughts and fears Katniss has... And a Capitol that will make the unthinkable happen to stop her, mentally and physically, of leading a revolution...
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Okay, the acting is not the best, but this team is getting better with every movie. If you have children, you will love it!
B009329ZF2|4.0|this is an awesome movie. it has a lot of great actors and is overall just an awesome movie. !!!!
034580404X|3.0|The book was just okay.  I do a lot of reading and I guess I was disappointed in the writing of the story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it makes school so much more easy and this makes my homework much more easy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (:
B007IYWY3C|4.0|The video quality on the DVD is disapponting -- I had hoped for a higher-resolution recording, with better surround, I think.  It's more grainy than I had wished.  The concert is amazing, though.  I saw this originally as an HD show on TV, and hoped that this would mirror that recording.  Can't help but be a little disappointed by the recording quality...
B007LL81UW|5.0|Attached to back of truck - holds light firmly and looks great.  Easy install and great quality.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a secure mount.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story in the third book is totally unexpected, including the end, but it is still a great story! Like I said on the review of the second book, I totally recommend this Trilogy!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very addictive game. l can not stop playing this game. Perfect to waste time while waiting for something.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The beginning is a little boring, but once he begins the adventure, it is very exciting and interesting! It is not on my top ten list, but it is a nice read. Recommended for teens and young adults.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book... great ending & such a tear jerker. Cannot wait for the movie in February! This book is definitely one you'll remember.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was as excited as when I read the first book of the Hunger Games Trilogy! The whole story is very thrilling! Once you start reading it, it's hard to let go of the book. I totally recommend this Trilogy!
B008J05EL8|1.0|OfficeSuite Font package did not work when initially installed with OfficeSuite(non-Pro). Upgraded to OfficeSuitePro and it was no longer required. A refund for the app was made which is appreciated. There may be an issue in installing this app and users may need assistance if this is the case.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Twists and turns but not up to expectations. Grisham admitted research of facts was not a priority. Speed of publishing was more important?
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a wonderful app. It works great!  If you like having your weather report personalized, this one will do the trick.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very interesting and held my interest.  I like books from which I learn something about our national interests, current defense technology, hostile forces in other countries, and spies (CIA included, if facts presented are to be believed).  This story will not let you down.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|The unrated version is definitely very risque.  A simple, funny movie concept that is just done right.  Seth MacFarlane is a comedy genius and with the acting skills of Mark Wahlberg and his ability to completely take the piss out of himself, this movie is laugh out loud funny.  Very rude in places and nothing beats the fight scene between Ted and Marky Mark.  A must watch for adults.
0740748475|5.0|Who can't relate to either Calvin, Hobbes, parents, babysitter, neighbor, or teacher?  The creativity through which nuances of childhood is spot on.  The quality of the binding in the harbound edition is excellent.  Needless to say multiple hands have been grabbing these books off the shelf and they are sturdy enough to take the high volume of browsing.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I don't understand this game what so ever. What's the objective? Why am I crafting these things? Very confusing controls and disorienting. I guess I don't have enough time in one sitting to figure out why I'm wandering aimlessly digging and crafting things.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is an amazing CD and I'm so glad it came with the AutoRip and I could listen to it immediately, As a whole it's just great and I can't stop listening to it, every song on it is a good song so i never skip any of them and just leave it on repeat. Their sound is a little folky but it also has this mystical almost magical feel to it. Great vocals, lyrics and music this group just has a really great sound. I love listening to it all the time of course but especially when I'm writing it's inspiring. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone, I literally haven't listened to anything else since I bought this it's that good. Seriously buy it. It's totally worth it.
1451696191|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is probably one of my favorites. Literally couldn't put it down. Started 5 o'clock one night and didn't stop until 12:30 in the morning. Then waited the agonizing 6 hours in school to finish it. Pick it up and don't stop reading.
0547391005|5.0|I loved this book and bought it for my 4 year old nephew. He is learning to love it also!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I absolutely love love love KIK........now it just needs to be made available on the kindle fire and it would be Perfection!!!!!  It is one of the fastest most reliable texting apps I have ever used internationally.  I will give it 5++++++ stars as soon as it is made available on the fire.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I loved reading this book, i felt that Riordan brought all the main characters together perfectly. the story didnt feel like it was rushing to the end but it didnt feel like it was getting away from the main plot too much. I feel that anyone who enjoys the heroes of olympus will enjoy this book.
B00005JKZV|5.0|great movie loved it and will always think they are better then harry potter. cant wait for the hobbits to come out.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this book like 12 times and it rocks<br />I love it :)<br />It's awesome<br />I can't find a way to put it in words
B00006CXSS|5.0|this serious is great im waiting to buy the pacific but i loved this when i first saw it on hbo go.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Hearing specialist don't prefer in ear buds and these are very convenient without going into the ear.  Also very light and comfortable
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show!! Always on the edge of my seat! They aren't afraid to take chances with this show- never predictable!
B003JJA59K|5.0|was believable ~ the acting was great ~ I would watch it again ~ not for people that are worried for the end of man kind
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! I am truly speechless and have no idea where to even begin except to say. WTF!! This story took me on the ride of my life. The twists and turns were like driving down a winding road in the darkness of night unable to see the next bend in the road. And, when I thought the road would veer right, it veered left. The unexpected connections of the characters in this story were penned with such skill and sensitivity, my mind is still spinning.<br /><br />Hoover, literally, breathed life into Sky and Holder. I felt every heartfelt emotion and experienced every painful revelation. The story unfolded effortlessly with each page turned.. Stunningly, beautifully written ... A love story like no other from the imagination and courage of an author who was willing to take a chance and write about a truth too scary to contemplate. An ugly truth that many of us go through life blissfully ignorant of. In the end, the soulful and painstakingly difficult healing of Sky and Holder resonates. Truly and incredible story.<br /><br />Without a doubt, read this book and let your heart be moved.... <3
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A brilliant story.  Truth  isn't necessarily  found in fact alone. Such is the power of metaphor. Richard Parker may be in all of our lives.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Can't beat the price paid for this. It is only the blue ray DVD&#60; but that is all we watch so it didn't matter.
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|This toy said it was for 5yrs. and older, it is far too difficult for any 5yr. old! A 10yr. old would have trouble doing it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  The only reason I give a 4 star instead of 5 is because of typos/editing errors in the middle of the book.  Completely forgivable for a self-published book, but there none the less.  I'm looking forward to Walking Disaster.  I have been stalking the author's website for teaser of Travis's POV.
B0058YPL66|5.0|What happens after the \\"happily ever after\\"? Also what really happened between \\"Once upon a time\\" and \\"The End\\"? This is a shows that takes place after the Evil Queen brings a curse, to destroy her step daughter's (Snow White) happiness, along with all that are in the land. It also includes, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood and her Granny, and others. The curse brings them to our land and they loose their memory. It also goes back and retells the stories of our beloved fairy tales. It is a very interesting series, and a great hit.
B004289ZW0|3.0|This GPS device works. but the BlueTooth linking is tenuous (it drops off a lot) the battery life is marginal - 1-2 hours at most and the GPS has to have an almost perfectly clear sky view to work.  It's usable, but not nearly as good as the build-in GPS in the iPAD 2.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series. It wisks you off to a different time and place and that is so lovely in this day and age!
B001USHRCK|5.0|My 14 year old nephew got this from me for christmas this year. He was thrilled beyond belief. I never knew that he had wanted this for 3 years. He put it together for the rest of the day and into the night. I must say that it was super impressive!
B005F3XV62|5.0|Kevin James was outstanding in this movie.  Even in its almost cartoonish manner there were a serious lessons in life to learn.  And certainly more real than most people want to admit. And I will be hard pressed to ever go to the zoo again without wondering what the animals are really thinking.  I doubt if many other actors could have pulled this movie up to the level of enjoyment for me than Kevin James. his funny dry humor was a natural compliment to the hilarious story line. His co stars and all the animals did a good job too.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I am 61 as of last October 3, 2012 and I totally love this CD. I think/hope they have their second CD coming out in March. I will be watching the Amazon site for it. They have a very unique sound and are true artists and musicians. I also have found one can find and do just about anything on the AMAZON site!  Thank You
B0085A9J18|1.0|My nephew, who if 58yrs old asked me to get this DVD for him....I watched it one nite before giving it to him.<br />In my time I have enjoyed Bruce Lee, marshal arts.......Never had a problem sleeping. I watched this dvd and with all the<br />violence,shooting.......the marshal arts in this film were too violent........The actors doing the marshal arts are good.....but was overdone.......I could not sleep that nite.....i kept seeing the violent images.  I am a 74 yr old lady......i am sorry to put this dvd down......but in my time i have seen all types of movies I am not a prude......but this is not a movie for young children.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Could not put it down.  Can't wait for the movie.<br />This is a wonderful book for a woman who is starting over.  It can be so scary when you end a relationship and are completely starting your life over, new place to live, new town, new friends.  After reading this book you have to believe that it can be done, will not always be easy, but alot of the time life ends up being better than before.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run kindle fire is a very good game for my daughter... she plays it every day and a fun game for her
B008MBXFEM|2.0|The track \\"The Fire Rises\\" doesn't have chanting of any kind. I was a little bit disappointed but the song is still enjoyable even without the chanting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I thought this  game was relaxing and fun it can become<br />guite  addictive though and before you know it a hour has<br /> gone .
0399160450|5.0|being a Clancy fan and having read most of his books, truly enjoy the pace and story development of real time history and possible events..I guess the time is approaching for new characters and new situations....Must say looking behind the curtain of governments is a mind opener to real events that occur today...
B0094BB4TW|3.0|If you have a page on Facebook it will not let you see your news feed or post on other people's wall as the page. Also it only shows 10 posts on your news feed!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who couldn't be happier. she is a big taylor swift fan and wanted this for Christmas
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Just as amazing as the first series, the absolute best horror series ever. I love this show and Evan Peters he never fails!
140053271X|1.0|I only used it a few times because the screen marks the words hard to see. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I thought this was going to be a really funny movie but it isn't all that funny of corse there are funny scenes but humor is not the bulk of this movie but it actually does have a good story line and i enjoyed it.
030758836X|3.0|I wanted to love this book - written by a local gal who (claims) to sip whiskey at my favorite Chicago Scottish bar.  At first I enjoyed 'Gone Girl' - the first half of the book really chugs along, ending on a climax which makes you eagerly begin the second half ... which then lets you down with a big THUD.<br /><br />'Gone Girl' has an interesting story (with many, many plot holes), and I applaud the author's ability to maintain the male/female voices consistently throughout the book. That said, the plot is ridiculous.  I am usually able to suspend my disbelief for a good story, but not this one.  It is so completely difficult to believe that (no spoilers here) anyone could pull off any of the feats presented.  The author justifies the characters' motivations but I just didn't buy it.<br /><br />The ending (as many reviewers are complaining about) is yet another \\"twist\\" which completely goes against your expectation of a character.  I didn't really mind that, but it fell flat.  It made me feel like I'd wasted my time reading the book, because (possible spoiler) we end right back where we began.<br /><br />Summary: If you don't have anything better to read, knock yourself out and read 'Gone Girl'.  If you're a James Patterson type of reader, then you'll probably eat this up.  If you're looking for something that will leave you feeling a bit more satiated, then look elsewhere.
B007704HO6|5.0|Brilliant!  Lovely story, couldn't put it down.  Recommend this to cat fanciers as well as anyone who knows a musician or has one in the family.  An open and honest look at life on the streets of London and the drug rehabilitation process and how one fuzzy feline made all the difference in the world.  Miracles do happen sometimes.
1439152799|4.0|If this had been my first Kate Morton novel, I'm not sure I'd come back for more.  But since it's my third, I'll stick with her because I simply adored \\"The House at Riverton\\" and \\"The Forgotten Garden\\".  I didn't like this one as well as those, although it's a good, solid book.  I found there to be so many threads I had a hard time keeping track of the tapestry.  It mostly ties up neatly at the end and the omniscient reader gets the whole story, while the participants see only parts.  I was a little bugged that Edie's brother, Daniel, wasn't a little more explained when he kept being mentioned, but most of the loose ends were explained.  I liked the way writing and words were at the heart of the novel and how their impact was different on each character. Writing was a major theme of the book and the characters were interesting and compelling, but it just wasn't as totally awesome as the other novels.
B005LAIISU|3.0|this is not as good as earlier films in the series but not nearly as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.  yes there is some mild cartoon violence from slightly mean and scary creatures but don't most animated shows have some bad guys.  nice saturday night movie when you don't want a deep philosophical drama
B000SEI230|5.0|Love it!! I could read this over and over. Such  a romantic book. The movie was good but I would prefer to read the book
B00633W614|1.0|I love historical fiction, James Michener being an all time favorite.  This book references history in South Africa but that's about all.  The characters are flat and one dimensional.  I was bored by page 60.
B009X01FJS|5.0|The instructions are great and it was easy to install my Kindle Fire.  I love the fact that I can 'swivel' my Kindle Fire in different directions.  The case is very sturdy and appealing to the eye.
0345803507|5.0|I have read all three of the Fifty Shades books and they are a great series.  Will keep you up late not wanting to put it down.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|All Reacher novels are good reads.  Some are better than others.  This one is.  WORTH DYING FOR is even better.
B0000CNY27|5.0|It was a surprise to have received the deluxe edition;) I wasn't expecting it at all, thought it was just going to be the movie and that's it, but i got the movie and so much more. It arrived in great condition. I look to do future business with this seller again. I was very pleased with my purchase~
B0053KWDES|5.0|all i can say is WOW this little bad boy packs some serious punch i was expecting some volume increase but holy sh?? this bad boy on my rooted galaxy s3 with voodoo mod and my fav bose headphones is seriosly loud and super clear with great frequency response from lows to highs if u love ur music loud this is a great thing to have im very pleased and highly recommend this little bad boy GET ONE
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of my new favorites. It's real. It's well written. You'll fall in love with the characters and walk away with new quotes about love and live that you will remember forever.<br /><br />GO READ!!
B0074AGVWK|4.0|This was an entertaining, quick read that was quite easy to identify with, as i expect many other women would also.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It is great for kids or nostalgic adults. Roald Dahl is always a pleasure, but this is one of his best.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I love Tim Burton's macabre sense of humor, and that isn't missing in this film. Sparky and Victor are lovable, believable characters. It's a fun story that will keep you engaged. The editing is interesting, sound effects are excellent and the visuals are great.<br /><br />I'm not sure all angles of the story were as developed as they could've been - and I miss the quirky song stylings of the &#34;Nightmare Before Christmas,&#34; but overall I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Poorly written, and largely uninteresting. I have no idea what all the fuss is about. I didn't expect outstanding literature, but this storyline is beyond pathetic. Don't waste your time or money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't want to put it down - and didn't!  I hope the story continues. Going to look for my next rental while I still have prime.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book has been very helpful. It has helped me prepare my next story for publication on Amazon for Kindle.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Engrossing novel that kept me entertained until the very end.  I have recommended it to friends.  An easy read on Kindle.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|its really cool and you can mix and match with other legos. I would love a bigger set with mora animals, but for a baby this is just fine.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|Loved the cast, but there was something about the storyline that couldn't keep me engaged. Maybe it was the complexity and I wasn't looking for that when I watched it. Dunno. All I can say is that I made it through and wouldn't watch it again.
B003E88TKS|4.0|This is one of those movies that I like for a number of little reasons. That means that overall, it's just my opinion of the movie and may not apply to others. But the idea of living life completely free is the topic that intrigues me in this movie. To be free, does that necessarily mean living life solo, or would that actually hold you back from experiencing true freedom? There is a brief scene with nudity and a lot of swearing, so I don't recommend this for children.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Had heard about Ellie Goulding earlier but didn't really *know* her sound. Listening to this album has been a lot of fun, a la other Brit electronica music. Glad that I bought it and plan on enjoying Ellie's music going forward.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This is a movie that people in my age group (early-mid 20's) should always love. In my opinion, so be gentle, this video is from the glory days of the NBA. Love it!
B007FH9GT2|4.0|This movie version of the book has Hollywood stamped all over it. Better looking actors, better quips, smoother look. Love Daniel Craig and could totally see how he is a charismatic journalist. (Scandinavian guy not so much.) Missed a bit of edge and roughness of the novel, which as a bit too cool and not raw enough in the movie. But overall, still a great film.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Fun movie,very entertaining . Great addition to the Men In Black series. Brolin as a young Tommy Lee Jones was spot on!
B0062LU85S|3.0|LIke the previous Twilight movies, am not watching this for the great acting or CGI. It's really more of an exercise about how is the movie different from the books, and how will Bella finally look in her vampire incarnation. Mildly entertaining and am interested to see how part 2 winds everything up.
1449410243|5.0|Great little book. Sturdy, and omg, the hilarity! So true about cats---theyre crazy and everything that the book describes is so believable! ;-) If you love cats, this IS the book for you!
B0088TG252|3.0|While I was expecting the usual fighting, shooting and chasing in any thriller movie. This one was more than I usually like to see. More like Kill Bill, than any Bourne movie. If you're OK with that kind of thing, the acting was good and the plot interesting. If not, skip this one.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|You might think you have a dysfunctional family, but it's nothing like Camille`s.  Camille is a reporter that has gone bad home to bring justice to a town grieving.  Her mother, Adora never liked her so staying in her house makes things uncomfortable.  Camille half sister makes life miserable for her and people she calls friends. Despite being the perfect mother to the perfect daughter,Amma, they both keep secrets.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Usually don't like sequels to animation movies. (Toy Story is one notable exception.) But I enjoyed this one. It was nice to see the tapping move on to another generation, set to song. If you want to have a happy night, Happy Feet will do it.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Great item! Got it just in time for the holidays! I will do more shopping like this in the future!
B0081KTI0E|3.0|i don't mind a slightly creepy movie, but this was too much for me. Also didn't find Daniel Radcliffe convincing as a father or problem solver in this movie. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down. I loved every bit of it. The characters are amazing and it had a wonderful story.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|On occasion, I wind up liking things that everyone else pans. I was hoping that this was that kind of exception. No such luck. Good thing I was doing other things while I was watching the movie, so my time wasn't completely wasted.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|lovedloved it it's amazing cool cool great great great hours of fun sick cool bro tutu ish love amazingggggg love for choreographer horses
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|The storyline couldn't keep me engages, and I love these sort of fantastical stories. The execution of the special effects didn't help things any....
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy is just like any other kid.  He is one of the most enjoyable, loveable, relatable, and human characters I've ever encountered in a novel.  Sure he's half god, but that doesn't stop you from relating with him.  He's that kid inside of every one of us interacting with a difficult and unjust world.  He says and does the things we all wish we would, but we are too frightened to say, think, or even do those things.  I'm an adult, but I admire Percy...I wish I could be brave like him, resilient like him, and FUNNY like him.  Percy is a humble hero, a hero that has been told all his life that he is a troublemaker, a punk, and a failure.  But power and value can be found in the little things, in the ones we expect so little from.  Round of applause for Percy Jackson.  If I were a middle school teacher, I would have my students read this.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|Love Charlize Theron and the roles that she has chosen, including this one. She definitely reflected bits of myself, which was sort of uncomfortable in some ways, but a needed wake up call. Strangely, I started much self-introspection after scoffing at the character throughout the movie. We all need a movie like this, every once in a while.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a funny ,good ,awesome book I'm hope their are more DIARY OF A WIN BY KID thank you for the book
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This is a remake that hit all the right spots. Johah Hill and Channing Tatum worked off each other well. The storyline was plausible, and the script funny. Definitely recommend.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I'm only 11 and I live in 2013 so I didn't understand most of the language. It was a very hard book which is what I wanted. Most books at this level are slow moving but with all the adventures sometimes I had trouble putting it down.
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|with her &#34;when the pawn....&#34; album, I realized that I'm not the the deep type of person who can get all of her music, but at least I found a few tracks that i really got into. I'm still looking for that on this album. have only listened to it a couple of time, and think I'll need a couple more to figure out how I feel about this one.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Classic Demille wit and sarcasm. I enjoyed the appearance of Paul Brenner and knew the two would make a great team.
B007HJ91HU|3.0|The update was good in some ways, but I only found myself wishing for the version that I grew up, which seems rougher around the edges. This version was a bit too produced/smooth, from the movie to the soundtrack. Great for a fun night where you don't want to expend too much brain power.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i like that it shows how long you have left todo something before the battery dies as well as how much longer till the charge is complete
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Was expecting a bit more excitement in this movie, a la The Fast and The Furious, but nada. It's a decent movie to pass the time, but don't expect too much.
B0022Y570K|5.0|Don't know what else to day.  Great album, great linup of songs. Also downloaded Beyond Hell / Above Heaven. Great!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Disclaimer: I tend to like books better than the movie versions of the story. I like the dark cinematography and the salient point of the book made it into the movie. (Love to think of Lincoln as an a**-kicking vampire killer.) But had a hard time getting into this. Couldn't put my finger on why. If you're looking for a fun movie that won't strain your brain too much, this might be good. But if you want to figure out fact from fiction, go for the book.
B004A1Y4UM|5.0|Don't know what else to day.  Great album, great linup of songs. Also downloaded Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood. Great!
B007AMMHSY|5.0|Maybe I missed the clues, but I loved the twists in this story. It's a bit of a sick story but absolutely fascinating. Would definitely a well-made movie that works your brain.
B006T3RM08|1.0|Some reviewers indicated the track pad click issue has been resolved but it hasn't been. I emailed Henge and was sent a copy of their troubleshooting guide which tells the user to \\"smooth out the lip.\\"<br /><br />I have sanded the lip a bit which worked initially but installing the keyboard added enough pressure to set me back to square one. I'm going to have to be a bit aggressive with removing plastic and if that doesn't work it's going back.<br /><br />The customer shouldn't have to modify it. If you're not willing to do so, get something else.
B0080OK7YC|4.0|i like that the music of glee is evolving over time, but unfortunately, it's evolving for the most part away from songs that I seem to find enjoyable. Per song, I've given fewer 4- and 5-stars to the songs on this album vs. older Glee soundtracks. But still enjoyed overall. However, I'm thinking about buying by the song for the next one...
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|This Is My Favorite Disney Movie. The Quality Of The Movie Was Amazing. Great Purchase :)<br />It Also Keeps Me And My Sister Occupied On Long Car Rides.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|I love the idea of these kinds of supernatural storylines, and was pleasantly surprised at how this movie was put together. I enjoyed the main characters's development, but the CGI in the end of the fighting could be better.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Story moves along between past and present which helps get a better understanding of the life of main character.  Interesting how author uses flowers to relate to specific personal feelings.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|was pleasantly surprised with this film. as an american, have a tendency to think of Santa Claus with an American accent. But the British slant worked well in this movie. (And better that than a Dutch-accent in English for Sinterklaus.) The family aspect works well in the frame of the gift-giving season. The only think I kept on wondering is what happens to the females of the family... If I ever watch this with my niece/daughter/friend's kids, I'm going to need to think of a good answer.....
B009GEFXLC|5.0|really like to show! Castle and Beckett are great for each other hope they will stay together for the whole season
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Until the movie comes out on DVD, this is the DVD to own if you are a Les Miz fan. Awesome singing, and great performances at the end. Wish I had been there!
B000000OS2|5.0|I love Tesla I can't get enough of them and this CD is awesome it came in great condition even the cover looked real good. Thanks for a great product.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I simply love this show and I am grateful that I have received this 7th season at a steal. I plan to enjoy it to the fullest.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This came in brand new and very quick especially around christmas. It was wrapped brand new and in mint condtion.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love that I can get HBO series (which are usually good) all in one sitting rather than paying Direct TV millions of dollars for a year of HBO, since it consists of mostly sucky old movies.  This series is awesome for anyone that likes this type of fantasy epic.  I also like the fact that it is very true to the book - that is always disappointing when they take too much license.  I am looking forward to purchasing season 2!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This was quickly deleivered and right around christmas I was so happy with the shipping and also the move was brand new you can't complain. However I have no watch it yet because this was a gift to my husband so when i do i will edit my review.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I can't resist the beautiful mansion and all its real and lavish decor. Neither can I resist judging the stiff upper class that has its problems simply by being upper class. The servants and their lives are suspenseful and far more interesting.  After the World War, however, life as the upper class knew it will never be the same again. The lower classes work for themselves and succeed in their own right, and the upper class has to scramble in order to survive.<br />I love the character of Maggie Smith. She is hilarious.
B004KKXMSI|3.0|I'm giving three stars solely on the playablity of the disc - the video quality is just what you'd expect from a Blu-Ray, and obviously the movies are awesome.<br /><br />I bought this because it's almost half of what you would pay at Best Buy; but for US buyers, be wary this may not play correctly in your Blu-Ray player. When I put it in my LG player, the background music/video of the menus kept playing and no menus showed up, so I couldn't play the movie. I didn't mess with it too much, maybe there was a way to get around it, but it DOES work is a Playstation 3. Just a fair warning.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|THE LITTLE GIRL MAKES THIS MOVIE . AND THOUGH IT'S DATED NOW AND FILMED AT A LESS COMPLICATED TIME IN LIFE, IT HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. THE STORY CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WORK OUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE, BUT IT'S WELL ACTED AND HAS ENOUGH OF THE ELEMENTS OF GOOD WILL TO BE ENJOYED EACH YEAR.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am totally hooked on this series.  Best I have watched in a very long time.<br />I am so glad that I decided to purchase this.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I give 5 stars because I can't seem to put the books down for long. I'm nearly finished. Every now and again I become obsessed with a book series, and this series has become one of my great obsessions. Why? I didn't know I'd care so much for the characters, but I do care, achingly so. They never fail to earn my sympathy, and even as brilliant as some seem, they never fail to disappoint. I love them for their flaws. They reach and they fall. I love them for their courage, and in some cases, heroism. Traditional fantasy elements are there, but not quite as I've seen them before. At times the author has pushed my limits of credulity, but not too far. I recommend this book series to those who like gritty fantasy with a consistent story and theme (and thus it's as plausible as fantasy can be), but you must be able to stomach graphic violence, gore, and cruelty. They're constant.
B004FOA84A|4.0|It's OK.  I haven't used it much.  But what I have done is OK. I'll need to use it some more before I'm sure.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a really good take along game is you have to wait at the doctor's office or waiting for grandkids to get out of school. It is worth the cost ($2,99) to have fun when there is a lot of waiting.
1444757202|5.0|This was a gift for my son.  But he did tell me it was a great book.  I'll read it when he gets done.  We like all of Grisham's books.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV series. I follow it faithfully.  And it's especally rewardin to watch the full episodes with zero commercials and uncut.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|Rome: The Complete Series.....Enjoyed the series and will definately purchase the next season. It was no &#34;John Adams&#34; or &#34;Shogun&#34; but was certainly entertaining and worth the price.
1400052181|5.0|My daugher & I read this book, we checked it out at our library.  So I bought it for my daughter to add to her library.  She hasn't read her own book yet.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|I watched it with my daughter, who I gave it to for Christmas.  It was wonderful, I saw the movie at the theater, but my daughter hadn't seen it.
B000022TSY|1.0|I am sure this movie had it's day and back in the time period it was filmed it was entertaining I suppose. I found it dull, and quite odd.. did not care for it , trash baggn it
0515142247|5.0|I loved the first book, The Killing Floor. I really loved this book - #2 in the series. I can't wait to work my way through the entire series.

1475143389|5.0|This is an excellent book. It's quite simple and the program is very effective. If you truly study and apply what the author states you will get results. There were times during the book where I was a little annoyed at what I perceived to be the author's arrogance and general attitude of \\"well this has worked for me so it will work for you.\\" Now with that said, everything he's said to do HAS WORKED! That's not to say that everything is perfect because it's not. There are some exercises that he recommends that I thought were a bit ineffective compared to other variations (for example I think the weighted swiss ball crunch targets the abdominal muscles much more effectively than the weighted cable crunch he recommends)and since you are doing a relatively low rep program you may want to consider doing a dynamic stretching program prior to your regular warm up sets. Again though whatever differences in opinions that I have with the author are few and far between since his program has done what it says it will do. As stated before this program works and works beautifully. I come from having used the Nate Green and Lou Schuler type programs of almost entirely compound movements on full body or two way split programs. While those programs gave me decent mass I truly didn't feel like I was ripped. This book and the author's methodology has increased both my mass and my definition to where people have told me there is a marked difference (my weight has also increased from 188lbs to 193lbs, and I'm only on the third week of the program). In fact my chest and shoulders look very different after Michael recommended that the reader get serious about the Incline Bench Press. I kind of scoffed after reading that. I mean I had done Incline Bench Presses before but the results weren't that great. Well this program has changed that. The author knows his stuff (and walks the walk as his photos show) and after he explains what to do it does appear to be a very simple process. Now I love bodyweight only exercise books (and will continue to read those books)and do perform a bodyweight cardio circuit about two times a week. But for my gym workouts there's only one book I really look to and that's this one. Buy it, read it, study it and GROW! Big ups to the author for writing a great, simple, and most importantly EFFECTIVE program for all of us out there that want to get bigger, leaner, and stronger.e bodyweight only exercise books (and will continue to read those books)and do perform a bodyweight cardio circuit about two times a week.

B0049VVE7Y|3.0|I approached The Walking Dead extremely excited by its rave reviews amongst my friends. &#34;Oh, you have to see it!&#34;, &#34;It's great!&#34; they chimed. I would ask why, but I'd get the rather terrible answer of, &#34;Oh, just watch it!&#34;<br /><br />As someone who generally enjoys a good round of zombies, I tried to think through why it could be so much more interesting to my friends than the typical zombie fair. I came to the conclusion that zombie films require so much time and energy to set up the backstory and tone that they have little left for the characters, leaving them as unfortunately shallow shells you don't care much about. While this is fine for a night of popcorn mashing, it doesn't leave a film as particularly memorable. However, given the episodic structure of a TV show, there's a lot of time to develop characters and make them into people you care about, making their interactions with zombies all the more enthralling.<br /><br />With this in mind, I eventually bit the bullet and decided to give it a go. I purchased and streamed each episode separately, constantly skeptical as to whether or not I would finish the whole season or not. Seeing as I made it to the end, that's a good start I suppose (although the cheap cliffhanger endings made that significantly easier).<br /><br />However, the journey was often times disappointing and frustrating. The show starts off the first few episodes with a stereotypically boring intro to set the peculiarities of this particular strain of zombies and characters. While the content of these episodes tended to be boring, they showed off a few emotional twists I've never seen before in a zombie film, making the show feel promising. Thus, I continued. As time moved on, however, I found that the characters remain shallow.<br /><br />In general, it seems as if the writers are trying to write for a short-attention spanned audience - the only characters that get developed in interesting ways are the ones who disappear from the show at the end of the episode (zombified or otherwise). I really had no issues throwing my uninitiated friends in to watch a single episode of the season (for comparison's sake, try doing that with Lost). In my opinion, this single-episode mentality really wastes the episodic format and ruins my hopes for the character development in the show. Worse yet, most of the time, the characters are hardly likeable - I often celebrated to myself when the most boring characters were uprooted from the show.<br /><br />That being said, as most zombie films, it was popcorn-munchingly decent. On the plus side, it still feels as though future seasons may hold potential - in fact, this season reminds me of the 20-minute exposition of a typical zombie movie: rather dull and boring (&#34;Haven't these characters seen a zombie movie before? Why do I have to watch their ignorance again?&#34;), but necessary for the fist-bump inducing follow up. By the end, the show's fat is trimmed and it seems perfect for a good roasting, provided the writers can get their act together.<br /><br />I would recommend The Walking Dead, Season 1, to zombie lovers who don't really have much else to do at the moment.<br /><br />(Summary)<br />Pros:<br />* Zombies<br />* Potential - episodic format has the ability to develop the characters in interesting ways<br />* Creates unique, although subtle, moments with zombies that plays with the emotional impact unlike other zombie films I've seen<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Shallow, unlikeable characters<br />* Feels like the boring exposition of every zombie flick
B000002J1U|5.0|Released in 1970, Zeppelin's third album received a lukewarm reception after the explosive impact of the sensational debut and follow-up.<br /><br />In retrospect we can now see `Zep 3' as a more mature release, with the band stretching out to embrace styles other than R&B, hard rock and blues. The developing writing partnership between Page & Plant, and the way the four gel at every level, comes through strongly. The storming opener `Immigrant Song' moves through more mellow rhythmic rockers `Friends' and `Celebration Day' to a powerful slow-paced blues number & perennial live-performance favourite `Since I've been loving You', & back to rockblast with `Out on the Tiles'.<br /><br />The latter part of the album (the second side of the original vinyl release) showcases a lot of acoustic numbers. The languid `Tangerine' with multi-tracked guitar work gives way to the sublime `That's the Way', Page's 12-string re-tuned to `open E' overlaid by tasteful slide guitar; and `Bron-y-Aur Stomp' forming the core of the band's acoustic interlude on stage through the 1970s. This side of Zeppelin really set them apart from other rock groups of the period by offering a more dynamically & stylistically varied musical palette.<br /><br />There's nothing remotely formulaic about this music. Each song is distinctive & special, with an individual character so strong they still sound fresh after 40 years and have rarely (if ever) been covered by other performers.<br /><br />The original gatefold vinyl album cover was a real work of art, glossy-white with dozens of small colour photo-images, some visible on a rotating wheel through holes cut in the sleeve - a 70s classic. You don't get this idiosyncratic feature on any of the CD releases.
0143119680|5.0|Very good story, started out just a bit slow for the first couple of pages, but the rest of the book was exciting!

B004Y042N8|4.0|I am so tired of seeing everyone bash the FAOTD, so I'm here to give an ACTUAL review.(or if you don't believe me, go to Google play and look at ALL the positive reviews there for this game)<br /><br />The game has a very simple interface, and after all the flashing lights and stuff on other games, it's a nice break. While I do wish there was maybe some nice relaxing music in the background, it comes in handy sometimes that it's quiet. I've started up this game in a boring class at university, when my husband has been sleeping, and even when I've been talking to that *one* customer on the phone that never stops talking, all without fear of being caught (though I always have my phone or tablet on silent when in class or at work.)<br /><br />There are only 2 permissions, and neither of them have any way off trying to steal your information, which is another VERY nice thing in today's day and age.<br /><br />So, overall, fun little time killer that there's no fear of it stealing your information. I only gave it 4 stars because I wish there was SOME kind of music and then the option to turn it on/off, but who knows! Maybe that will be in a future update :-)

B0055MBQOM|3.0|I used the colornunki for 2 plain 1080p Dell LCD monitors and it made both of them really really dim/dark.  Not as bright as they were originally (before the calibration).  I dont know if the room lighting made the difference or what.  But the screens were so dark that they hurt my eyes.  I increased my brightness but could only do so a little.  anyway, I now have 2 Samsung LED -that I love- and haven't used the Colormunki on them yet.  Too scared too.  If its an improvement I may update this review.
B000SEI230|5.0|I saw the movie so I kind of had a hint of what would happen at the end and after it became one of my favorite movies, I decided to buy the book.<br />  What I just read was magnificent and beautiful and nothing like I had suspected. I still cried my eyes out as I did with the movie. Nicholas Sparks is truly one amazing author who could create such a beautiful story that will blow your mind.<br />  This book will surely have you laughing with Landon, crying with Landon, and smiling with Landon. Amazing. Just amazing.

B000058USU|5.0|I confess that my top choice for a Missa Solemnis recording is the original instrument rendition conducted by Philippe Herreweghe on Harmonia Mundi. So much texture is brought to the fore, and there's both intimacy and grandeur in the performance. Still, if you are looking to sit enthralled at the base of a granite monument, nothing beats this version conducted by the legendary Otto Klemperer. I've been of two minds regarding his treatment of Beethoven -- liking most of his collaboration with Daniel Barenboim in the piano concertos but ultimately cooling to his interpretations of the symphonies -- but my reaction to this recording has never wavered from my initial reaction of wonder. In my view the best of the modern instrument renditions of the work, this truly is a recording not just of the past century but for the ages.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very fun. Mini games were challenging but not too frustrating, the graphics were awesome and the game play was smooth and story made sense (well as much as these kind of stories can!).
B0010358CQ|3.0|The first thing to note is that I'm a casual viewer of anime, so my comments will be more along the lines of reactions on an absolute scale rather than rating this work relative to a number of others. Indeed, I've not seen the first Appleseed film, so take that into account. In that absolute sense, I'd have to regard this film as both a joy and a bore to watch. The computer animation is very good most of the time. In some places, actually, it's marvelous while in others the motion is less convincing. The urban views and shots of  flying machines are truly stupendous. On the other hand, the plot was quite predictable, and the story too often seemed to be several combat scenes strung one after the other with some dialogue in between. And though those combat scenes were often reasonably effective, I found the climactic one extremely unconvincing. The character interactions struck me as a bit stiff, even for anime, and rather monotonous. So overall my reaction is mixed -- this film is nice for the eye but less so for the brain. It depends on which organ you're more in the mood to exercise.
B005T87QCI|3.0|It takes up a.lot of space. Its a great game abe worth everyyhing. I download it for the kids but they.didnt like it but I enjoyed it
B00005LOUP|4.0|I saw this in the theatre when it was first released about a decade ago and liked it then,  I also like the original cartoon classic with Boris Karloff narrating.  This is a well done screen adaptation of the Christmas classic.  Jim Carrey is wonderful as he captures the essence of The Grinch character.  Very enjoyable and fun to watch especially each Christmas season.
B008M721MS|5.0|I really love.it . But I hate that u have to pay for it. Why can't fun stuff be free. Make it free ill keep it. Very fun it worth it if u wanna pay for it. Im cheap love
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Good movie, nice scene, I like the artist and the music of this disc. I make smile one person I like :D
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|This is by far the best DC Animated Feature to date. One would think that successfully adapting one of the most beloved comics of all time would be impossible, given the period-specific nature of the plot and the overall depth of the narrative that needs to be covered in what amounts to three hours over the course of both films, but DC came into this with the intent to prove the disbelievers wrong and they did it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've been trying to finish this book for months and finally did. I'm a full time college student so there isn't much time to read for pleasure. I found all the characters interesting and look forward to reading the other books in the series , I just hope it doesn't take me as long. The subject matter is a lifestyle I'm not familiar with or one I'd like to experience personally. None the less I still continued on with the book and I'm curious what will happen to Ana and Christian.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If you want to entertain yourself with a great book, then get this book! It's funny, creative, and a great book to have.It's one of the best books in history!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Excellente saison elle est encore mieux que les précédentes.Excellents acteurs et excellent jeu de la part des acteurs de cette série. Je recommande vivement cette saison à tous les fans. Recommande ce vendeur.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I  love to play games by myself rather than with other people.I find this game deals too many loosing hands.I like to win at lest every once iin a while.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Katniss and Peeta survived the 74th Hunger Games and their victory, especially Katniss refusing to kill Peeta, has brought Capitol wrath upon them. With the 75th Hunger Games coming soon they will find themselves as mentors or so they think.<br />The 75th Hunger Games brings about special version of the games, The Quarter Quell. Every twenty-five years the quarter quell marks the anniversary of the games and the uprising and defeat of the districts. Special rules are put in place for these games. Highmick won the 2nd quarter quell were each district had to twice as many tributes.<br />Not saying any more than that, no spoilers. The writing is a great improvement over the first book but I really wish she would be more descriptive in certain sections. Some times things feel rushed and confusing that might find yourself rereading several pages again to understand what just happened. That is really what brought down the rating.<br />The writing did improve as I mentioned. The book moves along well, giving you slow, nothing is going to happen moments to get you of guard then gets you when you least expect it. Anyone who understands my title to this review will get what happens in this book.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Pure fun and makes you want to learn to read music so you don't need the notes falling from the top.  I only have the free version,but plan to buy the full one once I learn more,and I need to put on pc, instead of my kindle fire.  &quot;Love the app&quot;
B0091LS07E|5.0|I have followed AK since the first CD, not a big fan, but I love this CD and enjoyed the cuts.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Once you get used to it, it's more convenient and less annoying than Facebook on a browser.  I like it better than Facebook on IOS as well.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Very disappointing. I will not read the last two books. Too many characters and details that add nothing to the story. Loved the first four books.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not up to the standards of the version that comes with Windows.  Getting rid of the ads varies from ad to ad which is a nuisance.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have become a fan of Nicholas Sparks.  I look forward to reading more of his books and would recommend this one.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Loved it! I absolutely loved fifty shades and this is a great read too! Bit sassier though! Definitely worth the read, cant wait for book number 3 to come out!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Not disappointed.  Anxious to read all the Jack Reacher novels.  Tough to put down; but have to sleep some time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Like the way it looks and it enables me to connect the Kindle to my Mac and access material from the computer.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Had real good story. Just didn't like the ending the story started with and ending and then left story open at the end.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Some of the time I couldn't read fast enough, it was a real page turner, but I have to say I don't think it's as good as everyone who is raving about it.
0785163174|3.0|Thor Vs Emma Frost and he loses this guy is a joke he used to on of my favorites,but after Superman kicked his tail he been a loser ever since. Marvel just sold out most of Jack Kirby characters none of them can beat wolverine the hulk is weak the thing loses to colossus namor is awful, he got beaten under water all the avengers lose except Captain America who acts like a nazi this book is good from a vizual standpoint but i've read better indy comics in the past,i'm glad i didn't pay for individual issues or pay 75 dollars for this mess,it only deserves 3 stars because i got it on sale for less than half,otherwise zero stars.And Marvel stop saying \\"Avengers Assemble\\" on every other page we get it you made a movie.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|although it does have signs of being an older movie, that is one of the things that make it what it is. i don't belive i woul like it half as much if not in its original form.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Doesn't work.  Messed up my Kindle.  We went to Kindle support and they recognize that there is a problem, said it would probably correct itself in a few days.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As a parent, this book contains sex, drugs, date rape and all the things I wish I could protect my children from in the world.  Reality is, it exists and this book deals with it.  Thank you for opening up the conversation.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen in the past couple of years. I wish I could demand my money back. The acting, accents and overall story were terrible. Don't waste two hours watching this.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|amazing read.... starts with a bang and has a great story line would recommend this to all reacher fans and even non fans
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great book! We owe a lot to men who keep our country strong and free! I would recommend this book to any one who loves America.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The game is OK, but it is very irritating to have to watch a commercial if you want to play.
B000ROALCG|3.0|Why then buy dis? When the real Hector Lavoe's albums are still availiable. Plus , a big \\"minus\\" one star for letting Jlo sing on dis joint. Marc's a good singer, her, not so much.
B004TI5N38|2.0|A great deal of research went into this book, but not enough to make it come alive. Baldacci is clearly writing about things with which he has had no personal experience, producing a narrative that is drab, colorless. The plot is uninspired, the women mere cardboard cutouts, the intrigue stillborn, the writing choppy.
B001TODCII|4.0|This movie scared me and kept me glue to the screen. I have watched it 5 times now and still enjoy it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Very Clancy.  Quick read with all the right moves.  The Chinese make great villians (PRC and the triads). Very cyber smart. Even the old dogs can be painfully heroic.
0812993357|5.0|Grace Coddington is such a fascinating woman! I love her! I have to tell you a short story. I bought this for my Mother for Christmas. We had watched the DVD &#34;The September Issue&#34; several times and I wanted to learn more about Ms. Coddington. I was thrilled when I saw that she had written a book. I ordered the book and received it at my Mothers house ( that is where we all visit for the holidays). Mother opened it by mistake. Mother asked me if it was for my sister (who is a fashion/costume designer). I was so angry and told her it was for her for Christmas. She of course was thrilled. I read it before I wrapped it and then she read it after she unwrapped it. Ms. Coddington has had a wonderful life and I can't wait for the sequel to this book. I love her layouts and creativity in Vogue and always look forward to seeing what she does next. I highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so addictive one you get it you cant stop its so fun get it right now don't think just get it

B003O86FMW|3.0|Definitely not as good for me as the first book. I hope the third book is better. Seemed to skip ahead real quick to the games and leave a lot to question in the year between them.  The second half of the book was better and the suspense at the end was  great although it seemed a bit oddly expressed.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|This is a standard case for the kindle.  It doesn't offer as much protection as I would like but the color is great.  I think the price is a little too high for the quality.
0670020745|5.0|I placed the order for this book on the 5th of January and received it on the 9th.  I was a little disappointed that I did not receive the book until the 9th because when I made the purchase the details on the website indicated that I would receive it on the 8th if I used Prime, Two-Day shipping.  One day isn't a big deal but the reason that I pay for Prime is so I get the order in \\"Two Days.\\"<br /><br />That being said, The book arrived in excellent condition. It is a hard cover edition and the price was very reasonable, costing no more than a paper back copy from other sellers.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase and would buy from this seller again.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can you say about the Avengers movie?  This is great action and the blue ray is out of this world.
1439153663|3.0|This was a good book, but pretty unrelenting in bad events. Strong characters - good portrayal of life during slavery in the South.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|First time I ever read this author and Loved it  hoping for more!  I good not get enough of the reading!  PLease write more!
B00ANT9MZW|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow won an Oscar with \\"The Hurt Locker\\" and it seems she's either fascinated with the war on terror, just really good at making movies about the war on terror, or both. I'd have to go with both. The original focus of the film was supposed to be about the December 21st battle of Tora Bora, also a film about Usama Bin Laden. When they were about to begin filming, news broke of the successful raid of the Bin Laden compound in May of 2011. Bigelow immediately shelved her Tora Bora project and redirected her focus.<br /><br />In this review, I'm going to do a little bit of comparison between \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" and \\"Argo\\". They are completely different movies, but they are both historical and both are going to be mentioned a lot in the days and night leading up to Oscars. While both are factual accounts and both tried to be as accurate and true to the real events as possible, I found \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" to be a cut above \\"Argo\\" for one glaring reason. Bigelow did not rely on Hollywood gimmicks to ramp up tension; she allowed the real events of the story do that. Affleck, with \\"Argo\\", I think did.<br /><br />Bigelow cast an extremely talented and fearless actress in Jessica Chastain who has been absolutely on fire since breaking onto the scene. After making her film debut in \\"Jolene\\", she continued to `wow' casting agents and landed parts in big time films like \\"The Debt\\", \\"The Tree of Life\\", \\"The Help\\", \\"Lawless\\" and \\"Zero Dark\\" among others in just three years time. Now, she is the favorite to take home Oscar for this film, and you will see why. Chastain, had to be tough as nails and vulnerable as well in order to pull off Maya. Maya is a CIA agent who spent 12-years in the agency doing one thing, tracking Bin Laden and risking everything on a thin and muddled lead that she had found Bin Laden's currier.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is not only incredibly accurate, it is an important piece of filmmaking that makes you question many things. The torture tactics that were used were important to finding Bin Laden, but also those tactics mixed with kindness may have played an even bigger part. The film also shows how incredibly complex and difficult it is to navigate the terror networks and as much as everybody likes to paint a yes and a no, a wrong and a right on everything done or to be done, there is nothing definitive in the war on terror.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a fantastic film that I have no doubts will make Oscar voting very difficult this year and will certainly make voting for Best Actress very difficult as well. It is an important movie about history and an inside look at the intelligence battles that our agents are fighting everyday to keep us safe.that were used were important to finding Bin Laden, but also those tactics mixed with kindness may have played an even bigger part.

0375851569|4.0|I bought this set for my son who's 3. I love the original Cat & Hat stories and this collection has them all...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down.  I can't wait to read the next one.  I have to collect the series.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|The special effects were fantastic!  I really like both the female lead actresses and enjoyed the performance by the man who played the &#34;Huntsman&#34;.<br />It was exciting and kept my interest all through the movie.  Too bad there wouldn't be a sequel.
B0000064TT|5.0|This was the first Dixie Dregs Album (dating myself now) that I ever owned, and it is still my favorite. Steve Morse gives a stellar performance and the band is incredibly tight. In this album more than any other, the music is more important than the ability to astound with their talent. If you are a fan of jazz fusion, country, or straight ahead rock, you will find it here. While this is a familiar formula for the Dregs, it is put to best use here. From &#34; Take it off the Top&#34; to &#34;Night Meets Light&#34;, it is a thoroughly enjoyable listen.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I've read a lot of the big name popular romance books out this year (Beautiful Disaster, Gabriels Inferno, Fifty Shades series...) and I must say this was my least favorite of all the books. Why? Because I just didn't like the plotline. The two main characters were so aggressively impulsive, rediculously immature and incredibly co-dependent. They drove me completely crazy (in a bad way). I finished the book because I dont beleive in writting a review without finishing but I had to force myself to keep reading at a couple points in the book.<br /><br />The romance part of this book was strange and boring. I dont think a sex scene necesarily makes a book but if the book is about romance then by god make it romantic. I found their couplings completely odd. All this build up over someone having their V card only to have this blaise interaction. Another major thing that drove me crazy were the substories about why the characters were the way they were (both were jadded and had daddy issues). I just didn't find the stories beleivable or relatable. I think there was poor plot development and actions by both characters came across really random to me. This just wasn't my cup of tea.
6305922756|1.0|This is without question the worst movie I bought in 2012. I was and still am still star struck by the talent and music culture of the 50's/60's/70's/80's. This movie is as far removed from any vestige of that culture and talent as you would be able to place it - unadulterated junk!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Normally I am too lazy to write a review, but seriously for the price of this book the advice compels me to write. Her tips are actual ones I feel like I could follow. I like how the writing is simple and to the point. She also uses experiences from her own life to illustrate points she is trying to make. Awesome x10! Just buy it already!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|So funny! I live fat Amy. She makes the movie. Watch it when ever you need a good laugh. Hilarious
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|ok I couldntnstop playing this game for hours but when I went to get an animal. for my zoo intransigent out on gas tank but its th best game EVER!!!!!!
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|A great product easy to use and set up.  While the buttons arent recognized by some emulators they will still function.  Very portable small enough to fit in a pant pocket.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy set up and sync<br />- Rechargeable battery!<br />- Dual joysticks and shoulder buttons<br />- Came with carrying case and cell phone/tablet stand<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Too small for people with big hands<br />- Charge cable is too short (does work with other usb cables)<br />- Buttons feel mushy
B002ZG97LK|4.0|This Footloose is a good movie, but nothing compares to the original with Kevin Bacon. There is a good soundtrack to this one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charlie has such an honest nature. Absolutely amazing book in more ways than one. great quick read. No regrets. Glad I read it before seeing the movie.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|These movies just get better and better. Each year the students learn more and more and each story line is unique.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm actually not very good at this game. My reflexes are not what they use to be and one needs fast reflexes for this one. That being said, my husband and 9 year old daughter are very good at this game. I have to make my daughter put it down . She loves it!!!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Harry Potter has learned a lot over the years and it just keeps going. All these movies keep your attention.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a member of the military I am proud of this book and all that it stands for. Excellent would be my word to sum it up!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Deathly Hallows part 1 set up a whole new year for the students of Hogwarts. Watching them grow thru the years makes it even better.

0345803507|5.0|This series started out with me wondering if I really wanted to read this first book, but I stayed with them and discovered a well written, some mistique, and a very sincere, deep love story.  Thank you,

B004QX07G4|1.0|I didn't know you could publish a book that was this bad. It's just Ellen stream of conscienceness. It's just her very sarcastic bad jokes over and over. Regret buying this book.

0525952926|5.0|I bought the book for my father. I actually listened to the book on the iPod- audible.com- which counts as reading. Splendid as usual. Thank you Ken Follett.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beyond the most influential and inspiring book I've read in my life. Ever. I hope to someday find a guy like Augustus. Love this book. So incredible. Words just can't do it justice.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The angry birds game is fun and challenging.  I play it almost every day and sometimes I cant put it down.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I haven't read a book cover to cover in 2 weeks time in many years. This book was riveting to say the least. This had so much real battlefield action you would think the book was fiction. I had seen Chris Kyle on tv on some talk-show and I was impressed by what I saw. The History Channel or something like that did a re-created scenario of one of his ops in Ramhadi, Iraq where he took out must have been a dozen bad guys ( they had their AK's and RPG)
B002BWP49C|4.0|Not quite as good as the first three movies! It still was wotrh watching as my wife and I have watched the others at least six times each.
0345803485|5.0|Could not put down Vol. 1 till finished.  Vol. 2 was less captivating.  Vol. 3 was a great ending, but, indicating a definite need for a follow-up to be written from Chris's point of view.  .
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't know how else to say it, I love this book so much, it's my favorite book, it's just so amazing I'm gonna see the movie, but I'm sure it won't compare to this, I wish I could rate more than five stars
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Only real struggle we had with this game was that we were all familiar with another game 'DOS' and we confused ourselves somewhat.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a fun game if u like to be challenged :) this game has more upgrades then before
B00A7CF1QY|1.0|The prior movies had a story that had a plot that unfolded and in some fashion mostly wrapped up but left an option for additional, this one is a character study, building a foundation for other installments.  Objective is clearly to share some back story and create all sorts of options for additional stories, but this one is a snoozer if you are looking for the same caliber as the priors.  Well acted by Renner, Weisz, and Norton, just not much to the story.
B00122OCJ0|5.0|Well what can I say other then I really like this music, I recommend it and know you like it just as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved everything about this book!  It was from the heart! Powerful and healing process of his journey of healing

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderful book! I would recommend it to all of my friends as a must read for all.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first of the Jack Reacher series that I have read (and I assume it is the first in the series anyway from the title.) Excellent book. The typical super hero type of guy who is extremely logical, strong yet can be tender, blah, blah, blah; but I truly enjoyed every moment of the read. It kept me wanting more. I will continue with the Jack Reacher series.
B009PMB3CI|3.0|It's ok, my five-year old is the only one who plays it and it's a little hard for her to navigate. There are some fun little tasks to do but it does get very repetitive over time.
B00006AW2P|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. This is where it all starts. On this record you get the best example of what was the reason this band got noticed and got signed and took off. These are many of the songs that built the Stones reputation in England in 1963. I like to pull this album to settle debates. See, my argument has always been that bad bands do not have careers that last - in fact, bad bands don't go far at all. And good bands are pretty damn good right from the start - or certainly by the time that the general public becomes aware of them. By the time they started cutting records, the Rolling Stones were already very good. I offer as proof their version of \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\" - the incredible tempo, the guitar chop, the vocal, the harp, the whole nine. And then there is \\"Route 66\\" - and the boys just smoke it. Then you have got \\"Can I Get a Witness\\"  and  \\"Walking the Dog\\", with Brian's slinky sounding guitar work, followed by Keith's Berryesque runs. These kids could play. And they were that at this point - kids. And when you listen to these albums I think it is important to keep in mind - because I think it helps seal the argument - that they generally are recording these songs live to tape, and they typically only did 3, 4 or 5 takes. No label was wasting good money on expensive studio time on an unproven product. Labels made albums as quickly and as inexpensively as possible and that meant that the band had better walk into that studio ready to record and knock it out. There weren't endless overdub sessions and separate vocal sessions. You weren't given 12 opportunities to get the guitar solo right. You couldn't disappear into a booth for half the day. There was none of that. You had to pull it off - and you had to pull it off while everyone else is blowing and going too. You had better not screw the take if everybody else pulled off their part. That is peer pressure! And albums had to sell too before you would get a chance to record another. Albums weren't released \\"Platinum\\", and they weren't released \\"Gold\\". Albums weren't recorded - let alone released - unless there was a single that proved people were at least interested. It is hard for anyone to imagine that today where this crap that passes for music is shipped platinum before anyone has even heard it or bought it. I don't know this for a fact, but chances are that this was recorded in a few days. This is the band you would have seen live in 1963 and early '64 - stepped out right onto your turntable (at the time), and onto your iPod (today). Just listen to \\"I'm a King Bee\\"  or  \\"Carol\\" - if you heard those songs being pulled off live in a bar today like they are being pulled off live on this recording then you would be blown away and telling everyone about this amazing group of kids just knocking it out - just killing it. You'd be telling everybody about the band you just saw. And that is exactly what happened.ms weren't released \\"Platinum\\", and they weren't released \\"Gold\\".

B005OCFGTO|3.0|It's great to have such an economical choice to get all the movies in one box, but I found that each disc tends to freeze at times in various places (it will freeze one time playing on one track.  Another playing it freezes on another track).  And once it freezes everything is frozen.  I had to eject the disc and reload to get it playing again.  Sometimes they freeze multiple times.  Sigh.  Otherwise the quality is good.  I would have loved some features that meant something as well.
0525951652|5.0|I enjoy history for its own sake, but this book, the 1st of a trilogy, brings history alive for the period it covers.  I read it a second time when the 2nd book became available to maintain continuity.
1400052181|5.0|I work with researchers and a disadvantaged population and found this book extremely interesting.  So well researched, so well written.  One of the most memorable books I've read in a long time.  (I gave it out as a Christmas present to my colleagues who hadn't read it.)
B001AOKA3W|1.0|Stupidest movie I've seen in a long time. Characters were shallow and unlikable, situations involving real-life things (medical conditions, etc.) totally implausible, had the potential to be a good movie and failed miserably. Don't waste your money or the hours of your life you'll never get back. Cinematography gave me a headache, didn't add any suspense to the story, just really annoying.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I thought this looked like a fun easy &#34;zone out&#34; game.  It fit that description - just save those babies! (addicting)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Hello,<br />AM so satisfied for this purchase . I love this bag, It can carry everything you need for your dslr camera.<br /><br />I LOVE IT SO HARDLY.<br /><br />Many thanks to amazon for this amazing affordable items .<br /><br />I LOVE AMAZON
B0045XICB2|5.0|Twilight is one of my favorite movies collections.  I bought this to add it to my collection.  It is a wonderful movie.
1442362901|5.0|Product was exactly as stated and arrived promptly.<br />It does have to be played on a newer CD player though.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I love the Twilight movies.  This is another one I bought to be able to watch over and over again.
B003X8597K|5.0|Terrific modern rendition of Wagner's Rienzi! Having seen it live, this recording masterfully captured the essential aspects of the production with powerful performances by all, especially that of Rienzi and surprisingly Adriano. A must for the hardcore Rienzi fans!
0140544518|5.0|This presentation of a classic was so creative.  I laughed so hard while reading this to our 3 year old grandson, that I had to leave the room.  He was spellbound by the artwork and of course the dialogue is priceless.
B008PZZUF2|5.0|I love this movie and just had to own it.  while the ending (last 30 mins or so), are a little hard to understand (they really dont get their point across well), its a great movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is loads of fun for my kids. they each have it on their kindle and they try to out do the other.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|a total classic.  The quality is very good, the packaging is the regular blu-ray box.  i recommend this movie to anyone who hasnt seen it, and to those who enjoy the movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very enjoyable. Highly entertaining, the only thing is it does require you have friends to obtain items to complete quests unless u want to pay money to complete them.  I still enjoy the game very much.
1451613512|5.0|I just received this book yesterday and am very excitied and interested in what all there is to read and get some questions answered.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had heard the buzz about Angry Birds for a long time before downloading the game for my Kindle Fire and I wondered why everybody was so amped-up.  Now I know - the game is addicting, in a good way. Simple, repetitive but not boring, good animation and a quirky sense of humor. I'm not a big &#34;game-person&#34; but Angry Birds has me hooked.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This book is lyrical, engaging, exciting, interesting, entertaining, has a good plot, good characters, and is generally a lot of fun.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Folks that enjoy epic fantasy will be happy with this.Brandon Sanderson starts off a projected 10 volume series with this thousand odd page novel. The world is unique and the characters have a tolerable depth which I'm sure will continue to develop over the years. The writing and the people feel more mature and fleshed out then Mist born,all in all I'm excited to read future installments.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! It was such a good book! Highly recommended!!I've read a lot of books and this is definitely one of my favorites!
B007FRHZ4A|2.0|Such a fun idea, but the plastic pieces are not smooth and very difficult to set up as the cards instruct.  My 8 year old got too frustrated to finish the game.  I ended up doing most of the set up which was time consuming and tedious.  Many times it would tip over and I had to set it up again and again.  After about 30 minutes into our first game, we quit.  I don't think we'll play it again anytime soon.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This app on my iPad is free of ads. No amount of money can clear the Kindle version of this annoyance.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a fun read...couldn't put it down...very quirky characters...how they were made believable was fascinating and watching this story unfold was a delight.
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|I was psyched to learn that they were remaking Fright Night for a new generation. To find out that Colin Farrell, a devotee of the original and a hottie, was going to play the vampire made the anticipation great.<br /><br />I was disappointed that NONE of the great things about the first movie--the humor, sexiness, campy scariness, clear videography, and empathetic characters--were present in this remake. This version was a mindless, soul-less slasher film with no appeal.<br /><br />I walked out after the first half.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch the original for a real treat.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|is there any other websites I could get this game for free. ive played the first one and liked it and want to play the second one.
1451695187|4.0|I liked the book very much with all the medical terminology and his denying what others had told him until he went through the same experience. As I recall he did not get into the scriptural side of what the Bible says about heaven.  I could be wrong. It has been awhile since I read it, along with others on the subject.  Other than that it is a great book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two started off slow I thought, but ended great!  Now I have to get Mockingjay asap!! What a great book!
B00942S4OY|5.0|el servicio fue excelente, igual que el tiempo  y las condiciones del producto, estoy muy contenta con lo que me ofrecieron.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Mitch Albom has provided another quick & enjoyable read that leaves me looking a little deeper into myself.  His writing style is wonderful for someone like me who doesn't have much free time to read.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|You're no Stallone. The plot sucks, if you can call it a plot. Too much of just shooting around. Waste of money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was amazed the entire time I read!! I can't wait to begin book two!! I'm sure the next will be just as surprising!!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Pretty cool, like the plot. Definitely worth watching if you are into sy-fy and all of that. Recommend to watch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved playing solitaire and now I can take it &#34;on the go&#34;. It is my favorite game
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Who knew raising dragons could be so entertaining? I love this kinda stuff ....building, buying and making coin to expand and buy more goodies. Plays beautifully on the Kindle and has a pleasant soundtrack too. Yes ....you CAN spend REAL money to purchase items that your don't want to wait for but, its not required to play and enjoy.....just more patience. Nice work Backflip studios!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|2012PG13: But I wish Clint Eastwood's character appeared stronger. Maybe it's cause I'm getting older, but just because my vision is going doesn't mean I can't throw a few good punches. Didn't evoke a strong sense of being torn between difficult decisions which is certainly what it would be when having to chose between a legal career and a sports agent career. MFJLabs 3x
B005PTYP70|4.0|We loved mission impossible 1 & 3 but mission impossible 2 is a bit of a drag. Tom Cruse is such a &#34;pretty boy&#34; in 2 and the story line just isn't appealing. Skip MI 2 and just watch 1 & 3.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The Plot unravels in a slow, predictable manner.  This movie would have been better for me if it was done in Frank Miller's style then it would have been better for me.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|The show is fantastic, but the DVDs I had were flawed. Some of them stuck numerous times. I was frustrated.
B008LC8TJI|3.0|Yeah, it's pop, but not a bad album.  But PLEASE...what's with the rap garbage in the middle of \\"Payphone?\\"  Too bad they can't release a version without the rap...
B002VD5S42|5.0|I LOVE this movie! Star studded (the actors are famous in Europe but it's about time they become known in USA as well). Louis de Funes and Bourvil at their best! A good movie to watch with the entire family. The DVD is recorded in the European system so it might not work on all DVD players. It didn't work on mine but it worked on my computer so I connected the computer to the TV and watched the movie without a problem. The movie is both French and English, with English subtitles when French is spoken. I highly recommend this movie. It's impossible not to laugh while watching it.
0670026603|5.0|I am rarely moved by a book as I am with this one.  Very easy to read.  Wonderful characters and this was so well written!  The ending was perfect.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Although the ending might not have been a surprise I was gripped to the story line with the last minute twist in the plot.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is an amazing update to Angry Birds.<br /><br />The detail and updates making is so Star Wars like makes me smile as someone who grew up with Star Wars.  I highly recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love reading the hunger games trilogy in high school so i decided to get the books again to read. Everytime i read them I get a different view of what was going on.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Shot in beautiful black and white, \\"Frankenweenie\\" is a stop-motion animation directed by Tim Burton. Based on his 1984 short film \\"Frankenweenie,\\" the new version follows the story of Victor Frankenstein (voice by Charlie Tahan), a young student aspiring to be a scientist living in suburbia New Holland. Victor has a dog named \\"Sparky,\\" his best friend (and \\"star\\" of Victor's home-made monster flick).<br /><br />Then one tragic event happens: Sparky's untimely death. Victor is shocked and dejected, but he thinks of a plan to bring Sparky back to life when he sees a demonstration of scientific experiment by his teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi in Burton's \\"Ed Wood\\").<br /><br />You can say \\"Frankenweenie\\" is director Tim Burton's most personal or autobiographical movie; by saying \\"autobiographical\\" I mean the film is filled with memories of what he liked (and still likes) in his childhood. There are so many references to classic horror movies - from Elsa Lanchester to a windmill - as well as jokes poking fun at pop culture including one popular Sanrio character.<br /><br />But the film itself, even at 87 minutes, feels a little drawn-out, especially at its mid-section. The film suddenly loses steam after Victor's attempts to resurrect Sparky, with a story about his classmates' schemes to win the upcoming science fair, which I found pretty dull. The subplot about Mr. Rzykruski, who looks scary but actually a nice teacher (and is probably the most interesting human character), is not fully developed.<br /><br />Still, I can say with \\"Frankenweenie\\" Tim Burton is back in form. What the film needs is some more time about the bond between Victor and Sparky, a lovely dog who is the star of the film. Why not give us more of Sparky?
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I know that people like to read books in the english language but sometimes its more fun to read it in the language it came from.
0810993139|3.0|My eight year old son has really gotten into this series this school year. I decided to read them too so I could see what all the fuss was about. I'm glad I did because, although Greg is a hilarious character to my son, he's not exactly a good role model. He's very self-centered (what middle schooler isn't?) and not very nice to his friend Rowley. My son and I have been talking about what Greg does that we like and what we would do differently from Greg. It's been fun because my son gets so excited about these books - he loves to talk about them.<br /><br />Greg's parents are clueless and out of touch. I think reading about them has made my son appreciate me! For example, Greg's mom makes him try out for the school play - my son wanted to make sure that I would never make him do something like that if he didn't want to.<br /><br />This book is a very easy read even for an elementary school kid. There are a lot of cartoons - it only took me about an hour to read and didn't take my son much longer. It is funny and sometimes gross but not inappropriate. I think these books would be especially good if you have a boy who is a reluctant reader - the drawings make it extra fun.
0061673730|5.0|I recently pulled a copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance from my bookshelf, intending only to look at my notes on the back cover. As it happened it was a copy which I'd lent my father 25 years earlier. Dad died 17 years ago--his own notes slowly drew me into rereading the book, as we both relived Pirsig's journey. After I'd finished the book it wasn't the philosophic conundrum (what is Quality?) that stuck; or his insights into the venal, stagnant nature of contemporary academics (perfectly accurate); or even his emotional journey with his son--which culminates (in the newer Forward, 1984) in his dramatic, though measured retelling of Chris' murder on street in front of the San Francisco Zen Center. For me it was the honesty of the prose that stuck. Without it the rest of the text would have been dry, uninteresting...lacking in 'Quality.' Though Pirsig gives some credit to the ancient Greeks for helping him resolve the puzzle of what constitutes 'Quality'; in reality, it was his own honest reflection...his own unvarnished revelations that revealed what he sought: his own true nature.<br /><br />Even though the book has taken on a different meaning for me since my first reading nearly forty years ago, I believe it's valuable at a variety of levels, and for various kinds of readers. For some it will be a book on philosophy; for others a father and son road trip; for others a study in the workings of the human mind. However, as the author warns, its not very factual related to Zen Buddhism--nor is it 'very factual on motorcycles either.' A modern classic.
B004I744AS|5.0|love this app, as an addicted words with friends player, I like to learn the meaning of my opponent's words.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Arrived quickly and looks professional, just like a leather book. My husband loves it.  Good price compared to other leather ones.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I purchased the book based on the people's review and read the book in one day. I have always struggled to gain muscle mass regardless of intense training and I am not talking about body builder type muscle. This book corrected me on so many things that I was doing wrong. This  books talks about how less is more and provides explanation behind it. I've been following the book for a week and I already feel different in terms of how my posture and strength improved. There is probably no visible external physical change yet but can't wait to comment again after couple of months. I was also very pleased after receiving a reply from the author himself after asking him a question. Looking forward to next few weeks of training.....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great deal on Kindle version- thanks Amazon!! Ok, I have to say I hate horror and this book is so not horror at all.  Several folks from all walks recommended and I agree- great book!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is nice to finally have an App to access Facebook on my Kindle Fire. The included &#34;app&#34; was merely a link to load the mobile version of the Facebook website. Now if only I could remove that link permanently.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I literally couldn't put it down.  Just pulls you in and twists and turns you around.  Can't recommend it enough!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its grate I love this app I use it everyday you should get this app and rate it a five star!!!!!!!!!!;)
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I found the g2 bottle cutter easy to use. I was able to succesfully cut several wine bottles with no breakages the first time I used it. It only comes with one sheet of each of the sand papers which don't last long so you will need to buy more. I highly recommend buying if you want to cut your own bottles. I found it was easiest alternate between running boiling water and iced water over the score mark to get the bottle to separate.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is another A+ item for my kindle fire; with one exception i cannot 'browse' said another way if way to browse I must write down the Item number/name and Goggle it. That said, The ebay app is extremely useful.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Could’ve been an excellent movie just kept waiting on the action…all the way to the end.  No one ever touch charge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! i'm addicted to it! It's challenging at first but when you get the hang of it its super fun!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I am a big fan of his writing and Winter of the World did not disappoint. You find yourself being carried seamlessly from one characters situation to the next. I can't recommend this highly enough.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister. She would listen to this all the time as a teenager, now she can enjoy it as an adult. It's awesome!!!!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|this was for my daughter she like her music so when i don't know what to get for both my daughter and son i go to the Amazpn<br />list to find some thing thanks
B00A757EFW|3.0|i just love pac man and was disappointed with the performance....not able to control as much as one should for it go fast or slow
1421550644|5.0|Got this item for my son and he likes them very much some of the things he really likes thanks
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire made user friendly and fun to play....very easy to get &#34;hooked&#34; to with a variety of ways to play..would highly recommend
B002R27J1W|5.0|Love the movie. Got it in time. Would recommend to anyone that likes suspense movies. It's even clean; almost no swearing. It's a little freaky at parts but it's what makes the movie.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|A lot of people think that this is an awful movie. But i just loved it since i saw it. And im more than happy to have now on DVD so i can watch it everytime i want to.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I don't want to write a long review.  The opening to this movie is an interesting premise, but that's where it ends.  The pacing is poor, the characters are lifeless blow up dolls.  The film proceeds from the initial hook as a boob and special effects fest for no apparent reason other than to please the younger male demographic.  If you want boobies and panty shots, this is for you.  Basically it is A-list soft corn porn for the timid underdeveloped males.  If you're a grown up looking for a film with more depth than a puddle of primordial ooze, seek elsewhere.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I got this case for my stepmothers new kindle this past Christmas. She reads with it every night, and she has told me that the design is helpful for reading in bed, as it will stay propped up. She loves the color and the durability of the materials. Overall I'm happy that she liked her gift so much!
B004T4LUPW|1.0|couldn't use it-<br />just not what i was wanting... wanted a simple agenda, didn't have a google account set up, so it wouldn't work for me.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|While the period of history cannot be written about or appreciated enough, the present day drama and emotional termoil in Sarah's Key is a bit much.
055380684X|5.0|I read this as a requirement but it totally changed how I look practicing (I'm a musician) and many other things in my life. It is a bit redundant at times but the information is fascinating.
B001UAPVDU|5.0|I was so dumbfounded when I learned this CD was still available for purchase. I was ecstatic! So, of course I ordered it, it is so worth it! =)
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I loved this game.  Took about a day and a half.  Very challenging,  but not impossible.  I only used 3 hints, but probably could have gotten by on just 2.  Try it and I promise you'll like it!!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I downloaded this for my daughter and she just loves it! She plays on it for about an hour at a time, she really likes that she can talk to &#34;Tom&#34; and he repeats it back, so for a free download it works well.
B00559B9N8|5.0|This book is WONDERFUL! Many grammatical errors, however. Will recommend to friends. LOVE IT! It's a very captivating story to read.
B005LAIISA|1.0|I have always loved the ice age movies and bought all of them.  This one should have been left on the cutting room floor (realize they probably don't do films that way any more); it was a total waste of time and an insult to those of us who have been Ice Age fans since the beginning.  The only possible purpose of this film would have been to make money from the reputation of the first three; I sincerely hope that there won't be an Ice Age 5 if this is the direction in which they are going with them for the future.  It was truly poor.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this trilogy and found it to be incredibly captivating. It was easy to read on my kindle. I will recommend it to friends.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Can' t get past the second screen. Poor instructions.No help. Don' t waste your money on this app, its not worth it.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|Once again, I'm updating from my old vinyl albums. Yeh I know, \\"a guy who still plays records?\\".<br />Frankly,  I don't miss all the pop and noise, and it makes for much better headphone listening.<br />I don't have 5.1 surround either, so I miss what some of the other reviewers hear. I give it<br />the 5 stars for bringing back memories from 40 or so years ago.
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|While there seems to be a bit of re-writing of the history of the Third Reich, this story of chivalry, and forgiveness, amongst warriors is incredible....the writing, unfortunately, is execrable.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book is amazing. Bram stoker is a genius. I read this book every year and enjoy it and catch something different each time. I love the suspense it's gets me everytime
0316044695|5.0|Well written, learned a lot about the pure hell those guys go thru to become a Seal, I would have lasted about 20 seconds, maybe less. Amazing what those guys went thru in Afghanistan and  Marcus journey.
B007VYQ9G2|4.0|This was an amazing documentary. The time and patience it took to capture these intimate relationships really paid off. An enjoyable film for the entire family.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I loved this movie when I was little and I love that my kids are able to watch it now too!!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Couldn't wait to purchase Jurassic Park on Blu-Ray and now that a purchased it it's awesome great video and audio upscale from DVD and I got it for a great price where? On Amazon thanks.
B004OR199G|5.0|This book was just what I needed, answered all of my questions about why we want to eat or not eat certain foods with a comprehensive explanation of the science in our bodies. Also, Chris Karr is a terrific humouros writer and makes the reading fun. After failing at so many other diets, with CSD I lost wieght and felt better. Yeah!
B0086700CM|4.0|We like it. Sometimes it is difficult to turn right or left when you slide the tablet screen, but as far as everything else about the game. pretty cool.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I found it a little hard to get into but I enjoyed it as a good read  It keeped me intrigued as the plot thickened
B004OXCL5Q|3.0|While this Blu-Ray DVD is undoubtedly excellent in many ways, USA buyers must understand that it is a B/2 foreign format which is not compatible with USA A/1 format DVD players.  USA movie purchasers must check the data provided and note the type of format in which the DVD is sold.  By doing so you will avoid disappointment when it arrives and find that it is incompatible with your DVD SD (conventional) or Blu-Ray player.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|It took me a little while to get used to the story lines jumping around but once I got into I couldn't put it down. It went very quickly and my only issue with it is I feel it ended a little abruptly. I would recommend it.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I feel that this bowling game is the closet thing to the real thing. Pins are hit and fall, like they do in real bowling. You can spin the ball and you can see the spin on the ball and you can throw fast or slow and if you hit the pins correctly, you will get a strike either way. Granted, you will have  to practice, and like with any thing we do,  sometimes we will have off days and the computer will win a lot. But then we have good days too. I think the key is to get to know the game an  see what works when you throw the ball a certain way or another. I have been playing the free 3 frame version for months and I will still play the mini version for quick games but I wanted to get the ten frame version for Times when I have extra time. But if you ever have to stop the game you pick right here you left off. I have fun with it and I think you will too.......... Have Fun.......
B00708L94Q|5.0|As a JLT fan, I just ordered this without hearing any tracks figuring I'd take a chance in hope of finding a gen or two.  Well....the whole CD is awesome!  It's a trip back to the 80's with JLT delivering some great vocals and lyrical content.  Great band and great CD!
B00886XQO0|5.0|Received order on time. Packaged well with no damage. Works just like I expected it too. Makes gaming fun. 5 stars!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book keeps the suspense alive until the very last chapter! A brilliant page turner! The characters came alive and it was easy to empathise with them all.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good science fiction! I liked it! Bruce Willis is as good as ever in this movie. An interesting but somewhat predictable story.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|I found this book very interesting. What's more, it was free to read on the kindle. I would recommend it.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Great book, a bit \\"baseball wordy\\" at times but I can't wait to see the movie. Recommended for any sports fan out there.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This was the first book i tried out when deciding to get a kindle. I found it good, and it inspired me to read further and but the kindle. I'm not sure if i would read more Mark Twain however.
B0000024LN|1.0|Came with other discs sent from Amazon directly.  The other discs were in good condition, but case of muddy waters from third party was cracked in several places.  Could not refund because it was not from Amazon.  Cracked Christmas gift .  :-(
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I bought this book, and i just read straight through until Martin's 5th book in the series. Would recommend it to anyone even moderately interested in fantasy.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is an excellent and provocative TV series.  It was hard not to watch all of the segments at one time.  I am looking forward to being able to stream season 2.
B00760BPOC|5.0|Picks up where the 4th book may have been a bit slack. Cannot be read in isolation obviously, but as part of the series
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book! Thought I knew everything that would happen like other books but I was wrong. It gave me chills.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I LIKE THE APPS BACK GROUNDS AND SPECFICS BUT WANT A LOT MORE DETAILS FOR MY WEATHER BECAUSE I M OUT IN IT MOST OF THE DAY.

B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I know this may sound obvious but we realized they have to be positioned in such a way that they come on when you need them but not, when you don't.<br />To explain, before attaching them to the wall, I put them on the floor in various places in the house which helped to fine tune where they needed to go. Once up we realized we'd put some in the wrong place. When we came around a corner, because the light was on the wall closest to me it couldn't detect the movement until I started down the stairs. It was just a matter of moving it to the opposite wall and it's working perfectly. On the other hand, we have one as you enter the room, however, every time we walk by the room it turns on so we need to tweak that.<br />This has been part of our quest to decrease our energy usage. We started by adding solar panels, and most recently we installed the Nest thermostat.

B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I did the free trial. Love the G5 games, and puzzle scenarios.<br />AS SOON AS I PAID for the app after it stuck me and wouldn't let me move on unless I did,<br />It's now froze. When I try to \\"pick up\\" something, the screen just dims and doesn't let me select it. I am stuck where you put the gas in the car, and you need to pick up the mailbox lever to get the gas can. I can move around, do everything, but when I select something- screen dims and doesn't let me pick it up!!! I've cleared caches, force stopped, moved to SD card, you name it and Nada. It's locked up on me and the only option I have is to reinstall the app and start over from scratch.<br />Needless to say, despite my love for G5 games, this has happened at least 5 times on other apps- and on different devices too!!!!<br />Fail.
1589949811|5.0|So I'm a LoTR fan and also a card game fan. I've played CCGs like MtG for 15+ years. This was my first intro to LCGs, however, which meant learning a new set of rules and understanding the structure of LCGs vs. CCGs.<br /><br />This core set contains 4 30-card mini-decks that can be used to play the game. Though they are not tournament legal, players can combine the decks if desired. There are also scenario cards that players use. I've only played the simplest scenario since from what I've read the more difficult ones are too much for the basic decks to handle. I've played this game solo and with another player.<br /><br />Overall I've really enjoyed playing this, particularly with two people. Being able to discuss strategies and how to initiate combat in a collaborative way reminds me a lot of MtG Two-Headed Giant or EDH formats, where users can partner up to beat opponents.<br /><br />The one complaint that I have is that the game has a steep learning curve in my opinion. The seven phases of a turn are a little complicated and it's easy to forget one in the beginning. Still, if you like strategic card games, LoTR, and are willing to watch a few videos on YouTube like the one on the Watch It Played channel then you'll really like this game. Highly recommend.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Up to date presentation of a true story that is truly inspiring - especially if you love dogs.  Great for the whole family.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am a dog lover whose beloved Queensland Heeler Jake died recently after 12 years of intense companionship. This book isa highly charged and emotional journey through the imagined mind and feelings of a dog. It sparks intense reaction, including tears. The realm of experience is spiritual.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Wonderful!  Just like all of Mitch's books.  I was a fan of his when I lived in MI and he wrote for the Detroit Free Press.  Kudos to him again.
B004MYF4SS|3.0|However, neither the memory part or the procedural aspect does the job for me. It has been very well reviewed almost universally so I am likely in the minority but, it seems to me, that the bit of returning to an isolated childhood environment and unearthing old secrets is tired. I liked the character of our hero however. The idea of following a character who is finding his or her way through difficult and uncharted waters without the requisite abilities is always appealing.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Starts off to be promising, but most of the movie stooped to idiotic humor that wasn't even funny. Why Hollywood feels that people want to see stuff like this, is beyond me. Expected a lot more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What can I say...Stephen King has done it again. He's a masterful storyteller and writer...but I'm sure it comes natural to him.<br /><br />Great story line. Have read several fiction books about time travel but, as usual, King found a way to make his unique. Won't say much more because I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. If you like Stephen King, you'll like this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book because it's full of events and keeps you hooked up and attached to the book till the last page.  I recommend reading it.  It's softer than the first one and more realistic.
B007SGM084|5.0|Totally incredible writing, details make you feel it all. E L James shares most intimate opinions, titillating and alluring. Recommended.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Since  you read the first two books you might as well read the third.  The only thing I like in this book is the part where he's talking about her from his own perspective, when he first met her, how he felt about her, and give some details about how she looks like for him.

B0070Y46UY|2.0|A great story of survival, but I was very underwhelmed with how it was told. It seemed to take half the book to even get the story started and some parts went off on tangents that I felt added nothing to the story. I was expecting a different book than the one I got and maybe that was just my own misunderstanding of what I was supposed to get out of the story.
B00846REIS|3.0|The book was a good read over all.  Have to love Gideon!! my only issue is the language.  Just have to choose better options to get the same message across.  Not afraid of the &#34;bad&#34; words, but it's a turn off.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have never felt as emotionally attached to a book before in my life. Charlie is a character that really feels like a human being, just a teenage boy trying to find his way in the world and the way he examines everything and his narration of life is something unique.

B0083GQ2A0|3.0|This movie had a very dark undertone and some of the special effects regarding the wolves seemed unrealistic.  I don't think I would spend the time to watch it again.
159420411X|4.0|A hard book to classify. Better than Freakonomics and others of that ilk, this book has some pretty good math and science behind it.  You will learn how gamblers, chess, baseball, poker, the stock market, climatology, weather, terrorism,  and earthquake forecasting schemas work and where they are weak.  As well you get some great advice on Bayesian mathematics, how to reduce  errors in your forecasts ( but never eliminate them, nor do you eliminate your bias).<br /><br />Great lines (From many sources) :<br /><br />  The future seen as sprinkles of probability<br />  With more evidence we can get closer and closer to the truth<br />  The majority of scientific hypothesis deemed to be true are actually false<br />  Big Data will make us more prone to failure<br />  most data is noise<br />  combining forecasts could reduce error 15-20%<br />  the stock market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent<br />  unknown unknowns are gaps in our knowledge - but we do not know they exist<br /><br />Valuable book for your library - this is required reading to reset your brain away from common fallacies. Very readable, good for that trip to the UK and back . My only gripe is that the paper quality is too low - for my eyes I need a brighter white to  see the text.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Confession, I was swayed to read the book based on all of the accolades and hype that the movie version has been receiving. I wanted to see the movie from the previews, but missed its initial weeks in theaters, so I thought that I had better read the book first. Books are nearly always better than the movie version. However, after reading Matthew Quick's novel version, I making a tentative guess that the screenplay is stronger than the novel.<br /><br />The book is good and I probably would have enjoyed it more, if I had not gone in with high expectations driven by the success of the movie adaptation.<br /><br />The Silver Linings Playbook, centers around the character of Patrick Peoples, a man in his mid-thirties, who has just been released from a mental institution and is living with his parents as he tries to piece his life back together. He obsesses over his ex-wife, as he can't remember several years of his life, including his break up or what landed him in the institution. He befriends his neighbor, Tiffany, a young widow who has been in a deep depression and has moved back in with her parents.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that it's a bit clunky, especially towards the middle of the book when a bunch of the story (including character motivations) is revealed through letters. The letters really bog down the pacing and don't do much to develop the character of Tiffany, who has a great backstory that's barely explored. Tiffany and Patricks friendship is developed more through Patrick telling what they did, rather than letting us see the moments and the scenes play out.<br /><br />The story is very Patrick-centric, but it is a tease, as it is filled with great minor characters who are unfortunately minimized. The book could have been longer and more fleshed out, especially with regard to Pat's parents. It ends on an rather abrupt note and I was left wanted more.<br /><br />The brilliance in Quick's writing, is his ability to create multifaceted, sympathetic characters. He writes characters that are relatable. I've spent time with mentally unstable family members (ex's family) and I felt like Quick nailed it. I immediately remembered the walking on egg shells feeling and not knowing what would set the person off. Quick captured that awkward, uncomfortable dynamic perfectly. I also felt like he really got in the mindset of Pat, as someone who is unstable, but constantly trying to do his best and please his family. It's often heartbreaking. This book has many uncomfortable moments.<br /><br />I'm excited to see the movie version, as I feel like this book was a great foundation for a potentially even better screenplay.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very addictive! Interesting characters with great plot lines. Keep the episodes coming! Wish they aired more often so there wasn't such a long wait for our next &#34;fix.&#34;
B00110K62U|5.0|This 10th anniversary presentation is well worth the price.  I can't help you if you're trying to decide between this and the 25th anniversary presentation.  I have them both and I enjoy them both.<br />In this one, I particularly like Ruthie Henshall's interpratation of Fantine.  She is beautiful and vulnerable.  She is even angry in parts of \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\" I tought that was especially appropriate.  I also admire Lea Salonga's portrayal of Eponine - \\"On My Own\\" is done beautifully, without going overboard or getting sappy.  What a wonderful talent!  The large orchestra and chorus support the quality and integrity of this presentation.  The second disc about the \\"making of\\" is interesting.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been meaning to write a review of Firefly for a long time. To this day, I regret losing this wonderful series in it's infancy. I was one of those people who didn't watch it when it was on, but found it a couple of years later.<br /><br />This true gem, with it's eclectic cast of talented people brought to us by Joss Whedon, as noted by the thousands who have reviewed it here, and reviewed it recently, has probably become the standard for almost perfect sci fi. Nathan Fillion, now known as Richard Castle, will never eclipse his role as Mal Reynolds, captain of his spit and duct taped spaceship, Serenity. The rest of the crew already named here probably a thousand times, can thank Firefly for their still huge popularity and success today. Those of us who love Firefly do so with great passion and loyalty.<br /><br />What exactly defines the wonderful series as what has become not just a cult series, but also simply a fan favorite is the magic this cast (and crew) weaved in each episode. It was far ahead of its time with stories so varied, smart and many times very funny, they can be watched again and again and one never tires of it. I still find it hard to believe this series was cancelled after only 13 episodes and the movie, Serenity, did not wow the box office as it should have. That is on we, the people, for not showing up and supporting it when it was needed the most.<br /><br />As for should you, the few people who have not seen it yet, should you get it and watch it? A resounding yes! I'm sure it's not for everyone, but if you like smart, sweet, excellent entertainment, it doesn't hurt to give it a chance. While the series 13 episodes are stand alone and the movie, Serenity, does tie it up, I suspect you will join the ranks of the rest of us who wish the network had made a bolder decision and stuck with it. Like NCIS today, which began around the time Firefly was on, it would have built its audience and those of us who miss it dearly would have many more episodes to watch over and over again. I join the many voices here and tell you to buy this wonderful, once in a lifetime series, and envy you that you get to watch it for the first time. Very, very highly recommendedepisodes to watch over and over again. I join the many voices here and tell you to buy this wonderful, once in a lifetime series, and envy you that you get to watch it for the first time. Very, very highly recommended
B00364K6YW|4.0|I bought this film for my wife, and I actually was entertained while watching it with my wife.  It had great character development based upon the Jane Austin series, and the length of the film was broken up into different &#34;Acts.&#34;

They are not so pretty to look at.  They remind me of clown shoes, but they are perfect for standing.  They are also very easy to keep clean - just wipe & go.
B0060CRM6M|5.0|A cute movie, with humor for adults too. I have 3 year olds that love to watch this movie and it's a frequent request. It's great for teaching kids about learning to do things for yourself, and that sometimes we need friends and family's help too. It's about sticking to your guns and believing in yourself, and about the relationship kids and parents can have too. It can be good for helping kids understand that parents aren't infallible and sometimes we don't see the things that are bothering them as problems, until they tell us what the problem is.

B004L9MFM2|5.0|Got into all this from seeing the first 6 episodes of series 1 on a flight to China (v. small screen).<br /><br />Just a great story with real characters - the politics and trickery beats the swords and sorcery aspects - although they are good.<br /><br />One quibble: the maps at the start of the book are unreadable in Kindle (at least on an iPad)
B001O1O71C|4.0|I liked how the author maintained the POV of a 10 year old boy throughout the entire book. He was really consistent which made the book enjoyable for me. I am interested to see the movie and how it was translated to film.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved, loved, loved it.  I am a big Stephen King fan from way back, but this is not a typical Stephen King book.  Don't shy away because you think it may be too scary - it's not.<br />The story is beyond engaging - Jake Epping is asked by a friend to help with a task in the past.  This friend has a portal to the past and has been visiting the late 50's/early 60's for years.  Now he needs Jake to help him finish what he started.<br />Jake learns a lot about himself in the past and has a wonderful experience with friends he meets along the way.  But the main focus of his trip back in time is to correct a wrong - prevent the assassination of JFK.  The journey to that goal is a wonderful story that keeps you hanging on every word.  The references to US history are fascinating to me and the story is awesome.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who reads.  Just buy it already!!!

7500117124|2.0|Dr. Seuss is great - our kids and grandkids alike have loved his books. Fox in Socks may not be as popular as the Cat in the Hat, but they are in the same genre and excellent for beginning readers.<br />We ordered the book using a link supplied by our daughter to the Amazon website, and that link showed the book in English. However, when the book was received, it was a dual language book (English plus Chinese or some other Asian language that we neither read nor speak). i hope Amazon doesn't make mistakes like this very often!
1423124111|5.0|This is a wonderful array of poster art that brings back memories of early days at Disneyland. We grew up nearby and went very frequently to the park.  One of the artists lives near us now in Solvang and an article in the local paper turned us on to this book. We bought it for my son, a Disneyphile and Expert on All Things Disney and he was thrilled.<br />One of the things we liked was seeing the poster art from other Disney Parks around the world. The differences were very interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The other reviews said the last book was not very good, but I disagree. It has a sad ending, no denying that, but a sad ending fit the story in my opinion. The first book was the best, and Mockingjay was second, and Catching Fire seemed boring until the end when Katniss was back in the arena. Highly recommended the series.
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|Yo La Tengo just may be the most consistent band in modern music over the past few decades. It could certainly be argued that, in 27 years, not a single album released by the group has been anything less than very good, with a handful being certified classics. 'Fade,' the band's 13th studio album, almost feels like a summation of their entire career up to this point, hitting all their key sounds and styles, while still having something new to say.<br /><br />Produced by Tortoise's John McEntire, this album marks the first time in over 20 years that anyone other than Roger Moutenot has helmed a Yo La Tengo album. The result is a richly detailed, cohesive set of songs that, while still covering a pretty wide spectrum of sounds and moods, is extremely tight and focused compared to the sprawling, kaleidoscopic nature of their last full-length, '09's underrated 'Popular Songs,' and maintains a warm, dreamy vibe throughout its 46 minutes, making for perfect late-night headphone journeys.<br /><br />Highlights for me include the album's tripped-out opener, \\"Ohm,\\" an epic, droning track featuring the same two chords repeating for nearly seven minutes, while slowly building with more and more instrumentation until the song turns into pure fuzzed-out sonic bliss. The existential, mantra-like lyrics, sung simultaneously by both Ira and Georgia, reaches an almost spiritual level, and only adds to the euphoric vibe. The Krautrock beats of \\"Well You Better\\" and \\"Stupid Things\\" are quite hypnotic, with the latter's lazy guitar noodling combining with the bouncing rhythms to create a feeling not unlike floating around through the cosmos. Or so I'd imagine.<br /><br />\\"Is That Enough\\"s string-laden melodies are absolutely infectious, sounding almost like a solo Thurston Moore track, only an alternate universe version where the violins are sugary-sweet instead of eerie and haunting, and with excellent boy-girl harmonies. \\"I'll Be Around\\" is a moving psych-folk track, with gentle acoustic fingerpicking, droning mellotron, and intimate vocals and lyrics from Ira Kaplan, recalling the more introspective moments of the band's unplugged, almost country-ish album of (mostly) covers, 1990's 'Fakebook.'<br /><br />The 6-plus-minute \\"Before We Run\\" closes the album with a wobbly curlique riff that, when combined with Georgia's soothing vocals, is near trance-inducing. McEntire's patented strings and trumpets slowly intrude on the serene vibe, gathering momentum until the song turns into a gorgeous symphony, resulting in one of the band's most memorable epic closers in a catalog rich with them.<br /><br />While 'Fade' doesn't really break much new musical ground for Yo La Tengo, it still manages to sound entirely fresh, and does represent very well what the band does best: creating stellar, dreamy noise-pop, with beautiful melodies and fluid, bouncing rhythms. It may be the same old, same old for this band, but they do it better than anyone else out there, so I'm definitely not complaining. I'm too busy listening.
B005F96UNM|4.0|Wasn't the kind of movie I expected but the eclectic, comic book styling with the use of simplified landscape and vivid colors changed my mind.

B009JBZH54|5.0|A masterpiece! Chris Nolans series has not only set the tone for which hero movies now pull their template from but stands as some of the best cinema created in the last 100 years. Turning one of the best roles is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, but to be fair the casting was spot on for each of the characters. The scripting is great, action phenomenal, and the tale classic. Pick it up today.

B00A6RVRXG|4.0|Yo La Tengo have been around now for +25 years... though they have never hit the mainstream, (and most likely never will) they have been very dear to a faithful group of thousands of fans, who know how to find beauty in their simple and understated tunes as well as their slow building musical swells and forays into experimentation. On Fade, they opted to keep their magnificent balance of sweetness, fuzziness, jangly guitars, loops, hushed vocals, and everything that makes Yo la Tengo such avid respecters of their fans ears.<br /><br />If you like Yo la Tengo already you can buy this album with no hesitation. It is way up there with \\"...and then nothing turned itself inside out\\" and \\"I can hear the heart beating as one\\", as well as the more overlooked \\"I am not afraid of you and I will beat your ass\\"... Listen to is any time of any day and you will feel very happy, but listen to it on a rainy day as you stare into the ceiling and you will find God!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|How much more fun can it get! Love the graphics- light bulbs flashing, birds flying everywhere, colorful, musical. It's a hoot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|**I have to say I very much enjoy a good and confounding mystery and Gillian Flynn writes some of the best.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love being able to just have one click and I'm into my Facebook. Has never failed me, or dropped, or messed up.
B000056JYC|5.0|I agree with all the other reviewers who gave this Deluxe Edition a 5 star rating. This CD definitely brings back fond memories from 1976. Plus, with the 25th special deluxe edition, you get extra bonus songs. The bulk of this live album was recorded at San Francisco's Famous Bill Graham's \\"Winterland Ballroom\\", during 1975.<br /><br />You get original art work, including some great original photos, plus you get some great liner notes, written by John McDermott, dated October, 2000 & original liner notes written by Cameron Crowe (contibuting editor of Rolling Stone magazine, & also featured in the movie \\"Almost Famous\\", dated December, 1975.)<br /><br />If you like classic live rock albums, it doesn't get any better than this!!!! I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Lots of levels, colorful, fun, challenging without the frustration. Have played the same levels several time. Would like more levels to be offered once I've gone through the first sequence a few times. But that does take awhile. You get your money's worth.
1416955070|1.0|The Quality of the book was poor. The cover was glued together upside down and the first part of the book was correct.What happened to quality control.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds just keeps it coming. A whole lot of fun, for all ages. I've been enjoying it for several months now.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|That this is Mel Brooks son is cool.  That he wrote such a great book is beyond cool. I don't think children of stars can get a free right in the world of literture.  The reading public is too tough to allow that. Max Brooks has earned every 4 and 5 star review written about his book.<br /><br />The journalistic style was done perfectly. Once I picked this book up, I had real trouble putting it down until I was done.  Using the historical account device (right way to say that?) created a very different experience. As I went through the reviews for this book, I realize this is not the first time it has been done, but it was the first one I read. And he did it in a way that made a zombie apocalypse (ZA) believeable in the context of the story.<br /><br />One note of caution - now that I have read World War Z, I am a little skeptical I will find another ZA book as good as this. I have not picked a new ZA book since because I am afraid I will be disappointed when measuring it against WWZ.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is by far the best book he has wrote so far hopefully the house of Hades is just as good
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I like it, but the first season was a little more jarring. Overall the story is a bit predictable, but the other series dealt with the supernatural.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|At first glance, I was very pleased with the quality and how it protected my iPhone 4s, but after the first phone call, I realized my voice came through muffled.  I was disappointed because the case is very nice.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Love the seriers and decided to get the DVD.  Never a dull moment on Breaking Bad for sure.  Always a twist and a turn.
0141339667|4.0|It was not a French version.  It is same as the English version but the price on the back shows UK pound.<br />I received a refund and donated it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My kids love all Ice Age movies and this one was just as wonderful. They can't take their eyes away, even for a few seconds.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed the passion and the hardcore honesty between sky and holder.  The relationships between sky and the other characters were heartwarming.
B008RC72G8|5.0|I wanted to see this at the theater but missed it. I got a good deal on the BR on Amazon so I bought it. I have watched this movie about 5 times. I think as a whole the ems-amble cast does really well. I have heard fans of the series were put off as expected. Burton clearly was making nods to the original show and the period, but trying to freshen it up. The CGI is minimal and subtle. Clearly this was s big budget movie with solid visuals. Burton sometimes overdoes the quirky weird. I know that is his thing, but sometimes a distraction.<br />Depp was well casted, I was watching Baranubus Collins, not Johnny Depp. The story at times veers of a little and appears lost. In the end the story does come full circle. So a solid Burton film overall.
0141195851|5.0|The cover on this book is beautiful and the binding itself is nice and tight, while at the same time flexible allowing for the book to be opened and read normally without putting a strain on the spine.
B0001HAISG|4.0|My wife had to have this film as it was her favorite Peter pan film from when she was younger.  We purchased it and it was a good movie portraying the time when Peter Pan and Wendy met and went to Neverland together.  I thought it was a captivating film and inspires the &#34;fun loving child&#34; in all of us.
B000A7DVR2|2.0|Language!  There are at least a million words but this film uses one especially offensive word over and over - ad nauseum.  I was so put off that I did not get beyond the first four minutes.  You are welcome to take this movie back.<br />Wanda Chadwick
B004DM0UII|4.0|Every song i have searched for was available, from new to older classic rock. Speedy downloads and so far no hick ups i highly recom this app
B00003CXRM|5.0|Fun movie with lots of deeper stuff if you want to think about it.  There was a lot of thought required to make this movie as good as it is.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I started reading S. King back when he wrote &#34;Carrie&#34; and have never stopped.  This is a good one, more sophisticated, less gory, than some of his earlier works.  On par with &#34;Under the Dome&#34;, more a study in personalities and possibilities.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|The story line was decent but the book jumped around with the different characters and plot.  Too much time was spent in areas that had no impact on the conclusion and built up to nothing.  The transitions and character development could have been smoother and more captivating.  The ending was good and a surprise which I like.  Overall I was disappoint but I finished it.
B0061S073A|5.0|I've tried out a few locks and this one is my favorite so far. Choosing apps to place in it are easy, setting the lock code is easy, you can turn it on airplane mode so there is no signal, or turn it to just block the marketplace so your child doesn't buy anything. I have a few puzzles, coloring apps, and even Netflix on this and my toddler can navigate it with ease. My favorite part is if my child turns the kindle off and back on again, the kindle will restart with this app running. Sometimes I'm just astounded by the cleverness of my baby. :-) I also love that if you press the home button, it just goes to the child lock home, and you have to go to the settings>exit option and type in the code to get out. Brilliant.
B007L6VR12|4.0|A really fun, but different movie with a lot of familiar faces!  The kids are great (& so is Bruce Willis!).
1619691809|5.0|Nelson DeMille never fails to keep me intrigued with his stories but having two of his most colorful characters together made this book exceptional.You may want to read &#34;The Lions Game&#34; first or you could miss some of the plot and as always his characters whit is outstanding.I would highly recommend this to all readers even if military plots aren't your usual genre.
B004HAEGP4|2.0|Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy. And I say that as a RE fan and a Milla Jovovich fan. Too bad, such potential.
0060527986|5.0|This awesome read is an instant lift me up. Filled with inspirational quotes .Paulo at his best. highly recommended read.
B002QNEJT2|3.0|After watching all the seasons, I would say this one is the slowest-moving of them all. But compared to most of the other shows on TV, even the slowest season of Dexter is better than most other shows by far. And Miami in HD is gorgeous!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book was great!!! I really do recommend you read this book. I think book could be been longer.The Third Wheel Is not  my favourite Diary of a Wimpy Kid book,butt it was very good!:)
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Loved this book. It had the twists and turns you expect from a Reacher novel. Plus the wisecracks. And I will definitely use the puzzle question. How to talk for 1 minute without using the letter A. LMAO!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is just such an awesome movie about family values, I knew it had to be part of my collection
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Shades Triology.  I enjoyed all three of the Fifty Shades and wish the story would continue.  The lives of each character were very interesting.
1419705849|4.0|Both 12 year old & 9 year old son have read since we received before Christmas & both give it a thumbs up.  My 12 year old liked a few of the other books better, my 9 year old said it was just a good as the rest.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fifty Shades Triology.  I enjoyed all three of the Fifty Shades and wish the story would continue.  The lives of each character were very interesting.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Part of 5 year old daughters Christmas presents, in her eyes Big Time Rush is the best so CD was a big hit.
B00A2AHU2E|5.0|I got this thru Amazon Prime digital downloads. Its a great movie.. And the ending song is one of my favorites in a movie, the song that plays as the credits roll. I like a good movie sound track or just good music in movies.<br /><br /> I dont like telling plots of movies, even online...lol. I guess I can say its an action, revenge type of movie.
0345803485|5.0|Very moving, exciting, interesting, well-written Trilogy. All three have been a &#34;can't put it down&#34; entertainment. Well worth the purchase to read.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Wonderful, well-written story with colorful characters and a great storyline--an adventure filled with history, magic, and love.  I was completely swept away and look forward to the rest of Matthew and Diana's tale.
B000SXOFL4|4.0|I purchased a lot of Enigma's songs and still have them.  Some I didn't purchase were too hard to understand the purpose, but for the most part they are awesome just because they are different and experimental in their messages they try to release in their songs.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn writes colourfully with believeable characters, adding twists and turns to the plot throughout.  A thoroughly gripping yarn!  I wanted to put it down but read in one sitting.
0345803507|5.0|Very moving, exciting, interesting, well-written Trilogy. All three have been a &#34;can't put it down&#34; entertainment. Well worth the purchase to read.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I didn't realize that there were ads involved. Every time one popped up, I clicked close, and that was OK. But then, I HAD to chose something. The ads were for a dating service that I AM NOT interested in. I do not particularly care for products that force me to choose something, or I can't continue. I will probably uninstall.
0345803493|5.0|Very moving, exciting, interesting, well-written Trilogy. All three have been a &#34;can't put it down&#34; entertainment. Well worth the purchase to read.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|All of the books and movies were very entertaining and mind stretching. Radcliffe has an amazing imagination. The disparity between books and movies are not a bad thing. Each has its own charm.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Not as good as the originals but still good. Lots of action as usual. I like the original Jason better.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Historically accurate lesson in perceived hurdles being great opportunities. An interesting period in Briutish history portrayed in an effective manner.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Wife liked it. I thought it was okay. It was worth watching though. Just not my cup of tea I guess.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|I love this movie, it is fantastic and very funny! However, I bought this movie expecting to be able to play the Blu-ray disc on my Blu-ray capable laptop, since I don't own a Blu-ray player. It turns out that Universal Blu-ray movies don't work on laptops. This wasn't a huge deal because it comes with a DVD. But then I realized all the extras and special features are on the Blu-ray disc so I am unable to watch those. Hopefully Universal will start using the same codec as other companies so that their movies can be viewed on computers.<br /><br />Also, the code that was included for the Digital Copy expired over a year ago, but it still works.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Bought this for myself (I know I'm selfish), but my family enjoys watching the newest Batman Trilogy as well: I'm satisfied.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|ok I might have jumped the gun when I down loaded this but i think that it will work just fine.
B0064Y5U24|4.0|I love Nickleback, and this is a good album. But I do like thier earlier albums better. But I love using it on amazon cloud !
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Clock does what it says it will. Easy to use and simple. Perfect for turning your Kindle into an alarm clock.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I feel that I have to read this book a couple of more times to receive the full input of this novel. There seems to be multiple levels to this story so that anyone can identify with some aspect of this story. Unfortunately munch in the novel applies today with the darker aspects of human nature ,genius notwithstanding. I must say the author's personal beliefs has tainted his work
B003TJR2HS|5.0|We use this product with our portable sony player. My husband and I both have an iphone with the otterbox cases. Without this adapter we were having to take our phones out of the cases to use the sony player. Now with the adapter we are able to plug and unplug in a jiffy. Worth every penny! Would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a solution to this type of problem. We are very happy to have found exactly what we were looking for.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so amazing! So many ideas and awesome pictures all at one place. I love it! It is addicting!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|You can never beat the prices of a Blu-ray on Amazon!  This is a great movie that I bought for my brother for Christmas.  He loved it.
145210655X|5.0|Gave this as a gift to my 27 year old grandson for Christmas and he loved it. He has a whole room filled with Star Wars items.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movie series and this box set was such a great deal; too good to pass up.  I got this for my husband for Christmas.  If it weren't Christmas, I'd still buy the box set!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love it. Never saw the ending coming.<br /><br />Could not stop reading til I reached the end.<br />Wanted to keep reading and reading.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I and my grand daughter r having trouble understanding this game, she wants to know why more ponies don't exsist
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this cd and I love Lindsey Stirling. She is just amazing. I love all the tracks on this cd, they are all nice and catchy and entertaining. She plays the violin so beautifully and combines some trance into it, so cool. I blast this cd when I cook, clean, workout, relax, go for a drive...etc!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary. It really makes you examine what you eat, the true cost behind the foods we consume, and how we feed children. The woman who lost her son because of an e-coli tainted hamburger from a fast food place is a real eye opener.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 5 yr old granddaughter led me to this as she had played it before. Not only does she love it, but her 2 yr old brother loves it as well, and I must confess I've stayed up late more than a few times playing it myself and I'm 50+. It's a challenge trying to beat my previous score and the 2 yr old....well, he just likes to see the fruit splatter and the bombs explode.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Watch this and love it at least once a year.  Music is just fantastic.  The dancing just has to make you happy.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|i like the move. i like the way the movie arrive (packaged well, quickly). I HATE the digital copy-of lack there of.<br /><br />We bought this version for the digital copy (we don't have blu-ray, but it was the only version with a DC), but we can't access it. AT ALL. First, ultraviolet does not let you go through itunes unless you have a specific code, which they do not give you. ok, fine so i have to go through a different app that i have to download and do a bunch of other things with. Ok fine, did that. when we entered the digital code in the flickster app, as directed, the code said it had already been used. mind you we bought this BRAND NEW from amazon. and UltraViolet has the WORST customer service. As in it is completely non-existant. We emailed and tried to call and have got nothing in return. this was a wasted purchase for us since our only interest is in the digital copy and DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down, i dont read fast but i finished in two days, it was great!!! I enjoyed it and hope you do too!!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I definitely have enjoyed this series. It's got a great story line and interesting characters and I'm glad I picked it up. The only downfall is the author drops hints in there that are slapping you in the face because they're so obvious but its still very fun to read :)
B005HSL626|5.0|Lots of fun easy on the kindle's system and works well with the touch screen not as good on smaller systems
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is my fifth Jodi Picoult and it generally follows a script she has developed such as there is usually a legal wrangling of some sort. I have learned somethings from her five books that makes them enjoyable to read. My goal is to read all of her books because I do enjoy her writing style. Ms Picoult's writing is intelligent with a current feel to it. I recommend reading The Pact..it is fun to get into the heads of her characters without investing too much in them. Good modern day writing.
B0053O89K6|5.0|i love house m.d. hate its over with, great idea new and sealed, no scratches and the case was perfect
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We love this series.  The story lines continue from the first series with enough of a resolve to satisfy but always a great teaser to get you to come back.  Can hardly wait for the next episode.
1594135851|4.0|It was pretty simple.  I need a little more practice.  I got the book I wanted there seemed to be alot of choises and I didn't have much time.  I am looking forward to looking again and taking more time.
B00ARAO720|3.0|I liked the action in a way, but it was a little far out. They kept going in the past of what happened at first and then switching into the present time.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game itself is fine, but after you have played the game a few times, ads start poping up at the beginning of every game.  It is annoying and I will look for another game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great mystery/thriller. I had to keep reading to find out what happened next. Flynn pulled the protective layer off Nick and Amy Dunne's marriage to show the depth and complexity of each spouse and how hard it is to really know another human being. Nick knew the Amy she wanted him to see and he knew he wasn't the nice boy he presented himself to be. If we don't know ourselves how can we truly know another?
B00A31UXLW|4.0|As a big Michael Connelly fan and especially of his Harry Bosch character I found this a great read. Setting the story around the infamous LA riots was a great subject matter.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I gave it this rating because it deserves it. He is a tremendous writer. I have read all his books to date and enjoyed every one.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|I had stopped buying cookbooks because I could find so many recipes on the Internet, but my husband gave me and my son Ottolenghi's two cookbooks Plenty and Jerusalem for Christmas.  His devious plan worked spectacularly as we were drooling over the pictures immediately and diving into the kitchen as soon as we could.  So far everything we've tried has been a hit (I particularly like the cucumber salad with crushed ginger - yummmmmmmm).  If you live in a rural area you might have trouble finding some of the more exotic ingredients but living in Raleigh we've had little trouble finding what we needed.  Highly recommended.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Very cute movie for a great price brand new, sealed in package. Received quickly with no complaints.Little one is very happy.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|Good. I like this musical very much it is one of my favorites and my family too. So we are enjoying it as much as we can. Ilove the book on the making of the movie and the possible stars who could have done it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I've loved draw something ever since I got it on my phone last year and was excited to download it on my Kindle fire but it's a completely different setup than for my phone and not in a good way. On the phone the games you are currently playing are much more organized and put into 2 categories; your turn and their turn. Also on my phone I can use bombs to choose a new category that are worth many more coins, not just redo the list I'm already at for nothing special. I also wish their was a save picture mode on my Kindle fire version.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the bigger screen on my Kindle I probably would just continue to play it on my phone for all the extra options :/
B007UQRW62|4.0|I am still enjoying it. I haven't had the time to see all but I am pretty confdent it is going to make me happy anyway. I am a bit dissapointed on the umbrella, it is so tiny, I would have liked a red one like the one Gene Kelly has in the advertisement but one cannot have everything, I have one that size from New York City and I love it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing and really shows the peer pressure of high school students this coming from a high school student herself. I loved this book it was amazing.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a really fun game.  Great game play. Great graphics. Great music. And all the help you could ever need.  Just get it. You won't be sorry.  It's a little spooky but my seven year old grand daughter loves it.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|This movie has it all: Comedy,Romance,Passion,Irony, Suspense.<br />There is a lot of good humor in this movie that creates more than just a smile, it causes audible laughter.<br />The romance is obvious and present but not overwhelming to a point where a guy wouldn't watch and enjoy..thus it has romance but is not a full blown chick-flick by any means.  The sex scenes are sizzling but not raunchy.  They are intense but tasteful.  The obvious irony is seen in the movie where you think things would go one direction but they take a different unexpected turn.  The viewer has this suspenseful impact of wondering how is this all going to turn out.  Does he call does she call...Do they end up together. A great movie for audiences who appreciate any genre.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Better than average movie, but not quite as entertaining as I had expected. Product's price was among the lowest available.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put it down. There was twist after twist. I loved it!! It was so intense and so wonderful. Can't wait to read more of Hoover's novels
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This show is extremely well done and captivating. Cast is great and the sets are Amazing! One of the best horror shows of all time.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Really enjoyed this ... a great analysis of the importance of one's appearance in society that can even be applicable today.<br />Definite must read !
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I only had to watch two minutes of Magic Mike before I saw Channing Tatum's butt and Matthew McConaughey shirtless. That right there is enough to make this a must-see for women and gay men. Okay, this is not a great movie. Not even close. For a movie about male stripping, there is probably only about ten or fifteen minutes of actual stripping. There should have more stripping, and less drama about drugs and stuff. But is it worth seeing? Definitely. And Matthew McConaughey might give the most entertaining performance of his career in this movie.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Driven texts study results crush tested fists Dutch non trade civic breaches coffin neon drum Dutch Dutch Dutch stuck it's odd kHz kHz
B0066W1AZK|4.0|a timeless game simple and addictive.... how can u call yourself a gamer and not love chess. Bobby Fisher would have it on his kindle
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved the story. The characters were interesting and I enjoyed following them on their journey. If you like fantasy books, you will probably enjoy this one as well.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Entertaining book, very predictable plot I stayed a half a book ahead of the main character, but a pretty good read.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|This book not only grabbed my attention<br />It throttled me and hung me from my own expectations and excitements<br />FANTASTIC<br />the greatest book for those  that may not have the highest self esteem and ANYONE else
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is my favorite app but it crashes quite often for me and this needs to be fixed. Otherwise I play it everyday!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have been a fan of Game of Thrones on HBO for a while but now even more so after reading this first book. Now for book two!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I just love the series :) It has a great story to it and the actors are amazing! Great series to get into.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Probably appeals to the older viewer rather than the young. No mayhem, no nudity, no blowing things up, just great acting
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I'm learning a great deal from this book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand nonverbal messages from the people around them.  I love it!
B008LZHA3G|3.0|Somewhat derivative in comparison to earlier albums. As such it is not new and even thn it is not as good as some of the earlier work
B00782O7IY|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. My daughter saw previews and voiced that she would like to get it for her movie collection. We bought it to give to her for Christmas. She was thrilled!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Brilliant blend of history and fiction.  The amount of research that goes into this series is mind boggling. Can't wait for the third book in the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|My friend Mo suggested this book to me, and I am so grateful for her recommendation. I love how the author pulled you into Holder & Sky's lives. I'm still stuck on the best first kiss in the history of first non-kisses! The way Colleen Hoover's words danced on the page, made me never want to put it down. I will most likely read this book more than once and will check into more of her books. :)
B004UID2LC|1.0|Whenever I run the &#34;Antivirus Free&#34; App, it picks out the FREEdi app as malicious and I eventually uninstalled this aplp.
B009VB97EY|4.0|This movie was not what I was expecting, it actually had a pretty good storyline.  I enjoyed it and not just for the stripping!
B00007KQA3|5.0|I have owned the \\"theatrical\\" version of 1984 with the inappropriate and \\"ethereal\\" Eurythmics soundtrack ever since it was first issued on laser disk almost 25 years ago.  Now, finally, I get to see it with the wonderful Muldowney soundtrack which is how creator of this film intended it to be seen.  It's like watching a different, and much improved film without having to tolerate that trash music from those 1990's psycho-pop crooners ruining the film.
B0061QD88S|5.0|I bought this for my mother for Christmas and gave it to her as a gift from the family dogs, she not only loved it, but crawled into bed and watched it &#34;with&#34; the dogs.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I tried to build my own Linux based Media Server, running Open Source programs. I wanted to build a server to deliver media to HTML5 devices, like a Chromebook or IPad that doesn't have flash. I originally ruled out Plex because it had a lack luster web management interface, and no way to view content on web only devices. I had to find this program for photos, that program for audio and another for video. It was a lot of work.<br /><br />That all changed a few months ago. The web-based management tools have been completely redone and are up to my standards of performance. In addition you can now play your media within the web interface of the Plex server, so this was my solution to my project. Better admin and web based playback. I scrapped my own media server web interface players, as Plex offers many additional features, like gathering all the meta data for all your media.<br /><br />With Plex media server installed on my Linux box, and web users being able to access the content in a beautiful way, it now came to my portable devices. Up to now all software was free, the server and the app for Mac.<br /><br />For my Kindle Fire and my Apple iPad, it required purchasing the APP to directly connect to the PlexServer. So while the web interface to Plex is adequate and very functional, the dedicated APP interfaces are much better. It is a pleasure to scan through my libraries of content and view them on the Kindle. And while most APPs are in the $1-$3 range, I do not begrudge $5 for this app in the least.<br /><br />If you have a large media collection and want to serve you media to your Kindle, definitely go with the Plex Server on your favorite platform (Win Mac Linux), and get this APP for a very nice playback experience.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This writer 'puts you there' right where it is all happening. Your concentration is grabbed by each page. Unusually I saw the film series first and am now reading the book one. It is a pleasure that the films follow this intriguing book as closely as they do. I will buy the other later books without any doubt. Martin writes with a positive aliveness.<br /><br />It is cruel and bloodthirsty in places and there are several characters that you absolutely hate, ( as we did JR in Dallas!) as was Martin's intention. It is a page turner and could keep you reading well into the night. It is in the Potter and Tolkein genre in some way, yet more easily believable because it is less far fetched perhaps.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|I read other reviews and was somewhat hesitant to order, but glad that I did. The shows are exactly as I remember with all the original songs. Definitely worth the price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. Well written characters. Lots of twists and turns. Highly recommend read! It had an unexpected ending too.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  Could not put it down! Almost didn't read because of the age of characters, but so glad I did. It was heartbreakingly  wonderful!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|ES File Explorer brings a Windows File Explorer style capability to my Kindle Fire HD.  Folders are clearly available.  Downloads from the web browser go into the ... Downloads folder of course.  How nice is that.  No hunting and wondering.  This should be your first app to install with your new Kindle Fire.

B0054R6BFM|3.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />  Jay Asher's heart wrenching novel Thirteen Reasons Why is an excellent portrayal of life in high school. This book is about a teenager, Clay Jensen, who receives tapes from an anonymous source. As he begins listening to them, he realizes that the tapes are from Hannah Baker, his friend who committed suicide two weeks before. Hannah has made these tapes specifically for the thirteen people who are the reasons why she ended her life. Clay has no idea why is has received these tapes, in fact, him and Hannah had just had a good time together at a party a few weeks ago. When he gets to tape number 7, he learns that Hannah did like him, and that he did not fit in with the others on the tapes.<br /><br />  There are a few other people on the list who I believe have greater impact on the story than others. First is Justin Foley, who was Hannah's first kiss. He is number one because he started the rumor that created her reputation as easy and also created a ripple effect for everything else bad that happened in her life. Another person on the list who I believe stands out is number 10, Jenny Kurtz. I think Asher did a great thing putting this character in the novel because it shows that there are consequences for actions. Jenny killed someone because she was afraid to call the police and was irresponsible, and Hannah could not live with herself knowing that. The third person who I think is important to mention is Bryce Walker. He is number 12 and is a disgusting character, and unfortunately, people like him do exist in reality. Bryce raped a drunk Jessica Davis (another girl on the list) while Hannah was hiding in a closet at a party. On another night, he took advantage of Hannah who willingly put herself in danger because she was giving up on her life completely. The last character that I find is an asset to the realistic quality of this book is Mr. Porter, who did not do his duty as a guidance counselor and suffered the consequences of that. Mr. Porter's tape is different from the rest; it is a recording of Hannah's conversation with him. Hannah was trying to get help, and I think it is repulsive that Mr. Porter would do nothing about it. Asher was smart for adding this character because it really drives home the message that adults can be at fault too, and that thoughts of suicide should never be taken lightly. Hannah Baker was a teenager who was not able to cope with her problems, and someone other than Clay Jensen should have been there to help her.<br /><br />  While this novel was decently realistic with the issues that Hannah had to go through, I did feel that not all of them were problems that would lead to her suicide. I was disappointed that Asher did not go into more detail with her personal life at home, instead of just referencing that \\"she couldn't trust her parents.\\" Despite this, I did enjoy Clay's character because he showed actual compassion and caring for Hannah and realized that what the other people did was wrong. I also enjoyed Tony's character a lot. He was an exceptional add to show that not everyone had a part in ruining Hannah Baker's life, and that it is never too late to do the right thing. I feel that Thirteen Reasons Why was a fantastic novel for high school students to learn hard lessons and the effect of creating rumors and bullying others.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Came out happy!  Overall a great movie that kept me interested from start to finish.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great casting, smart, quirky, modern day but holds on to the essence of Sherlock.  I hope they dont cancel it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The blue-rays are very nicely  packaged and the book is very nice. There is also a short documentary about the history of the bat mobile it was interesting. For the price it is a really good addition to any movie collection. I bought this as a Christmas present for myself and could not be happier. And it got here 3 days early even in the Holliday season. WELL DONE Amazon. The ultra violet edition is awesome too
B00992CF6W|5.0|The people that report one star are missing the Pont moaning could have put the game for more than 20&middot;00 dollars ok and I have been dreaming to get mincemeat for years I love it one star reviewers show respect
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I haven't read a book in a long time that had me captured in the beginning as this did.  It's a must read for anyone who believes in love, trust and hope ever after.  Such a sweet story.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I loved Travis's character - so raw and intense- never doing anything in half measures. He really is the ultimate Bad Boy! This has to be one of my favorite books that I have read so far in the last 6 mnths.
B009KKLQVS|4.0|The talent that always was is still there within America's Band. The news of the reunion was greeted by fans all over the world and the resulting CD effort: That's Why God Made The Radio is testament to what these guys can do with Brian's wonderful composing and producing talent. The God-given talent Brian Wilson has for &#34;hearing&#34; each part that he wants each person to sing is clearly evident during their concerts. If there is a short-coming to this DVD is that it is not the entire 50 song concert only 21 songs are recorded within. Is it just like being at the concert? No, nothing will take the place of being there in person. For those of us who were not able to catch one of the 50 performances, it will have to do for now. Hopefully, a longer, full performance version of this DVD will become available. If there is a downside to all of this it is the fact that Mr. Love and Mr. Johnston have struck back out on tour which has sent Brian, Al and David back to their own bands. Shame. But do enjoy this DVD as many times as you play it.
B0098JJYZQ|3.0|I enjoyed the book but found the pace of it a little slow. For me it was maybe 2 or 3 chapters too long. It was a sweet story but all the references to Dante and Abelaard and all these other poets or whatever they were - was a bit much for me and I could not relate.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Good mail reader.  I use it on my kindle.  Simple interface, nothing fancy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Simple and straight forward<br />Does what you expect a mail reader to do.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Would be nice to have some options to personalize the display a bit more
B000002HGD|5.0|Too many good songs on this disc to pass up. The perfect album for work, at home, in the car (though I defy you not to dance in your seat when the vocalist belts out, \\"I'm - Feeling so Real!\\") If you remember the 90's you have to get this one. Not to mention, it has some beautiful uplifting but sad songs, and at least one strangely dropped in punk number.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun little game.  My daughter got me hooked on it.  I play with everyone in my family now.  The game can be played for free and still have fun.  Give it a shot.

B001383XT8|2.0|I was in need of a distortion pedal for my guitar seeing as how the one I've used for years broke. However, I've been low on cash lately so to save some money I bought this after reading some glorious reviews. So I ordered this thinking it would do at least a decent job, but upon using it, first I'd like to stress how confusing it was to install the battery. It's not like most pedals, and there were no clear instructions on how to do it. I went through three of my friends and my dad before we finally figured out how to install the battery. And our work was put to shame, because while this would probably be a good product for a beginner or practicing guitarist, it had very mediocre sound, and there was far too much feedback for it's own good. Adjustments to it's settings did not seem to make much of a difference. So while this might be a good idea if your low on money or are just a beginning guitarist, I would not recommend it for anyone experienced or planning to record or perform.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This was a dellightful surprise -- a book chosen for our book club by a friend, and when I began to read it I wasn't quite sure it was something I would like.  But in  just a few pages I was hooked.  It was a little sad, mixed with a lot of love and fun.  It's a light read, but one you won't want to end.

B005LAII80|5.0|I never read the Dredd comics too much but seeing this movie made me like the Dredd character so much more. Before watching Dredd, i was skeptical and the trailer made this movie look like garbage. After watching the movie i was shocked because i underestimated it and it turned out to be a fun movie to watch. It is extremely bloody and the 3D is great! This is totally not what i expected it to be. This movie is a must-buy!

B004Y042N8|4.0|I like it! It has settings to turn off sound and or use vibration feedback.<br />It is one of those games like metal puzzles that you need to figure out once, but for the price it is a good way to stretch for a quick break.

1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now is my third most favorite spiritual book.  One of the most important questions we can ask in this life is who am I?  Or what am I?  Tolle points the way to have an experiential, not an intellectual, answer to these questions.  Almost all of us humans are going to have to deal with the problem of too much sorrow or suffering at some point in our lives and Tolle points the way to freedom from suffering.  The ego centered life will ultimately produce a life with too much suffering or sorrow.  Tolle shows the way to live a life that is not centered in the mind or ego.<br /><br />The best way to read The Power of Now is by attempting to feel what Tolle says.  Reading to accumulate more ideas is not the way to experience what Tolle is conveying.<br /><br />Tolle writes clearly and succinctly and that is one of the many beautiful aspects of The Power of Now.<br /><br />Reading The Power of Now made a wonderful change in my perspective.  Before reading The Power of Now I was not aware of how much time I spent thinking about the past and worrying about the future.<br /><br />Changing one's perspective from thinking to Consciousness is one of the keys that Tolle points out.  Tolle's techniques show how to go further and deeper into Consciousness.<br /><br />The fact that peace is to be found only within has been pointed out in many spiritual books.  The difference is that The Power of Now has detailed, effective instructions in just how to find that inner peace.<br /><br />Tolle's writing is inspiring.<br /><br />The Power of Now is a spiritual masterpiece.<br /><br />Emotionally fighting what is happening in our lives gets us nowhere.  Tolle's alternative is to stop emotionally resisting what is happening and to emotionally accept the events occurring in our lives.<br /><br />A question worth asking is How can I stop living a shallow life on the surface and instead live deep in the heart?  The Power of Now answers that question.<br /><br />My most favorite spiritual book on the subject of how to transcend the ego, end all suffering, and live in bliss is [[ASIN:097972676X THE SEVEN STEPS TO AWAKENING]]  The Seven Steps to Awakening is a collection of quotes by these seven authors:  1.  Nisargadatta Maharaj.  2.  Ramana Maharshi.  3.  Vasistha.  4.  Sankara.  5.  Sadhu Om  6.  Annamalai Swami.  7.  Muruganar.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Yann Martel creates a lively world easy to inhabit. You live, love and suffer along with the main character Piscine Molitar Patel. Written as if it were a true story of a castaway, the author doesn't gloss over the brutality of a young man in a desperate situation. While some of the details are hard to believe by the end of the book, you find yourself in the same shoes as an interviewer who would rather believe the story is true than think the journey was for naught.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|It kept me on  the edge of my seat, no movie has ever done that before. Excellent account of the American embassy crisis in Tehran.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|While the soundtrack is lovely - I'd love a more complete one. \\"The Song of Angry Men\\" to me was a very important and often repeated song throughout the playwright and the movie - why was it left off?<br />Im not typically given to conspiracies but my guess is the big bag GOV didn't want any new anthems being taken up...could be wrong but...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If I hadn't all ready recommended this book, while I was only halfway through, I would shout it from the rooftops!  These books were the best thing I've read in a long time, and I read a lot!<br /><br />I cannot wait to check out more of Hughs work. I have a feeling he just made a major new fan.

B0029QRA1U|1.0|Have an extensive LP collection that I want to try to get onto CD.  Started with a double album and the first three sides recorded okay and then the turntable started to drag.  Seems to be a problem with a lot of these units.  I plan on packing it up and returning it tomorrow.  The unit is pretty easy to use and I would like to give another one a try just to see if I had a defective one, but after reading other reviews, I don't know if I will.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is an easy read. It is the kind of book that is easy to follow and the story is intriguing. I was a little dissapointed with the ending, but I would recommend it!

B001HN694K|4.0|A little bit more for adults than the original, this new take by Disney on Alice in Wonderland is more of a sequel than a re-do.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Johnny Depp as the Mad hatter dominates the screen. Still there are quite a few other fun performances.<br /><br />Altho I said \\"a little bit more for adults\\" it is still rated PG, and fine for all but the smallest viwerers.<br /><br />Still, and all, this is more \\"Tim Burton\\" than \\"Disney\\" if you know what I mean.

B006R6ZP6U|5.0|Will and Jake Grimm are traveling con-artists who encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse which requires true courage instead of their usual bogus exorcisms. This is one of those u love it or hate it movies. Effects could have been better but all in all not bad. I loved it, it has humor, action, ect: basically it has a little of everything. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I have read twice over the years. Once as a paperback & once on Kindle. Let yourself go & imagine yourself in this position. What would you do? This is one of my favourite reads. Who cares if it is true or not? It's about how you feel & think. I am transported by this story. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0099114WO|5.0|After thirty years of marriage, a middle-aged couple attends an intense, week-long counseling session to work on their relationship. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones turn in stellar performances. Funny and serious at the same time. As the beby boomers are coming of age this type of situation shown in this movie happens often in real life. This movie is one of the best I have seen in a while. Great plot and stars to fill the roles. Must see.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|LOCKOUT gets its entertainment value from its pure adrenaline rush and its visceral attack on the viewers senses.  Fluidly directed by Luc Besson (TAKEN, FIFTH ELEMENT), the film's basically simplistic plot is inconsistent and filled with holes and unexplained information which I won't discuss here due to spoilers.<br />Guy Pearce swaggers his way through his role as Snow, tossing off one-liners like dandruff, and is actually quite good.  TAKEN and LOST's Maggie Grace is coy and sassy as the President's endangered daughter.  The crazed prisoners are stereotypes and Peter Stormare is his usual nasty self.<br />LOCKOUT isn't classic cinema, but as action fare goes, it fills the bill.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy. The ending wasn't what i expected, but was good. Very slow in several places but if they didn't put them in it would explain whats going on so u can understand it. When there is action it is great. VERY LONG movie approximately 2.5 hours. So have the drinks and popcorn ready, sit back and enjoy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app! Comprehensive and free. Does all I need it to. Minor complaint is that it doesn't display as landscapes.

I was apprehensive to purchase this CD because I'm a young guy who likes heavy metal, but I thought this would be a good gift for my mother.

0061537969|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - so much so, that I finished it in 2 days. It's a quick, easy read, and I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />It's fun to \\"see the world\\" through a dog's eyes, and there were some insights and passages that I really enjoyed. Enzo's explanation on why dogs are clearly closer to humans (from an evolutionary standpoint), for example, made me laugh out loud. (Though be warned - there are some heavy topics covered as well. It isn't just a comedic book).<br /><br />There are a few things that prevent me from giving this five stars, however:<br /><br />1) The \\"bad guys\\" of the story (to avoid spoilers, I won't tell you who they are) are pretty over-the-top and one-dimensional. I don't know whether this was intentional since it's from the POV of a dog, but it detracted from the story line.<br /><br />2) Some of the plot twists seemed just a bit too deus ex machina for my taste. I had to suspend disbelief more than once to buy the choices characters made and the outcomes of those choices.<br /><br />Also, a fair warning for those who care about these things: there's some amount of strong profanity in this book. Also, there's a new age spirituality throughout the book, most notably seen in the discussions of reincarnation.<br /><br />Still, a book I enjoyed and found to be worth the read.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Fantastic!  Showcases the talents of an expert master with the rising star of Stevie Ray Vaughan.  A must have for any fan of either one and any fan of great Texas blues or The Blues!
B0027GGL6W|5.0|For many years Blues and Motown artists had their music sampled and sometimes outright stolen with no royalties paid to them. It was awesome to see the artists stories. This movied showed it all, the good, the bad, the laughter and the tears. There will never be another generation of artists such as these. If you are a fan of music then this is a must see.

1466401885|1.0|I picked this book up on a whim at 6am in the airport and read it until I was about halfway through. At that point I could no longer stand either of the main characters, nor how my emotions were being manipulated throughout the book. (Parker is nice but we are made to dislike him for example) I also tired of the constant back and forth between fighting and being happy. It was just too much and clearly being done to keep us reading - well it had the opposite effect on me. I didn't see many typos while reading, though I was tired and reading fast so I might have missed them. Having said that, one thing that irked me was that characters \\"puffed\\". I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean when used as a dialogue tag. You can puff your cheeks, you can puff your breath/a cigarette, I suppose you could do something with cream puffs and turn it into a verb, but I don't think you can puff dialogue. Nor can you shrug dialogue. You can make a statement and then shrug - the same goes for puffing (whatever is meant by that).<br />Before I end, I would also like to mention that their relationship disturbed me greatly - and I didn't even get to Mrs. Maddox tattoo part (I could go on at length about why this bothers me so much, but I won't for the sake of brevity.) I worry that people think all of this is acceptable behavior - let alone romantic...
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Not bad, but it sounds as if they recorded the movie onto a CD.  Was expecting a little more with the soundtrack.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Everyone has neurotic tendencies in there youth. This is a really relatable story on so many different levels. A good read.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|The soundtrack was more acapella than the movie.  Loved the movie, kids loved the movie, and now they love the soundtrack too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless has many unexpected twists and turns.  This book will definitely hold your interest clear to the end.  Colleen Hoover knows how to unwind the past and carry it to the present in the face of reality. Some parts are quite explicit, so I do not recommend this to be read by young readers.<br />I'll be watching the lists for any new books by Ms. Hoover.
6302642248|5.0|Arrived new, as was listed, and promptly with no problems. The children of this generation should watch more movies like this one.
B0083DJWGO|1.0|A somewhat interesting concept but not worth an entire book; perhaps an essay. I found this book very easy to put down after the first 10 pages. It felt like just so much consumer pop pap.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Funny and wonderful Sandra Bullock is her usual funny self and Ryan is always hilarious.. check this one out you'll love it
0399160450|4.0|This is the lowest rating I have ever given one of Clancy's books.  As always, story line is great, well researched and timely.  The inclusion of a graphic sex scene cheapens an otherwise great novel.  I'm disappointed for the first time ever.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game so much it takes a good mind to win !!! You should get this game and its just like Cut the Rope but a little bit more fun!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Typical Child style, great read.  Jack Reacher does it again, leaving you wanting more and waiting for the next adventure.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Very fun and entertaining app, great graphics awesome music. The sound tracks along makes world of a must have, mind bending app. You will enjoy.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing Solitaire on my Kindle Fire HD. Only drawback are the advertising popups. I count the popups as a minor annoyance in receiving the free game app.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I'm not a huge Justin Bieber fan, but one of my kids is a Belieber and loves the cd.  Quality of cd is fine.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I am changing my review as the problem was fixed.  This is a very fun and challenging game
B003YK42LQ|2.0|KOL really sold out on this one.  I miss the raw voice that Caleb used when they produced Youth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak.  Sounds like any other type of pop rock you could imagine, the bass instrumentals are still awesome though.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting book told from 2 points of view.  Lots of twists and turns.  I would recommended it to anyone who loves a mystery.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This story gives an interesting perspective on WWII as experienced from a German Ace's view. It was a different time when honor and courage were valued above all else - even country. Pilots on both sides of the conflict operated under an unwritten code of conduct that was distinct and separate from the politics of the country's at war. We often forget that countries engage in  wars while people fight them. Here a tale is told of the men who fought against each other in the skies over Europe and what it meant to be a pilot in WWII.
B000FO0AOC|5.0|I really like Otis Redding and this CD has some of his best hits. The sound quality is great. Highly recommend it for fans of soul.

B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Hilarious, nostalgic, & general Angry Birds fun.  A must own for Angry Birds or Star Wars fans.  The Jedi powers of the birds are just amazing.
0783225849|3.0|this movie was for my film class and it was a great movie for it's time i had  to compare it to a 1998 movie the Psycho. what a big difference. The was great for the project.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This is a book full of good but common sense advice about meeting new people . It does help that it is in a book format so that it can remind you of all the things that you forgot. Not mind blowing but ok.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was great. Can't wait for more. It's one of the best series I have seen to date. Keep them coming
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this second part of the trilogy, and looking forward to the third part. Follett builds the characters well, and continues to write in a very good style to keep the reader interested.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|I was really looking foward to this movie because I love Meryl Streep and I was interested to see the story of an important woman in history. While Streep's acting was great, the storyline was somewhat flat. It didn't illicit excitement, compassion nor admiration and to make the story more interesting they used that confusing camera movement that so many contemporary flimmakers use. It just seems to cover up the truth of this film, that it was boring.It could have been a wonderful film.
B00063F8B2|3.0|had not played the newly arrived cd until our drive with kids and grandkids in mini-van to christmas eve dinner and fun at relatives home.  we all enjoyed the tunes from the movie.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A must read for those off all ages seeking their \\"Personal Legend\\". Read with an open mind and soft heart.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it keeps me in contact with friends and relatives i can't visit often and because im a senior i do not feel so isolated besides a lot of these apps are really fun and keep our minds working.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun time waster...but when you run out of coins that sux.You have to wait 30 seconds for a new coin.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book had me so intrigued I couldn't put it down its not your everyday love story it's got everything and the best thing it's not all fantasy it's very realistic! Read it I know you'll enjoy it!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I've been using this case for a while now and I love it! It feels like it is too light when you first get it but it fits the Fire perfectly and provides good impact protection. I've dropped my Kindle plenty of times and it has yet to get a scratch. The only thing I don't like is the elastic band gets stretched out and a little deformed over time. Right now, it has not affected the functionality of the product but I feel like it might be useless after a few years of use. But really, it is a perfect case for the Fire. I would recommend it.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It is great other than it took 2 hours to download and the price was hight. It is good if the slow download and high price is worth it to you.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|If you're a fan of Manson, this is a must read.  Brutally honest about his rise to stardom (complete with stories about drug use, abortions, gay oral sessions, and many other taboo subjects other celebrities wouldn't dare discuss), Manson lets readers into his world of insanity.  Sometimes he uses the thesaurus a bit much for the dramatic effect, but overall a pretty well written book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was completely better than I ever expected it to be. I read this book in less than a week, I couldn't take my eyes off.
B003UYV08E|3.0|It took me awhile to finally sit down and watch this movie, but I am glad I did.  The movie was slow to start, but definately picked up about halfway through.  I ended up liking Tony Stark a lot more in this movie; even though he faces a lot of adversity in Avengers and the first Iron Man, it doesn't seem to shake him of his arrogance for very long. In Iron Man 2, you see more moments of humility come from Tony Stark than in Avengers or Iron Man 1.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Fun read with some interesting insights. Possibilities brought up that I hadn't considered before. The audio book wasn't very good thought.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|Was action packed but the plot was not that great likeHitler gettinmg bown up at a movie where you hardly had any security for the guy..and things like that..
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I like stupid funny movies with Rated R humor especially with Seth Mcfarlins writers.<br />This is a must see when the kids are out with their grandparents.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|BluRay adds a lot to all 3 films, color, sound, defination, all add to the enjoyment of watching these again and again. This is the way to see these films TODAY .....
0735619670|1.0|This book is recommended by many authors, not just the customer reviews here. But I have to admit that I don't get it. I tried many times and always gave up reading it up. It just seems some good points but too much diluted. If you are already aware of such a thing called 'good practice', this book may not be much useful for you.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|India.  Not my favorite setting, despite Judy Dench;s marvelous performance.  Wouldn't recommend unless your ties with India are more fulsome than mine.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As something of a student of NDE's and OOBE's, I appreciated Dr. Alexander's linear and non-religious approach in relating the story of his heavenward journey.  Too often, I find, those who've had such an experience use it to beat the drum of their particular belief system, completely missing the fact that while those beliefs may give THEM comfort, not everyone is a part of their culture and religion.  So, while they may have had a transcendant experience, they are effectively saying that what they believe is right, and everyone else is wrong, there is only one road to heaven, which is THEIR way. Not so, Dr. Eben.  Coming from a medical background in which the accepted wisdom is that any NDE is the last gasp of a dying brain, his story is especially compelling because there is no dogma, nothing to frighten the reader that lest they believe this or kowtow to that, they'll end up in seven kinds of Hell.  Interestingly, it paints a picture of a loving Creator that cherishes each soul regardless of what their earthly time leads them to believe, which is the ultimate gift: free choice.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very thought provoking.  Caused me to remember that I need to make my time count instead of counting time.  Really puts life in perspective
B008BM9L72|4.0|I'm very glad I read some of the negative reviews here AFTER I read E.L. James' trilogy of Fifty Shades. I read the 3 books in under 5 days ... they literally brought my real world to a halt and I escaped with glee (and without sleep!) for those 5 fantasy days. And they were a very enjoyable (but tiring) 5 days.<br /><br />So what does this say for author E.L. James? Simple. She can write a good story. All of some 1000 pages or more of it are page-turning prose. Unlike what many reviewers here say, Fifty Shades is not about sex and BDSM. The driving force behind the story is the emotion ... the developing complex love between two very different people from two different worlds and the complex personality of the male character. This is why women around the world are reading it so voraciously, and why it was a hit. If it were just erotica, it wouldn't do a thing for women!<br /><br />To be sure, the repetitive cliches were a bit much for me to take in at times (I especially disliked the &quot;Oh my's&quot;). True enough, too, that I found some scenes hard to believe. And most emphatically, Christian Grey is not your average man of the real world, who would never seem to find time for anything or anyone but himself. Christian Grey is what every woman's dream-man looks like and acts like (minus the slapping and whipping stuff), and for this they are probably willing to forgive his dark side, or, at best, permit it to slip into the background. As long as, of course, he mends his villainous ways in the end.<br /><br />The character Ana hops from virgin to sexpert in a blink and that hardly constitutes credibility in the real world. Neither is it credible that she attains orgasms at will and each and EVERY time. The dark side of the story can really turn your stomach if you dwell on it too long. But despite the negatives, Fifty Shades is indeed good fiction.<br /><br />The author has her own writing style that one can like or dislike. I personally thought it was passably good considering. What I found to be excellent was the techniques the author uses to keep her readers enthralled. The &quot;Inner Goddess&quot; is actually quite cute. So is the email correspondence between the two characters. Heck, what woman wouldn't just love to get all that attention from the man she adores?!<br /><br />There is not one person I know who has read these books who has been able to put them down. I think that says a lot for how a book is written. It certainly isn't boring, I can vouch for that.<br /><br />Fiction is about larger-than-life characters doing daring things we ourselves would never dream of doing. Perhaps there is a little of the alter ego that attracts some readers to the characters ... they are dangerous, exciting and, finally, a good deal romantic into the bargain ... an aspect of our own personalities that we keep very firmly in check. And isn't this why we read fiction, I would venture to ask? To escape into an unreal world and fantasise about what cannot be? So why are people complaining that the trilogy is too far-out? If they want a story to be close to reality, then they should stick to non-fiction where every detail must be referenced to a reliable source. Alternatively, they should be reading real-life stories that tell us about what we know so well ... that life is hardship and disillusionment rather than the happy ending of an impossible situation like the one depicted in these novels.<br /><br />And do I dare say it?? Could there be a teeny bit of envy at play here, that a first-time author sold 40 million copies of her books in such a short time? I mean, imagine how wealthy she has become overnight thanks to the so-called 'thrash' she has managed to produce. Oh my! Oh my! ...LOL<br /><br />Let me assure those of you who are looking to escape that you will not be bored for a minute reading Fifty Shades.ood considering.

B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Kate Beckinsale is back and she's kicking butt once again. Lots of action, werewolfs, vampires and evil scientists, what more could you ask for.
B00622BF40|5.0|This movie works on so many levels it is a pure joy to watch. Love story, underdog story, ugly duckling story, individualist story, dancing story, family story, moral story... Truly a gem that should be in every collector's library.
0061900656|5.0|We have a 3 year old autistic son who we're trying to prepare to be a big brother.  The story is simple, and understandable, and our son asks to read it each day.  Definitely recommend this book.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A true classic .. Should be required reading for all children in school. You can not go wrong with this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love taking seminar notes, especially with gesture typing, and having all my notesin the cloud. i can leave the notepads and just use phone.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Let me start by saying I absolutely loved, loved, loved Catching Fire, and the entire series. I would not be giving a low rating if i felt it would affect the over-all score but I would like my complaint to be heard.I rebought the entire series to read on my kindle while on vacation. To my surprise, the kindle version is absolutely riddled with numerous typos. I know that this a problem to be expected on a kindle, but when I would notice cutoff or misspelled words every ten pages or so, it became a problem. This book has sold millions of copies, how has an editor not gone in to fix this problem after all this time? Without a doubt I reccomemd this book, but buy the physical copy to save yourself a lot of grief.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan Boyle's latest collection of recordings are based on the songs from musical theatre. Here choices are well-known classics and only 11 instead of her usual 10 on a disc here. In this collection, she has assistance from the great Michael Crawford from \\"The Phantom Of the Opera\\" and Donny Osmond. They do a very good job with Susan. While it's her disc, Crawford and Osmond are to assist and support her in belting out the recordings. Boyle has slowly emerged as a great recording singer and still popular today. Her choices are fine but she could take a risk more in the future. She is already established now and will probably get honored by the Queen at some point in the future.<br /><br />Her first song is her own rendition of Judy Garland's classic, \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" from the classic show, \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" When you hear Judy Garland sing it, Boyle does a fine job in her own interpretation of it but not stunning or remarkable in any way.<br /><br />Her second song is ABBA's classic, \\"Winner Takes It All,\\"from the musical, \\"Mamma Mia,\\" which I enjoyed more than the first song. It's a powerful, passionate rendition and perhaps signifies her own ordeal and life.<br /><br />Another song is Stephen Sondheim's classic, \\"Send in the Clowns,\\" from the musical, \\"A Little Night Music.\\" Sondheim wrote this song especially for raspy voiced Glynis Johns. It's been recorded countless times but Boyle is quite clear in her rendition here. She's better than Dame Judi Dench personally with her singing voice.<br /><br />Susan recorded \\"Bring Him Home\\" from the classic musical, \\"Les Miserables.\\" It's a good recording and clear in presentation.<br /><br />She sings with Michael Crawford who played the lead role in the musical, \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" They sang \\"Music of the Night\\" together and they done perfectly fine job here.<br /><br />She sang the classic song, \\"Memory,\\" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, \\"Cats.\\" She does a fine job here.<br /><br />She also recorded two songs with Donny Osmond. They do a fine job together.<br /><br />Overall, it's a fine album or disc but I wished Susan would take more risks with her recordings.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love it but needs more levels. Mastered it too fast and hoped I could buy more. Its like bejeweled but with better music.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|This movie from what I understand is a prelude to the return of the muppet show on primetime.  The producer / director are gearing up to bringing the muppets back.  Loved the movie.  Reminded me of the older movies like Muppet's take Matthattan and The Great Muppet Caper.  Awesome purchase.  The bonus features has a making of the movie which is the best making of I've seen in awhile.  Funny stuff.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. The information is reasonably accurate for . my area and It is easy to navigate. I would recommend<br />.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A person could go crazy thinking about and applying all the rules, possibilities and consequences that go along with time travel. So what's really great about Looper is that the movie strays away from even trying to explain the hows and what-ifs. Looper sticks to the simple story of a scenario where time travel does indeed exist, and what happens to the life of an assassin when a criminal organization is using time travel to send those they want killed into the past to said assassin.<br /><br />Director Rian Johnson gets great performances out of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Young Joe) and Bruce Willis (Old Joe). Johnson's make up crew does an astounding job making Levitt physically resemble a young Willis, and Levitt captures many of Willis' signature personality traits to really enhance the believability of the movie. Levitt (and Willis) must have had a lot of fun with this film.<br /><br />So the story really takes flight when Willis himself is sent back in time to meet the end of Levitt the assassin's suped-up shotgun. What ensues is an action packed story that's easy to follow (for a time travel movie) and fun to watch. I was completely entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />Check it out.
0545265355|5.0|Excellent story and nonstop action from the begining to the end it kept me awake late at night. Very hard to put down.
1573300403|5.0|I love the man and his music. This product was exactly what the description said it was. I am very satisfied.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have liked few books as the first 2 or 3 in the ice and fire sage from George RR Martin: what a giant among writers he was in those first books. The last however and in particular this very last one, the impression is the GRRM is getting paid by the page or word: huge shame.
0689835604|5.0|great book, its like peek a boo, good for learning parts of the body, baby loves it. would recommend .
1933952806|4.0|I hesitate to even rate this book.  I found it to be very in depth and complex.  I am sure that the nuggets of info are rich it is just up to me to dig in and find them.  The title is &#34;Mastering&#34; and I feel for sure that if one puts their mind into it and reads this entirely there is a chance of mastering this wonderful camera!
B008HK3XU4|2.0|This is the second time I have ordered (two different kindles of different sizes) but, yet again, I ordered the wrong size.<br />I guess I just didn't read this clearly... and will take responsibility for making the mistake.<br /><br />But I think that Amazon must make more of an effort to express what kindle covers fit what kindles. I usually am good about this sort of thing and, especially on the second order, I made sure to read as carefully as I could. But ... wrong again. (I ended up ordering for the Kindle Fire HD, instead of &#34;regular&#34; Kindle Fire that I had just obtained.)<br /><br />As usual, Amazon was good at taking back my original order and I was reimbursed as soon as they received it. But I still had to wait for it and, as I live in a rural area, didn't have any choices to buy at, say, a Target or such. I had to wait until I went to &#34;the city&#34; to buy and I would much rather buy from Amazon.<br /><br />I have noticed that the advertising on Amazon's website is more detailed the last few times I've been on it, so perhaps enough idiots (like me) complained! Thanks for this opportunity to review, by the way...

B00475AROS|5.0|Innovative, creative, funny, witty romantic: one of he best books in the last couple of years. I hope the quality remains the same in the next book.
0307120007|5.0|this is an awesome book, its very interactive for you and your baby, my baby loves it, you can feel all the defferent textures. i would def. recommend this book.
0345803485|4.0|Yes, the book has multiple grammatical errors... Yes, the intimate scenes are extremely awkward... But I still like the tortured romance. I'm sorry! What can I say!? I'm a sucker for a love story even if it's pathetic and choppy like this one! I got attached, I bought the second book too... I can't help myself... I have to know what happens... and guess what? I'm going to buy the third one later this month or early next month! If it's not for you, fine, but I think it's cute and sometimes it's just funny. I went through the book and actually highlighted the commonly used verbs and it's... Well it's bad, you should know that if you read any of the other reviews and I realize that this is trash compared to other pieces of American literature, but I think it's worth reading at least once, even if it's just to see what all the hype is about! If you're curious... I encourage you! Go for it! You'll never know until you try it yourself, right?
B002DD67XG|5.0|I have always enjoyed James Taylors music and singing ability. It comes from his heart and you can feel it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Once again PIxar has nailed it.  A story that speaks to today's daughters and mothers, but has been going on for generations and about family in general.  The animation is great, the story is great and the whole movie takes you to another time an place for while......
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I think this was more of a adult married couple kind of a movie. It was cute but i didn't really relate to it.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Simply the best fantasy book in a decade. Abercrombie could even write historic novels. Extraordinary characters, the bloody nine top of all. Nobody today manages to bring the reader in the mist of the action so vividly as Joe: you can almost smell the blood, the sweat... The Mages part should take less and less importance as it is the only weak part that at the same standard.
067144901X|5.0|i love this book and so does my baby, its simple and to the point, i would def. recommend this book.
0060989157|5.0|You hear alot of stories about The Crue and it seem that most of it is exaggerated. Read the book and you will know that alot of it has to be exaggerated. Nonetheless, it's still a great read.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|My 8 year old granddaughter loves the Ice Age movies and so was thrilled when I downloaded the game, but was bored very quickly. Didn't have enough of a challenge. Graphics were good.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Don't get me wrong...Awesome book...I just feel like about 3/4 of the way through it seemed \\"hurried\\".  It seemed like the author knew this was her last book and unless she wanted to.make it 800 pages she needed to start condensing.  The first two books and the first half of this one the story flowed well but then I feel as if she (the author) started skipping over things as well as left us hanging on some things...like what's to come of Mia and Ethan??? It also would have been nice to see more of a story on the pregnancy and birth of blip. I think rather than \\"rushing\\" this book a fourth book could have emerged. But still a great series look forward to the movie! Would LOVE to see Channing Tatum play Christian!!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I always like it when a third in a series can hold up to the first and second. I think i may have like<br />#3 better then # 2.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is probably the best ones of all of them! This is the best team to put together with these dimegods! You won't be disappointed
B0076DELIG|5.0|Loved the book.  Poor Harry Bosch has a black cloud over his head. Everybody is out to get him.<br /><br />As usual Harry's masterful deductive process solves a twenty year old cold case but not before he is nearly murdered himself.<br /><br />The book is too short.  I wanted another 100 pages.
0920668364|5.0|great book, my baby loves when i read it to him and a little part to sing, i would def. recommend this book to buy.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved this second book as much as the first in the series. Wish she would write more of them!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|New fan, reading all I can get.  Grisham appears incapable of writing a bad book.  As an aside, word requirement for any review is rediculous.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game itself is quite fun. I enjoy getting the ponies and watching them play, as well as the in game games. The only setbacks is that: 1. Even though the game tells you that you will not need to participate in the social networking aspect you will need to in order to gather the hearts in order to buy Scootaloo - a game mission.<br />2. You need to purchase gems, or wait a very long time, in order to gain enough gems to buy Sweetie Belle and Rarity.<br />3. It'd be nice to have a purchasing option for TimeTurner and some of the other \\"Play Game to Win\\" ponies. It is practically impossible to win a pony in the balloon pop game, AND it costs hearts or gems...so you either need to go social or spend actual money. :(<br />4. I've noticed glitches while trying to travel to friends games to leave gifts, and occasionally while loading the friends list -The glitch is that the game app will close or be unable to load the visiting Ponyville.<br />Still, the game is something that I enjoy in my spare time, so it's worth trying.
1451695195|5.0|My wife has encouraged me for some time to read her &#34;out of body experience&#34; books... which, of course, I never did.  For some reason, I was really intrigued when I heard the story of this guy on some radio show.  After reading the book, I'm pretty much blown away.  I'm a below average practicing Roman Catholic.  I have always believed in God, but have also always questioned my faith.  This story hit the main belief nerve big time... and the cool thing is that it had nothing to do with my Catholic faith.  It makes sense for anyone, irrespective of religion, because it makes sense outside a religious context...but also makes sense given a religious context.  The author is clearly brilliant and knows what he's talking about.  If it's complete fiction, then the guy deserves a pretty distinguished award, and I deserve some prozac...
0399226907|5.0|great book, my baby are intrigued by this book when i read it, i would def. recommend this book to buy.

B006S08RLU|5.0|I guess you have heard of the charm of this film or you wouldn't be here. So, I'll just add that I love it and her and the way she uses her little schemes to bring real joy and intrigue, or a little harm and slight terror, depending on who is worth what.<br /><br />Watch for the way this film is filmed, especially in the use of color. I like a movie which knows it is a visual art, too.
0765325950|5.0|This is a fine last entry into the series.<br /><br />Apparently, some people are annoyed because the ebook version is coming out several months later than the hard copy. The release dates for each medium were made apparent many months ago.<br /><br />I won't go into great detail about the book. It's the last in a long series. Chances are anyone moseying around these reviews is just looking for a last minute nudge on whether or not to purchase. I think this book is worth it. I like the world Robert Jordan created and I loved the way Brandon Sanderson has helped finish the series.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have read up to this point in the series this final entry will not let you down. It may also help rekindle your love of the series just as it ends.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Looper is a science fiction thriller with lots of twists and turns.<br />The plot is complicated and requires your full attention.<br />There is a sub-plot; romances between the two lead characters, a younger and older version of the &#34;looper&#34;.<br />Loopers are essentially time travelers with a license to kill.<br />There is a surprise ending that really makes this movie great!<br />This is not academy award stuff, just pure entertainment with lots of action.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I sat down to watch this movie. I suppose I was hoping for something like a new Star Man, Superman or Highlander. An extra-terrestrial here on Earth trying to sort out Galactic issues with some great action and thrills along the way.<br />  What I found instead was a very mediocre movie that couldn't seem to keep it's mind on it's purported plot. The script writing is very superficial and the characters rather lame. The \\"hero\\" is among the last of a dying race hiding on Earth from an evil force bent on his destruction and that of the Earth as well. Pretty heavy stuff.<br />  He however, seems far more concerned with social networking, scoring points with the local high school girls and naming stray dogs after retired Cleveland Browns Quarterbacks (Bernie Kozar)than in saving himself or the Earth, all of this to the steady pounding beat of an endless stream of pop music songs.<br />  Seriously, there are so many \\"special moment songs\\" meant to capture and frame different scenes, that if you closed your eyes you'd think that you were listening to the radio rather than watching a movie.<br />  There's nothing wrong with music in a movie or an appropriate meaningful song now and then - but you get the impression that they sat around and created the song play list from their MP3 player first and then tried to write a movie around it, rather than the other way around.<br />  Never mind that the \\"teenagers\\" in the movie are all played by \\"actors\\" in their mid to late twenties. Must have all been left behind a few times at graduation. But I digress.<br />  A couple of other things - the evil aliens who are going to destroy the planet seem about as threatening as your Uncle Earl with a few too many beers in him. Their Galactic evil knows no bounds as they alternatly make faces at random strangers out car windows while driving on the highway (ohhh that's scary), go to grocery stores to buy lots of frozen turkeys and apparently have enough free time left in their inter galactic day planner to cut side deals with random human bums hoping to solicit their help in conquering the planet because they just can't seem to get the job done by themselves. It's laughable, but not supposed to be.<br />  The props and make-up look to be left over from Buckaroo Banzai. The special effects are much more ordinary than they are special. It seems that low budget was a high priority here.<br />  I'm sure that the writers and producers were hoping to ride the popularity wave of the Twilight moview with this film being the first chapter of a hoped for new franchise. No such luck however, what they cranked out is much much less. Kind of like ordering a T-Bone steak and getting a White Castle burger instead. In a nutshell, this movie (script/acting/effects et all) is Ed Wood quality.<br />  This movie is not recommended and I suggest you save your two hours for something more likely to please. I think you'll be glad you did.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|As a baby boomer, I of course loved this story.  Not a fan of time travel plots, I believe Stephen King, not only made this plausible, but a wonderful visit to your own youth.
0765325950|1.0|And so we see the price to be paid by purposefully withholding the digital version to \\"pump up\\" hardback sales numbers.  The resulting three star average of this book probably drive net sales away, as will the fact that illegal digital versions have consequently proliferated on the web.  Similar to Apple's Maps program - \\"But aren't you HAPPY having us force you to use a product you do not prefer?\\" - there is a lesson to be learned.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|This book is stuffed full of interesting information.<br />I did like it but some of the info was not relevant to me.<br /><br />The best part was the accelerated learning section!<br />Loved it and it could be applied to anything.
038532653X|5.0|This lovely, pitch-perfect book proves that middle grade fiction can be spare and simple, yet still shine.<br /><br />Young Michael tries to cope with his infant sister's  life threatening illness while living an ordinary boy's life.  He plays soccer, visits with pals from school, and helps his father fixing up their new home and garden.  Michael discovers a mysterious stranger in the dilapidated shed with odd manners.  Is he a monster, angel, or something else?<br /><br />Michael befriends Mina, who is home schooled and has a penchant for William Blake's poetry and an obsession with flying creatures.  They embark upon a quiet journey and a moving friendship.  Together, they attempt to piece together the enigma of the man in the shed.  The beauty of this quiet story lies in the friendship between Mina and Michael, and the author's insistence on leaving some things unanswered.<br /><br />I wish more books for this age group were so lyrical and calm.  David Almond's book is a master work in restraint.  I particularly like Michael's interactions with Mina and her mother.  This friendship seems so true, and although I wish I could know more of these characters, the story is a perfect length and I was so satisfied with the resolution.<br /><br />This is a Printz Honor selection.  Almond addresses weighty issues like life, death, and the inevitable unknowable in between on a level that is just right for this age group. I am so impressed with Almond's grasp of the complexities of Michael and Mina's world.  He truly understands that although the world of a child is, on some level, simple-they are far from simplistic creatures.  Instead, children have a rich inner emotional life and high levels of creativity, sensitivity, and wonder inside them.  This book shows such respect for the characters and audience, and I would highly recommend this to any middle grade reader.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I chose this book because after the first one, I couldn't wait to read it..I love these characters the read is so fast, that I'm sad I have to wait till the next one comes out....this book just captivates you till the end...So I'll be anxiously waiting.....

It makes tagging on the tablet a frustrating experience.<br /><br />Haven't had too many other problems on the original Kindle Fire.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have watched all of the Harry Potter movies at the theatre after my nephew got me started I couldn't quit until I got to see all of them.  He said I should read the books so I am reading them on my Kindle Fire.  The movies have followed the books pretty closely.  Now I want to watch the movies again to compare with the book.  These are great stories and are good family reading and discussions.  Glad to find a reasonable solution to get all of the movies.
0345529057|5.0|In the A Song of Ice and Fire series, beginning with A Game of Thrones, George R  R. Martin has written a relentless, fast moving adventure based in a mythical but entirely believable world peopled with characters that you can admire, love, or love to hate. The cast is huge but somehow the text doesn't let you get lost, and if you do there is an excellent index of all the memorable characters and where they belong in the varied and fascinating landscape; from the warm south full of intrigue and dangerous alliances to the cold north which is separated by a huge ancient ice wall from the strange beings who live beyond it. The wall is supposed to be guarded by the black-garbed brothers-in-arms who forsake marriage and family too keep the kingdom safe, but, after eight thousand years, even they have almost forgotten why they are guarding it. Legends are just stories to entertain inn crowds on a blustery night or to frighten children. The wall guards are dangerously depleted in numbers so that it is impossible to watch the many miles of towering ice, and one of the cruel, freezing winters that can last for decades and has not occurred in living memory is coming.  The soul-freezing threat from the northern wastes stirs once more. Can the aristocrats forget their quarrels for long enough to organize the kingdom and save its people from the fast approaching horrors beyond the wall? This is a saga of immense power, compelling fascination and real characters who must fight to survive. I couldn't put the books down. Pauline A. Harris

B00ANA27IU|4.0|2001: A Space Odyssey obviously has some tarnish that it has picked up in the years since it was written. From the point of view of men living in 2013, we can look back and see the many points where Arthur C. Clarke almost ludicrously overestimated the March of science, and the few where his underestimation were just as dramatic.<br /><br />As a novel, however, 2001 holds the same literary quality it possessed when written in 1968.  The story captures in vivid detail the cold isolation and beautiful majesty of space, that unimaginable void which holds both fear and wonder for those who gaze up into the warm summer night. On the other hand, the story does have a few notable flaws which are often overlooked due to its near iconic quality. Why would the U.S. government send five people on a research vessel watched over by a computer with no need for food, water, or oxygen?  These don't detract too much from the overall quality, but they are fairly major potholes.

I was a little irritating in the beginning because the leader of the bellas was so stuck in her way while all the will Beca was an amazing music producer and she is pretty sic at what she loved to do.  Over all I liked it because the end did justice for the movie!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I enjoyed this series.  It felt a bit like the Hunger Games, Divergent, and Ender's Game all mixed into one.  Not very original, but interesting nonetheless

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first 2 books were great, but book 3 was pretty terrible. It felt like she did a huge build up of the characters in books 1 & 2, just to let them fizzle out in a drug induced stupor in book 3. It was VERY disappointing, to say the least.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I love Jeremy Renner, point, blank, period. His acting was great. The film kept with the story line and I like that  they had all this going on at the same time Bourne Ultimatum was going on.
1594484805|5.0|I think that the length of the book is a bit extensive because the main points were covered by the first half of the book and it could have been shorter and to the point. The other part of the book is a guide for you to try out his motivation techniques in your life and some of them are very interesting like the websites for schools that are based on intrinsic motivators so children will grow up to be what they want to be by giving them autonomy, mastery and purpose to be in something bigger than what they are.<br /><br />He chose to tell many stories to make the content relatable with real life companies that work with these principles and inspire others to follow. On the other hand not all companies will be able to follow because their cultures or business structure will not allow them to get out of the line restrictions given by society norms.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people that are looking how to improve their business and be part of today's changing world, the motivators that motivate us to do magnificent works that will fulfill our lives with something more than a paycheck.

The Marware case also has built-in features that the Amazon case does not offer.  These include the ability to rotate the screen to landscape and portrait positions for viewing while the Amazon case doesn't really offer a stable portrait option.  As a reader, I find myself wishing the Amazon case had a built-in hand strap like the Marware case.  That said, the Amazon case has a very slim profile and doesn't add a lot of weight to the device.  I do wish it had an elastic strap to hold the case shut so I would feel a bit more secure about it riding around in my hand bag.  That said, the larger Marware version with all the bells and whistles does not easily fit in my purse.<br /><br />Here's how it breaks down:<br /><br />Amazon Standing Leather Case:<br /><br />nice leather materials<br />great fit - no ports obstructed and nothing is loose<br />feels good in the hand<br />effective rubber edges act as bumpers and help hold it open for viewing<br />small profile<br />lightweight<br /><br />Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case:<br /><br />nice leather materials - feels good in the hand<br />great fit - no ports obstructed and nothing is loose<br />feels good in the hand<br />provides a hand strap for extended viewing and reading<br />has an elastic strap to ensure that the case stays shut<br />swivel allows for portrait and landscape hands-free viewing<br />larger profile<br /><br />I'm a reader, so the options provided by the Marware case appeal a little more to me in terms of how I use and carry my Kindle.

B002QE3CTY|3.0|The book starts with a bang and really pulls you in.  Eventually you find yourself reaching to try and find something else in the plot.  The long mundane middle could have been shortened considerably.  The ending was a bit of a puzzle. I will reluctantly buy the rest of the series only to satisfy my curiosity as to what happens with the group of adolescents I have grown to care about.

B006MR2ZQC|4.0|We bought this for our 8-year-old son for Christmas.  He had recently gotten &#34;Lego Batman 2&#34;, and got really interested in Batman and the other Justice Leaguers, so he wanted the Lego versions.  The set has a lot of cool things (trap door, rolling cart, Robin hanging upside-down, but in some ways, it's almost too much.  It's not a particularly sturdy set, unlike most of the other ones he has.  If you try to pick it up, it will fall apart.  I'm trying to find spots where I can add some support so the bottom floor and the &#34;pillars&#34; don't fall apart when you pick it up.<br /><br />Other than that tiny issue, this is great.  It comes with Batman, Robin, Joker, Riddler, and Harley Quinn.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I downloaded this application to my Kindle Fire, and don't get me wrong, I love to use this application, as I write sometimes and it is exactly what I need to be able to write anywhere.  But, there are two major problems with it that make me not want to use it. The first one is that whenever I tap the delete button it will not let me delete, instead I have to hold the delete button and most times I end up going past what I wanted to.  The second problem, even bigger than the other, is that even though I have my Kindle Fire Keyboard Settings Auto-Complete Words turned off, Kingsoft Office still does it.  I noticed that it usually only happens when I start typing, space and then backspace and continue typing, (and I think when I pause before completing the word), I can be trying to type \\"Looking\\" and unless I type it extremely quickly or do not accidentely space, it will let me type Lo, and then auto-complete when I type the second o to Loa.  Those two things have made it extremely difficult to type, and have turned me away from this app for now, which is why I give it 3 stars.

1616960922|5.0|This was a great read. To say that this book takes place in the same world as Elantris may be a bit of a stretch - while it may be on the same *planet*, there's very little commonality between the setting of this book and the setting of Elantris. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the sparse traces of Elantris found in this book.<br /><br />The story in the book was riveting, the magic woven into the story was incredibly interesting, and the characters were deep. Fans of Sanderson's writing won't be disappointed.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is great at keeping interest and has a good message to it. Although, I am far too lazy to type a whole review on it. All I can say is read it. You definitely will not regret it.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I LOVE this album!!!!!  It is spectacular!!  I have been a Bee Gee's fan for many years and would have loved to be at a live concert at some point in my life.  It is sad that Robyn and Maurice are gone and the world is deprived of many more years of this outstanding music.<br /><br />I listen to these guys every day when I am working out.  Besides the music being fabulous, the quality of the audio and video is great.  I would recommend this album to everyone!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is one of the very few apps I found that will simulate a sort of \\"painting\\" effect. I really would love an app that simulates an oil painting.<br /><br />That said, this is fun to play with. You can bring a photo in and play with it, or you can take a photo drectly through the app. There are a lot of options with the little slide buttns to change the appearance with in each seperate effect.<br /><br />I was disappointed because it wasn't what I was really looking for, but after playing with it, it has really grown on me. I give it 5 stars, because a lot of thought went into this little app.<br /><br />Would love to see an oils affect added.<br /><br />Thanks for making this app. I find it well worth the money.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself an avid Stephen King reader, but in the past had read several of his biggest hits.  This was my first King novel in probably 15 years.  I had been accustomed to his horror stories but a time travel/love story was a refreshing break.  I read this while on a beach vacation and it was a quick read even though it was extremely long.  He did his best to explain away many of the contradictions of time travel so it was easy to take a leap of faith.  I am not an expert on string theory but it seemed to take a part.  Perhaps the cadence of the book could have been quickened a bit, as each time the main character goes back in time he has to start at the beginning - and some of the subplots, such as a school show, didn't have to be repeated in detail.  But I will forgive those minor shortcomings for an otherwise entertaining diversion.  King's vision of &#34;what might have been&#34; had JFK not been assassinated was intriguing and can give us comfort that sometimes things work out for the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A novel that holds your interest as the characters struggle to maintain some dignity while being forced into a situation that would have most people frightened to death. The protagonist is an extremely likeable person and that makes the pages fly by ...
B004V9T19W|5.0|Great gift I gave my fiance on his birthday. He loves Tron and it came with a Tron Light Cycle. The product was as described and reasonably priced. Very happy with the seller and product! Quick shipping, too!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am currently using this backpack to carry my Canon Rebel T3I.  I can easily fit the camera body, three lenses, a speedlite and several cleaning supplies in the main compartment.  Likely could fit another lens or two if needed.  On top of all that storage, I have confidence that it is all secure inside the backpack.<br /><br />The main compartment is very nicely padded.  It also has several velcro straps to secure larger things, such as a camera body.  All of the padding is adjustable, it's all secured with velcro and can be moved around to fit whatever you want to carry.  The other compartments (there are three in total)  are very small.  The secondary compartment could possibly be used to carry a small laptop, though I wouldn't recommend it since it lacks the protection the main compartment offers.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this backpack.  The only thing I'm not sure of is whether it would hold up in the rain.  However, the outside material is quite rugged, so it may.
B006O6F932|4.0|Wasn't as easy to set up and put together as I thought it would but ovberall it is a childrens castle house and shge is very happy with the gift.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a seriously good series. I read the whole thing in a very short time, sacrificing a lot of sleep to get through it quickly. In its own way, as good as the Hunger Games.
0425252868|5.0|This story gave a different perspective of the German Air Force during WWII that I was not aware of. I was surprised at how religious and ant-Nazi they were. They were very concerned about the welfare of the pilots they shot down. The life of the B-17 pilots like Charlie Brown, again showed a side of young humanity of the Greatest Generation thoughts, fears, loves, strengths and weaknesses. It is one of those books that is hard to put down!
B004LROUW2|3.0|I couldn't wait to find out how this book brought it all together, and thought with so much more to go it was really going to be spectacular.  I was caught up in the suspense and twists.  And then the last 300 pages started me wishing I could just skip to the end.  What a shame because I was throughly enjoying the first 600 pages.  So, 2/3rds of a book that is great and 1/3 that is a total drag...
145210655X|5.0|Great for any Star Wars fan with Children! I bought this for my husband and we have a 4 year old so it was perfect! A fun gift.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is engaging and fast paced.  I couldn't put it down!  Great character building and an eerily realistic future.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun app.  There is one downfall to it though, and that is that everytime you start a new deal, an add pops up.  That is the only downfall and is somewhat annoying.
B0076DELIG|5.0|What I mean by the title is that this series has been a staple in my fiction reading for a decade, and it is not going to change. So long as Connelly is willing to write these (and the Mickey Haller off shoot), I am willing to read them. They are the pinnacle of the genre.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is great for the kids and even fun for mommy. It is worth every single penny. Highly recommended by all.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Raising 3 kids with a wide range of ages, I can relate to lots of the stages described in the book, and often wished I had the steel of the Tiger Mom, even as a Dad.  Of course I fall in her Western paradigm, but would like to take a few things from her playbook.  The book made me laugh out loud so often, and I found myself reading long passages to my wife, as I couldn't possibly explain it properly without reading word-for-word.  That to me says it is a book well worth reading.<br /><br />She is right, it is so hard on a parent to try keep up that level of pressure.  Seems impossible in this day and age, and with her workload, even more so.  Impressive and maybe insane.
143911000X|5.0|We love HIMYM, and I thought my bf would get a kick out of this little book, so I picked it up as part of his b-day gift. It’s a nice, short read for anyone who enjoys the show. Reads easy and fast.<br />Please!~ do not buy this if you are expecting a book with filled pages; it is just verses of the “bro-code” on each page with some illustrations and it’ll probably take less than an hour to read through. Also, do not take this book seriously! I see reviews from women who were offended by this, but it is just a book for fans of the show!! Keep that in mind before writing a review!<br />Overall, I think you will like this if you enjoy the show and Barney’s character!<br />Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that it was so hard to put it down! I can't wait for the next book!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|My first Jack Reacher book [61 Hours] was just 3 to 4 weeks ago and  now I am a big Jack Reacher fan.  I finished &#34; A Wanted Man&#34; a couple of weeks ago, and it was just as good if not better.  I am now in the process of reading Lee Child's first Jack Reacher novel, &#34;Killing Floor&#34;.
B0040JHNZ2|3.0|Contains some interesting social history detail but is unconvincing as a novel. Too many stereotypes and coincidences and incidental material which adds nothing to the narrative.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It started out very slow and I almost stopped reading it. Glad I didnt because it took off with heated passion and unexpected twists!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I am really enjoying using it to add my photos to my Kindle Fire. It is pretty easy to use, but it did trial and error to figure out - how to download the app to more than one computer, how to organize photos into folders, etc.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her hike on the Pacific Crest Trail and her reflections on her life before and after is fascinating and very readable. Dealing with misfortune and learning from experience are themes which offer much for the reader's own reflection.

B004KPQK2S|1.0|I'm sure the movie is fine but u was unable to view it in any devise I tried. It would never open.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Bought two and gave to my nephews.  Ages were 10 & 14, and I would say they were a little hard for them.  I even tried it and got mad at it.  If you like a challenge this is the toy for you.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|The DVD is wonderful! Meryl definitely gave a worty oscar winning performance in this movie.  She is defintely a national treasure in Hollywood.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|Thou it was a deep subject, it thought this book was good. The way it was written was such a way you felt as though you were inside the mothers head. So many emotions , some sad, some distressing. Overall a good read.
B004TI5N38|4.0|If you can get past the oft cited comparison to Jack Reacher,this book is what it is : a well written,good story.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I enjoy; the game very much.  I am alone a lot and it hellps me get through the day. I also think; it is very cute.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Well written, enjoyable story that kept my interest. I downloaded her other book the &#34;forgotten Garden&#34; because I enjoyed this one so much.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|As an autobiography, this is an interesting read. Relevant to her NDE, however, there's not much here. Too, her claim of a miracle healing is, in my view, convoluted. The story goes: in her final stages of cancer, she is hospitalized, has a NDE, and then after returning receives cancer treatment and is cured. I'd buy the miracle without the treatment, but the miracle following traditional treatment just doesn't ring true for me. I appreciate the author's search for meaning, and her struggle with various cultural roles are heartfelt and well articulated, and I believe she experienced a miracle of sorts...I'm just not sure exactly what that miracle was.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game, like it alot. It is a game that offers things for real money, but you never need to. I have most of the epic dragons and got them without spending a penny. Be prepared to spend time, it is slow paced (weeks). They update alot, so there is new content, and holiday related items.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was a good read. It should have been written before the previous book so to provide connection. But all in all I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
0812982622|5.0|Johnson's book elucidates life in the insular and isolated North Korean Republic. However, this book is not for the faint-hearted. Some of the descriptions, often passed off matter of factly, have really depressed and discomforted book club partners.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Highly recommended to be part of your reading collection. Best suspense-thriller novel I haven't been able to put down. I'm now a Gillian Flynn fan for life!
0061020680|5.0|Terry Pratchett has not written a book that is less than excellent. This book is one with Death taking an interest in mortals in a most unusual way.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I again downloaded this game as it was to be free, but it comes up with tokens to purchase - and I do not want to play if that is the case.  How to delete?????
B008KE3960|4.0|This is one of those simple apps that can keep you engaged for a while. Nice easy controls, just drag a line and your plane follows it. It is a tower defence sort of game, but you dont have towers, you have planes. As you play , you earn gears to buy new planes and unlock more boards. I like the controls and gameplay. The graphic are simple, but look nice on my 10&#34; screen. My son plays on a phone, but it seemed too small to me.
B005CMGKTG|5.0|There have been many live adaptations of cartoons from the 80s and this is one of the best ones I've seen.  I with there was a blu ray version in English.  I hope they make more of these films.  It rocked!
030758836X|3.0|I purchased this book to have a fun and thought provoking winter read. Unfortunately, I figured out where it was going after Part 1
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I was really excited for this film to come out. I love Pixar films and the animation was so beautiful. The idea of an independent Scottish princess was also very attractive to me since I like strong female characters and the Celtic cultures. However, the film just lacked plot. The concept is similar to Brother Bear, but not nearly as moving. Merida is independent and rebellious, but not really in an inspiring way like Pocahontas or Mulan were. She's actually a bit of a brat. I understand not wanting to marry when you're not in love and I think that's a worthy cause, but she's outright awful to her mother. It's not just back-talking, either. She carelessly gives her mother an enchanted tart that a witch said would \\"change her fate,\\" without having any thought into what the consequences might be. So then the consequences are bad and the rest of the movie is focused on fixing her mistake while also rekindling ties with her mother. In the end it's cute and happy, but not as satisfying as most Pixar films.<br /><br />Overall, the film is okay. I just expected a more interesting plot from Pixar, but instead it seemed like a bad copy of another film. It was a shame to waste such gorgeous animation. Merida's hair was awesome.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Need to watch the other Bourne movies before watching this one.  It references them quite often though out the movie.  But great action and fantastic continuation of the story!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Wonderful movie to watch with the family.  It is a kid friendly movie that is enjoyed by adults as well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was very enjoyable!!! THE RACKETEER was great. I hated to see it end! I think everyone would enjoy it.
0756405890|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The world and characters are a nice breathe of fresh air.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Okay, so Bruce is Bruce, and if you love his lyrics and energy you will love the recording. Kudos, kudos.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This is such an enjoyable movie. I can watch it multiple times without it getting to be &#34;too much&#34;.  A truly beautiful family movie for kids and adults to watch together.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|There are so many excellent reviews written about this book that I find it hard to add any value to the discussion.  Just about everything that should be said has been said.  This is my first book by Michael Lewis; and after finishing The Big Short, I quickly purchased Liar's Poker.  I'm sure it will be a great read as well.<br /><br />One of the things that strikes me is how obvious it is that many people should have gone to jail as fraudsters, but they ended up just \\"moving on\\", many with millions in their pockets.  It's apparent that Wall Street is just a unstoppable corruption machine, a kind of \\"beast\\" that is mostly immune to criminal prosecution.  The US government lends trillions to corporate criminals instead of putting them in jail where they belong.<br /><br />As an active investor, it is good to have the knowledge in mind that Wall Street would gladly fluke you out of every dime of your money if they could; and your government cannot and will not protect you from the crimes on Wall Street.  Yes, a youngster can sell a bit of pot that really hurts no one, less serious than a few shots of legal alcohol and their life is ruined; yet defraud people in the financial world of billions of dollars and you can apply for a loan from a trillion dollar bailout program and get a bonus.<br /><br />It's unbelievable what a topsy-turvy world we live in,  mostly created by Wall Street and greed.  The \\"beast\\" is unstoppable and never sleeps.  The fraud and corruption continues each day; and the sleeping dragon grows strong; and sometime in the future it will rise again.  It's quite simply unstoppable, obviously.<br /><br />Halfway through The Big Short I began to feel a bit sick to my stomach over the greed of the corporate players identified in the book.  It would have been more satisfying, as a reader, if the heros were rewarded by their heroic efforts and the evil greedy criminals were punished; but that would have been the emotionally satisfying outcome of a Hollywood blockbuster.  In real life, as in this great book, the heros are mostly hated and the criminals are glorified and given fat Wall Street paychecks.<br /><br />The fact that any of these criminal firms are still in business, including the rating companies and big financial firms, and their key players are not in jail is a strong statement on the dystopian state of our world today.<br /><br />As a big fan of dystopian science fiction, The Big Short enabled me to understand that we don't have too look ahead in a science fiction novel to find a dystopian world.  We are living in one today.... and it's not going to get any better.  As they say, truth is stranger than fiction; and the story in this book makes fiction seem lame and boring.<br /><br />Thank you Micheal Lewis for the hard work you put into writing and publishing this excellent book.blockbuster.

6305622914|5.0|I just received the DVD and I had to watch it right away.  I saw it many years ago and it is just as funny as it was then.  Thank Goodness for captioning.  Sometimes they were a little hard to understand.  Also, the music is absolutely great!  I have the CD and play it in my car all the time.
