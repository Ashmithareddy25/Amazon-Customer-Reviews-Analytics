B001GQSY5K|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, I'm 25 and could tell that it's been geared more towards younger kids, but I still liked it being a pretty big Star wars fan.
0312383320|4.0|There have been several reviewer comments about Stephanie growing (or not growing).  My concern is not so much growing - as learning.  She seems to continually fail to learn from her mistakes (particularly as a bounty hunter).  She and Lula repeatedly make the same farcical blunders every time they attempt to apprehend an FTA.  One would think she would learn rather than continuing to re-make them time and time again.  Once is funny; multiple times is dumb.      Yes, there were numerous LOL sections.  We've got the Ranger \\"Babe\\" so ingrained in our psyches all she has to do is print that word and we know the scenario exactly (his \\"Babe\\" when seeing a car full of monkeys had me in stitches).  Her grandmother, as always, provides gales of laughter (I laughed so hard I woke up the cat).   It was my Evanovich fix - to hold me over until the next number hits the stores.
0385513755|4.0|I first learn about The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, through my father and older sister who read it before me, then I watched the movie and after a few years I decided to read it for my high school Humanities class. The Da Vinci Code was a very long book but quite easy to read for me.<br /><br />I borrowed the special illustrated edition from the public library since I was not sure if I wanted to spend the money to buy the book. The special illustrated edition helped me a lot in imagining the places in The Da Vinci Code so I could almost be in the book itself. Sometimes I could not believe that what some of the stuff in the books where real, but pictures in the book helped me believe it was somewhat real. One of the most interesting pictures was The Last Supper because I never knew one of the people at the table had been a woman and possibly Mary Magdalene and I had to look at it more carefully to see if it was really a woman. Also pictures like the Château Villette and the Arc De Triomphe helped me see another part of the world because I have not visited countries outside of the United States. Sometimes it was hard to choose if something sounded or looked real because I knew that not everything was real in this fictional book. As I read the book, I constantly questioned myself whether the things where true or false.<br /><br />It was also challenging to see if I could figure out the puzzles before I read the answers to them. Many of the puzzles where anagrams and one of the anagrams are Amon L'isa which is Egyptian gods called Amon and Isis who was called L'isa. The anagram answer was Mona Lisa. The book had so many hard puzzles I could only figure out a few on my own. If I did not figure it out, eventually the book would explain and answer the puzzle usually in the same chapter. The Da Vinci Code was very easy to read and when the stories of Silas, the albino and Professor Langdon and Sophie all came together it became very exciting and it hooks you in. While Silas was looking for the keystone, Professor Langdon had received it, not knowingly what the keystone was, from Jacque's bank. In the book it was extremely appealing when Professor Langdon or any of the other characters told about Leonardo Da Vinci and his pieces of work. Some of them include the cryptex, The Madonna of the Rocks, Mona Lisa and many more invention and paintings.<br /><br />Although parts of the plot where a little boring and long, the places and objects Dan Brown described where very attention-grabbing. One of the most interesting thing was the number PHI, the golden ratio. PHI was very interesting because Professor Langdon explains that PHI is called the Divine Proportion and he told if you get the number of female bees and divide them by the number or male bees you get PHI and if you measure your height and divide by the distance from your belly button to the floor you also get the same result, PHI.<br /><br />Overall I think the book is quite easy to read and is a good book and almost anyone could read it, but it could take a little bit of time. Now that I've read the book I would recommend people to buy the book or the regular one because it's a nice collection to your personal library.or the keystone, Professor Langdon had received it, not knowingly what the keystone was, from Jacque's bank.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the most moving and compelling projects ever done on WWII.  My husband and I have watched it several times, enjoying it each time equally as much as the first time we viewed it.
B001QB9H10|2.0|It Plays, however, sounds terrible in the drive and does not down load so I can not copy it to my Ipod. Movie was good.....
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The movie in blu ray adds another dimension with the IMAX scenes. The sound and image for the scenes is unforgettable and overall the movie is fantastic.
B000FMBCUK|3.0|A pop masterpiece in one respect but a completely over indulgent overload of crap in another. Much like the bubble-gum it is the album is good for a while but looses flavor fast and then becomes dull and annoying to have just taking up space in your mouth or on your record shelf.<br /><br />There is a reason why with pop albums of the 1970's people only remember the hit singles off albums like this. Now obviously the hit singles are the majority of the album making up 6 of the 11 tracks but what isn't a hit single is virtually awful. 'Second Hand News' was nothing more than a nice acoustic melody ruined by Buckingham's annoying lyrics and vocals. 'Never Going Back Again' suffers equally. 'Songbird' shoots for a Carpenter's thing but lands angerly around Captain and Tenniel territory. Yikes! 'I Don't Want To Know' suffers from the enough with this whole \\"I'm on coke and the person I'm dating in the band is cheating on me\\" more than any of the other tracks on the album which by this point has worn frail. 'Oh Daddy' is trite and the fact that it was let to go on the album should have led to someone at the record company loosing their job.<br /><br />The hit singles, which is whats left on the album are nice and feature decent musicianship from Lindsay Buckingham who is an admittedly underrated guitarist but nothing more. Really the only tracks with substance are those from that coked out gypsy that calls herself Stevie Nicks. 'Dreams' is bitter-sweet and the only 'true' classic on the album as far as I'm concerned. 'Gold Dust Woman' is basically saved by it's dry production and atmosphere.<br /><br />Rumours is essentially the sound of Fleetwood Mac dying. This album of infidelity and  coke abuse is what would be the groups eventual downfall and destroy them in the coming decade but somehow still stands as a classic.
B00102FELM|4.0|I bought this DVD because it features a few songs with Uli Roth performing again with the Scorpions. I wasn't let down, though Uli could have been up in the mix a little more and it would have been nice to see him perform on more of the songs. His playing is as awesome as ever. It was also nice to see Herman Rarebell return to play drums on three songs. My biggest disappointment was the songs that added Michael Schenker back into the mix. He kinda butchered 'Coast To Coast\\" and his playing on the other songs that featured him was pretty lack luster. This bummed me out because I'm also a huge Michael Schenker fan. Klaus Meine, Rudolph Schenker and Matthias Jabs all deliver solid performances, as they usually do. All in all it is a must have for all diehard Uli-era Scorpions fans.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|I know many adults and older teens who curl their lip and snarl when anyone mentions any of the HSM movies, but does anyone remember West Side Story, Grease, Oliver, or even Oklahoma? Yes, it's fake for the characters to break into song in the middle of the cafeteria, but it's a MUSICAL--that's what is supposed to happen! The story is a little sappy--but tell me how realistic Grease was? I applaud the return of the musical to the screen; I think the younger generations have been missing out on an important music genre!!
B0000C9ZBW|2.0|The watch is handsome like many Skagen watches but the clasp is delicate, weak and breakable and it lacks a \\"second\\" hand, again, like many skagen watches.
B001GQACGO|1.0|I was so excited when I heard Beyonce call I Am...Sasha Fierce her strongest albmu lyrically; when I got the album home, I was slightly impressed with the Beyonce half, but the sasha fierce half was an amazing disappointment.  I dont think that this is Album as a whole has strong lyrics...maybe Beyonce doesnt know what a strong lyric is.      The saving grace of the set as a whole is the I Am Beyonce half because Beyonce's voice puts depth and feeling into the songs.  The songs themselves are uninspired, because they only look at things from the surface and they never touch any type of complexity.  Many of the songs are melodramtic, and it gets old after song 4.  The saddest part of the I Am Beyonce half is that I never get to see Beyonce alone, all of the songs on the I Am Beyonce half are about a relationship so we never get to know Beyonce as a woman.  We just get to see the Beyonce that we have always seen.      I Am Sasha Fierce half is filled with vapid lyrics and simular beat structure which makes most of the songs blend together into one messy whole.  Sasha Fierce seems too complacent and I feel as though the Sasha Fierce half was just recorded quickly because they couldnt find anymore songs that would fit the Beyonce half.  There are also some songs on this half that I feel could fit on the I Am Beyonce album, which shows me that the I Am Sasha Fierce half of the album is added to give some much needed variety, but was not really thought through.      The saddest part of the whole set, is that Beyonce earnestly believes that she is doing something that is original in Pop; it may be very original for Beyonce, but many artists have been adding the same influences into their music since the 80's.  I am totally disappointed in this album and I feel like everyone should get 20 people to pitch in 75 cents so that you all can buy one album and then use itunes to import it into your ipod.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Highly recommend the Bluray quality of this movies.  You can pick up details you did not see before.  I have the DVD collection of these movies, but it just doesn't compare to HD quality of these films.  It would cost a whole lot more to buy individually.  I'm glad I bought this collection!
B0015DROBO|1.0|This book was very very boring, and the characters you are suppose to like are comletely odious. Reading this book was a waste of time.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|To be honest I devoured this entire series and found it very entertaining. And I was not at all disappointed as so many other were in the 4th and final novel. We are talking about Vampires and Werewolves for God's sakes. My attention was kept the entire time and it was guilty pleasure reading. I'm a 38 year old guy so I think the demographic reaches a lot wider than most realize. It was fun, I'm glad I read these books and I'm certainly ready to move on.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|The moment the music started, my expectations lowered. Then the Signature Bond theme song didn't play, which sets the tone for the much anticipated Bond Experience.    It didn't feel like a Bond movie b/c they tried to change everything so it wouldn't resemble the Bond movies we  know and love and gladly pay for. Why make it a James Bond movie at all? Call it \\"Gritty, Grumpy, Boring Rogue Spy with No Chemistry and No Fun Toys Movie\\". Seriously, did you even have to make the Martini annoying? I was snoring by the time they finished explaining what went in it just so we would know that you had changed that too.     And to Paul Haggis, if you want to be self serving, please do it with something you create, not go and ruin this previously fun Bond Franchise. You weren't out to please The Bond audience,that's for sure, you wanted to capture our money and give us something that doesn't resemble Bond at all. We, the loyal followers, want the wry wit, clever actions and the sophisticated, smooth nature of the character. We want the fun technologies, cars with outlandish capabilities and stellar music.     And Marc Forster as the director didn't do anything to liven it up at all, but decidedly did the exact opposite. We expect and want to be swept away in escapism, that is what Bond used to give us. Even the little details like missing the Bond music that used to come flooding in when he gets busy with the Bondgirls. There wasn't even any kissing in this movie. They showed Fields after she supposedly slept with him saying she was mad at herself. Well honey, I was pissed off the whole movie!    Matt Chesse and Richard Pearson chopped up the movie so badly in editing you can't even tell what was happening in some of the action scenes.     To add insult to injury, they play the Bond theme at the end of the movie. What's the point, to stab us in the heart? So we could miss what we lost even more? It made me momentarily hopeful that what I just saw wasn't the real movie and the real one was now going to come on.    Until someone that understands the culture of Bond comes in and brings back a REAL Bond movie, I won't be fooled again into shelling out money for the ruination of Bond.       Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, you should be ashamed of yourselves for what you have done to Bond. 50 lashes and no dessert for the rest of your lives. And trust me, that won't be nearly as torturesome and disappointing to you as this movie was to me and the rest of us Bondies.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|Overall it's an excellent model. I especially like the movable jaw and how the upper teeth overlap the lower jaw like the real thing. Though it's kinda strange that it also resembles that Godzilla in that movie that Mathew Broaderick was in.
0920668364|5.0|My mom used to sing a song to me with these words in it...I never knew it was a children's book until a few years ago...I used to cry and cry. She said that she would sing it for my sister and she never cared. So she thought I was smarter because I understood the story! haha.     Its a saaaaaad story, but a good one. I think better for older children
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This cd is everything that people made it out to be. It is absolutely amazing. Taylor Swift is a musical genius!   There is not one girl out there that can't relate to atleast one or all of Taylors songs. They are so heartfelt and amazing, they are written straight from the heart. Its almost as if you and Taylor are best friends and you told her about the boys who broke your heart and she wrote a song about them. She is amazing and I think everyone out there should own a copy of this cd. You won't be dissapointed.
0240810961|5.0|These two volumes are a master class in Disney style animation thinking. Essentially, a goldmine of what we learned here at Disney as young animators trying to follow in the shoes of the masters of the craft of character animation. I was lucky enough to have been taught every one of these lessons from Walt himself over my thirty years and running as an animator/story man/director/designer at Walt Disney Studios. I only wish you all could have met the man who brings this wealth of knowledge to these pages. He made you feel good just being around him. He was never dour or sour or in any way unhappy. If he was, he hid it completely from us. He was the coolest \\"old guy\\" you could ever hope to be taught by. Athletic, youthful in every way, passionate, inquisitive, searching and digging for the answers all the time. He stayed hungry for improvement his entire life and we all try to emulate that to this day and make our teacher and friend proud of us for trying. You will not only most definitely be a better artist after reading these volumes I practically guarantee you will be a better person for having gotten to know Walt Stanchfield and his way of looking at life and art as one. We all feel this way at Disney, believe me.
B001HN69AE|4.0|As a fan of the Dragon Ball series, I (like so many others) was expecting a poo fest with this adaptation after seeing images on the net and reading spoilers. After seeing the movie I must admit that it was exactly the reversed of what I thought. This movie is great as long as you understand it's design. This film was never intended to be a carbon copy of the Dragon Ball series AND IT IS NOT DRAGON BALL Z. The creators adjusted the story of the original Dragon Ball, which is an origin story, to fit a new audience. Many have complained that the movie is not what it was supposed to be. It was exactly what it was supposed to be. Yes, elements of the original story had to be either altered or changed. this is true with any peace of production whether film or written.     If you are a true fan of the Dragon Ball series, you will look past the necessary alterations and realize that the movie captures the important elements of the Dragon Ball universe. Goku is an alien who was sent to Earth to destroy it but did not after being raised by the kindly Gohan. Piccolo is an alien (yes, they do call him a Namek) seeking revenge for being sealed away for thousands of years. Goku turns into his Oozaru (giant ape) form. Goku and company must travel around the world gathering the seven magic Dragon Balls, learning new martial arts from Master Roshi, to save the world from being destroyed. Goku has the same funny attitude he had in the series. Master Roshi's perverted attitude was toned down for the younger audience, but that is a good thing. Goku learns the Kamahamaha from Roshi.     All the important elements are here. the movie was great for an American adaptation of a Japanese anime. Marsters did a fantastic job as Piccolo and really made sure that the heart of the series was captured in a new and exciting way with his input. This is a movie that should be seen over and over again by fans. Those new to the series should really enjoy it. This film is for anyone who is a fan of martial arts, sci-fi, adventure, and action movies. And yes, there are explosions. JOY!
B0011HF6GE|4.0|For Emma, Forever Ago is one of those works of music that is hard to say exactly what it is about it that connects.  For me, it's like reading poetry that I really don't understand, but leaves a ghostly trace for some moments afterward, that intuitively tells me this was time well spent.    Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks\\" would probably be the epitome of this and I am not implying that this album approaches that level, but it flows, is lyrical in word and music and just sounds right. Justin Vernon certainly has developed his own sound and it will be interesting to see where he goes.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I saw the movie, \\"Same Time, Next Year\\" several times before finally purchasing it on DVD a few years ago.  I absolutely loved the movie.  Alan Alda was so hilarious.  Both Alan Alda's and Ellen Burstyn's performances were superb.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh and wants to leave a movie with a light hearted and uplifted feeling.     Joan
B00005N5S5|2.0|I did not get the product advertised, it was NOT a special edition copy. It was the regular version.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I have loved this show since the first episode.  Each show is better then the last.  The two young men, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, are incredible actors.  This is by far the best, horror, drama, comedy and family show on television  If you have not watched it, you are missing a rare treat.  Round Season out with Jim Beaver as Bobby Singer and Misha Collins as the angel, Castiel, and you have quiet a good cast.  I have missed Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the boys' father.  He says he hopes they will bring him back for the final season.  Eric Kripke quits after season 5 and it will depend on the CW if it continues.  If their contracts are up, both Ackles and Padalecki don't want to continue so we will have to see.<br /><br />I would like to know why they are splitting this season and making two Season 4s part 1 and 2 for England.  They are getting the first 11 episodes on April 27.
B00004S35Z|5.0|I really like most all of the music on this CD. I heard most of these songs back in the summer of 1992 (June-August 1992) Some of the music really resonates with my Soul-Spirit. Thanks!    Dave

B001JNNDGA|5.0|\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is an impressive cinematographic art piece, and in Blu-ray it is stunning as well as awesome. Gibson's work is a masterpiece which comes alive in every detail through this format. \\"The Passion...\\" in Blu-ray helped make this Easter so spiritually powerful!!!
B001KNUQ8M|5.0|One of my favorite albums and one of The Band's best, their self titled second album sounds terrific in this remaster. The sound stage, dynamics and detail that are often missing from \\"modern\\" remasters are all here. Audio Fidelity has done a nice job with this reissue and Steve Hoffman's remaster nicely captures the warmth of the original recording and Hoffman uses the original master tape for the first time since the original pressing of the album (let's just say that one band member has had it all this time and wouldn't give it up).<br /><br />If you're going to buy the regular remaster from 2000 that sounds pretty good as well and does have the advantage of the additional alternate takes for other tracks on the album but it doesn't sound as clear and warm as this edition.<br /><br />The big difference between this and the previous reissue aside from the master being used for the first time in years is that this has only the original 12 tracks for the album plus \\"Get Up Jake\\" an outtake from the sessions that should have been on the original album. The outtakes that were on the reissue of the album aren't here but that's a small issue for me as this album has never sounded this good on compact disc before.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|Very Tommy Lee Jones movie.  Good action movie.  Strange movie, left me wanting a better ending.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I've seen this movie in the 80s and ever since I have been searching the DVD version of this film.   I really love this movie, the music, the actor/actress and everything!      When I'm searching for some Bluray in the Amazon UK, I typed in \\"Electric Dreams\\" just to see if DVD or even Bluray version would be available.  To my surprise, there's finally a DVD for this film ......I ordered it instantly and is now waiting anxiously for its arrival.  I think the Bluray version will appear not long and I'm sure I'll be ordering it once available.    Again, thanks to all supporters of this film who left your review here.  Your effort is finally paid!!!!!!
B001IAOEXU|4.0|The original design of the triggers is flawed.  When going for the R2 L2 triggers you have to reach down for them = sucks.  With this triggers one can easily access this buttons in the middle of the action without slipping out of the button due to hard press.  The add-on snaps tightly on the triggers and is very capable of surviving quick presses and intense action.  I dont only recommend it, I will go to say this is a most to compensate for the flawed design.  Hope it helps, now go get it!
B001IZGPJG|5.0|When I started watching this, I was amazed!  I loved the dvd \\"MCMXC A.D.\\". And it was nice to see, not only a new music video for one of the best of their creations, but showing homage to earlier work.  Let's face it, Michael Cretu started out making beautiful creations with samples and music.  He's done it again, and what's wrong with sampling yourself?    One of my favorite videos is \\"Seven Lives\\".  I strikes me as a combination of \\"Push The Limits\\" and \\"Mea Culpa\\".  I have it playing in the background right now and loving everything I hear and see.  I feel it is well worth the money for this.  I only wish there was a dvd for each Enigma creation!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|This is going to be a somewhat short(ish) review from me. Primarily, because I don't wish to give too much away about the film. It's very difficult to talk about this film and remain on the side of a potential viewer, but here goes...    The movie is set in 1964, a year after Kennedy's shooting, but goes a great distance to reflect a time even further back in the past. The particular religious order in the film is unbeknownst to me, but it is rooted in a staunch and strict manifestation of Catholic belief. Something which Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is eager to move away from in an effort to get closer to the general public. But, this staunchness, seems to offer succor to his opposite, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryil Streep), who appears to have surrendered herself to a more hard lined path. This is evidenced in her banning of ballpoint pens in the Catholic school she is principal of and her disapproval of Father Flynn's sweet tooth. These two characters are balanced out by Sister James (Amy Adams), who gives a gentle performance as Sister Aloysius' would-be cohort.    In short, Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn of engaging in \\"activities\\" that would be \\"unbecoming\\" of the school and seeks to undermine his position and have him removed. But the real meat of the piece is not in its basic premise, but in the questions (and doubts) it throws up in the course of the events. There is little of a black and white nature on offer in this film and that in itself creates a very strong and compelling pull to the story. Even at the end of the movie, there is still a lot of room for maneuver, as far as the viewer is concerned and for those wishing to have all the loose ends tied up, they may be left feeling a little disappointed.    The real attraction to the film however, is not really the actual story (which may be a little thin to some), but the superb performances that are given by the cast involved. I haven't seen a film in such a long time where everyone onscreen turns in such an utterly convincing act. The fine slots from the three main characters are complimented extremely well by a truly brilliant supporting piece by Viola Davis, who goes head to head with Streep in the movie's best scene.    \\"Doubt\\" is easily one of the better films of 2008 and I heartily recommend it.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Although Streetcore was completed and issued after Joe Strummer's untimely death, it was the next scheduled Mescalero's album and, as such, not something hobbled together from leavings and false start demos.  Whether or not Joe's non- involvement in the final sound of the album has anything to do with what we hear is a minor debate at best- although worth noting as the production here is much more forceful than previous Mescalero's outings; Joe's voice is front and centre where it should be in all its fiery and heartfelt intent; the band's playing seems more fluid than we've heard before- not hard to understand given how soon this was released after Joe passed.  Rather than go into the merits of each track- and there are many outstanding numbers here, best to say that this is the album we always knew Joe Strummer and the Mescalero's always had in them.  If you haven't really listened to much latter Joe Strummer, and only know his work through the Clash, this is the album to get.
067154683X|4.0|MY granddaughter is a sophmore in highschool. when she came home and said that she needed the book,\\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" to read for school, and she had to have it within a few days because she(like a lot of people) put off mentioning this to her mother or myself. I immediately thought of Amazon.com because I had purchased a book for my daughter's Christmas present a few months earlier. Both books were in excellent condition, and the price was more than reasonable. I would definately recomend Amazon to all my friends and relatives. I also would not hesitate to purchase from them in the future.
B000001ESP|4.0|I never could become a huge fan of this band; despite many intriguing ingredients they generally didn't have enough compelling elements in place to satisfy me. MP is a somewhat exception where the prog, rock, and pop feel natural enough side by side inside the band's typically talented-but-strained dynamics.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Honestly, I didn't think it was that bad.  Because I had to watch it on my own time outside of school, it was a little more difficult to get through, but in comparison to Macbeth, it was good.  I saw a lot of 1984's influence on the movie, but I don't know if I liked how they changed thought crime to sense crime or the crime of having emotion.  I don't remember the exact wording of it.  Personally, I liked the Matrix touch to the movie too.  It brought a lot more action to the film and made it more enjoying to watch.  I also thought the scenery helped set the mood of the movie, and thought that was done well too.  However, I didn't like the weird romance they tried to incorporate or the fact that they had to inject themselves with drugs everyday.  It kinda reminded me of Brave New World, and I didn't like that book.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|I admit the movie was not at all what I expected. I expected an epic along the lines of Thorn Birds or Gone With The Wind.  This really was a movie about a child.  It was more about the child Nala than anything else. So I felt it was entirely mismarketed.  The child should have been included on the features cover. He was the real star. Scenes with him were the only time Nicole Kidman shines.  Her romantic scenes were a flop. Hugh Jackman was amazing, absolutely fantastic! And Drover was the one I was rooting for. Kidman's character never quite overcomes the hoity-toity princess-ness.  Her love for the child is what this movie was about, and honestly I felt betrayed into expecting something different. And it tried too hard to be politically correct for today's viewing audiences. I'd rather watch MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER, THE THORN BIRDS, or even QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER for a taste of Australia.    I very much enjoyed learning a little bit about the Japanese bombing of Darwin, of which I knew little prior to this film.   But overall this movie just didn't reach it's potential.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down.  Loved the letter format and historically based novel.  Quick read.  I did think I could tell when the authors changed but did love the ending.
1563898586|4.0|If you were a fan of the film adaptation of Alan Moore's revivalist Victorian-era Hero caper, or merely curious to see what all the fuss is about definitely give Volume #1 of, \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" a try.  At $10 or so (after Amazon's discounting) this book certainly provides great value with 200 pages or so of finely detailed art with Moore's typical highly plotted narratives.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|If you have never seen this movie you are missing a classic.  What an amazing story and it is acted out perfectly.  Ever wondered how far that co-worker would go?  Check this out, you will laugh and your senses (and other things possibly) will be aroused.    Enjoy.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Vincent Cassel has been one of my husband's favorite actor for some time now. Ironically, that is how we came to watch this film \\"Irreversible.\\" I knew nothing of this film other than: 1.) Vincent Cassel 2.) Monica Belluci (One of MY favorite actresses; Please watch \\"Malena\\") 3.) French film. These facts did not prepare me in the least bit for what we were about to see.<br /><br />I do not actively pursue the \\"super-violence\\" in film. I do, however, pursue creativity at its greatest with a camera and that is what this film has completely and utterly achieved.<br /><br />Was it hard to watch? Absolutely. Would I watch it again? Never. Do I think it is one of the greatest achievements in film? Undoubtedly.<br /><br />If this film had come out in the U.S., it would never have been released under an \\"R\\" rating. MAYBE NC-17 and thats if luck is on your side. I am saying this to give the viewer of this review a very clear message that the scenes of rape and violence are so hard to watch that tears welled up in my eyes and I had to look away for SEVERAL minutes; the sounds were enough though, believe me.<br /><br />Almodovar achieves this very specific and rare talent for taking a subject in which no one, and I mean no one, would ever pay for as entertainment for the weekend evening. \\"Bad Educacion\\" is about priests molesting little boys. Horrible topic but wonderful movie.<br /><br />Child abuse is very real. And so is RAPE. 1 in 4 women in the U.S. has been raped.<br /><br />This film is VERY REAL. The rape scene is 9 MINUTES long. You squirm, you are in disgust , and you feel, well, frankly raped yourself. That is why people walked out of the movie theaters.<br /><br />It is so important for us to understand the plights of others on EVERY level so that we may prevent and educate. Doing this through a film is significant since we are now in the age of iphones, internet; antiquated modes of communication such as books, newspapers, etc are being pushed into oblivion. Thus, the accessibility of this movie with such a powerhouse crew of actors allows random members of the public to experience this compelling film.se crew of actors allows random members of the public to experience this compelling film.

0061245097|5.0|I reached for this book as soon as I had inhaled the first book and it certainly disappoint.  It's a wonderful balance of romance, action, humor and other really strong side characters that enhances instead of overshadows.  I'm so glad there's a third one waiting for me.
B001D94L1Q|5.0|I was one of the lucky ones. I bought this from Amazon France for 73.60 Euro. It is a wonderful collection. My one criticism of this set... couldn't Deutsche Grammophon have coded the CDs properly? I just transferred all 32 discs to my macBook and many of them contained misspellings and incomplete entries. One spelled Messiaen without the 2nd e. Composer info was not labeled consistently. Conductors & symphonies etc... were abbreviated. Artist information was incomplete at times. Disc numbers were wrong. Wouldn't it have been nice if this had been done by someone, like myself, who cares about this sort of thing? I am surprised that such a great label, on the occasion of such a noteworthy anniversary, couldn't do a more professional job. I am  grateful nonetheless to have had good luck in purchasing this.
1439136653|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire is not your average rags to riches story. It has a unique structure, each chapter corresponds with the question that it provided the answer for. Vikas Swarup's prose is not exceptional and the main character, Ram seems almost too perfect in his understanding of the world. The book has too many little stories and details crammed into, which can sometimes be confusing. But it makes up for it's shortcomings with its engaging story, and humorous characters. It explores the many different worlds of india, and how they mix. Swarup's portrayal of indian street children's spirits is uplifting and his image of india is as chaotic as it is unique. In summary, Slumdog Millionaire is a lighthearted and interesting read, and it has captured the attention of the world.   -Neil
B001CKBW5E|3.0|You couldn't invent a more interesting premise: Dr. Taylor, a brain scientist, has a major stroke and goes through years of rehabilitation after the left hemisphere of her brain is severely damaged. She ultimately recovers and records her detailed memories of the stroke and its aftereffects.<br /><br />Dr. Taylor has given a talk on this subject at a TED Conference -- if you go to that conference's website, you can find the video.<br /><br />This is what drew me to reading My Stroke of Insight, and the book does deliver on its promise before it veers off into territory that I couldn't quite appreciate.<br /><br />Dr. Taylor begins with some basic, fundamental brain science, to set the scene. It's written to be understandable to the layperson, and succeeds on that account. She then describes the day of her stroke, combining recollections of her experience with reminders of the science behind the events that occurred.<br /><br />This is fascinating stuff, allowing us to satisfy our curiosity and learn something at the same time.<br /><br />Then, Dr. Taylor spends the rest of the book sharing her recovery experience, including the epiphany that she had as a result of the stroke. She explains that her damaged left hemisphere gave her right hemisphere a chance to flourish, and thus taught her the value of her right hemisphere. She contrasts her blissful experience of right-brained living with our culture's emphasis on the left hemisphere's reason, task-orientation and linear thinking.<br /><br />She has a point -- but I didn't really warm up to the feeling that I was reading a self-help book with no clear path to actually helping one's self! This part of the book features too much repetition, and too many shiny promises of bliss awaiting us, if we only knew how to get there. Short of having a stroke, all we get is advice that amounts to: meditate, and tell your left hemisphere to be quiet. Prune it back. It sounds good in theory, but this is slippery stuff.<br /><br />Irecommend this book for its unique look into how our brains work and what happens when they go wrong. Just know, going in, that you may or may not appreciate the unusual combination of science, memoir and self-help.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|I have to admit that I am not usually a fan of shows based on movies, but Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a welcome addition to the Terminator universe. (If such a creature exists)    This show has everything a SciFi/action show should have, and more. And while there are a few holes in it, I am more than able to look past them and see an excellent show.  The cast is really good and they make the characters believable and feelable.  It is also nice to know that events did happrn between Terminator 2 and 3. Events that helped to shape John Connor into the future leader he will one day become.    All in all, this show is a fun, action packed ride that will not disappoint. Unless you just happen to be a cold, unfeeling cyborg.

B000JLPMPS|5.0|I wrestle with my mind wondering whether this is the second greatest westerb ever made or just where it sits or whether one should divide quality ratings by time period.<br />I'll just go the simple route and say that in my opinion Clints movie, The Unforgiven, sits only behind Fords, The Searchers, as the greatest western ever brought to film.<br />I screwed up and bought the DVD after seeing the movie \\"in house\\". I should have forseen the development of Blu Ray and waited. Now I am fighting with myself over whether to spring for the bucks to buy the Blu Ray version as well. Might not. Might just wait until Dish brings it to Hi def television and trap in on Tivo.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|And I thought \\"Spitfire\\" was loud...  Hard-edged as ever, The Prodigy's 5th CD is kind of like being picked up by the ears and thrown down a flight of stairs at a crowded dance club. This CD has alot of the elements that made The Prodigy's music memorable.       Very few musicians can do industrial strength techno but the Prodigy, with some heavy bass and screaming electric guitar riffs, manage to create something completely wild but very engaging.      Invaders Must Die is not for everyone, of course, but if you like Industrial/Heavy Metal/Techno then you can't go wrong buying this CD.
B00005JLWN|2.0|This film appears to have been made within minutes of the director finishing the novel 1984.  The plot scheme and motifs in Equilibrium are almost identical to those found in George Orwell's classic.  However, in an attempt to make the story more contemporary, this work resorted to excess gun violence and underground dealings as cheap thrills for a certain age demographic.  Probably the most painful ting to watch is the acting; the dramatic stances and mundane voices just scream \\"Matrix\\" and come off as a very poor performance.  The overall aspect of the film was enjoyable to watch if you don't exactly want to witness something more creative and just want the \\"SparkNotes\\" version of 1984.    In short, you will enjoy this film if you liked the book 1984 and don't want to watch something that builds upon it.  But if you are a diehard Orwell and 1984 fan, this is the film to pass up.
B001VV4MVA|5.0|I have listened the book on CD. A must read book and very very thoughtful.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|The great Mastodon returns with album number four, Crack the Skye. Their music has gotten more and more ambitious with each record and this is by far the most ambitious yet. By this point Mastodon seems to be more interested in being a prog band than a metal band. The music is still pretty heavy, but with a lot more emphasis on variety and texture than before. It has all the trademarks of progressive rock/metal: insane tempo changes, virtuoso musicanship, cerebral lyrics, incomprehensible concept, and at least one multi-part epic. Musically, the album kind of sounds like a much heavier version of Pink Floyd or Yes. I've listened to Crack the Skye several times and I can't make heads or tails of the \\"storyline\\". It supposedly has something to do with astral projection, the Devil and \\"Mad Monk\\" Grigori Rasputin. Yeah. I haven't read sat down and analyzed the lyrics but there's really no need to. The music by itself will take you on an out-of-body experience. You needn't understand the concept to enjoy Mastodon's musical genius. Just sit back and listen some good old trippy space rock. Everything this band does is pure gold. They are certainly one of the greatest rock bands in the world and truly the masters of psychedelic prog-metal. I still prefer Mastodon's classic [[ASIN:B000GPI2EK Blood Mountain]], but Crack the Skye is quite an extraordinary experience for the adventurous music fan. It's guaranteed to make you say \\"Whoa...\\".
B00005JKLZ|1.0|This is not a good movie at all. I honestly believe Simon Wells did not read the book his grandfather wrote! He looked up a 5 sentence outline of the book and filled in the rest with his ideas.     Now the movie included some special effects, but I don't agree with the majority who say that they are so amazing.     If you have not read the book, this movie may appeal to you, because you have no idea what the story is all about.     I have read reviews that the book could not be made into a good movie, so this adaptation is good. However I completely disagree. The book is much more compelling with much better imagery than the movie includes.     Skip the movie, read the book!
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|There is no sun in Gothum City. This visually and conceptually dark film tortures the viewer with eye-strain for hours on end, until at long last, you turn it off, because by now, you don't care what happens to any of these characters.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Was completely satisfied with this purchase.  Exactly what I wanted and received it fast and safe.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|Having also seen the wonderful 1988 production of \\"Little Dorrit\\", I was looking forward to the new version.  I have to say that I prefer the former.  Andrew Davies is becoming a bit of a disappointment with some of his adaptions.  The earlier version cut out minor storylines and characters (this is Dickens afterall) and made the story easier to follow, with better flow.  If you get the chance to see the 1988 version, which was recently shown on TCM, watch it and you'll see the obvious differences.  In the current version the Tattycoram storyline could have been given a miss completely.  I found it annoying at best and it doesn't add anything to the story.  And Pet Meagle!  I don't know why anyone would fall in love with this self absorbed character, and the actress always looks like she's not the sharpest tack in the box, which makes Arthur's infatuation even more bewildering. As far as Amy Dorrit, what the actress in the 1988 version gave Amy was great dignity, and an almost obsessive, complusive quality.  I'm not impressed with the current Amy.    Alec Guiness played Mr. Dorrit as delusional, and it was fun watching him preen and portray the character as a celebrity, the \\"Father of the Marshallsea\\". Tom Courtney's version of Mr. Dorritt is just a sad, mentally unbalanced man.  And I love Tom Courtney, but find Sir Alec's portral more fun and interesting.  If you have not had the opportunity to see the 1988 version, then by all means, see this one and perhaps it will interest you in reading the book.

0312427646|4.0|This little book is a gem, and a fantastic read for those interested in reading. I could not help but think what a wonderful way to encourage people to read.<br />Queen Elizabeth II is \\"the uncommon reader\\" of the title. It was not so unsual for me to think that the actual queen does read books, but she must be pressured for time in her reading with the schedule she keeps.<br />  In this book the Queen makes reading the most important thing in her life, and her regular duties are put somewhat on the back burner. In a sense, reading changes the Queen's whole life in demeanor and thought process.<br />  The irony of the book is the Queen who is not a commoner taking part in one of the most common of activities which is reading. What I took from this is an encouragement for everyone to read. In other words, if the Queen can do it, then you can as well.<br />  I thought all in all the book was very cute. I would definitely recommend to biblophiles and those interested in the British monarchy.

B0000844IT|5.0|Finally a dvd version depicting both the director's cut and theatrical versions of this fine film. It starts off as kind of sequel to Evil Dead 2, with Bruce Campbell's character Ash trapped in Medieval time after narrowly escaping with his life after fighting the deadites in Evil Dead 2. What follows is him being captured at first by the villagers, then helping the villagers to fight the deadites. Using his knowledge of 20th century weaponry and science makes him able to give the dead what for.<br /><br />This is an alltime classic, hilarious scenes involving Ash's sheer ignorance towards vital instuctions, his confrontation with his evil self, and the last scene in the theatrical version at the s-mart.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell as always is fun as the chainsaw/shotgun wielding hero, who is short on brains but makes up for it in bravery and skill; who uses quips and one liners on the deadites as well as force. Embeth Davidtz is really good and believable as Ash's medieval love interest.<br /><br />The Director's Cut has a few additional scenes and an apocalyptic ending which will shock you and make you laugh at the same time.<br /><br />The only other thing I can say about this movie is as Ash would put it \\"GROOVY\\".
B001AEF6D6|5.0|I won't go deeply into the plot of this film. It is just to convoluted, too bizzare, and in a sense, beside the point. Let's just say that a smart but burnt out old hippie tries to find a kidnapped girl, has a fight with nialists, has a toe sent to him, has his rug pissed on, has another fight with the same nialists plus one marmet, is duped into conceiving a baby...............are you starting to understand why I don't want to do a plot summery?<br /><br />But yet, you just gotta see this film. The writing and acting-Jeff Bridges, John Goodman-is pure surealism, full of events that are nearly impossible to happen in the sequence they do, and are always absurd, yet the movie makes all of it totally beleiveable and extreamly funny. You completely accept and are drawn into the world of these guys, because they are just that nuts, and just that likeable.<br /><br />Acting and writting something like this is very difficult, because if you are just a fraction of an inch off, it is not going to work. But the Cohen Brothers and co pull it off, and the result is proably my favorate comedy of all time
0385338910|5.0|This book is a romantic comedy about a young guy that married an older woman with a teenaged son.

Doug has a hilarious dysfunctional family that is also dealing with their own issues.  Will Doug find a new love?<br /><br />The back flap of the book indicated some interest for a movie but does anybody know if it will become a movie?  The book flows very well and you can picture it like a movie in your mind.<br /><br />I plan on reading his other books too.
0307277887|3.0|I give this book three stars only because of the potential it has to be great. The  Of course it would need an entire rewrite. The book is full of jokes that fall flat. I was especially annoyed with Dexter's internal dialog. I honestly found myself annoyed with the author while reading this. I expected to find a little more depth than the series. I was sorely disappointed. The book is shallow and inconsistent.

B000PAAJYW|5.0|This is a story of faith, and of the the value of empathy and good works.  The divine intervention and \\"deus ex machina\\" at the end of the film may be controversial, but it makes the point brilliantly.  It's no more bizarre than anything recounted in the Bible and is meant to remind one of the various extraordinary plagues visited upon Egypt.      But the faith that matters -- the faith that stories of divine miracles are meant to inspire in us all -- is that of the nurse and cop who have the gift of empathy and the ability to see and to bring out the best in people.      The seemingly disconnected stories come together in a brilliant and compelling way.  They are connected, after all, by the traumas visited upon us in our youth and about how those traumas continue to play out for the rest of our lives.  We all share in this experience to some extent, and it's what unites us all.      Tom Cruise is surprisingly good in his role as the huckster son.  Julianne Moore proves why she is one of our finest actresses.  And then you have wonderful actors like Jason Robards and William Macy in supporting roles.      A couple of things don't work.  The title makes no sense to me -- how does \\"Magnolia\\" capture the film's message of faith and hope?  And the opening sequence of bizarre coincidences does not work for me.  It misses the point that there are strange coincidences.  What -- does the Supreme Being have some macabre sense of humor?  The ultimate mystery is whether there is some force higher than us and the meaning of life appears to be having faith in something greater than us.  The sketches at the beginning of the film don't capture this. Finally, the infamous sing-a-long scene by leading characters near the end of the film has been deservedly lampooned by critics -- though it is silly to suggest, as did the contemporaneous review in the New York Times, that one bad scene ruins the whole movie.    An absolutely wonderful film.  Like \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" it was abomb in the theaters but will be seen in future years as one of the great films of the decade.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|I read reviews and asked a couple of people about this movie. I was very impressed. I have already watched it twice and i'll watch it again. Every woman should watch this movie. It was a very real situation that is never dealt with in that way.   A woman leaves the city for some quiet time to write a book and runs into some problems. 4 Guys decide they want to rape her and they continuously do so. But they don't do it back to back. They toy with her. They beat her. They leave her for dead. Only, she isn't.  She takes matters into her own hands and exacts her revenge on these guys. Every revenge scene was great. One particular bathroom scene, especially.   This isn't really for the weak hearted. But it is a good movie (to me). My suggestion, watch it.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|nothing great about this movie...its an average movie... i wonder how could it worth Oscar and Golden Globe. It can not come close to the past winners like Gladiator/Beautiful mind/Lord of the rings/million dollar baby/crash/departed.
B00005JOA0|3.0|I enjoyed it, I didn't care for the sort of sexual overtones and some physical abuse. I think overall it was well done. Her husband the part was acted so well, I found myself saying How could that guy be so horrid? That's good acting when they get you to enter in the story.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|and now I am delighted that I remembered. The story is original and very quirky, quite funny at times and then deeply moving. Emma Watson plays a bit of a brat, but humbles easy. In an interview she once said that it is probable that she will do very little acting after Harry Potter, but after seeing this film I believe she is mistaken. Insight into the plight of a single woman trying to support 3 orphans in post-war Britain was riveting. That those orphaned girls could find work in the entertainment field seems plausible. The story is very moving when the girls feel so much pressure to excel at their crafts to help support their little family. For some reason Radio Days comes to my mind, and if you enjoy that sort of thing this will be a keeper.
1931382794|4.0|This is a fantastic presentation about training with power with one exception.  The Book/Font size does not support the detail in the charts.

B001PPGAIA|2.0|There are some very charismatic actors in this film, particularly David Wenham, who plays the half-aboriginal child.  But while the historical circumstances and cultural issues which the film exploits are indeed moving, I cannot recall the last time I experienced a screenplay this melodramatic & heavy-handed.  At the height of the film's dramatic climax, I burst out laughing because the scene was so contrived it had begun to (strongly) resemble a comic opera.  The film is pretty to watch and the aboriginal theme is inherently intriguing, but honestly I thought the writing in \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" was far superior.

B00003CXB2|5.0|I went to my son's house for Easter and instead of sitting down to watch the latest action flick (His great joke is treating me to films that I would never watch on my own.), it was with great pleasure that I discovered that the evening's entertainment was \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\"  As he set up the DVD, he said,  \\"Don't you remember, you took us to see it when we were kids.\\" I had forgotten.<br /><br />Doing the math, I calculated that he was seven years old at the time and his sister was eight; and that the film, viewed in all its lengthy magnificence on the large screen had left a lasting impression on him.<br /><br />When I got home, I pulled out my own two-disc set of the Limited Edition, noting the incredibly clear transfer that looks like HD when played on my computer. I then watched the extras. Whereas so many \\"the making of\\" documentaries nowadays are self-serving and otherwise forgettable, the Interview with David Lean, Omar Sherif, and the behind-the-scenes crew is truly enlightening, as are the comments of Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Having seen the film several times since 1963, and realizing that my young adult self did not understand the full implications of the story, which I have since come to appreciate, I can well imagine that it was David Lean's sweeping panoramas, Maurice Jarre's haunting musical score that evokes the emptiness of the desert, and the spectacle of the camels, Arabian horses, & British military bands that imprinted \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" into my son's childhood memories.<br /><br />Now, of course, I appreciate the subtleties of Peter O'Toole's nuanced performance of the troubled protagonist (and I am still cross about Hollywood's failure to recognize him in any other way than a \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\"--Oscar's [Registered] booby prize). In perusing the several hundred reviews on this website, I have noted proper accolades for the performances of Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Claude Raines (always brilliant), but I noticed a failure to mention Anthony Quayle, whose performance as the officer who moves from stiff-upper-lipped-Empire-right-or-wrong--at first resenting Lawrence whom he clearly considers an eccentric loose cannon--to anguished disgust at the political manipulations of Allenby (Hawkins) and Dryden (Raines), and even Faisal (Guinness), who shamelessly discard Lawrence as an embarrassment after they have not only used him but also used him up to achieve their political ends. Quayle's sterling performance complements and completes this phenomenal ensemble cast.re to mention Anthony Quayle, whose performance as the officer who moves from stiff-upper-lipped-Empire-right-or-wrong--at first resenting Lawrence whom he clearly considers an eccentric loose cannon--to anguished disgust at the political manipulations of Allenby (Hawkins) and Dryden (Raines), and even Faisal (Guinness), who shamelessly discard Lawrence as an embarrassment after they have not only used him but also used him up to achieve their political ends.

B000002LGQ|5.0|For many 'Like a Prayer' is considered the best work from the Queen of Pop herself, and rightfully so. This album reveals a maturity of expression in pop music that takes away the bitter perception of Pop music as being lame without substance. Madonna once again collaborated with her 'True Blue' (read my review on that album) team , Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray to create yet another masterpiece.    Like a Prayer: This probably is one of Madonna's most memorable songs of her career (next to Vogue), definetely her most powerful, not much credit was given to her for her vocal performance on this memoriable track that was a #1 throughout the world, even in Zimbabwe where I was staying at the time. Every body memorised the words. The song is brilliant I love the way it slowly builds up into an explosive ending with the choir, the video, even though played today would not have raised such a storm, was brilliant and cleverly thought out. Indeed a memoriable track by the Queen herself. 5/5    Express Yourself: A statement that is Madonna herself, a fearless, explosive track with a video to match, this is Madonna's first steps in ranting her views towards the right of expression, never to hold back who you trully are. A great track. 5/5    Love Song: Prince and Madonna what a collaboration, although the track is somewhat perculiar and different and heavily influence by the music of Prince who screams and yelps throughout the track. Its a good track if you looking for something different, quite experimental there is a break down in the song that says 'time goes by so slowly for those who wait', reminiscent of Madonna #1 'Hung Up' smash hit. An okay song but probably the weakest on the album. 3/5    Till Death Do Us Part: In my opinion this is her best track that was not released as a single or ever performed, Madonna does something she had never done and thats to reveal the abusive relationship she had with her then ex-hubby Sean Penn \\"the bruises they will fade away, what hurt so hard are the things you say, I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows, you're not inlove with someone else you don't even love yourself, yet still I wish you ask me not to go\\", now thats deep. Love the instrumentation, her vocals, a very mature piece of Pop. Absolutely love it. 5/5    Promise to Try: Yet another revealing track, this time around she sings solo backed by piano and violin, a story of a little girl trying to find understanding due to loss, in this case Madonna losing her mother Madonna to cancer when she was five. A touching beautifully sung song, which features in 'In Bed with Madonna' documentary as she visits her mothers grave. A true gem to this amazing album. 5/5    Cherish: Madonna brings the album back to cheerful hieghts with the beautiful track 'Cherish', a love song with a great pop melody and video, great backing vocals by Donna Delorey and Nikki Harris, this track makes you feel good inside. 5/5    Dear Jessie: Madonna reveals a more child like imagination in this gem, \\"Pink Elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie hear her laughing running through the love parade, candy kisses on a sunny day\\", very imaginatively written, a colourful song, sung beautiful by Madonna, another feel good track. 4/5    Oh Father: Madonna yet again reveals a personal side to her private life, her turbulent relationship with her father one of her deepest song on this album, very touching \\"Oh father you never wanted to be that way, you never wanted to hurt me, why am I running away\\" a powerful song with a choir and orcheraster to add on the fuel, Madonna sings hard on this track, another beauty. 4/5    Keep it together: Before ending the album she picks it up one more time with the grooviest track on the album, this track talks about her experience being in a large family, sharing all the hand me downs and having to be the clown in order to get attention. Nevertheless even then Madonna knew the importance of having a tight family unit. Great performanceof this track on her \\"Blonde Ambition Tour Finale\\". Love this track. 4/5    Spanish Eyes: A dark, mysterious piece of work, heavily influenced by Spanish instrumentation, beautiful vocals and backing vocals, probably the most maturist song on the album \\"how many lives do they have to take, how much heartache, how many sons do they have to burn, spanish eyes, when will they ever learn\\", beautiful if I might say so myself.    Act of Contriction (closing Interlude): A rather wierd ending to the album, but fits in perfectly, Like a Prayer choral section is played backwards (which in those days was very controversial, some even saying satanic), but of course Madonna takes that away and puts a touch of humour on it. It seems she waiting to at the gate of heaven, but doesn't have a reservation, the album ends with her screeching, 'what do you mean I am not in the computer'(ha ha ha)only Madonna.    Listen if you are a Madonna fan you probably have this album, but if you love pop and are a child of the 90's get this album and hear what mature, entertaining Pop music is all about, forget about Britney, Hanna Montanna and all the other wannabes, Madonna is the sure deal.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|I read these other reviews and wonder if they saw the same poorly acted, poorly shot, incoherent film that I own.  Awful quality in every way, especially the grainy, blurry visuals.  I wonder how a movie like this ever gets made when independent film makers with something to say are so routinely rejected by the major studios.  Best to borrow this one first before sinking your hard earned cash into it, I would counsel.  I found it unwatchable.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|I like this movie-I liked it even more BEFORE I saw Party Monster-Shockumentary. I am a fan of Michael and I write to him. A lot of the events that happened in the movie was twisted because it came from another person's perspective. If you want to real truth, wait until Michael comes out with his book!
0316143472|4.0|When I picked up this book at the library, I knew precisely two things about David Sedaris.<br /><br />- He occasionally wrote essays for This American Life.<br />- His sister Amy Sedaris was in a commercial with a lot of rabbits.<br /><br />Also, I discovered a third fact about him while I was trying to find a digital copy of the cover art for his book.<br /><br />- White people like him.<br /><br />When You Are Engulfed In Flames is a collection of essays.  Each one is a short and fascinating story from Sedaris's life, sparsely embellished with digressions from the topic at hand. It's easy to see how Sedaris got his start in public radio, and it's even easier to imagine him reading the essays aloud as you're reading them, if you have ever heard his voice on the radio.  Reading the book is a bit like being next to a very interesting person at a party, the sort of gifted soul who can keep a monologue going for fifteen minutes without boring anyone in the room.<br /><br />Sedaris is generally billed as a humorist and there are widespread reports of folks finding his work milk-out-the-nose funny.  I am not in this group.  Sedaris is funny, but this is a sort of subtle humor that is rather more under the surface and it keeps the text from feeling like it belongs in a joke book.  What Sedaris really has a knack for is observation and a particularly effective way of relating stories and thoughts.  A lot of these essays touch on deep topics, but Sedaris resists the urge to pontificate heavily and seems content to relate the details in a way that lets the reader draw their own conclusions. After you read about, say, the author's self-doubt concerning whether his umbrage at a fellow airline passenger is justified, or confess to not knowing what a dingo is, you can't help but feel like you've had the same experience.<br /><br />This book earns my recommendation.  It's light reading, to be sure, but not the sort that you feel like you have to hide under a colorful book jacket, because every now and again you'll get a beautiful little pop of insight about life, or death, or whether you should wear a bowtie.  4/5.<br /><br />(A word of warning-this is definitely a book for adults due to its language and content.)tiful little pop of insight about life, or death, or whether you should wear a bowtie.  4/5.      (A word of warning-this is definitely a book for adults due to its language and content.)
B001PPGAIA|3.0|[[ASIN:B001PPGAIA Australia]]<br /><br />Plot: Interesting. The first half of the movie appeared to be directed by someone other than the person who directed the second half. The first half of the movie prepares the viewer for the second half of the movie but it's slow, meandering, and I felt a bit confused about what the central point of the movie was. The second half rolls around and the pace quickens, there's urgency, drama, death, destruction, reunions.<br />Scenery: Wonderful<br />Overall: Good movie. I'd watch it again.
B001E1EOQ0|5.0|The movie looked and sounded amazing. The cut scenes were put back into the movie seemlessly and to great effect. Anyone who loves this movie should definately get this version!!
1572816112|5.0|A lot of others have detailed the cards in this deck. I have had it about a week and used it for several readings, and it handles wonderfully. The slick card surfaces tend to fly out of my hands, but they shuffle like a dream. The deck yields great, deep readings for me, and the imagery is outstanding. This was a deck worth waiting for. If you're on the fence about it like I was, go ahead and get it. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Unless you like tarot to be all butterflies and light. Which this deck isn't.
0385496494|5.0|This is a great book without the need for further introduction. The main theme about this book revolves around learning how to die in order to live well, to love and to be loved. It also covers marriage, community, material possession and handling of our emotion. The following is the main gist of what I have learned from this book.<br /><br />We must learn how to die in order to live well.<br />We must learn how to give out love, and to let love come in. Death ends a life, but it does not end love or a relationship.<br />We must actively seek the meaning of our life. Do the kinds of things that come from the heart.<br />The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives purpose and meaning.<br />When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, and you won't be longing for somebody else's things.<br />We shouldn't hide our emotion, we should let emotion flow. We should cry or mourn when we need it.<br />We need to mourn or feel sad. But don't hang on to that emotion for too long; after that we need to focus on the good things in our life.<br />Culture is not necessary right, if necessary create your culture.<br />Don't attach to material possession because they don't satisfy us. Don't cling on to things; let the experience penetrate you instead.<br />We also need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. You can't get struck on the regrets of what should have happened.<br /><br />Listed below is beautiful quote extracted from the book:<br />\\"Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else.\\" (p35)<br />\\"The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. We're teaching the wrong things. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it. Create your own.\\" (p35)<br />\\"Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.\\" (p40)<br />\\"A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.\\" (p40)<br />\\"Love wins, Love always wins.\\" (p40)<br />\\"The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives purpose and meaning.\\" (p43)<br />\\"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.\\" (p52)<br />\\"I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then I concentrate on all the good things still in my life.\\" (p57)<br />\\"If you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too - even when you're in the dark. Even when you're falling.\\" (p61)<br />\\"What if today were my last day on earth?\\" \\"The culture doesn't encourage you to think about such things until you're about to die.\\"  \\"We are involved in trillions of little act just to keep going. So we don't get into the habit of standing back and looking at our lives and saying, Is this all?\\" (p64,p65)<br />\\"To know you're going to die and to be prepared for it at any time.\\" (p81)<br />\\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\" (p82)<br />\\"If you accept that you can die at any time - then you might not be as ambitious as you are.\\" (p83)<br />\\"We are too involved in materialistic things, and they don't satisfy us.\\" (p84)<br />\\"There is no foundation, no secure ground, upon which people may stand today if it isn't the family.\\" (p91)<br />\\"Learn to detach.\\" \\"Don't cling to things, because everything is impermanent.\\" \\"But detachment doesn't mean you don't let experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That's how you are able to leave it.\\" (p103)<br />On crying. \\"Turnon the faucet.

B000P12LWY|5.0|Awesome movie.  We have just finished season one and can't wait to start season two.
B001LMU182|5.0|This is a great release, especially for the audiophile, and a great transfer, true to original theatrical releases, with grain, muted colours and vibrant tones mixed, and truly a must for fans of the film.  The only missing piece that would have made this the definitive version for me, were some of the extras from the Pioneer DVD version.  Having said that, for me, Blu-ray is about THE BEST vision and sound, and THAT is what keep bringing me back to a BD for repeated viewing.  I would rather the PCM Uncompressed soundtracks than gimmicks.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is truly one of the best series that I have seen in a very long time.  It is funny, serious, and full of action.
B001LMU182|3.0|I own a Laserdisc [Japanese] and DVD [English] releases of Akira and I was thrilled to see that there was a Blu-ray release now available.  I was looking forward to revisiting as much as possible the original theater experience I had when it played in art houses on a large screen.  The meticulous frame by frame painted artwork on Blu-ray must be visually impressive.  Unfortunately I'm going to pass on this edition in spite of what must be the best video transfer due to what sounds like inferior voice acting.    Hopefully another edition will be released in the future.  My money is waiting for that release.
B001TOD92C|5.0|In his real life Hollywood comeback, Mickey Rourke's art imitates his life. Rourke stars as Randy \\"The Ram\\" (Ram Jam!) Robinson, a professional wrestler twenty years over the hill. When he can't pay the rent for his sleazy trailer, he sleeps in his rusted van. Duct tape holds his coat together, steroids have bloated his body, chemicals make his hair blond, and a hearing aid dangles from his ear. Hard living, bad luck and stupid choices have landed him where you might expect, including estrangement from his daughter Stefanie. But he soldiers on, and so we love him and resonate with him. When the movie ends ambiguously, we wonder about his fate and hope he will be okay. In a near mirror image, a stripper, Pam, is Randy's only friend, and their mutual commiseration is touching. Who would have thought that a stripper and a wrestler would win our hearts? But such is the skill of director Darren Aronofsky. In one scene Pam quotes a long passage from Isaiah to and about Randy, likening him, in a clever play on words, to \\"the sacrificial ram.\\" And, in fact, Randy embodies all the woes of humanity and discovers that even when broken things cannot be fixed, it's still okay.
1433502410|5.0|Any who would study the Bible will find the ESV Study Bible an outstanding, in-depth collection offering nearly three thousand pages of explanation, maps, articles, and Bible text. Some 200 new color maps, 40 new illustrations, 200 charts, and over 50 articles on topics ranging from ethics to biblical interpretations make for a Christian collection addition not to be missed. Scholarly, specific, and packed with Biblical insights.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is a great workout. I like it because it is challenging, but not too hard to follow, even for beginners. I've noticed with some videos and even with Wii My Fitness Trainer, there is not enough instruction or it goes so quickly you can't keep up. No problem with that here. Easy to follow, but a good, hard workout that will get you sweating in the first 5 minutes.    I am 5'5\\" and about 130 lbs, and I usually do cardio (elliptical/elliptical) about 3-5 times per week for at least half an hour. I definitely feel that I get a lot more out of this workout than I do with 45 minutes on the elliptical. I have pretty strong legs from running/elliptical, so this is a great help to keep me well rounded with lots of work on the arms and abs.    I did level 2 for the first time today and it was definitely tougher, but still, not impossible. Jillian is very likable and I don't get annoyed with her at all. It would be nice if there were counts for all the repetitions though rather than just the first couple. Also, at the beginning of the DVD there are a few minutes of introduction I can't figure out how to skip. Those are really the only issues I have.    I haven't done this on a consistent enough basis to see measurable results, but there's no doubt in my mind that if you did this every day you would.    Buy it.. you won't regret it!!
0312360266|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. It had all the turmoil and drama I would expect from a group of teens... and more!... but by the 5th book, I was a bit done with Zoey and her \\"boy\\" drama! Maybe that's because I'm not 16 anymore- but still. I was also tired of having to read the \\"recaps\\". I didn't need the book to explain who the twins were, in detail, in EVERY book...???     It was a fun read though and I do look forward to book 6! I just hope Zoey can get her head out of her butt long enough to realize that boys are not worth the drama! Just move on already! LOL.     My one warning: Although it's in the \\"young adult\\" section- there is enough sexual content that it's in no way appropriate for the younger crowd.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Arguably the two greatest actors from my teens together again in a gritty vigilante film should be a slam dunk success, but for me it wasn't. The story is okay, not great, full of clich&eacute;d plot lines. The acting is okay, just not what I might have hoped for from Pacino and De Niro.  Top that off with these super-cops being in at least their mid sixties, made the suspension of disbelief surpass any science fiction plot that I can think of.<br /><br />So here's my take,<br />If you want a vigilante cop movie, (the much maligned acting of Keanu Reeves is more believable) in [[ASIN:B001BP4K22 Street Kings]]  is a much better view from last year. If you want a Super Vigilante movie, go see [[ASIN:B001TODCII Taken]] where Liam Neeson is also much more believable and also much more empathetic as the man best not messed with.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I am satisfied with this product. This really brings out the potential of my headphones originally being powered from my weak Walkman mp3 player. I am happy I purchased this amp.
0446691437|5.0|I bought a copy and some of the facts were so spot-on it was embarrassing to see my bad habits spelled out like that.  I winced and kept reading.  Digested it.  Read it again.  Recommended it to several friends. All have loved it.  By \\"loved it\\" I mean some of us agonized over parts, some felt uplifted by parts, some went back and checked in again.  It's really a workbook that involves art, but then it lays down helpful insights for living life in general.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Great value! Watch shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. Well protected with plastic film. Links easily adjusted. On registering the warranty with Invicta, it was immediately upgraded from 1 to 5 years (due to buying the watch through Amazon.com).    As others have stated, the watch is much more attractive in person and I think it looks great in all the photos I've seen of it online. It's definitely a heavy watch but that lends to it's perceived quality and it is by no means cumbersome. The screw down crowns are a great addition.    I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend this watch to others.
B00005JLKN|5.0|This is a very good \\"remake\\" of Manhunter\\" which was the first Hannibal Lecter movie but didn't get the press the others did because it didn't have Anthony Hopkins as the famous criminal.     After \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" became so popular, and the sequel, \\"Hannibal,\\" it was decided to re-do that first film and this time obtain Hopkins' services.It worked because not only do you have the incomparable Hopkins at Dr. Lecter but you have one this generations best actors, Edward Norton, as the leading character \\"Will Graham.\\"     Norton, as always, gives a solid performance. And - look at the backup cast: Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary Louise Parker and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Not bad.    This is one of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing. On my first look, I was disappointed Hopkins didn't have a bigger role but, after I knew what to expect, subsequent viewings made me appreciate the film's effort as a whole, and it's an underrated flick and a fine addition to the \\"Lecter\\" series.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|It's--a movie. Lots of money was spent on it apparently.  It's great to see Dustin Hoffman's grandfather is still spry and getting work. Perfume is really--well it's like--remember when we had to read long novels in school and we wished somewhere in the book, the earth would open up and--well, it kind of happens here kind of. I think the rodent was the tip off. But man when they sell a movie, they really hook you and--ok--it's not something I would--I didn't watch the interviews with the film makers cause--ah--I didn't want to spoil the bouquet.<br /><br />And of course death has its lingering scent--Andy Warhol's Frankenstein proved that--it's just--well--it's a long movie or maybe not. And it is based on an unfilmable novel--some reviews say--and I'd take that as a measure of warning--well what I'm trying to say,  without spoiling the surprises, and that is one tough thing to do--let's just say you may be singing Good Morning, Starshine or Hair by the time the perfume just soaks into everything--the room, the furniture, the aforementioned hair--<br /><br />It's just--getting back to that what we would like to happen in the middle of a novel we're forced to read in school--and you want to run from the room when your face is just about as full of blood as it can get--that rodent scene kind of makes one feel the same way--course the stench of France then--well--you gotta smell then you gotta smell, I say.<br /><br />Remember Hans Conreid on an I Love Lucy show reciting his poem that ends with \\"....I just love to stand there and smell\\"? It's kind of a huge practical--well, I don't want to spoil the vintage here--I would have loved to have seen this in an art theatre--not really--and go around giving the audience a hot foot--cause that would be liberating--kind of symbolic too I guess--<br /><br />Oh come on, the movie stinks, the thing is a practical joke, there is one line toward the last that will leave you in hysterical laughter, so see the thing, really, cause it's just one of the most--well, you remember Goldman's law concerning more than one writer, or two writers--this film could have used William Goldman as script doc--don't think I'll be buying the novel it's based--it's based on a novel? Lord. Is there no shame?<br /><br />Any how..it's a movie to give one that smell of delusion, not to mention the drugs they must have been on when they made this--you remember Snidley Whiplash? And how we hated him? But we loved him too cause he was so Snidley. Doesn't have anything to do with Perfume: The Story of a Killer--just wanted to mention it. But it's good Dustin Hoffman's grandfather still gets work--his house caves in--well--it's like they're saying just how long can they string us along here?<br /><br />And from some of these reviews apparently a long long time. It's a movie about murder. And it's--well--the breakout comedy hit of the year. Get that blu-ray--yep--do get that blu-ray. Honest. It's a love in, yes sir, with some of the ugli---well never mind. You can tell people about the movie. And they will take one giant step back from you and look around nervously for the nearest exit. S'true. I lived to tell the tale.u remember Goldman's law concerning more than one writer, or two writers--this film could have used William Goldman as script doc--don't think I'll be buying the novel it's based--it's based on a novel? Lord. Is there no shame?    Any how..it's a movie to give one that smell of delusion, not to mention the drugs they must have been on when they made this--you remember Snidley Whiplash? And how we hated him? But we loved him too cause he was so Snidley. Doesn't have anything to do with Perfume: The Story of a Killer--just wanted to mention it. But it's good Dustin Hoffman's grandfather still gets work--his house caves in--well--it's like they're saying just how long can they string us along here?    And from some of these reviews apparently a long long time. It's a movie about murder. And it's--well--the breakout comedy hit of the year. Get that blu-ray--yep--do get that blu-ray. Honest.

B001ILFUDM|3.0|I'll even out the review with a 3.  I can't argue with the movie, obvious classic.    The Blu-Ray however is worthless.  There is nothing inherantly special about the Blu-Ray.  At least Sleeping Beauty is widescreen.  The same picture and sound can be had on the DVD version.  Don't waste the extra money on the Blu-Ray.    I'm not expecting Horton Hears A Who in picture and sound quality, obviously there are constraints on taking an old movie and trying to make it into Hi-Def.  However, there appears to have been no effort put in to distinguish the Blu-Ray from regular DVD, other than the price and maybe a few features that most people don't even use.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|It lingers, this film. It is so brooding and involving. The 1920's have been re-created so perfectly. Identity is the key here. And how difficult it is to hang onto it, to protect it when everything is against the need of a mother to have her true son back home again. The cover up by the police. The monstrousness in the madhouse run by mad people. It is  that core fear of am I wrong? And never wrong. Never giving up.<br /><br />There are parallels here with what we've been through the last eight years. Though it is more. When manipulation comes at a woman full force, when the gods it seems are proving her wrong at every turn, that sweaty edginess comes in so seemlessly and deeply. We know as does she and that is the guilt of the thing. The denouement is so frightening and so creepy that it leaves me shaken.<br /><br />How easily identities can be stolen and how conscience can be wiped clean so totally. The most harrowing scenes are the realization of what has happened and how we can be taken away to hell because it fits the neat tucks and smooth bedding those in power, those who know best, who say you got off easily this time, you don't want to know, and that child they have placed you with, this is yours and the dimness of the lighting, the dimness of something that is collared in the corner, an attempt at faking a parent/a son and it's so true.<br /><br />Every word of it, every scene of it. We are not safe and this is a horror film that sets itself so long ago, so needful are we to believe in authority then especially. There are so many shadows here. There is such a palpable creepy scratchiness under the surface. Eastwood as director, a superb cast, brilliant sets and autos and feel and time and clothing, as we go deeper into the skin of a paranoia that is said the solution. It's so easy to do it that way. Too many eyes look away. Such manipulation in the taking away and the giving back. Evil.<br /><br />If the solution is guessed before hand, it probably is the wrong guess. The ease of horror, the way it goes on under a person's eyes and the debasing of a child, still and bleak and haunting stark images and more than haunting thoughts. What creatures man can turn into and the whole of the film is so honest, so terribly real, and there is where the true nightmare lies--the need once more given--to sign that document the doctor hands to the mother searching for her child with such immense bravery and determination and at last, to still search, but this time, to know.<br /><br />See this film.

B00004VXF2|1.0|in short: I own roughly 5,000 albums, I actually see 300 gigs a year and listen to roughly eight hours of music every single day for the last 20 years.  I have travel to places like Stockholm, Praha and Oxford to see gigs.  I have seen just about every important act over the years.  I have seen Lou Reed many times and he is in my fav 100 musicians of all time.    Now you know my background.    I can honestly state THIS IS THE WORSE ALBUM I have ever listened to and there shall never be anything as bad in the future as this all time stinker.      People, even getting drugged up could not enhanced this wreck.    It is two guitars tuned differently placed next to amps and left there just to create noise.  In other words, any person in the whole world could accomplish the same thing.    Now let us define music.    Music has:  melody (none here)  harmony (none here)  tempo (none here)  articulation (none here)  dynamics (none here)  texture (none here)    So even though there is sound, I do not believe this actually qualifies as music.  Recording the sound of your car engine or toilet flushing for 60 straight minutes would not be music either, there would be a sound, but it would not qualify as music.
B00158K0S8|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. The Blu-ray presentation is excellent for sound and picture. George C. Scott truly captures the essence of one of the best (and misunderstood) generals in United States history.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is one of the very best soundtracks to come out recently. Bella's Lullaby is beautiful. There is not a single bad song on the whole soundtrack. The music is very appropriate for the movie and gave it lots of life. The soundtrack stands equally as well on it's own.    Linkin Park - Leave Out All the Rest      Muse - Supermassive Black Hole    Awesome songs!! I still listen to this music at least once a day. It's well worth the purchase price.
B00000DI06|5.0|Received as promised and am enjoying listening to it very much. Music doesn't get much better than this.  Be sure to read the lyrics in English on the inserts for deeper understanding of the piece.
B000WQW988|2.0|Almost every one of these songs sounds exactly the same, the same chords, the same structure. Even Kurt Cobain says on the tape that a certain two songs should not be played back to back \\"because they are the exact same song.\\" He was right. Still, this has its ghoulish appeal, coming just five months before Cobain's suicide. He certainly looks and sounds depressed. Was he always like this, you wonder? It's fun to see a very cherubic looking Dave Grohl delicately playing his drums with Thunder Rods instead of sticks. This is for the diehard fan. I dozed off after 7 or 8 of these dirges.
1416550542|5.0|A little Dickens, some Secret Garden, a touch of Wuthering Heights and a dose of Grimm's Fairy Tales all rolled together into a story I couldn't stop reading. I don't say that often, but I was really captivated by this book. I'm generally not a fan of having chapters in different time periods with different sets of characters and realized pretty quickly that if I didn't pay close attention to each chapter's place/date note, I was going to be in trouble.  You do have to stay alert to keep the generations straight, but once you figure that out, it isn't too hard to keep it all sorted out, and frankly, I don't know that this story could have been told any other way.<br /><br />I found the writing style very appealing--a good blend of lyrical description and action, and although I yearned to speed things up a bit in places, mostly the pace was good.<br /><br />I really loved the included fairy tales.  They were filled with vivid symbolism and depth and were just dark enough to make them intriguing.  I wish I had the book that is so fondly treasured throughout the story.  (message to Kate: publish illustrated fairy tale book).<br /><br />This is a complex story that spans multiple generations.  Each time period felt authentic to me and I yearned, right along with the modern characters, to solve the mystery of the little girl's identity and abandonment.  Even though I figured out most of what happened sooner than the characters did, I remained interested to learn how all the loose ends tied together, and they did.  I found this book one of the most satisfying and enjoyable I've read in a long time.
B001AUKUUO|5.0|If you are a fan of music from this genre, then it gets 3-4 stars for some VERY good songs, but the entire album is not all that strong song-wise. However, if you are a guitar player, or a fan of guitar in particular, then this is a must have for the incredibly melodic playing of Vito Bratta, that has not been equaled since. It is a great loss that this guy does not continue to make music, because unlike Mike Tramp, his voice on the guitar was unique and without equal. Get this and all other White Lion that Vito played on. (which would include all  but the most recent release) His guitar is well worth hearing.
B001PA0FFO|3.0|The Amazon.com reviewer Kathleen C. Fennessy says, \\"Looking for any excuse to push the progressive priest out of her tradition-minded institution, Sister Aloysius sets out to destroy him . . . .\\"  Had I known this in advance -- and had the viewing audience likewise known this in advance -- it would have made for a far better and much more honest theatrical experience as well as a far better film.<br /><br />Released while the Catholic Priest Sexual Abuse Scandal continues to plague that Church, one might have thought that the film would offer insight into that arena of behavior and all the \\"doubt\\" it has raised about priests, bishops, and Catholics in general.  That is one of many areas where this film disappoints.  Although heavily advertised as raising a question of \\"doubt\\" about the priest's guilt or innocence, Fr. Flynn's virtue is never in \\"doubt\\" in any real sense.  There is proof of nothing -- in fact, there is evidence of nothing, except that this is an exceptionally good priest.  I almost laughed out loud when Sr. Aloysius admitted at the end of the film that she had \\"doubts\\" about what she had done to the him.  The only thing she could have doubted was the morality of attempting to destroy a good priest in order to protect her territory and her perceived rights as a guardian of the old order.<br /><br />Amy Adams is quite sweet and reminds me of the joy and innocence of Miss Jennifer Honey, played by Embeth Davidtz, in [[ASIN:B0000VCZKW Matilda (Special Edition)]]  At the same time, there is an unexplored dark side to Sr. James which Amy Adams never touches:  it was largely her observations about the pastor which gave Sr. Aloysius her initial ammunition -- and which kept feeding her misbegotten fire.  (I say this not to criticize Amy's fine performance, but to point one obvious flaw in the screenplay.)<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman turns in an outstanding performance but he and the rest of this stellar cast are greatly hindered by a lack-luster script.  Perhaps the translation from stage to screen is partially responsible, but often the symbols used fall flat or come across as banal or trite.  The screen writer's lack of knowledge of Catholicism, its rules and regulations, its habits and traditions, its \\"line of command\\" and way of conducting important \\"business,\\" and particularly the order and style of its Liturgy, were not devastating to the film but were noticeable -- and quite annoying.  When the background of a film isn't right, the whole film suffers.  I don't think that the author really understood this particular period in American Catholicism -- and certainly didn't seem sensitive to the movement of the Second Vatican Council . . . or the Child Abuse Crisis, which Sr. Aloysius alone in all the world seemed to be anticipating.<br /><br />The brilliant Meryl Streep copes with the material she's been handed, but is almost literally hog-tied by the wimple and habit she perennially wears.  She manages a wince, a half-smile, a raised eye-brow -- but her Cruella de Ville imitation can't conquer the often silly dialogue she is called to recite.  Sad, really, that a talent of this caliber could not be treated to better material.  (Perhaps, also, someone should have given Costuming the clue that, even in the old days, nuns did not do manual labor in full choir habit -- nor did they sleep and rise as identical clones of the perfect mold, not a moment early, not a moment late, in complete costumed-unity.)  I don't want to say that Meryl Streep was wasted here, although that's not too far off the mark.  I found this particular vehicle far inferior to the talents of one so genuinely good, and wished that I was watching her flawless performances in, for example, [[ASIN:B0001I2BUI Angels in America]], instead.  Now THAT was acting -- and a vehicle far more worthy of her gift.<br /><br />Having seen DOUBT once, I now know how badly it was misrepresented in its advertising; I could go back and watch it again, now that I have been cleansed of my original misunderstanding of what the film was all about.  Some films you really need to see twice -- or more -- in order to fully understand them and fully enjoy them.  But most films which you need to see twice just aren't worth seeing even once.  Do I put DOUBT in that category?  Close.  But do I think I'll give it another two hours of my time?  Doubtful.nderstanding of what the film was all about.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|After listening to the results of the Martins work on these recordings, and thoroughly enjoying the new life breathed into them, my only thought was, \\"Man, it's time to have the whole catalog redone.\\" With the announcement of these coming out on 9.09.09, I am one happy fan. My wish has come true. To all Beatle fans, the lads are back! It been a Hard Day's Night and a Long and Winding Road, but Here Comes the Sun, so don't be a Nowhere Man and miss out. Come Together, buy a Ticket to Ride and even if it takes Eight Days A Week, revel in the greatness of this music. I Will.
B000683VI4|4.0|Actors I loved  as I was younger, still captured my heart.Their love was so strong... oh to have a love like that...
1402756399|5.0|Wonderful book.  Well written and fully ilustrated, it offers the reader not only the full text of the \\"Origin\\", but Darwin´s biography and the Captain´s log aboard the \\"HMS Beagle\\". I strongly recommend it.
B000UBMWG4|1.0|I guess I just don't get it. I've seen lots of cheesy 80's sci-fi movies but I never thought to classify them as masterpieces. Aside from the out-dated effects and crappy acting, it didn't even make sense. I have a hard time sympathizing with a ROBOT. Great, it has feelings. By that standard Short Circuit is a filmmaking masterpiece too. IRobot made a statement about society, but I don't see that here. You want to see a filmmaking masterpiece from the 80's? Go watch Conan the Barbarian. If you can't see how well that film was made then don't tell me I'm close minded because I can't see the greatness of this cheese-fest. People need to grow up. It's a cheesy 80's flick. Just cause you like it, doesn't mean it's the greatest movie ever made.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Every song is a hit - classic Kansas at it's best.  It's an album to devour.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good. The comparison to 1984 was pretty strong although I enjoyed 1984 better. I thought the plot was interesting, but the story line was weak. I liked how they tried to spin off of 1984 with taking away people's emotions, but that seemed pretty ridiculous to me to take away emotions and feelings. I thought the romance they tried to include was weak, and if they could have created a stronger relationship or more details with that then it could have made for a more interesting story. I was not a fan of the violence, and how they killed the puppies. That to me was unnecessary and just too much detail. I liked how they tried to show how the society tried to be uniform. With that uniform society there is obviously going to be someone who tries to go against it. I thought it was weird that they had to inject themselves with medicine every day like they had no self control. Overall this was a good movie, but I still think there are some ways to improve it.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I just love this collection of songs - there's not a song to skip.  The recordings are fantastic and captures their voices and music very well.  You can't listen to these songs on the radio to really appreciate them, you must own this and hear it on cd.
B00005067B|5.0|The album is' beautiful, ONLY THAT I HAVE WHEN I ORDERED THE ALBUM ON THE DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOS who see E 'represents the WHOLE ALBUM TO BOX, pins, hats and ZIP IF YOU CAN tell me HOW CAN I DO TO BUY THE BOX ? GRZIE DA TULLIO
B000000ZGO|5.0|If you don't like this, you just don't \\"get it\\". This album, as with other work by Isaac Hayes, is the epitome of soul music; music that makes you just kinda bob your head and feel it as you're listening to it. The only negative is that it serves as a reminder of what music has devolved into in this day and age. Soul music has experienced a slight resurgence through the efforts of artists like Maxwell, Angie Stone, Jill Scott, John Legend and Erykah Badu, but nobody does it like the old cats did...
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best video I have owned for a few reasons:  -It is not corny or annoying  -I can do it although I am the LEAST coordinated person ever!  -It is very difficult without being impossible
B00000AFWW|5.0|this album was a good pick. Love is sure good at sounding like/impersonating her late ex.
0007263589|5.0|I would highly suggest this book for anyone interested in behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, or just how certain instances trigger the same 'irrationality' gene that runs through us all. Though it deals with economic principals, it's very basic and well explained, so anyone can follow. Plus, it's pretty funny at times, so at the danger of sounding like an afterschool special - it's entertaining as well as educational! But it really is.
B000002UWW|4.0|Rightly joked about by some critics at the time of its release as being a terribly commercial move, the Chilis have here released (or their record company did more like) a veritable feast of their career up to this point.<br /><br />And that statement is really the crux of the matter. This came out after the hugely successful Blood Sugar Sex Magic and was designed to cash in on that. It also served the very useful purpose of introducing newcomers to the fact that this was a band that had a history, a cataloge to explore if you cared to. With numbers reaching back to their earlier days this is probably a great buy for anybody new to the RHCP or those younger people who only know the latter stuff. This way you can get the hits and other salient tracks of the funk rockers early days without having to wade through their at times less successful attempts to communicate via psychadelic funk wattage.<br /><br />Of course there are some reasons not to bother with this handy single CD platter. These being that the band later morphed into something different. So here you ge the condensed version of their first incarnation. But not a brilliant intro to their greater body of work and it also must be borne in mind that there is a later double disc best of available and an accompanying video of clips etc for that. And so while I am happy to give this hastily assembled but valid release four stars the prospective buyer should weigh up his/her options before parting with their cash.
B00127RAJY|1.0|Jillian Michaels prides herself on being the toughest trainer on \\"The Biggest Loser.\\" That might be true, but I'm not sure that's something to brag about. She seems to be overcompensating for something--her style is bullying, gruff, crass, and insulting. Maybe some people are motivated by that kind of attitude (seeing how many five-star reviews this has....*scratches head*), but I'm not. Her training style makes me want to sit on my couch, eat a cheeseburger, and watch \\"Newhart.\\" I've been active and fit all my life, but I don't respond well to condescension. If this works for you, fine. I prefer trainers who are warm and encouraging (though demanding), like Jennifer Kries and Violet Zaki. I'm selling 30 day shred. It's a waste of time and money.
B000XUUQQK|2.0|Boring, and not even a compelling rental.  The gory parts were a bit too gratuitous w/o adding value to the story.  Average acting.  Overall, average story without any real visual engagement.
B001VT1HCO|5.0|With this band it's easy to get caught up in the normal prattle of obvious influences... to me they sound like Ultravox had a baby out of wedlock with The Sisters of Mercy which was then raised by Joy Division... but that would be missing the point.  For a first offering this is an exceptionally well done effort!
0471267554|4.0|I really liked this book - and started the diet.  My sugar levels are way down, my blood pressure is down -  I wish I had this book 20 years ago!
B000YABYLA|1.0|There are a lot of bad comedies out there.  And surely Juno can't be the worst of the lot.But in a sense it is because it masquerades itself as intelligent, witty and interesting. And it is none of those things. Just a pretentious bore centered around the most annoying heroine ever.
0679457607|4.0|I bought the original version quite a while ago and wanted to revisit the topic, so I bought this revised edition.  The inner game principles and exercises remain valid, but are enhanced by apporpriate connection to technical teaching.  The simple act of paying attention in various ways to the various aspects of the game does actually enhance the enjoyment of the game -- at least for me.   One can get over-driven to be technically correct and results focused and forget the simple pleasure of the game.  So far I am only dabbling with this, but I am already feeling more natural in my learning and overall approach to the game.
1577314808|5.0|This is a very powerful book I have enjoyed it a lot. Most of us nowadays have a problem with \\"living in the now\\" we are living either in the future or in the past, but we forget about the present.<br />This is one of the big problems that we face nowadays. In addition, the book written by  Eckhart Tolle comes into our help.<br />I recommend reading it, because it is a good book.<br /><br />Author: Bogdan Alexandru<br />[[ASIN:1441492410 Thoughts across Time]]

B001CDWFPC|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by the Kindle edition of the ESV Study Bible.  The folks at Crossway went out of their way to transfer the content over a new format.  There are links to study notes on verses and sections, charts, maps, background and more.  A special introduction to the Kindle edition helps you use the five-way button.  Also, as some charts do not fit the Kindle screen, Crossway provides internet links for you to see them on your computer.<br />Overall, this is a bargain at $9.99 and probably the largest file book you will download.  It is loaded with great resources!
080017948X|4.0|Bill Murray is a self-important prima donna weatherman who seems set for just one more Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney.  But it's more than just one more Groundhog Day.  Way more than just one boring repeat of what he's done so many times before, apparently without learning anything, as he finds himself in a learning loop.    Haven't you ever thought that the whole problem with life is that we have to make mistakes and live through them to get to where we are today?  Ever wish you could go back in time and do things right that you did wrongly?  To undo the done and do the un-done?  To do the done things slightly differently in some small or big way?    Me too.    But, in time, we might realize that the path we took to get here was what made us what we are today.  Maybe it's good to have only one chance.    Bill Murray gets another chance.   Then Bill Murray gets another chance.  And then, Bill Murray gets another chance. But does he get the girl?    I've never sat down to count the chances he has.  I know that I have a chance to change that.  And I also know that the rest of us usually get only one chance to get things right, and then we have to live with the consequences.    I know, it's a movie, and therefore everything is probably imaginary or the result of some cinematic jiggery-pokery.  Still, ice sculptures are really cool.  I'd try them if I could figure out how many times I got to use the chainsaw to get it right.  Preferably, only one.    Bill Murray gets to do it right, though.  And, thereby, another chance to get the girl.  For more info, well...    Here's a chance to see how he does.      Every Groundhog Day I think of this movie and have another chance to see it.  Another Odyssey.
1401307450|5.0|The lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers at first was just that, the lead singer.  After this book, i found out many things that I did not know.  He has had so many experiences, but many that have happened because of drub abuse.  According to his book, he should have died a long time ago.  From a young age, he experienced so many things, that i am happy to  say, that he didn't.  Having read his story, has made me think about addiction and the rule it has over people.  His book expresses the effort he put into being the man he is today.  He also talks about the women that helped shaped who he is.  I do have to say that he did leave me a little empty, just wondering what his life has left for him...Kiedis rocks!!!

B001B71NPC|4.0|After the releases of Year Zero and Ghosts (I-IV) for commercial profit, NIN (aka Trent Reznor) releases a free album online.  It's a shame a band like Pink Floyd did not have this medium during their heyday!  Anyway, this album is amazing!  You say it's not original?  Maybe true.  You say it's not good?  Wrong!    This album was originally free to download on nin dot com.  I do believe the band's statement was \\"a gift to the fans.\\"  Listening to the album for the first time like any other NIN album you feel \\"cheated!\\"  Purist/devoted fans of anything will always expect more than what's put out.  This album to me is more of a retrospective than an album.  It spans the sounds and structures of NIN from its inception to now.  Half of it reminds me of the Broken/TDS sounds of distortion and energy while Discipline and Echoplex are of With Teeth.  The Lights in the Sky from the Fragile and the instrumentals from Ghosts.    Instead of giving us a greatest hits album of previously released tracks, NIN has given us a greatest hits package with new, fresh songs.  And this is why it should be given credit.  Not original, but nostalgic.  And very good!
0671004107|4.0|J. Dougherty  April 14, 2009  Amazon.com Book Review  Contact, by Carl Sagan, is about Ellie Arroway, a scientist with an interest in extraterrestrials.  While working at Argus, the first astronomical station just for the search for extraterrestrials, Ellie discovers a code of prime numbers in a radio frequency from the planet Vega.  This brings the world together to complete an objective of deciphering the code.   Ellie finds the primer deeper in the message and it contains the blueprints to build a machine. Without the world unity, however, the message would have probably been lost.    The U.S. is well on its way to building the machine when a bomb destroys it.  Mr. Hadden, a wealthy eccentric, finances and builds the machine in Japan. Ellie and four other people go to Vega on the machine through black holes which are used as portals to a huge landing platform.  Once they arrive in Vega, the aliens read their minds to get questions answered on the human species.  Then the aliens say they will leave Earth alone.     When the space travelers get back, people think the trip to Vega was a hoax because the journey only took twenty-five minutes.  The U.S. government tells Ellie if she ever gets proof about the aliens, she can come out with what she saw.  In the meantime, the government is going to say the machine failed.    I think Contact accurately portrayed human nature as people have always been initially uneasy with new ideas and ways of life.  I thought the book was insightful in how an extraterrestrial encounter could really happen.  However, I thought there should have been some action in Contact because there was virtually none.  In addition, the transitions between the main points to the story, such as finding the message and building the machine, took too long and were a bit boring.  All in all I thought it was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book that makes you think.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Technical notes:<br /><br />YES, the Blu-Ray version IS the unrated version with silhouettes removed from the party/orgy scene.<br /><br />YES, it is in widescreen 1.85 format, HOWEVER... you should note that Kubrick did indeed intend a full frame viewing experience.  As I understand, he framed it for 4:3 but protected the 1.85 frame for theatrical viewing.  You should note that in the widescreen version, you are actually losing some image on the top and bottom of the frame.  The 4:3 full frame version is the actual full negative.  But to my disappointment...<br /><br />NO, there is no option to choose one or the other.  1.85 is the only version on this BD.<br /><br />Movie notes:<br /><br />This movie took a lot of growing on me.  I watched the film theatrically when it was released and did not like it at all.  Since then, in subsequent viewings, I have come to appreciate the movie more and the tremendous amount of thought that went into it.<br /><br />For a moment, put aside the stories you hear about hundreds of takes on one scene and all the months it took to shoot this film.  What Kubrick put into it was probably an OD of conceptualism for most of us.  Sometimes that can come across as pretentious and unnecessary, but with every viewing something new arises.  If you overanalyze and look for the seemingly most miniscule details, you will be surprised at how much you find and how much of it is 100% relevant.<br /><br />Many have condemned this film as total garbage.  I can't stand Tom Cruise at all and quite honestly he sucks in this film just about as much as he does in any other... but Kubrick makes up for Cruise's shortcomings in many different ways.  Perhaps Cruise's lack of talent even adds to the film in some way.  In any case, I think it's a great film... not quite a masterpiece like some film geeks might attest to, but definitely worth a few looks.
1576754499|2.0|I felt that Polak really stretched to fill the 200 pages of this book. Many of the points he made were repeated in six different places unnecessarily. I would have enjoyed hearing more in-depth case studies of some of those farmers he has worked with or even of the successful organizations he has created. While his overall point was good, this book failed to deliver it impactfully.

B00005JLWN|3.0|The movie Equilibrium was a decent movie, not a great one, but not a movie you would regret seeing. It follows the plot of George Orwell's famous novel \\"1984\\" very closely with the idea of a distopian society and is extremely similar to the novel 1984. Like 1984, the main character in Equilibrium rebels against the established government and society. The movie's heavy action and \\"Matrix\\" like scenes add entertainment, but they do get tiring after awhile. The movie is interesting and the plot is well developed. The progression of the main character is also very evident throughout the movie. The important thing is that the movie stays interesting and does have any real slow parts. However, I was not a fan of the ending, which I felt was very unrealistic(even though dodging bullets is not very realistic either). The movie is better than average, but nothing spectacular.

B001R4MEYS|5.0|Quite simply, this is one of the best metal albums to come out in recent years. While it is only seven tracks long, two of those are long enough to count as several different songs, with The Czar actually BEING four songs in one track. Every single song is amazing, and I'd absolutely rate this as a must have for anyone who likes metal.

0152465030|3.0|I bought this edition in the hope of getting one that has a slightly vintage feel to it. Actually it was almost new, and the colors of illustration was super bright -brighter than I expected, some colors are almost flourescent. Illustrations are a mixture of color and black&white. It's printed on matt paper (rather than a glossy one that you get if you buy new ones from bookshops these days). Overall I'm satisfied with it.

0060578793|3.0|Wiseman's venerable SAS Survival Handbook has been around for over 20 years at this point & keeps getting reprinted regularly. Yet every time I look at a copy, it seems to be an exact reprint of the original - same diagrams, same chapters, and (sadly) the same errors.<br />Wiseman tries to write a comprehensive, world-wide, all-season survival manual & he's successful to a degree. Realistically, given the difficulty of effectively covering all the topics adequately, we should stop trying to buy/write/publish such comprehensive 'encyclopedias' & focus on excellent regional manuals.<br /><br />As an outdoor survival instructor in western Canada I've always recommended my students get the small pocket editions as a worthwhile addition to their library - but that was after I'd pointed out some of the glaring weaknesses in this book such as:<br /><br />1) In trying to be a do-all book, Wiseman (and other authors in other books) winds up mentioning a plethora of survival skills, but with the more primitive skills he gives such a cursory overview that I believe no novice reader could ever successfully implement such techniques in their backyard, let alone in a survival emergency. Specifically, sections such as bow-drill fire making, making bows & arrows, and making stone tools are all about one column (half page) in length. No one without previous experience is going to have any success with those techniques nor are those already competent going to learn anything new.<br /><br />2) The ridiculous spear thrower (atlatl) design that has graced every edition of this book is completely inefficient & not found anywhere in the world wide archeological record of spear-thrower designs. Anyone w/ a modicum of physical coordination, athletic ability or common sense understanding of physics will immediately recognize this awkward design will add very little (if any) performance increase to casting the dart. Actually, his design does show up in one other place... the caveman fantasy movie \\"Quest For Fire\\"... yes, really.<br /><br />3) The most dangerous error is in the knot tying section. The Sheet Bend illustration (a safe & sturdy method of joining 2 ropes, even of differing diameters) is completely WRONG. In the diagram, the thinner black rope does not drop down through the bight in the larger white rope, but merely weaves under itself & stays on the same side. The method shown slips into what's called a Thief Knot... completely unstable & unsafe.<br />Do I think John Wiseman doesn't know how to really tie a sheet bend properly? Not really, I'm just annoyed that he or the publisher have never corrected a dangerous error in the illustration.<br />NOTE: in the latest (5th) version, the \\"Revised Edition,\\" from Harper Publishing (March 2009) I've noticed that the sheetbend illustration has finally been corrected. All the other content remains basically identical to the best of my knowledge (including the ridiculous spear-thrower & other minimalist primitive technology). Too bad it took 5 editions over 20 years to get a primary knot correct, but at least it is now.yes, really.     3) The most dangerous error is in the knot tying section.

B0000047CW|4.0|It seems sometimes this album (at least by the public) is overshadowed by the mega-popular and best selling [[ASIN:B0000047CX Getz/Gilberto]], but that is somewhat harsh, as this album is ever bit as worthy.  In fact the two should easily be bought together, as both are essential Bossa Nova albums and the only two albums you need that belong to the genre (as far as I'm concerned).  It's a bit more accessible and more upbeat, with more subtle swinging rhythms and quicker than it's companion.  Those who bought the aforementioned mega album and were let down a bit by the downtempo will be happy that this album contains what they wanted.<br /><br />That's not to say this album suffers from lack of gorgeousness.  Right from the start, an essential love song, Desafindo, opens up the album, and the singing lines are replaced by gorgeous saxaphone playing.  And while Gilberto was a vital part of that record, Charlie Bird's guitar playing blows Gilberto away.  He actually plays some solos, and boy are they pretty mean!  Very intricate and melodic, and he's just as good as providing a gorgeous rhythm as he is when he adds spice and flair to the songs.  The aforementioned beats are played great with the backing band, and Stan Getz's saxaphone is in fine form, as usual.  And unlike it's companion, there are no vocals.<br /><br />Back to the songs.  Each of these songs will satisfy the hunger for bossa nova rhythms. (but it's not the same rhythm for the whole length, of course!), and it's as melancholy either.  The only track to be featured on later albums, Desafindo, is agruably better than the hit version, as the instrumental section is a lot different, as well as the intro.  It definitely won't replace the vocalist track, but the vocalist track will never be like this one.  The whole album is not very long, especially if you cut out the second cut of Desafino (why would you though), but the time suits it just fine.  It's over quick, but it doesn't have any filler, thank god.<br /><br />Bossa Nova, to the unitiated, may be hard to find, considering most \\"well known\\" bossa nova is the garbage you can find on one of those lame albums you can find at any gift shop in Palm Desert, California.  This trascends all of the elevator muzak garbage you can find at the aforementioned gift shops.  If you say you like Bossa Nova, and all you own are one of those lame noveltly albums (the kind in those gift shops that are part of those listening things with the cheap speakers that also sell native american music) or a couple of _______ albums by Thievery Corporation, I advise you pick this and [[ASIN:B0000047CX Getz/Gilberto]] and experience the real thing.<br /><br />8.0/10o the unitiated, may be hard to find, considering most \\"well known\\" bossa nova is the garbage you can find on one of those lame albums you can find at any gift shop in Palm Desert, California.

1593072937|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Frank Miller as a human being is an arrogant, sexist, racist homophobe who represents everything that is horrible about the human race.  Still, questions of author's intent aside, he has written some pretty good stuff.  And it may, in part, be the foulness of his own ideology that allows him to create a character like Marv, Sin City's protagonist, who is worthy of our sympathy, yet so monstrous, so twisted, that his only redemption is to die.  Unlike Marv, Miller is able to redeem himself through the accidental genius of his work, his contributions to the literary world.<br /><br />Darker than the noir of the mid-twentieth century, this book oozes with all the sleaze and filth of humanity.  One does not \\"like\\" this sort of material--one endures it and appreciates it.  Is it helpful to explore the darkness and emptiness of the human race with such fervor?  Is it helpful to go through wretched hell only to emerge feeling empty and tarnished?  I will leave these questions to the literary critics and philosophers; I just know that Book 1 of Sin City is damn disturbing and damn good.
B001R7IHA0|4.0|Keith Urban is a good artist. Period. I would take exception to ANYONE who says otherwise. I have seen him in concert and seen first hand that he can lay it on the line with no retakes.  So why only four stars? They wouldn't let me give three and a half.  There are good songs on the CD. Kiss a Girl and Sweet Thing (the early releases) are unfortunately the best.   I can't find any hidden jewels. My Heart is Open is almost an Alan Parsons rip-off. I do like Alan Parsons but this just seemed chinsy.   \\"Til Summer Comes Around\\" may be the most disappointing song on the CD. I was hoping for something really upbeat and lilting. It was a long, cold winter here and I really wanted a \\"Flip Flop Summer\\" or \\"Six-pack Summer\\" type. This was boring. After all Keith has had some tremendous upbeat songs.   Oh, well.  He's still a fine artist. Enjoyable album overall. But I'll burn out on this one too quickly.
0140157352|5.0|I'll start from a different tack to the other reviewers. I researched Roger Fisher's life. Here is my \\"biography\\". Born in the USA in 1922, he was 19 when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and off he was sent to the killing fields. After the war, he studied law and practised litigation for about a decade. To this point in his life, he had seen very little apart from people beating each other over the head either physically or emotionally/psychologically to gain an advantage and a victory. A turning point came when he asked, \\"is there another way?\\". For the next two decades, he spent his time with high-class negotiators. The best in the business. He asked, observed and practised. Today, it is called Alternative Dispute Resolution. I'm not sure it had a name back then but I've heard mediators who have been in the field for a long time say that they witness the counter-parties grow as people. In the late 70s, Fisher started writing the book and in 1981, it was published. The second edition has the ten most commonly asked questions readers of the book had over the next decade along with Fisher's, Ury's and Patton's responses.     I have started to apply the principles of the book in the six months since I first read it and I feel that *both* the outcomes I achieve in negotiations and the depth of my relationship with others have improved. I still have a long way to go but I feel I am on a track which is healthy. If people want to obtain what they want and have good relationships, this is required reading. I want to make one point so that it is not lost on anyone. Applying the principles in this book does not mean becoming a softie or pushover in negotiations. If that is what is happening, the book is not being applied correctly.     If people want to \\"win\\", I put it to you that it will show over the long term and your actions will not be sustainable in your own life and the life of others. In which case, what is the point?     In terms of results which Roger Fisher himself hasachieved, he recently was able to settle a decades long territorial dispute between two Sth American nations.     I believe that the principles illuminated in this book are the way of the future.     All the best.   Tom.  tom(dot)369(at)hotmail(dot) com
006051048X|4.0|Audio CD edition of this book looks great and it sounds great. It is a treat to have Neil read his own work as it was intended. The whole cat and mouse game and metaphor works brilliantly.    Maybe I am being too picky here, or maybe I have read too much Stephen King over the years and expect certain pace, but Neil's prose appears too wordy and slow for my taste, too many skirt-by-skirt rundowns, repetitions, eyes like black buttons (I got it the first time). The end of the book was somehow the best because prose picked up in pace.    Still can't explain to myself what  Ms. This or Ms. That added to the story. Who cares about Coraline's neighbors and their career in the theatre? Fast forward worked nicely here.
B001J32H6M|5.0|This is best score in the Indiana Jones franchise (well at least in my opinion). I give the 5 stars for the score written for the film overall and am happy that the new soundtracks are remastered in which the sound is impeccable. There is only one tiny complaint...just wish the entire score was available, but I digress lol. P.S.- I'm still not sure as to why some reviewers rate a certain product because they had a bad experience with a certain seller in which it has nothing to do with the product itself.

B001TOD92C|5.0|There is nearly nothing sadder than watching an old dog walk into a wall or bark at a shadow.  They lack the intelligence to know better, and they can't help but to rely on the familiar.  A broken down wrestler is in many ways similar to an old dog.  As Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Rourke) shows, however, there is one difference: If willing, an old wrestler CAN learn new tricks.<br /><br />The Ram's life is depressing.  He's a decayed professional wrestler whose end is near.  To pay the bills he has to all but beg a weasely supermarket middle-manager for extra hours at a deli counter.  End's meat, literally.  He has no real friends, no close family, and his health is declining rapidly because of the physical and self-prescribed chemical abuse he has endorsed over the years.  On the other hand, he's revered by his fellow wrestlers - a tutor, he's a living legend.  Oh to be King and pauper in the same day.<br /><br />Essentially \\"The Wrestler\\" is a professional wrestling biography - an expose similar to what Bouton's [[ASIN:097091170X Ball Four]] was to baseball or [[ASIN:B0018NKAYY This is Spinal Tap]] is to the music industry.  It's the backstage meetings and the locker room pharmacist, a look inside the detailed structure and choreography that defines wrestling (despite what an infamously hilarious crying wrestling fan would believe - google \\"crying wrestling fan\\").  Low brow fun, a contemporary Coliseum.  That's the appeal of this movie.<br /><br />Not everyone ends up like Hulk Hogan, a rich, reality tv star with a masculine daughter who beats Jay Leno on \\"chin-offs\\", and may be a tranny...err...or much less a Governor like Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura.  A depiction of the dark side is different, with increasing injuries as diminishing skills and physical ability cause the vets to take more risks for an increasingly bloodthirsty audience.  Like O'Brien's [[ASIN:0767902890 The Things They Carried]], The Ram shows us, through a brilliant portrayal by Mickey Rourke, that the life of an aging wrestler is often times dismal, and there are more than the visible, physical injuries.<br /><br />I'd be remiss if I didn't mention two things: One, the FACT that Rourke deserved best actor award over Sean Penn.  Milk?  Seriously?  Are you f'ing kidding me?  Highway robbery.  Two, Marisa Tomei is has some very erotic scenes, and looks awesome naked.<br /><br />Either way, great movie.

1881273156|5.0|This book is truly wonderful. My fiance and I have been on a rocky road for about 3 years. Nothing I seemed to do made him happy. We were about ready to give up and call it quits. Actually we had broken up several times already. My Father suggested I read this book, I am so thankful I did. It is so very true that people have there own love languages. After reading this book I could tell what our problem was. Our love tanks were running on empty, and we all know what an empty tank does \\"NOTHING\\" it just sits there empty. Now that we both know what each of out love language is we can speak it and fill the tanks that have been empty for so long. It has been almost a year now and I think we are more in love now than we have ever been. Thanks to this great book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. I think you should read this book even if you have a great marriage/relationship. It may just have what your looking for. GET THIS BOOK! BUY IT BORROW IT! JUST READ IT!!
0307341550|4.0|Book Club Review  Sharp Objects  by Gillian Flynn    Our book club's book for April was SHARP OBJECTS, by Gillian Flynn.  We decided on this book because we wanted to try reading something that is more issues-based, and this is a story about a young woman who engages in the disturbing practice of \\"cutting\\" (self-mutilation).  As a club we do not mind an intense read, and we thought we could all learn more about the psychology behind cutting by reading it.    The narrator of the book is a reporter for a third-rate Chicago newspaper who is sent back to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, to investigate the murder of a little girl--the second such murder in a short amount of time, which makes it seem like a serial killer is on the loose.  The editor thinks that Camille Preaker will be able to get the townspeople to open up and talk, because she is a native.  However, Camille goes back only under duress, because she has a very (and I do mean VERY) unpleasant relationship with her mother and stepfather (she doesn't even know who her real father is). She also has a sexually precocious half-sister who alternates between being a sort of Lolita and an almost catatonic clinging vine.  Camille's investigation uncovers some truly creepy things going on, including the fact that the two murdered girls were actually quite hateful, and that her own mother had odd relationships with those girls.  To say more would be a spoiler.    We found a lot to like and admire about this book.  First, the author is an incredibly sharp writer, full of insights and observations that are often disturbing, delivered in a way that slaps you across the face with their vividness.  Second, it was interesting to see the author going so much against \\"type\\" -- in other words, having the audacity/courage to make little girls into nasty, vicious creatures instead of sweet, innocent victims.  The insights into the narrator's \\"cutting\\" are deep and disturbing...The reader comes to realize the source of her behavior and how she is almost powerless to stop herself from playing out the script created in her childhood.  There are also some really intense plot surprises here, even if the middle of the book drags a bit.    What we liked less were some of the more \\"Southern Gothic\\" aspects of the book, moments that seemed like they were lifted directly from MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL.  Several of the characters are little more than cliches, and the pacing was inconsistent.  Still, we all agreed that Flynn is a terrific writer, and we look forward to more by her.  It probably does go without saying that this book isn't for the squeamish.  It is true noir but it does have just that little ray of hope/possible redemption that keeps you rooting for the heroine.
0525421033|5.0|Mia is the odd one out in her family. Like Mia both of her parents are involved in the music world - the punk scene - while Mia finds her niche in the classical world. The first time she touched a cello in third grade music class she knew that she had found her passion. She quickly excelled and now, a senior in high school, has a specialized professor and surpasses most college students that she accompanies. She even hopes to go to Julliard in the fall, even if it means leaving her awesome boyfriend Adam behind.<br /><br />Early on a February morning though life for Mia changes drastically. What was supposed to be snow day fun suddenly turned into the biggest nightmare that Mia has ever faced and it all happened in an instant. Now Mia has to make the biggest choice of her life, to hold on or let go.<br /><br />I have to start off by saying; I'm going to try as hard as possible not to gush about this book, as it is truly great. I sat down and read it all at once, never taking my eyes off the page and just entranced by Mia's story, not wanting it to end. After I was done, my jaw literally fell open in awe of the greatness!<br /><br />Let me start with the writing style. Gayle Forman managed to create this lyrical tone in the book that made the story dance through the reader's mind and implant itself in their heart. The words flowed off the page, just like they were notes coming off a cello. She created deep emotion in a short time and created a story that hits close to home, regardless of who you are or the experiences you have had.<br /><br />The story itself was absolutely breathtaking. To have to go through what Mia does is heart wrenching. The decisions she has to make and the things she has to see are so vivid, that you feel like you are right there in her position. I also love how music, in all its shapes and forms, are an essential part of the book; it's a great finishing touch to the book.<br /><br />Now we come to the characters, my absolute favorite part! Mia herself was fascinating. She had so much to offer to the reader by sharing her story and she expressed her emotions freely. The words truly did come off the page in her voice and she became real. Not only was Mia great, but the supporting characters were fabulous as well. They were all so real and you could feel the love in their voices and the hurt that they felt. I especially loved the grandfather, who was quiet almost the whole time until one moment when he said one of the most memorable quotes in the entire story. For me this just added to the amazingness.<br /><br />I am still in awe of this book and urge you all to run and grab a copy as soon as possible, so that you might experience the magic of this story for yourself. It is horribly real and extremely emotional, but it leaves you with so much. I absolutely cannot wait to read more of Gayle Forman's future works, as she is truly a rising star.much to offer to the reader by sharing her story and she expressed her emotions freely.

0618918248|5.0|Believers in any religion will find little to agree with in Dawkins' book because it is a polemic against religion in any form and in favor of atheism and intolerance of religion.  Initially he says that he wants to \\"raise consciousness to the fact that to be an atheist is a realistic expectation, and a brave and splendid one.\\" (p. 1) But he soon goes on the attack against religion as pleading for special protection from unbelief.  \\"A widespread assumption, which nearly everybody in our society accepts - the non-religious included - is that religious faith is especially vulnerable to offence and should be protected by an abnormally thick wall of respect, in a different class from the respect that any human being should pay to any other.\\" (p. 20) He makes it clear that he will show no such respect, for he sees the \\"God Hypothesis\\" as a \\"pernicious delusion.\\" (p. 31)<br /><br />What's wrong with religion? He maintains that \\"even mild and moderate religion helps to provide the climate of faith in which extremism naturally flourishes.\\" (p. 303) Moderate religion, he says, is \\"an open invitation to extremism.\\" (p. 306)<br /><br />As a believer, I found little in this book that I agree with.  What I found useful was that Dawkins is encyclopedic in his review of literature on the subject of atheism, especially the books written by scientists.  In an appendix, he also provides a listing of organizations and websites where atheists can find support.  Even more interesting is the fact that he recommends Biblical literacy.  Religious instruction of the young is equated with child abuse, but he points to a listing of phrases (pp. 341-343) which require knowledge of the Bible in order to be an educated person.<br /><br />The book is very entertaining unless you are a believer without a sense of humor.  Dawkins also raises some points that believers should take seriously in clarifying their beliefs.  For example, I think believers should listen when Dawkins asks: \\"But why, in any case, do we so readily accept the idea that the one thing you must do if you want to please God is believe in him?  What's so special about believing?  Isn't it just as likely that God would reward kindness, or generosity, or humility?\\" (p. 104)<br /><br />I give this book five stars because it is an outstanding example of a polemic against religion.accept the idea that the one thing you must do if you want to please God is believe in him?

B0000542D2|5.0|For it's time this was cutting edge cinema. I couldn't begin to count the breakthrough shots. It has lost little to time. The music is infectious, and while a tribute to teen idols it is never cloying. Probably the most startling thing about it is how tame the Beatles and their music are now. When the film was shot, many in this country considered them dangerous radicals. You can't go wrong buying this DVD. The smile won't leave your faces for days.
1594201927|5.0|Niall Ferguson offers a comprehensive collection of anecdotes and observations about the development of finance. He begins with a brief discussion of pre-money societies. Then, he carries you through the birth of banking in Renaissance Italy, the 18th-century Mississippi and South Sea bubbles, the role of Nathan Mayer Rothschild in the Napoleonic Wars, and the 20th-century transition from the Bretton Woods model to free-market derivatives and currency trading. getAbstract finds Ferguson's book eminently readable, entertaining and informative. One caveat: the author's approach is more that of a journalist than a historian, so he does not advance much of a comprehensive theory to explain the events he discusses, even the ones that are still occurring, notably, the financial crisis that began in 2008. This tasty financial history thoroughly covers who, what, when, where and how, a feast of facts with not quite enough \\"why\\" for dessert.
0375428550|5.0|This book was the only resource that I studied before taking the TOEFL. I did not take private lessons, and tanks to this book I could pass the test in only one attempt. If you have enough time to study and practice what the book teaches, do not worry you are going to pass.  I applied all the tecniques that the book teaches and really help, specially in reading and listening part. Speaking and writing was a little hard to me, so I needed to practice a little more, but a got 95. A score of 95 studying only this book is good. Don't you think? Also, I have to encourage that you have to read a lot, newsweek, time,discovery magazines. Whatch CNN is good for vocabulary.  Practice, practice, practice, if you do not have time for this, this is not the book for you.
B001B1T7BU|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie.  She is 2 and loves the real puppies, the farm animals and she knows all the characters.

I seem to be having bad luck receiving things lately, so I've not bothered re-ordering with any other 'carriers.'  What's going on lately?

Most people are watching where they spend their money.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Get busy living or get busy dying, was the theme presented throughout, the brilliantly written screenplay in, \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" Not just another prison movie, there's a wealth of life principles and metaphors for every student of success. Andy Dufresne had hope, never giving up his pursuit of freedom.<br /><br />Andy, played by Tim Robins, in the midst of dire circumstances while serving a life sentence for a crime he claimed, didn't commit, held on to hope.  According to Red, played by Morgan Freeman; \\"At Shawshank Prison, everyone believes they're innocent and hope is just a #&%*$  pipe dream.\\" (potential spoilers below)<br /><br />During a pivotal final scene (posted below), Andy asked Red; \\"Do you think you'll ever get out of here?  Yeah when I'm old and gray, with a few marbles rolling around in my head. I don't know if I could make it on the outside, I'm a institutional man.\\"  Like Brook, an older character in the movie, Red became dependent on the security of prison and cynical about the prospect of being paroled. \\"These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them.\\"<br /><br />Institutionalization isn't limited to the penitentiary. Many become tolerant, dependent and accustomed to the false security promised by the walls of their personal prisons. Could be the wrong career or job, a toxic relationship or circumstance that seems out of their control. They become hopeless victims, accept their lot in life and just give up hope.<br /><br />Andy was different than most of the inmates at Shawshank. He kept hope alive by dreaming and even visualizing his future -- Zihuatanejo.  He stayed productive, made  friends and alliances even with prison guards in order to advance his strategy and master plan. He didn't dwell on past mistakes.  He learned how to overcome obstacles while making consistent progress with daily decisions that advanced him toward the prize. His hope was cultivated by a plan of action and daily steps. Red noticed Andy's\\" meticulous nature.\\"  He was curious, observant and thorough. Andy developed constructive habits and attitudes and took consistent action during his tenure. His unwavering commitment and intention would eventually deliver his ultimate goal, freedom.<br /><br />\\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way...The way a prisoner imagined the future affected his longevity.\\" ― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning<br /><br />In the scene, Andy declared; \\"Guess it comes down to a simple choice; get busy living, or get busy dying.\\"  Choose to live, dream and hope or just give up and die a slow painful death. Whatever the circumstance, it boils down to our ability to choose our attitude, envision our future and take the small steps every day to achieve it.  Now that's the substance of faith and hope.<br /><br />We chose life. In 1987, I made a decision to escape from my job. I methodically planned and executed an exit strategy. Geology presents a perfect metaphor, \\"pressure and time.\\" No pain, no gain. Freedom comes with a price.  Sure it took work and perseverance, but I was confident because I chose to take charge of my future. Each day, month and year I advanced closer to the prize. Seven years later, The Shawshank Redemption premiered in October 1994, the month and year we escaped. According to Red who personifies the  hopeless, faithless, scoffers in our life; \\"there's no use for hope on the inside, it will drive a man insane.\\"  Don't worry, there's a happy ending for Red too.<br /><br />If you're not happy, it's insane to believe that somehow your circumstance will magically change. Don't leave your future to chance or in the hands of others. You're a victor not victim. It's okay to hope and dream again. Make the decision, plot your escape, execute your plan and the life-changing process willfollow.  Don't listen to the inmates. Find and follow the freedom lovers!  \\"Get busy living or get busy dying.\\"edom lovers!  \\"Get busy living or get busy dying.\\"
B00005JKHP|3.0|Everyone seems hyped up about the new f/x and such; but my issue with STTMP is that our most revered characters are relegated to second-tier status. The plot is an obvious rehash of \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" with a misguided attempt to thrust new unknown characters into the lead roles. HUGE mistake.    Thankfully WRATH OF KHAN corrected all that, and saved TREK from franchise oblivion.    STTMP actually works better if you think of it as the LAST in the series, rather than the first.

B001O2ZW1A|1.0|I flew to London to see Steve 8 years ago - point being, no one is a bigger fan of him than me.  I've tracked his brilliant career since 1994 \\"Sky Moves Sideways\\" - I've seen 5 of his concerts.  But this is nothing like his other stuff except maybe \\"Recordings\\" 2001, a CD I also discarded, or \\"Voyage 34\\" track 4 - 1993.   I cant get stoned enough to agree with any favorable reviews.  So I'm just saying be aware!    BTW - when this review of mine gets o out of 100 \\"helpful\\" it means 0 out of 100 don't \\"agree\\", that isn't the same as helpful, Steve Wilson reminds me of the Beatles as far as talent goes and I'm just saying this CD is NOT the Steve I know and love.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|I really like this movie. I loved Casino Royale. And this movie feels like an extention of that movie. Craig is again awesome as James Bond. Pretty darn close to be the best James Bond of the whole series. (It's really tough to beat Sean Connery). The only thing that holds this movie back a little was the villian. James Bond has always had classic memorable villians. And the short guy in this movie was not scary or intimidating and not memorable. And James Bonds needs a challange. I'm already looking forward for the next Bond Movie. I hope Craig stays on for a long time. One thing that has stayed consistant is the beautiful women. Quantum of Solace definitely has hot women. But also another draw back is that there was no Female villian. There is nothing hotter than a dangerous Bond Girl.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Showing my age here: when STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE finally appeared in 1979, I was among the first in line; I stood in the snow waiting breathlessly for the second show. When the audience for the premiere emptied out, everyone had blank, bewildered faces. Not good. After watching it I understood why. STTMP put the best characters on the sidelines and rehashed \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\\"     Fans develop attachments to characters and themes.    Even the late great Joseph Campbell revered the original STAR WARS trilogy. The original will always remain a classic, and Empire, the immediate sequel, nearly topped it. But by the time we got to Jedi we had cutesy Ewoks running around and a rehash of blow-up-death-star.     Drunk on profits, Lucas was already dumbing down the franchise.    Little did we know just how dumb it would get until PHANTOM MENACE.     We've all seen and suffered through it anyway, so I'm preaching to choirs. But it's still staggering to witness just how childish, simplistic and foolish PHANTOM is - this from a man who could literally film anything he wanted - and he did.    Nobody wanted to say NO to George Lucas.     Jar-Jar Binks: easily the most reviled \\"character\\" in film history; that took a lot of work to accomplish.    Darth Vader - a cultural icon - is reduced to a silly child. \\"Annie! Annie!\\"     ANNIE??? That's a girl's name, and a rather famous one.    There are so many jaw-droppingly stupid scenes, from the underwater \\"fish\\" people prancing around to the idiotic \\"finale\\" with Annie running amok as a wannabe pilot.     After suffering through this I have more respect for Mel Brooks' SPACEBALLS. It's about the same - except Lucas was serious.

There are fun new characters and a new understanding of all the clues presented in the previous books.  I stayed up all night reading it and I can conclusively say that this is the best conclusion to a series I have read! This series is better than Twilight, Marked, and any other series out there.  It is only comparable to Holly Black's wonderful work.  I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|The british rock group Dire Straits started out as a laid back blues band with a modern sheen.  This album, their first, displays that kinda sound more than any of their other albums.  This is long before the synth pop of \\"Brothers In Arms\\": Mark Knopfler's guitar is actually the dominate instrument here.  He plays with a clean tone throughout and pulls off blues licks and solos effortlessly, all within a format that is half-way between pop and gritty blues.  The production is fresh and has a cool, almost sensual feeling to it.    The album's center-piece, \\"Sultans Of Swing\\",  is the best example of what this album is about.  A lament for a long forgotten bar-band that is being overwhelmed by the punk and disco movements, \\"Sultans\\" has become a staple on rock radio at a time when punk was taking over everything.  Infact, Dire Straits may very well be one of the last bands with a classic rock sound to spend considerable time in the mainstream and \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" shows just how badly the band was struggling with that realization.  It just comes to show you that traditionalists can triumph along with innovators.    Though the rest of the songs are not as big as \\"Sultans\\" they still hold up the album quite well.  Knopfler's poetic lyrics suite the sound textures perfectly and the backing band (while not exactly flashy) holds everything together nicely.  But ultimately, Knopfler's guitar work takes center stage here.  After listening for even a short while, it becomes evident that he can play better than most other guitarists can with distortion and effects.    The more than capable instrumental abilities of the band was definitely a contributing factor to their success. But perhaps it was just that classic rock still had many loyal fans even as many rock fans turned to punk and new wave.  This is a must have, especially if you like blues-based AOR rock or just rock in general.

Refined sugar is responsible for many of today's ills, obesity, diabetes, cavities and many others.  In spite of this book and others sugar consumption in this country still remains high.  It is important that mothers and fathers become aware of the dangers of refined sugar so they can teach their children to avoid it. They should also stay off sweets as an example to their children.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell does it again. As in his earlier books, The Tipping Point and Blink, he rounds up research from a variety of sources to support an intriguing idea. In this case, he questions why it is that some individuals rocket to success, while others, with seemingly equal potential, achieve much less. He posits that an \\"outlier,\\" someone who achieves at a level outside statistical norms, really owes his success to a variety of factors that are not in his control.<br /><br />As he marches through a series of case studies and summaries of research, the author delivers the argument that the very successful benefit from opportunities as diverse as birth dates, parenting styles, and cultural legacies. In all cases, though, he points to the value of cumulative hours of work undertaken by his high achievers, whether he is talking about Bill Gates or the Beatles. While we assume that great success is bestowed upon those with outsize intelligence or ambition, Gladwell marshalls research and examines biographies to show how his selected \\"outliers\\" actually developed.<br /><br />As the book progresses, the reader looks for, but does not find, any evidence or argument against Gladwell's chosen thesis. Nonetheless, the research he presents is intriguing and endlessly debatable. Outliers would make a great selection for a book discussion group.<br /><br />Gladwell is an excellent writer, and he pulls the reader into his argument using fascinating and readable examples. While the ending is a bit indulgent, this short book, overall, is well worth your time.

0316067601|4.0|Luttrell's book is a little hard to choke down at times. He seemed so obsessed with this own greatness. Luttrell comes off egocentric but he goes to great lengths to describe why he is and the training he went through to get there.  The book read like an action movie and the book seemed to praise the greatness of the men that he was with.<br /><br />I am thankful for Luttrell's account of SEAL training. I think that most of us have no clue what they go through. I thought that basic training in the Army was tough...could not image the kind of crap they went through.<br /><br />I believe that their sacrifice will never be forget it is etched into my mind and they will live through me as well as all the people who read this book.<br /><br />Luttrell discourses on the rules of engagement are interesting and show just how much politicking has gone into the wars that we have fought and are still fighting. If the politicians trusted American military half of these wars would be over and won...anyway I digress. Read the book!

I figured that lighting wouldn't strike me twice so I picked up A Most Wanted Man and I was wrong....lighting did strike twice.  With A Most Wanted Man, Lecarre  has set a new standard for tedium.    A Most Wanted Man is really more like a 3 paragraph tale(that in and of itself wouldn't be very interesting), laboriously stretched into over 300 pages. The first 300 plus pages are spent with various convoluted European intellignce agencies convincing themselves, and the author I guess trying to convince the reader that the most wanted man in question is anything more than a immigrant derelict.  Then out of the blue, the ugly Americans sweep in a renditon the derelict.,,,bada bing bada boom.

B000U7169M|5.0|I really enjoyed his movie.  Knowing the Bible's plaques and also knowing scientific facts of how they could be justified if you wanted to not take them to reason of it all being God's will I could appreciate this movie very much.  I found this gripping, intense and also touching at times.  I would say be your own critic in this particular movie.  Don't watch the special features first!  Not knowing how they did the locus scene made it more intense and horrific.  I didn't notice the rating of this movie but I would give it a R rating myself and not let small children watch this movie.  I would even not trust a PG-13 rating because of the occult message in the movie of Satin verses God message that was sent during this movie when they arrived in Haven.  This is just my opinion.  I am a Hilary Swank movie collector and have no regrets I've added this to my collection.  I thought she did a great job in this movie. AnnaSophia was delightful yet frightening at times when she gave that glare of hers with those beautiful eyes.  I am glad they selected her to play the little girl who lived in the swamps.

In trying to find and buy my favorite albums, this being one of them, I found that Amazon amazingly hadn't had this album added to the site.. all searches for this album pointed to a prior album, \\" Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac\\".. NOT this album, which I was seeking desperately! Finally, the right album with the right pointers! Yay!    This album, very similar to the one that follows, \\"Rumors\\", is rich with nostalgia for me, rich with warm tones of Lindsey, Stevie, and the rest, rich with energy and depth. Together with Steve Miller's \\"Fly Like An Eagle, captures a very specific time period in my adolescence. If you love Rumors, this is the Album that began that new sound for this evolving band. Pop ish, yes, but soulful as well. Every song is a stand out for me.    Thank you!

6305907145|5.0|The more I watch this brilliant adaptation, the more thrilled I am by Rozema's daring, as well as the breadth of her knowledge.  Austen's letters are well integrated, Fanny's direct address to the camera is audacious and arresting.  O'Connor's manner, her delicacy, sensibility, spirited autonomy despite the character's real destitution, are so effective that repeated viewings make this a richer experience rather than a tired one.  I love the post-colonial touch of acknowledging the slave trade and the probable abuses on Sir Thomas's Antigua property.    I can't recommend this film enough.  Austen fans may initially feel that it is too innovative to be true Austen, but I think that, in fact, it's not only the greatest adaptation, but the most startling tribute to her genius.  Thank you, Patricia Rozema, for this beautiful, unflinching, witty delight!  p.s. Listen to Nivola's reading of the Sterne excerpt.  Wow!!

1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin in \\"Brooklyn\\" attempts to give some fresh air to much written about the Irish immigration to the United States. I was wondering if there is anything new or any possible form that has not been tried with this subject...<br /><br />The main character is a young woman, Eilis Lacey from Enniscorthy, who is skilled in accountancy, but, in the 1950s, cannot find a job in her town, despite the recommendations of her older, glamorous sister, Rose, who works in an office. Their three brothers are all working in England. When a priest from Brooklyn offers to take care of Eilis and arrange a good job for her if she comes to America, she agrees, therefore changing her life forever.<br /><br />The novel unravels slowly, showing Eilis as a reasonable girl who is also quite lucky - the priest, Father Flood, really cares about her, the job at the department store offers prospects of advancement towards the office work, Eilis lives in a decent boarding house with several other girls, and her employers contribute to her tuition for college evening classes. Her life is purposeful and organized. Only her feelings are not so easy to tame...<br />Eventually, Eilis meets Tony, who wants to marry her - but then she has to go back to Ireland in an emergency and the promises she made to Tony may get broken...<br /><br />I liked this novel very much - written in a simple, but suggestive prose, it reminded me much more of \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" than, for example, of \\"Angela's Ashes\\". Rather old-fashioned in structure, it is simply a good story, which probably mirrors the lives of many immigrant girls from that period. I was impressed by Toibin's ability to enter the mind of a young girl - I think Eilis's feelings and doubts are very realistic. I only feel that this novel has some unfulfilled potential - I wanted more from it, felt unsatisfied, there were many threads that could be developed and the novel could have been longer, richer and deeper. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.

0743298039|4.0|This is definitely a book-lovers book, because it tells a story about the art of telling a story. I'm not exactly a book-lover. I love to listen to books while doing mundane chores, and rarely have time to actually read an entire book, and so I would never finish any book that is not somewhat strange and fascinating from the very beginning. The Thirteenth Tale is quite intriguing, especially because the book is so much about twins and psychological disorders. I think the reader has to wonder which characters are sane, insane, or actually a ghost. The only reason this book didn't get a 5 rating from me is the story(ies) became quite convoluted by the end, and I lost faith that the story could be wrapped up neatly. I was concerned that it was becoming too fantastic. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the ending and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story that borders on \\"unreal\\".

0765350386|5.0|It reminds me of Ocean's Eleven meets The Italian Job, but set in Mordor after Sauron has ruled for 1000 years or so. In many fantasy stories, a dark lord is rising and it is up to our heroes to defeat him before that happens. In this, the Dark Lord is already set in place as the status quo and the heroes have to motivate others to want a change.....Yet there is a noble class of The Lord Ruler's flunkies who will need to be scammed and robbed along the way, to finance this big revolt.....I love it...<br /><br />The pace, style, and grand-heist-scheme-in-a-fantasy-setting plot remind me of Michael J. Sullivan's The Crown Conspiracy while the characters and rags-to-revolutionary story make me think of The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. Certainly a great blending, as both of these were recent 5-star reviews for me....<br /><br />Okay, now I've finished it. All I can say is WOW. Why did I wait so long to read this? I must read the other two books in the series very soon.......
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|it defies everything negative anyone ever said about them.<br /><br />Energetic, honest, somber, thoughtful, awe inspiring, and basically AH-MAZZZZING!!!
0930289234|5.0|Enjoyed reading this from start to finish.  Excellent graphic novel!  Very good story that keeps you guessing about where it's heading.  As you get move into the second half of the book, the story really begins to pull you along for a very enjoyable ride.
B000FIMG68|5.0|When I first met LOST, it was love at first sight. This has been one of the most continually interesting and entertaining series I have ever seen. There are those that complain about the continuity and the elongated and fractured story telling. Not me, I love the oddness, the mystery, I love the unanswered questions. I adore a story with an evolving mythology and this series has that in spades.  I was so excited when the second season DVDs arrived at my door. I immediately opened the package and started watching. Over the next two weeks I watched the whole incredible season. Everything about this set is great. Not only does this series hold up to repeated viewings, it grows, it deepens. Each episode kept me on the edge of my seat and left me wanting more.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Any BluRay owner should purchase this series.  The crispness, quality is amazing.  This BluRay DVD definitely sets the baseline for what a good nature documentary should be.  Hopefully more amazing series will be released in the near future.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I purchased this joystick after using older Saitek Joysticks and loving them. This one fits right in. I have had no issues with this joystick at all, and when playing IL1946 it seems extremely accurate. It has more buttons than I could ever want and the scroll wheel under the HAT works great for flaps. Overall love this product Saitek does it again.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|I did not like the font used.  This was the worst I have ever seen used any where.  The starting story line was flawed. It started in the middle went back in time then proceed on, not so good.  The rest was OK.  For those who the saw the early film it was lacking something.  In all a bad remake of the era.  The plot should have been the stole generation, and maybe had a focus on the white Australia policy. In Darwin and W.A. at that time the return of Chinese refugees off the boats back to face the japs, and execution in Singapore was common. Bad history there. Not enough not by far!
0316017922|4.0|If I were seeking  a not-so-in-depth look at success, I could have picked up this book for some light reading to kill some time in airport, etc. However, I found this book to be full of anecdotal stories and quotable sayings that left me feeling bored and frustrated.     Ok, so is the secret to success when your were born, or how hard your work, or how you were raised, or is the 10,000 hours of required education ? He never nails it down. And all of those things are obvious to any literate human.     There's nothing new here.    Gladwell's thinking is all over the map, padded with glib descriptions and shallow support for his arguements. If only he had put in the 10,000 requisite hours of accumulated wisdom before coming out with this book, it might have been worth my time.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Although I enjoyed their first 3 albums I always felt that Mastodon were a work in progress. It seemed to me that they were searching for their true sound and that when they found it they would create an epic. Following on from the themes of fire, water and earth that they gave us on their previous works they have now given us air, and this is a work of musical art that reaches new highs. This album is a truly gutsy performance that crosses time from the roots of metal to the present and already deserves album of the year status. It's very pleasing to hear a band that with an already  burgeoning legion of fans could have easily just settled for what has already worked for them but they are clearly on a mission. This is a brave and daring album that hearkens back to the sounds of many progressive bands from the past but stands on it's own and is destined to become a legend in it's own right. Let's hope that the mainstream music press recognises and delights in it's many wonders and that Mastodon get the plaudits that they deserve
B0009X766Y|5.0|\\"The Sting\\" has gone down in Hollywood history as being one of the best fims of all-time. Winner of a whopping 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 1973, \\"The Sting\\" stars gorgeous Robert Redford and Paul Newman as con artists in 1930's Chicago trying to con the head of the mafia, played superbly by Robert Shaw. The best gangster film of its kind, the frontrunner for that years Oscar for Best Picture was \\"The Exorcist, but \\"The Sting\\" would come out on top. A superb film with an amazing cast, \\"The Sting\\" has never aged.<br /> The DVD is beautiful and comes in a 2 disc set that opens up like a book. One disc has the newly restored WIDESCREEN format of the film, and the other has a ton of special features, including the original theatrical trailer, as well as a wonderful documentary on the movie, with interviews with Redford and Newman, as well as Eileen Brennan who plays a woman working for the Newman character, sort of a madame-type role.<br /> These kinds of flims are not made anymore in Hollywood. What makes the film is the amazing script.<br /> Julia Phillips, who was one of the producers of the film, and who would go on to be the first woman to ever receive an Oscar for Best Picture, has written a fabulous book called \\"You'll Never Eat Lunch In This Town Again\\", about her experiences in Hollywood. The book features some great anecodotes on \\"The Sting\\".
B00005CDNJ|5.0|To all of you who love ABBA and all great music from the 70's and 80's, this CD does not disappoint.  ABBA is so much more than just the songs you most associate readily with the group, and this collection just goes to prove that.  I LOVED this CD, and was so glad to be able to add it to my collection again - in fact, I still have the original album!  So please, if you are a fan of all great music and ABBA is certainly that - buy this CD - you won't regret it.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Directed by John Ford and adapted from the famous novel by John Steinbeck, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a gloomy masterpiece that challenges many of the assumptions we have about capitalism. Indeed, had Franklin Delano Roosevelt not come to power, social revolution would have been a very real possibility during the 1920's.<br /><br />The reason this film is not as celebrated as, say, \\"Citizen Kane\\" or other of the AFI films is because it exposes poverty in America for what it is: as bad as anywhere else.  We see the Joad family, a family that could be ours' very easily with a few alterations in time and space, suffering unimaginably.<br /><br />Tom Joad, played flawlessly by Henry Fonda in a sort of Zen simplicity of growing realization, is the youngest man in the Joad clan.  Having served 4 years for murder (justified homicide), he returns to the home in California which no longer exists.  The suffering of his parents and two younger siblings is so grievous that he no longer thinks about drinking, dancing so much--his mind is on something much bigger.  The powers that be.<br /><br />Every frame of this film is smothered with misery, heat, and oppression.  Perhaps now more than ever we should understand Joad's character and remember his words at the end of the movie to his saintly mother: \\"I'll be all around in the dark - I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build - I'll be there, too.\\"
B0012IWHDW|4.0|Lovely collection of low key chilled out tracks, but in need of remastering treatment in places, notably the the first track on which the rhythm acoustic guitar distorts quite frequently. I guess to some the low-fi approach to recording is part of the magic of this bunch of tunes, as for instance when Dylan's coat buttons rattle on his guitar, again on the first track. But loose as the playing is, I'd like to see the sound touched up in places.
6304712936|4.0|Always a lover of created stories of real people. The Characters were over the top. Mozart's fear of his father was carried off so well and the snobbery of the court musicians was fabulous. The characters are a true study in acting so the movie is worth watching for the tremendous variety of character studies by their actor/ess.

0061438294|4.0|A great book on body language, field-tested, and full of citations to accepted research.  Navarro has created an excellent resource, with each principle readily applied in real-world situations, often with personal stories accompanying the section where Navarro used nonverbal cues and caught somebody who was later convicted.    The only criticism I've seen so far on here is that what he says is obvious. It does all look obvious in hindsight, but the value the book has is that it codifies what's probably at the periphery of your mind, laying it in front of you.  Navarro states that most people do respond to body language, even if they can't put their finger on what makes them feel a certain way.    My only criticism is there's a good amount of redundancy in how he writes.  He'll usually state the same thing multiple times in the same paragraph.    The book was overall great and I'm quickly finding ways to apply my newfound knowledge, e.g. use a less intimidating stance when I'm working one-on-one with my students.  Also, if you want to see the ideas in the book illustrated beautifully, watch a 2 girls 1 cup reaction video.  Eye-blocking physical distancing behavior, every time!
B001LMU182|4.0|Visually and audibly this is the best Akira you can get.  However presentation wise the special edition DVD release that came out a while back blows it away, as it has a barren menu with little extras and a boring static splash page.  The movie deserves five stars but I wacked one off for presentation.

B0009A21R6|5.0|If you can get past Mark Knopler's vocals (sorry), this is a SACD to die for! Spacious sound stage, incredible depth, crystal clean from bottom to top, and Sting's vocals on \\"Money For Nothing\\" is just the icing on the cake! First rate production on every level. There is just ONE rock SACD that surpasses this as a system showoff, and that is Steely Dan's \\"Gaucho\\". (that is until they finally release \\"Aja\\" in SACD. What's up with that?)

0375714839|5.0|Book Review<br /> The Complete Persepolis, written by Marjane Satrapi, tells the story about her life growing up during a time of revolutionary war in Iran. The book is written in the format of a comic book. I really enjoy that it was written in a comic strip style because it is appealing to the reader's eye which makes it fun to read. I also liked how the author included everything from her life. The war was the main thing that affected her life but she also talked about her family and love life.<br /> Due to the war, Marjane's parents sent her to live in Austria. She attended a French school there, and like most people, she had a hard time fitting in at first but eventually did. She was also rebellious and strong, and I look up to that because no matter how bad things were she always tried to move forward. The author explains her life as a child very well and it is good to learn about different people from all over the world. She had to live without her parents for years, and this was very hard for her. One thing I thought was sad about her living on her own was that she sometimes wanted comfort from her parents and that was not possible since they were still in Iran. You can sympathize for her because it is always nice to be around your family.<br /> Later on in the book, when Marjane is older, she returns to Iran. When she returned, she had forgotten some of her cultural norms. She forgot that she would have to wear her veil, but she easily got back into the habit of doing so. Something I thought was interesting was that Marjane seemed to be very religious as a kid and even wanted to be a martyr, but while she was in Europe she broke a lot of her religion's rules. She had sex before marriage, and when she told her friends from Iran about this, they were ashamed of her. You learn about the cultural norms and religious beliefs about different places, and it helps you to realize what life is like for these people.<br /> Also when she returned she met a guy named Reza who she fell in love with. It was hard for them to be together because they could easily get in trouble because men and women were not allowed to be seen in the streets or cars together unless they were married. Since they were not married it made things hard for them. During this time they both went to the same school. At the time it was very hard to get into schools so they were very lucky. Boys and girls were separated and Reza and Marjane had to pretend they were not a couple because they could get kicked out. The author described this part of her life very well and detailed that you can almost put yourself in her shoes.<br /> Since things were hard for them being in a relationship, Reza asked Marjane to marry him. She ended up marrying him, but since the day they got married and moved in with each other, their love for one another faded. Marjane told Reza that she didn't think things were working out and they should get a divorce. He said that he still loved her and that they should move to France together. Instead they got the divorce and Marjane decided to leave Iran. This time when she left Iran it was her decision and for her freedom. This taught me that people in other countries do have similarities to people in the United States.<br /> Overall I would recommend this book to people of all ages. It was fun to read and the author makes it easy to understand a different culture and religion. I think Marjane, the main character, is a complex character and reading this book really makes you understand how the war forced her to grow up fast.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|The online and TV trailers for this movie promised a gun-toting, kick-ass action flick with some skin of Angelina Jolie.  And the movie delivers.  The premise of the movie is simple; there is an organization of assassins called \\"The Fraternity\\".  Induction is by personal selection and the ensuing grueling training process.  Somewhere along the way, the leader of this Fraternity, played by Morgan Freeman, gives into greed and uses the talents of his organization to kill for hire.  One of his subordinates, named Cross, leaves the group and begins fighting back.  The Fraternity in turn finds Cross's son, tells him that Cross actually killed his father, and trains him to kill Cross.      The movie is pure action, with lots of shooting, running, car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of other objects as weapons.  And yes, there is a brief shot of Jolie in the buff, though her tattoos are way too distracting.  Overall, a rated R movie fit for the older teenage audience.
0061537934|5.0|This was the most heartwarming book about the relationship between people and their dogs I have read in a long while.  Enzo's story touched my heart deeply as he tells his life story with his human.  You always hope that you touch your dog's life as much as they touch yours, and that they are as happy as they make you.  That's what you want to know as their life comes to an end, that you gave them the unconditional love you received.  A must read for every dog lover, especially if you have loved and lost a dear friend.  The ending of this story caused tears in my eyes, not because it was sad, but because it was PERFECT.    Betty
B000MV90IU|1.0|This review is to address the blu-ray quality of this movie.<br /><br />It is awful. Grainy, flat, milky.  If you want this movie, buy it on DVD, not on blu-ray.  Paying extra for blu-ray is a waste of money in this case.<br /><br />As everyone knows, old movies just don't transfer well to blu-ray....but this one transferred worse than most.
B001HN69AE|5.0|I don't know what the big deal is. I saw the movie and I didn't think  it was bad at all. And you know what? I HOPE there will be a sequel.  Because I LOVE Vegeta! And I think that it actually had the potential to be a good movie if people weren't ragging on it before they even saw it! I mean look at the Death Note and Sailor Moon live actions. They were WAAAAAAAY worse than this movie! So I think it deserves a LOT more credit than it's being gived. LOL Obviously it doesn't follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate. Call me crazy or stupid all you want. But as a die-hard DB and DBZ fan I went, I saw and I am buying the DVD. ^O^
B001YAG5DQ|4.0|Beautiful piercing yet soft voice. mystifying, haunting, and addicting all at the same time. If anything, download \\"Glass\\" \\"Sleep Alone\\" and \\"Daniel\\". those are the take home cuts, but the whole album is a keeper.

B001PR0Y4Y|5.0|James (Jesse Eisenberg) is a smart, sensitive kid just out of college. He needs to save money for grad school and finds himself working at a tawdry amusement park called Adventureland. His job is mindless and boring. But he soon ends up falling for his rebellious and angsty co-worker Em       (Kristen Stewart). Em is still in mourning over the loss of her mother to cancer, a situation made worse by her selfish and superficial step-mother. James and Em begin to develop a close bond. But Em is unwilling to committ and James is afraid of rejection. So they struggle to find their way while dealing with the trials and tribulations of youth.    I've got to say I love, love, love this movie. I also grew up in the 80's and can relate on a very profound level to the awkward and confusing situations James has to deal with. I liked writer/director James Mottola's earlier work, \\"Superbad\\". But this is a very different and perhaps even better movie. It has a sweeter, more heartfelt tone, with humor that is more subtle but still had me laughing out loud. The acting by Jesse Eisneberg and Kristen Stewart is top notch. It also has a great soundtrack featuring bands like Husker Du and the Replacements. It has an eye for detail and nuance in it's portrait of coming of age in the 80's. But also has a timeless quality that people of all generations should be able to appreciate. This is my favorite film of 2009 so far. Don't miss it!
015206396X|5.0|I picked up this book after reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" and was immediately taken with the characters. Po and Katsa and simply wonderful. But more than that, I was thrilled with Cashore's writing. Fluid, descriptive but suprisingly easy to read...her writing ability left nothing to be desired. An excellent book that has shot to the top of my list. Im excited and ready for more!! A must read!
1595141715|4.0|One day Clay Jensen receives a package. Inside are 14 audiotapes. When he plays them he is shocked to hear the voice of his high school crush, Hannah Baker, a young girl who took her life just a few weeks earlier. On the tapes Hannah tells the story of the 13 people who contributed to her decision to take her life, and Clay is one of them.<br /><br />Written in alternating voices, Hannah's on the tapes and Clays reactions to and memories of the events described, made for a compelling read, I barely stopped reading this book for 6 hours straight.  It is heartbreaking to see how sometimes seemingly small events can snowball in one person's mind, until she feels she has no choice.<br /><br />A must read for both children and parents, hopefully opening up some lines of communication.

B00003CXZ4|1.0|I seem to be one of few in my opinion of this movie which is that it's not a good movie. I felt the movie was boring and lacking of a good plot. I bought the movie believing it was a really good movie based on what I had heard but was really disapointed once I watched the movie. This movie in my opinion is very overrated.
B00004W510|5.0|UPDATED - okay the reviews are all mixed together for all the various versions of the Band.  If it is says Audio Fidelity and its $30 or so, this is the one you want!    Although this is one of the all-time greats, and this version is fine in every way, I know it is not the gold disc which came out a week or so ago, nor is it the limited edition Japan disc, as noted in the description.  No way are they selling that for this price!  Hopefully someone will read this and correct it.
B001HBEDKY|3.0|Interesting. When I first went to but this product there were about 1/2 a dozen reviews, mostly about the packaging.I guess Amazon must have taken them down because they all had unfavorable things to say about the packaging. Well it's true the packaging SUCKS. The record company should be flogged for putting out such a mess. But I had to have it and so do you.  We don't really need to talk about the music do we?   Supposedly, Kinda Blue is the best selling jazz album of all time.   So if you are buying this in vinyl it's because you believe that it's collectible and you want all of the optional extras.   Well the CD's will be damaged because they aren't in sleeves and probably fell out during shipping. Because of this I recommend you buy it in a brick and mortar store or be prepared for the hassle of returning it multiple times.  The music? What can I say that hasn't been said before?  Buy at your own risk.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|I was really disappoined with this movie.  The Zombies/Vampires or whatever they look sooooo fake.  Like someone else said they look like video game bad guys. I really hope someone lost there job for that POS.  Other then that I thought Will Smith did a great job playing our great hero but I also think the ending was lacking
B001EO748M|5.0|I have always had an affinity for this particular era in English history. I was certainly not disappointed in the series.

It sparked great conversations between my husband and me.      Kohn lays out his arguments so well, and everything in the book is thoroughly backed up with research.  It is funny, poignant, and clear.  A must read for sure!    If this book were required reading in High School, many of our families would be much happier and healthier.
0810970686|5.0|My eleven-year-old son is not one to sit around and read a book, but with Diary of a Wimpy Kid, he read straight through with hardly a break. He engulfed the entire series in little over a week and laughed the whole way through. I only wish there were more books of this nature. Thank you, Jeff Kinney, for a book great for preadolescent boys.
0786852550|3.0|Brief paragraph summarizing the plot: 12 year old magician's apprentice treated badly ala Harry Potter summons ancient genie (who is less witty & clever like the blue genie from Aladdin and more often pompous, arrgoant and tiresome) to avenge himself from some of the most obnoxious characters I've yet seen in any book (Ms. Umbridge would look like a fairy godmother!) namely his master and Mr. Lovelace.<br /><br />Fair enough but the author never put any effort into making Nathaniel likable. In fact even Nathaniel came off as arrogant, pompous and hateful. At least Bartimaeus has an excuse, he's a Jinni but literally every singly character besides the art teacher and Mrs. underwood were just vile. And what was the point of the IRRITATING street children besides being a foreshadowing for the next two books which will presumably be about the resistance? I wanted to punch that snotty little bell bottomed girl in the face.<br /><br />Fans of Harry Potter and Aladdin will be greatly disappointed unless they lower their expectations. Also, the 'true name' ripoff from LeGuin's Earthsea series was duly noted.<br /><br />Also PICK A TENSE AND STICK WITH IT!!!! or at least have the decency to not flip back and forth between tenses within one paragraph! Where is the editor?<br /><br />* note - 5/24/09 - I have read book 2 & just finished book 3. Just came here to let the reader know that the books DO get better and there is some character growth for Nate. I have grown very fond of Bartimaeus especially.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you're already a fan of SG-1. I got caught up in the story, even though I'd seen some spoilers. And Ba'al is eye candy ....  I also enjoyed the extras. While the commentary, with Martin & Brad, and the bit on going to the Arctic are great, I most like the piece about time travel by an astrophysicist. Get this DVD!
B001DU8T6S|1.0|I know I'll take a lot of flack for this but I don't care. This album doesn't deserve one star.  As an absolute gotta have everything queen ever recorded fan, I'll probably get the next one that comes out, but I'll down load it for free, seeing how I beleive they owe me for spending good money for absolutely nothing on this album.  I think Brian And Roger could have done much better by themselves on his album and certainly could have found a better replacement for Freddie then Paul.    This is not 'more like' a Bad Company album, it IS a 'Bad Company album. Queen, or Brian or Roger's name should'nt appear anywhere on this album but inside the cover under 'special thanks to'.  Not that I dislike Bad Company, they were just 'So So' for me, but  If you like Paul Rogers or Bad Company then you'll probably like this album, but don't expect anything even remotely close to queen, except Roger Taylors track near the end. The song 'We beleive', probably the best song on the album is the only song where you get any queenlike harmonies, and there was another song where you get some Brian like guitars ( it would be to painfull for me to listen to it again to find out which song)  All the rest of the songs were obviously Paul Rodgers songs and sounded to me that there was no effort what so ever put into them.  Queen + Paul Rogers would be an appropriate title if Brian and Roger did all the composing, producing, and lead vocals, where as Paul Rogers role were to simply play his guitar and maybe add some background vocals on the chorus, much like John Deacon (except John Deacon at least could compose).    I was never a big fan of Roger Taylor's songs in earlier queen albums when Freddie was alive, but he did add a certain flavor to the albums, but his song in this album is actually the highlight here. Not that it shines above his other work, its just that everything else on this album is horrible except: We Believe and Call Me,  and mabey 3 or 4 more that have a breif flash of something worth while in them.    One thing I don't get is Queen members have appeared on other artists songs before, Billy Squire, Mott the Hoople, Eddie Howell, to name a few, but you don't see 'Queen' appearing on the cover of those artists albums and this one is no different.    I've listened to this album 3 or 4 times to give it a chance, but it doesn't get any better.  Heres how I rate the songs:  1- Cosmos Rockin  D+ (somewhat of a catchy rythem)  2- Time to shine F (Mellow song with random notes, can't stand Paul wavering all over the place on certain notes like \\"shine\\"    3-Still Burnin D+ (F song but has a cool \\"we will rock you\\" bridge in it)  4- Small F (seems to be the most popular for reveiwers, but I don't care for it at all)    5-War Boys F---- (absolutly horible in every way)  6- We Beleive  B+ ('A' from about midway through till the end, but slow until that point- only song with decent queenlike harmonies)    7- Call Me  C+ ( Great intro, catchy chorus- Reminds me of the band 'Sweet'(they also did a song called 'Call Me')    8- Voodoo  F  (nothing good here, no melody just whining to randomized notes, for fans of the 'Blue's' type of music    9- Some things that glitter D- (Paul Rogers ballad, tollerable at best)    10- C- lebrity  D  (this song has some breif glimpses of Roger and Brian in the chorus) (the versus suck, chorus is decent)    11- Through the night D ( This song could be alright if it wasn't for all the wavering Paul does.  Freddie and Steivie wonder are the only 2 singers that can get away with wavering in my oppinion, and Freddie didn't do it to accessively)    12 Say Its not true  C+ ( refreshing to here something actually related to Queen. This song actually has a chance to grow on me. A nice prety song by Roger)    13- Surf's up.. Scools out D (I could actually like this song if it wasn't for the annoying screeming 'YEAAAAAH' throughout.)    14- Small Reprise  C+  (actually a nice way to end the album, to bad it wasn't much of an album to end it on.)    One final note, I can understand Brian May's wanting to get someone who sounds different then Freddie out of respect for Freddie, but by using Queen in the labeling just plain craps all over that respect theory. Thats more disrespectful then trying to replace Freddie
1416914307|3.0|If you have read the first two books in this trilogy, of course you ran to the store to pick up this final book. This particular book was the weakest of the three, but it is a must read because we all want to know about Clary and Jace and whether they are truly siblings.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that Clary became a little childish and annoying here. However other charcters grew and became stronger- Simon, Isabelle. I enjoyed the fact the Valentine had some shades of gray. The finale was great. I am a sucker for HEA.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars? I guess my expectations were so high this book could not meet them. Also the character of Clary really got on my nerves at points. First she will do anything for her Mom, and then when she sees her Mom again, she turns on her and sulks! Jace was dreamy as usual. The world building was innovative and fresh. I will definitely be buying the next book by this author. I hope she starts writing in the adult Fantasy genre as well.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites of the remakes of this great story = I still like the Judy Garland version but like the updated version of this one with Kris Christofferson - loved the music and the whole film - it is a \\"keeper\\" in my collection of films - and will be a good gift selection in the future for friends who see this one and want their own. - Appreciate the fast service -   Thanks
0375757856|4.0|A cursed diamond plundered from India and known as the Moonstone becomes a birthday gift of a lovely young heiress.  On the very night she receives it, it is stolen in a crime that is baffling to all and whose investigation is stymied by the very woman who should be most interested in getting the diamond back.  Characters include two cousin-suitors of the heiress, her indomitable mother, a lovesick serving girl with a humpback, the Robinson Crusoe-obsessed house steward, an unflappable private investigator, an outcast, drug-addicted, and misunderstood physician, a band of \\"Hindoo\\" jugglers/thieves/brigands intent on retrieving the diamond, and a spinster cousin who comments mean-spiritedly on the action from her holier-than-thou, let-me-save-your-soul perspective.  The narrative is told in the first person alternately by the different characters as they are closest to the action and best able to offer insight on events.      This novel is famous for its narrative style, its featuring of a private investigator, and its surprise ending.  I really enjoyed the narratives by Miss Clack and Mr. Betteredge, both of whom are hilarious.  Other narratives were less enticing.  As with other Collins novels, the love interests themselves were pretty dull.  Cuff, the investigator, reminds me of a C. Auguste Dupin-Sherlock Holmes sort.  However, this private detective gets it wrong for the most part.  His love of roses struck me as silly.  The surprise ending was also dissatisfying.  It was implausible to say the least, but it was still enjoyable to see the plot tie up.  The final outcome of the Moonstone seemed right.    This novel is a classic of detective fiction and certainly worth the read.  An oldie but goodie.

This concert flat out makes you want to dance around the house, screaming  \\"Bruce\\". The band was dead on, the expressions on everybody's faces were sheer enjoyment...it just makes you happy to watch. If you're a die hard  fan, you won't want to miss this, and if you are a \\"newbie\\", then this  is a great introduction.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|I am beginning to think Paul Haggis is one of the most over-rated men in Hollywood. There's the hideously hyped message movie [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash]]. There's [[ASIN:B00005JNP1 Million Dollar Baby]], a sloppy tear-jerker that would have been nothing except Clint Eastwood made it worthwhile and elevated Hillary Swank's performance. And now he's managed to make James Bond a floppy limp hack with \\"Quantum of Solace.\\"<br /><br />Do recall the shivering thrill you got watching Daniel Craig in [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale?]] You won't get that here. Craig, as Bond, is a steely blank of an MI6 agent, forced to wander around the film with a purpose that is left murky. Is he out to avenge Vesper from the last movie? Is he out to find the Eco-Gangster Dominic Greene (played with all the villainy of a stuffed chicken)? Or is he a neutered ex-he-man forced to slither around waffling nationals who bend their morals whatever way the wind blows?<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's what you, the viewer, is left to fuddle with. \\"Quantum Of Solace\\" is a juggling act of bland, with even a crappy theme to alert you that you're in for something other than the usual mach 8 thrill ride. Q and his Bond gadgets, is absent. There's not even a decent Bond Girl. This is little more than a run-of-the-mill spy flick, barely average when \\"Casino\\" was flawless. Bring back Action Director Martin Campbell and leave the \\"message\\" muddling at home.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|The Harnoncourt-Leonhardt series of Bach Cantata recordings are a landmark in themselves; they also point the way toward current performance practice on \\"original\\" instruments, with choral forces approximating those used by Bach;for their historic signifigance and for the joy of hearing performers fully involved in what they are doing, I highly recommend this set (treat yourself;\\"nuts\\" to the cost!).
159448385X|4.0|I read Kite Runner because my friend had it, and suggested I read it to see whether I liked the author's writing style. Of course, I did and bought this book. Fiction is not what I usually read, but I wanted to know more about Afghanistan, and what better way than books written by one from that country? Some circumstances in this story are such that one does not usually find. A Thousand Splendid Suns is well written. It held my attention. The ending, although a bit lengthy, was better done than the ending for The Kite Runner, though both are good books.     I can think of nothing more except compliments to the writer, Hosseini.  Yes, I would definitely recommend this book. It is an intriging story about the country,the affects of the wars to the land and the people, and especially the pitiful plights of at least some of the women.
B001KBZ6CU|5.0|What an inventive product - a \\"journal\\" exploring the many adventures of Indiana Jones ranging from childhood (\\"Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\") through the movies (ending with the recent \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\").    The journal was written by Indiana himself, containing many pictures, drawings, and notes on his exploits.  (It is reminiscent of Henry Sr.'s Grail Diary in \\"The Last Crusade.)  It goes chronologically through the series and was apparently \\"found\\" by the Russians.  They provide many annotations, linking and explaining the details of certain entries, pictures, characters, and notes.    This is a GREAT companion piece to the films.  It is a little pricey for its contents, so I recommend looking around for cheaper price tags before purchasing it.  If you can't find it cheaper, GET IT ANYWAY!    I actually found my copy on Amazon.  It came at the sales price of $5 because it contained a publisher's mark - which was only a black marker line above the pages on the top of the book.  A minor detail, because the book was still new and was $20 off the original price of $25.    If you want to collect essential Indiana Jones memorabilia, then this is a must.  If you are a passing fan, then it is still recommended because it has countless details for the average fan.

0765348276|4.0|Scalzi definitely has an intriguing style of writing.  He doesn't mince words and dilly dally around with filler.  He gets to the point without sacrificing the story.  Old Man's War is a great concept, part new and part old.    Scalzi takes concepts that are fairly routine and fleshed out.  The drill sergeant, the tough soldiers, the unstoppable hero.  All are ideas that are fairly fleshed out and were certainly used generously throughout.  Despite some common themes Scalzi seems to be able to take them and tweak them just enough to make them all his own.  His style of writing adds character and flare and makes his story unique and carry a life all its own.    Just when you think that the story is touching upon a clichéd science fiction literary tool Scalzi turns everything on its head as the character does something unpredictable.  Couple this with his fluid writing and you have a winner of an author and a new series.  I would recommend both the author and the series.    4.5 stars.

B001H5X7I4|2.0|First of all, why would Ben Stiller be the star?  His character was not funny.  Jack Black had a few moments, but not many.  Robert Downey Junior was the best character of the movie.  I have never seen anyone play a black man like him!  My husband and I are also black and we thought that he stole the show.  Even when he just said an average line it was funny because he made it so real.  I can actually imagine a real person being like his character.  We are also a military family and you would be surprised at how many people can take it all to another level.  I have to admit that I didn't look to see who was in the movie first (my husband bought it), so I didn't even know that he was in it at first.  It actually took me a little while before I realized that it was him!  He did an excellent job!  I didn't think that the movie was that funny, but he saved it.  Without him I probably would not have watched all of it.

B001RQ0SJO|4.0|Wow.  I saw a review for this album in Time Out New York and I'm glad I paid attention.  I'm a big fan of Tori Amos, especially her earlier work.  I'm also a big Bjork and Kate Bush fan so hearing Bat For Lashes' second album with a combination of all of these artists' elements was definitely a wonderful surprise.  The music has electronic moments (not dance) with great drum rhytms, at times reminiscent of some of Bjork's masterpieces.  But, with the ethereal voice here in this album, Bjork's sometimes annoying vocals are gratefully missing.  You're swept away on the slower songs and taken to a happy place.  After a few listens I'm gearing up for the upcoming concert here in NYC.  Both shows are sold out but eBay will come through and save the day.  I won'tbe missing out.  Great album! So lucky to have found it.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Skylark is a wonderful interpretation of songs from an era gone by. Delicate vocals, strong instrumentals, blend together, offering both passive and uplifting listening. Coming from a CD player, or uploaded to an iPod Renee Olstead is a subtle entertainment for any occasion. I remember when this young vocalist sang one time on her sitcom Still Standing; the storyline did not offer any additional opportunity at that time, but was sort of dismissed. It's great that she was discovered, now has three albums out and in addition has performed with two of America's premier entertainers: David Foster and Chris Botti at their concerts.

0312427999|5.0|This book made me think of a dvd I recently watched: The Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtis.  It's appropriate that Milton Friedman is the great guru of the Neoconservatives/Neoliberals, because he clearly demonstrates the same obsessive fixation as the Neocon (as well as the  Islamic) nutcases The Power of Nightmares focuses on: a total and totally irrational preoccupation with the absolute perfection of a system of thought - in Friedman's case an economic system.  This obsession with purity and perfection appears to be the hallmark of madness.  It's quite obvious to me, reading Naomi Klein's book, that Dr. Friedman was, first and foremost, a toady for the world's moneyed interests - which no doubt explains their virtual adoration of him.  What's not quite as obvious is that he was so entirely obsessed with perfecting an imperfect system in an inherently imperfect world as to come very close to a working definition of insanity.  Has anything but chaos and suffering ever proceeded from anyone's attempt to create a perfect world?  Country after country that applied his prescription to its economy ended up far worse than before - yet each of these ventures was touted as an \\"Economic Miracle.\\"  Of course it was miraculous for the venture capitalists who made a killing appropriating each country's entire social/political/economic apparatus; and since it was basically venture capitalists who had the means of reporting on and labeling the various ventures, it was a foregone conclusion that they would be touted as miracles.  But perhaps the greatest irony of Dr. Friedman's system is that he and his adherents constantly referred to it as \\"scientific\\" - yet even true scientists still debate what exactly \\"scientific\\" entails.  One thing virtually all scientists do agree on though: true science doesn't proceed from the butt of gun - which was, is, and will always be the one and only way Dr. Friedman's \\"perfect\\" economic system can be created. Friedmanites are perhaps best described as having been blinded by the reflected light of their own obsessions.

0930289234|2.0|\\"I engineered a monster, cloned its brain from a human psychic, sent it to New York and killed half the city.\\" This is how the arch-villain explains his master plan to the heroes near the end of Watchmen. I was so embarrassed for the author, and for myself.<br /><br />\\"This is the book that changed an industry and challenged a medium. If you've never read a graphic novel, start with Watchmen,\\" boasts the back cover of the book, along with declarations that Watchmen is a \\"brilliant piece of fiction,\\" \\"a masterwork representing the apex of artistry,\\" and even \\"the greatest piece of popular fiction ever produced.\\" Wow. Time Magazine rated Watchmen as one of the top 100 English-language novels since 1923.<br /><br />These people all need to grow up and start reading real books. Watchmen is a joke.<br /><br />Watchmen isn't my first graphic novel, either. I was an avid comic reader and collector as a kid... Then I grew up. But I returned to comics now and then through high school, college, and even my early post-college twenties. I respect the medium and was fully prepared to like Watchmen. But it just sucks. It's stupid, childish, totally outdated, and takes itself far too seriously. It is a comic book trying way too hard to be literature, and failing miserably.<br /><br />There is one statement of truth on the back cover of the book: \\"The would-be heroes of Watchmen have staggeringly complex psychological profiles.\\" This is the one saving grace of this otherwise completely unworthy effort. The problem is that author Alan Moore (whose other credits include V for Vendetta) chose to examine these \\"staggeringly complex\\" psyches through a hokey superhero prism. There are tons of comic-book in-jokes and what I think are actually veiled statements about adults who read super-hero comic books -- which is sort of funny, I guess. But just when I would get back into the book, I'd be rudely reminded that I'm a adult man -- a father -- reading a comic book, and it would jar me out of my enjoyment of the characters.<br /><br />Now some other problems: I read through Chapter 1 fully enjoying the book, and then I got to the bonus material at the end of the chapter. In this case, it was excerpts from the \\"tell-all\\" book one of the characters wrote. How completely boring, pointless, and lame! The amateurish prose shows why Alan Moore should stick to comics and why this most certainly is NOT one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923! Three or four chapters in, I stopped reading this bonus material -- which cut my reading time practically in half -- and just roughly skimmed it, never finding anything of interest or value when I did. Similarly, there's a kid reading a comic within the comic -- a pirate story -- throughout the first eleven chapters of Watchmen. Sometimes this goes on and on for entire pages, interspersed with dialog taking place in the main story. This got confusing and, again, pointless, so I stopped reading it, too.<br /><br />Now let me get to the heart of the matter; the ridiculous plot. Some mild spoilers may be contained herein, but I'll try to be good: This was written in 1985 and takes place in an alternate 1985 -- wherein Richard Nixon has been re-elected time and time again (constitutional amendment and everything) and the U.S. is still at the verge of war with the USSR. Only, in this alternate 1985, the U.S. won the war in Vietnam -- with the help of \\"Jon,\\" a god-like super being. The idea presented here is that Jon is the only thing stopping the U.S. and USSR from initiating World War III, and indeed, when Jon decides to vacate Earth for Mars, tensions mount and the nations begin preparing for war...<br /><br />Do you see the problem here?<br /><br />In real life, there was no Jon. How can taking Jon away make war inevitable when there was no Jon in real life? Maybe I'm missing something? And secondly, Jon can see the future, and yet the authors lacked the prescience to see that Communism was doomed to fail... The USSR wasextinct within five years of this book's publication, and thus nuclear war was not statistically inevitable -- anyone who'd ever read Mises's [[ASIN:0913966630 SOCIALISM]] would have known this. As one final, lame joke, Robert Redford is supposed to be running for president in 1988 -- \\"but nobody would want a cowboy-actor for president\\" -- hardy har har.<br /><br />Finally, I'll take a swipe at the art. Have you ever seen a CrossGen comic? If so, you'll realize there's nothing special about the art in Watchmen. Very mediocre.<br /><br />In summation, I guess I'm glad I read this \\"top 100 novel,\\" just so I can say, definitively, that it's not. But unless you have a similar goal, or you're just a comic-book nerd, reading Watchmen will be a waste of your time. Read a real book.extinct within five years of this book's publication, and thus nuclear war was not statistically inevitable -- anyone who'd ever read Mises's [[ASIN:0913966630 SOCIALISM]] would have known this.

B001TWT0A4|5.0|I fell in love with this film the first time I saw it in the movies.  From the marvelous theme song (sung by George Alexander and the Mello Men) to the conclusion of Wayne and Mitchum hobbling down the street on crutches, it is marvelously entertaining from start to finish.  Basically Hawks remaking his classic \\"Rio Bravo\\" and while not as great as that film, it is fun nonetheless.  Wayne and Mitchum as predictably great.  Arthur Hunnicutt is terrific as deputy Bull Harris, his wonderful laconic delivery of every line makes it memorable.  Like the fantastic Walter Brennan as Stumpy the deputy in \\"Rio Bravo\\" (Brennan should have won a best supporting actor oscar for that film,) Hunnicutt is great as well.  A very young James Caan is also fun as \\"Misissippi,\\" a slightly different version of the Ricky Nelson \\"Colorado\\" in \\"Bravo\\"  (Colorado was a fast gun, Mississippi cannot shoot at all.)  Good support from Michele Carey, Charlene Holt and Christopher George.  A nice soundtrack from once of Sinatra's favorite arrangers and conductor, Nelson Riddle.  This film is one of my favorite Wayne westerns, like Rio Bravo I never tire of it.  One of my favorite Howard Hawks films as well.  I bought it years ago on DVD.  Now that Paramount is finally releasing a deluxe edition, I will probably be buying it again.  I'm only sorry that are not releasing it on blu-ray.  If anyone knows whether a blu-ray release is coming soon, I'd like to hear about it.

B001DHXT6G|1.0|Whoever thought of this at CBS Video should be ashamed.        I love Star Trek.  I have watched every episode multiple times.  I recently began to watch the series with my kids and they love it too.  We rented episodes of the 2004 series on DVD.  These were great--5 stars. The original episodes, in their original format, with the original songs, the original visuals of the ship, everything.  Totally Awesome!      We were renting so much I decided to take the plunge and buy the series.  The 2004 wasn't available easily (you can find it on E-bay and used from Amazon), so I got the 2007 series.  I figured \\"remastered\\" meant better picture.  I could not be more disappointed.  Where to start....     Let's start with the simple--There are *NO* labels on the DVDs.      1.  Each DVD has no label on it whatsoever (unless you count the illegible 2 point font ring around the center).  Unlike the 2004 release (which had both the title of each episode and cool pictures on each DVD) these DVDs have nothing.  So, you are confronted with the problem of what episode on which disk.  Should I label them with a sharpie, etc... Better not because ...      Season 1 has the defunct HD DVD on one side (the one that plays when the tiny font ring is facing up) and regular DVD on the other.  The rest of the DVDs have the normal format on the side that plays when the font ring is facing up.  Confused?  Read on!     The DVD's are packaged in a clear hinged case that is like a stack.  You cannot tell which DVD is which, which episode is on which DVD.  You cannot separate the individual cases from the stack.  This is such exceedingly bad design (especially given that they did such a nice job in 2004) it is maddening.      There is no apparent way to label the DVDs either.  There is a set of translucent plastic \\"playing cards\\" at the back of each of the three stacks corresponding to each season.   These don't fit in the DVD case and you have to pull them out  each time to see what episode is on what DVD.  Arg!!    Now for the Heresy--these episodes have all been ALTERED!    2.  ***ALL*** scenes of the Enterprise (and other ships/stations and planets) have been removed and replaced with digitized versions of the ship, a la \\"Star Trek TNG\\". (the sole exception is the 2 second clip of the ship that appears in the trailer of each episode).  This is supposed to be a \\"feature,\\" and I suppose it is for folks who never actually saw the original series.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  They have removed every single shot of the ship and replaced it with digitized versions.      Gone are the cool hokey wobbly ship scenes from \\"The Galileo Seven,\\" and the paper mache cone from \\"The Doomsday Machine\\".  Replaced with digitized stuff.      It frankly beggars the imagination to understand folks who rejoice in this set!  Really, the original show was great, no need to redo it.  Even if one likes the new digitized ships, the poor packaging and lack of labels on the DVDs would limit this to at the most 3 stars.      Oh yes, the intro classic Star Trek theme has been redone.  Suppose that is the coup de gras to all the mangling.      Finally, they seem to have removed the English subtitles in this version (a real pain for watching via a DVD player on the plane or when you need to keep the sound down).  Yes, the 2004 version had very nice English subtitles.  There is closed captioning in the 2007 release, but that feature doesn't work on most DVD players, just TV sets.      My personal theory is that all the 5* reviews are execs or shills of CBS Video, its affiliates, or folks interested in pushing the release of the new JJ Abrams Star Trek movie.  Otherwise, it is baffling.      Summary--go thou and find the 2004 release, it is really cool and your kids will appreciate you for it.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|this movie is all hype, the story is token and predictable.  one of the main focuses is \\"who wants to be a millionaire\\", do you know how much scrutiny an american film would garner if it were based on \\"who wants to be a millionaire\\"?  a lot.  i know it wouldn't have won best picture.  the director, Danny Boyle, shows his affection for iPod, Target, and McDonalds commercials.  as bad as the story is, the directing is what really kills this film.  i was also annoyed by some scenes, notice i said annoyed and not grossed out or horrified, i'm not a prude and i appreciate gore and gross out humor but like i said, some scenes were just totally annoying.  off the top of my head i can think of the porta jon scene, you know the one.  i immediately disliked all characters after this scene, all i could think was \\"what a dumb *ss\\".    i've read a lot of reviews that say \\"best movie i've seen all year\\" or \\"worst movie ever\\", it's neither, it's near the middle sitting in mediocrity.  when someone asks you if slumdog millionaire is any good, your response should be \\"meh\\" followed by a shoulder shrug.

B001TOD92C|5.0|in fact, I hate wrestling.  I used to watch WWF in the early to late nineties because my brother was pretty obsessed with it, but even then it was laughable.  Of course I grew up with Hulk Hogan, Rowdy Roddy, Jake The Snake... but those were much different days than what kids watch now.  Anyways, this movie showed me a whole different side to wrestling, I really enjoyed seeing how it was like a club.  The backstage, er, locker room shots showing the wrestlers coming up with moves and joking around was really neat.  The Wrestler came off so real that it almost seemed like a documentary, and the acting performances were definitely award worthy.  Most movies don't move me, especially newer releases, but I really felt sympathy for The Ram, he just can't help screwing it up... I know a few people like that.  I don't think everyone that watches this will get it, but give it a chance, you might sympathize with the bumbling hero.
B001BGTWXI|2.0|for all those here. first off i know metal. and this isn't a metal. album. what it is a waste of money. i have this cd. i tried to like it. i did. but it just plain stinks. and the one dude that says theres songs that sound different yeah right. just a bunch of yelling. and screaming like any other band.nothing really memoriable or fun here.
B001N26GFM|4.0|I recently watched THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS.  I had read some good things about it and both my wife and I wanted to see it.  I knew it was about the relationship between a young German boy and that of boy inside a concentration camp.  It was interesting to watch this English film, and I thought the acting, music, editing and direction was terrific.  The two boys give outstanding performances and you would almost hope that there would be a happy ending, but as with the actual Holocaust it had a devastating ending that left my wife and I stunned. We never expected this film to end the way it did.  To me, this made the film all the more poignant.
1401207138|5.0|This was an excellent book when it was originally released as single issue comic books in the mid 80's. It seemed even greater once it was completed and compiled into a single graphic novel. Now we have what has to be the ultimate presentation of this iconic story... truly the ABSOLUTE edition.<br /><br />The recoloring and large format of the book make it a great showcase for Dave Gibbon's excellent art. The extras are also a great treat and make the book well worth the price.
0061537934|5.0|This book is enough to persuade even those who profess not to be dog lovers to soften their stance. Told from the viewpoint of Enzo, a lab/golden mix (if I recall correctly)the story is engrossing and captivating and caught hold of my heart within the first few pages.    At first, the idea of a story told in first person dog would put me off; however, my supervisor at work raved about it and I was impressed by sheer number of rave reviews on this site alone.  I was not disappointed. In fact, I'd wanted to savor this book throughout my entire one week vacation last year and found I had a hard time putting it down. I actually preferred reading it to sightseeing, as I felt as if it provided me a window into my own dog's thoughts. Anyone who has felt a closeness such as that between owner and beloved companion is all too well aware of the subtle nuances - gazes, nuzzles - that are shared in this amazing bond.  Enzo put into words those human feelings many of us believe our pets possess.    I was swept into the story of Enzo's owner, his involvement with the woman who ultimately became his wife, their child and extended family and friends.  I also enjoyed the aspect of the novel that involves car racing, a subject I'm not usually drawn to but the author had an engaging way of piquing my interest.     After reading this book, I lent it to dear friends whose 15 year old Cocker Spaniel was nearing the end of her life.  They read it in the weeks prior to her passing and said how much it helped them work past their grief; the book is truly that uplifting and inspiring.     Congratulations to the author for pulling off such a remarkable feat and giving voice to dogs everywhere.

1595141715|4.0|Thirteen people are included in Hannah's taped narrative of the events leading up to her suicide. The book is told from the perspective of one of the recipients of her message. However, Asher made an interesting choice in writing this book. Rather than writing the book from the perspective of one of the people who arguably drove Hannah to commit suicide, Asher puts the narrative in the hands of Clay, the one person who Hannah says bears no responsibility at all, but is just incidental to her story. But it makes for an interesting meditation on the repercussions of suicide, which typically focus on the guilt of those left behind. But Hannah herself makes it clear that Clay doesn't really have anything to feel guilty about. The depth of his feelings for her are what drive this book; unfortunately, although I did enjoy the book, this isn't quite enough to pull it off.

B000QFBW6K|5.0|I have seen over 24 live productions of \\"Der Ring\\" and this is certainly one that stands out over several lesser attempts to put the 15 plus hours of music on the stage.   However, as in every Ring, there are always several aspects that fail.     This is no exception !      Before purchasing this particular version, I would hold off for several months and hope that a BluRay production worthy of Wagner (and not the ONLY \\"Walkuere\\" currently available) in all aspects will be realized.     However, IF you must have a Ring this week, I do recommend this above the rest of the trash currently available and, for the most part, being offered on the stages of the world's opera houses.

B0001HAISG|4.0|This was certainly a nice surprise. What seems to be a light hearted fun movie for children certainly has a dark, undercurrent theme for adults as well. It's both uplifting and tragic at the same time. Peter Pan is certainly the main hero type thing, but unlike the Disney version (the only one I've seen previously), it certainly shows the character's \\"fall from grace\\" and shows the \\"Peter Pan syndrome\\" in not wanting to grow up. But at its heart it does well to depict that it's not \\"just a mere choice\\" as it often seems but does well to show that it goes beyond the surface exterior most people show. His unwilling to grow up is his safety net on preventing from getting hurt. The movie shows the hope for Peter to truly breach that skin, and the sadness when he doesn't but you still feel for him. He embodies that innocence many have forgotten and/or try to protect still. A recommended movie for families with young children to watch with as they grow and mature as they may pick up the themes along the way. I would give a perfect 5 star rating except (as difficult as it may be) there is room for perfection. As the movie begins it certainly has that \\"kids movie\\" feel which may put off some \\"maturer\\" viewers. Certain scenes appear as gimics which some people may not enjoy. In a sense it calls out to the child in us and asks us to use our imagination to fill in the gaps where the special effects don't quite make it. Not to be taken too seriously, it never the less leaves quite an impact (whether you like it or not).

0618918248|2.0|I give this book two stars for polemical flourish and clear writing style. Dawkins turns a nice phrase and his verbal barbs are sharp. But his reasoning is at times sloppy, which shouldn't be the case in a book that aims to persuade. Indeed, at the outset Dawkins writes that he hopes readers will be atheists by the time they put his book down. Now Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist, and when he talks about the mechanics of evolutionary biology he makes sense (although, as will be mentioned below, his philosophical premises for interpreting the scientific findings is fatally flawed). It's when Dawkins strays from his area of expertise and wanders into the neighborhood of theology and religion that he loses credibility. Dawkins, either through ignorance or pusillanimity, refuses to engage religious intellectual heavyweights in The God Delusion. Instead he \\"engages\\" religious straw men (or \\"straw persons\\" as Dawkins would prefer, as he explains in a rambling digression into the \\"consciousness raising\\" qualities of gender-neutral language).<br /><br />Dawkins argues that religion is irrational and intellectually stifling. And of course there are plenty of references to and quotes from Pat Robertson, fundamentalists, new earth creationists, and their ilk in support of Dawkins's conclusion that religion is an \\"infection\\" of the minds of the masses, from whose ranks \\"brights\\" like the elitist Dawkins have managed to wrest themselves. If your only exposure to the religious is an encounter with Dawkins's religion-infected simpletons and sociopaths, then you might conclude that religion is indeed a blight and agree with him that it's \\"child abuse\\" to indoctrinate children with it.  Suffice it to say, Dawkins handily makes these folks and their arguments look absurd; but that's like playing poker with children. But to suggest that the presence of putzes in the pews invalidates religion - specifically Christianity - is a fallacy. And to suggest that Dawkins's straw men (e.g., Paley, Anselm, etc.) represent all that Christianity has to offer in defense of God's existence is just plain disingenuous.<br /><br />I wish Dawkins had seriously taken on Christian luminaries like St Thomas Aquinas, who, using Aristotelian metaphysics (with its appreciation of final causes), proved that God necessarily exists and that belief in Him is thus imminently rational. Dawkins, alas, gives exceedingly short shrift to Aquinas in The God Delusion. In his new book The Last Superstition: A Rebuttal of the New Atheism, philosopher Edward Feser doesn't. He explains how Aristotelian metaphysical arguments - as developed by Scholastics like Aquinas - prove God's existence in a way that requires none of the irrational faith that Dawkins ascribes to his derisively coined \\"faith heads.\\" Feser goes on to eviscerate Dawkins's arguments with the precision of a surgeon and show that Dawkins doesn't even understand Aquinas's - much less defeat them. Now Feser's book (and Aquinas's Summa, for that matter) is not easy reading like Dawkins's breezy, blog-like The God Delusion. It's hard. But it's worth the effort. After reading The God Delusion and The Last Superstition in succession, Feser impressed me as the  headmaster who grabs Dawkins by the scruff of his neck and beats him like a recalcitrant, particularly obtuse schoolboy.<br /><br />If you haven't made up your mind on the critical issue of whether God exists, for God's sake, don't stop at Dawkins. Give a fair hearing to the best Christianity has to offer: Aquinas, whose arguments are made fairly accessible by, e.g., Feser. Then try C.S. Lewis's Miracles, followed by William Lane Craig's brilliant apologetic for the resurrection, The Son Rises. Round those out with Chesterton's The Everlasting Man and you have a case for God - and Christianity - that Dawkins and the other New Atheists can't tackle. And if you want to see where Dawkins's materialist philosophy leads, check out Lewis's The Abolition of Man. Finally, inresponse to Dawkins's assertion that religion has a generally pernicious influence on the world, I recommend Thomas Woods's How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.<br /><br />*As an aside, I would have thought that a scientist's book would be a bit more dispassionate but Dawkins's isn't; it's pure polemics. This is obvious from the prose itself but when one listens to the unabridged audio version of this book, as I did, it becomes abundantly clear. Dawkins's wife, Lalla, is his hatchet man (or woman, as the case may be). She reads the quotes from religious folks, and her inflection and tone are insufferable. Picture her in the recording studio with some lackey holding up cue cards that say \\"sanctimonious as*,\\" \\"credulous dullard,\\" and \\"browbeating ideologue\\" to remind her which religious character to slip into for a particular quote and you get the idea. Everyone else, of course, is quoted respectfully. In this respect, the audio version is so ham-handed it's laughable.response to Dawkins's assertion that religion has a generally pernicious influence on the world, I recommend Thomas Woods's How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.<br /><br />*As an aside, I would have thought that a scientist's book would be a bit more dispassionate but Dawkins's isn't; it's pure polemics.

B0000DJZAH|3.0|I know sound is the key concern, and the sound really is glorious. I don't own an SACD player, but the clarity is still impressive and superior to earlier releases. Moon's drums are much clearer, and as he's the greatest drummer ever that's no small potatoes. But *everything* is clearer, cleaner, more individual. There's more power, and the work shimmers. It's still quiet Tommy, not the racous noise usually (gloriously) assocated with The Who. If you've always felt Tommy was too underplayed, too sedate, I'm not sure this will change your experience. But if you've loved it before, you will love it more now.    But the packaging--SUCKS!    The previous CD release (the second, by my count, from 1996) was a beautiful job. All Michael McInnerey's original artwork was restored: the triptych cover, the gorgeous illustrations, libretto included, and to top it all off a beautiful Art Deco image created by David Byrd in 1970 for the Metropolitan Opera House performance graces the disc itself.    This new release does not retain the triptych, it does not contain the illustrations. Biggest offense: there is no libretto. There's some hazy backgroud info in the booklet inferior to that of earlier releases. A lot of session photography that is great, sure, but only as a supplimental, not a replacement. No real meaningful information about the rediscovery of the original tapes or how the recordings contained on it differ from those on previous releases supplied by Pete Townshend (there are some).     What this means is that a fan must buy both, even newcomers. That's a rip-off, in my opinion. Especially considering the price of this release.
1934648035|3.0|The book Siddhartha by Herman Hesse takes place in Ancient India and follows the story of a man called Siddhartha. He is born into wealth and is very intelligent. Siddhartha starts searching for the Atman. The Atman is within and but no one can tell him how to find it.  Not the Brahmins, who are the highest social class and similar to priests, or parents and teachers. He decides to leave his life of luxury and go to live with the ascetics with his best friend, Govinda. The ascetics, known as Samanas, teach that the way to Atman is by destroying your Self and that reality is an illusion. After a few years they hear stories of a Buddha who has attained enlightenment and is teaching disciples. They leave to follow him. Govinda stays with Buddha Gotama, but Siddhartha realizes that you can't teach enlightenment and he leaves.<br />Siddhartha realizes as he wanders that what he senses is not an illusion and what is most important is that he listens to the voice on his inside. He meets a ferryman and crosses the river. In the city he falls in love with a beautiful woman who is a courtesan, and unknowingly impregnates her. In order to be with her Siddhartha must become materially wealthy. When he does this he loses all his holiness and becomes bogged down in everyday life off a rich man. Eventually Siddhartha realizes he hates life so much that he leaves the city. He is about to kill himself when he realizes he can leave that life behind. Siddhartha goes and lives with the ferryman and listens to the river, which tells him many things. He meets his son who runs away and Siddartha has some very important realizations about life.<br /> This overall is a good story. However the writing isn't fully realized. One thing that made this book a little alienating was that it talks about concepts that are not fully explained. The Atman is a good example. It talks about where it's located, but doesn't explain the location (the soul).  The book takes awhile to grab the reader. If you keep reading it gets better but bogs back down towards the end of the story.  Hesse often repeats himself. For example he compares Siddartha's lover's lips to a fresh cut fig twice in two sentences. While repetition is useful in making points if overused you become redundant, making it weaker and casting an uncreative light on the author. However Hesse takes a creative path and strays from the accepted history of Siddhartha Gautama's life. For example, he never mentions the Bodhi tree that Buddha sat under when he became enlightened. This makes it seem like more of novel than a biography. This is also apparent by the fact that Hesse doesn't go into detail about all Siddartha's life, telling only what is necessary to get his real focus, Siddhartha's theories and beliefs and how those were formed. He will take pages to tell about days and then skip over years in the same amount of space or less. While this is necessary to keep the novel in a readable page range and to show focus on important parts it doesn't give you a complete perspective. For a more complete and light-hearted look at Buddha I suggest Osamu Tezuka's Buddha magna.<br />[[ASIN:1934648035 Siddhartha]]eading it gets better but bogs back down towards the end of the story.

B001DEXDNI|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 32 years since Annie Lennox first collaborated with Dave Stewart even before they formed Eurythmics and a mere seventeen years since her much-anticipated solo debut, 1992's [[ASIN:B000002VMH Diva]]. This 2009 collection focuses strictly on her solo output, so there are no [[ASIN:B000002W6Y Sweet Dreams]] to be found here. What it does have are five tracks from \\"Diva\\", arguably her best album, and the rest breezing through the years since with two new recordings included, the wistful \\"Pattern of My Life\\" by Keane's Tom Chaplin and the celebratory cover of Irish alt-rock band Ash's \\"Shining Light\\". Lennox has only made four albums on her own, so her 1995 all-covers [[ASIN:B000002VUC Medusa]], 2003's [[ASIN:B000089RVU Bare]] and 2007's [[ASIN:B000V801PK Songs of Mass Destruction]] are represented with a couple of tracks each on this disc.<br /><br />Lennox's soulful yet immaculate vocal delivery is what remains timeless even more than the pop craftsmanship behind her more prominent hits like the \\"Little Bird\\" and \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\". Her breakout hit \\"Why\\" remains masterfully hypnotic, and \\"Precious\\" still percolates with near-religious fervor. However, the standout of the \\"Diva\\" quintet has to be \\"Cold\\" with its eerie quality taking flight from Lennox's lush sense of dramatic force.  The two tracks from \\"Medusa\\" showcase her unerring ability to make the familiar sound fresh with her mournful take on Procol Harum's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" and the innate theatrical flair she brings to Lover Speaks' \\"No More `I Love You's'\\". From \\"Bare\\", neither \\"Pavement Cracks\\" nor \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things\\" display the sheer audacity of her previous efforts, but they show how she can turn in beautiful performances with her customary dexterity.<br /><br />From \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\", Lennox sounds even more rapturous on the somber \\"Dark Road\\", and on the African-tinged \\"Sing\\", she energizes an all-female chorus of 23 stars (including Faith Hill, Bonnie Raitt, Dido, Sarah MacLachlan, Gladys Knight, Beth Orton, Celine Dion and a most discernible Madonna among many others) who join voices for a gospel-fueled anthem which can be viewed as a more serious-minded sequel to Lennox's memorable duet with Aretha Franklin from over two decades back, \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\". While nominally about female empowerment, the song really reflects Lennox's dedication to bringing global awareness to the HIV/AIDS crisis. On the other end of the emotional spectrum is \\"Love Song for a Vampire\\", the evocative yet enervating theme song to Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 [[ASIN:B000TGJ80S Bram Stoker's Dracula]].

B000026EV6|5.0|This, the second album by the band was preceded by their highly hailed and applauded self-titled debut, a record that created so high expectations before its release -mainly by the music media- that it went to become the fastest selling record in the history of UK in 1993 and made them the recipients of that year's Mercury Prize award. Suddenly, Suede were all over the place, seen by many as the band responsible for bringing back British rock to the front, on a time when music was dominated by the grunge movement that was happening on the other side of the Atlantic. As things turned out, this was not to be the case, as Oasis took all praise for kickstarting the britpop frenzy and Suede were relegated to a very successful career in their homeland and continental Europe, while being virtual unknowns in the United States. What happened? Well... you might find some answers while listening to this record. Dog Man Star is a completely different album from Suede, gone were the catchy guitar hooks and the infected glam melodies from their debut, and what we get here is a grandiose album of epic proportions filled with melancholy and beauty in every song, Anderson and Butler deliver twelve tracks with gorgeous string arrangements and over the top vocals, that provide an atmosphere of calmness and reflection, and, aside of Heroin and This Hollywood Life, you hardly will find any monumental rocker like the ones on their debut. Maybe because they didn't deliver another Suede, and instead they chose to make a dark, elegant and beautiful album, they didn't hit it big in America. Something we'll never know. One thing we know, though. Dog Man Star is a great album, and an often overlooked statement of the British pop of the '90s.
B0016NF06O|5.0|I ordered my copy of this cd with great anticipation and I was not disappointed. The musical selections and musicianship are plain fun!  I read some of the other reviews and wondered if those who didn't like the cd had even listened to it. Sadly it seems some may have decided going in that they would not like what they heard and that is a shame.  They clearly missed the \\"music\\".   The only question that matters here is, \\"Is this good music and is it something one can enjoy listening to again and again?\\"   The answer is absolutely yes...these are good tunes, the arrangements are fun...traditional in a sense but with  some refreshing takes...some in the spirit of old time New Orleans jazz, others more blues... all are well crafted and very well performed.   I find myself rewinding the player to hear certain licks and chops again and again. Willie is Willie and Wynton is Wynton and the two bring what they do together in a way that is just too good to miss.  I like this recording very much.  I love that it is live... people don't record live much anymore...just as well because a lot of live music isn't anymore.  This is a fun cd, musically worthwhile and a joy to listen to again and again.  I recommend this to anyone who loves good music, plain and simple.

The fact that Trent even bothered to make fun of \\"Scream\\" should be seen as a compliment to Cornell's potential.    Cornell has completely abandoned everything he stood for by shrugging off Soundgarden and making a transition to pop, first obvious on his ok \\"Billy Jean\\" take. Here, on the cover, we see him furiously smashing a guitar... because guitars suck? Or are cliche? Or is it just that we're supposed to believe pop is much more liberating? Give me a break.

075640407X|4.0|OK, so maybe \\"classic\\" is too strong a word for a novel that's only been out a year or two, but still...    Here is what you can take away from this simple review. I JUST began reading fantasy. I have been a reader of the horror genre since I was a child. I read anything King, Koontz, McCammon, Crichton, Saul, or Little. About 10 years ago, a friend of mine tried to get me to read The Wheel of Time, \\"the best series ever written\\". I tried and failed miserably. So I went back to my comfort zone and gave up on fantasy. About six months ago, I wanted something new and the same friend recommended a new \\"best series ever written\\" and let me borrow a book called \\"A Game of Thrones\\". Need I say any more? I read all four Martin books in a few months (I'm a slow reader) and was clamoring for something else. Someone on the Martin sight compared the clamoring of A Dance with Dragons to the clamoring of Wise Man's Fear. I followed up on that and saw the reviews for Name of the Wind and gave it a try. I am so glad I did...    This is an extremely solid debut novel. Scratch that....this is an extremely solid novel. The characters are very well written and the plot kept me interested the entire way. Martin and Rothfuss are two different artists with two different styles, so I can't compare the two but for a novel of fantasy, Name of the Wind has \\"it\\" in spades.  I don't know which book I am most looking forward to....A Dance with Dragons or Wise Man's fear. How's that for a recommendation>
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I've heard excellent reviews from this film and as a vampire movie fan I was eager to see it in the theater but being a foreign limited released film I never got the chance. When it was released on DVD hardly any stores here carried the movie and if it did, sold out as they only have a limited amount.   The nice thing about Amazon is that they carry just about all releases and so I bought it from them and it took about 3 days.   Now to the movie:  I loved this movie because it does stick to vampire lore. The title refers to the old rule of vampires being prohibited from entering a home without being invited first. That is just one of the many rules that I remember from reading the old vampire stories. Now you see vampire movies that break the tradition of avoiding sunlight, entering a home without being invited first, etc.   Film quality is decent and there is very little special effects so if more of that is what your looking for, then this may not be your movie.   But if you like the stories in movies you might want to give this a try. This has a new yet traditional spin on vampires and the ending will leave you wondering. A very good movie!

031606792X|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews of Breaking Dawn I expected to be let down by it (although I absolutely loved every minute of the previous 3).  Now that I finished it, I've gotta say, What's all this whining about??  OK, so this book is not exactly like the previous novels with it's cutesy love story but it has matured and evolved, just like most of the characters within its pages.  If you were hooked from the beginning, what's not to love about this one?  I am totally depressed that it's over and will surely miss the magical world Ms. Meyer allowed me to get a glimpse of.  My only solace is that I have 200+ pages of Midnight Sun to drool over.  Once that one is finished I'm sure Ms. Meyer will have plenty of time to ponder the 5th book of this series.  Please tell me it's not REALLY over!?!

These are the kind of slow tunes that are great for dancing with your best girl/guy but to listen to for 60 minutes--sorry. Her ability to  put together an album that makes the listener sit up has disappeared since she met you-know-who. She still has talent  (I hope)--it is just totally hidden here.

B001N26GFM|5.0|How wonderful it must be to see the world through the eyes of an oblivious child.  There are no jobs, no wars, no famine, no taxes, no real thought of danger.  For a young boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the naivety and innocence could prove to be potentially dangerous.<br /><br />An up-and-coming SS officer (David Thewlis) is given a promotion; and as a result of his new assignment, his family is forced to move.  Traveling from the relative safety of Berlin to a very large, remote house was not what anyone other than the father expected.  Simultaneously supportive and reluctant, his family - especially the mother (played with heart-breaking emotion by Vera Farmiga) - soon realizes their new home is adjacent to an active concentration camp.<br /><br />With more than a passing resemblance to a mini-Hitler, Bruno is a typically adventurous boy.  Having a soldier for a father is a source of pride and admiration for him; he'd love nothing better than to emulate his father.  He initially notices the local \\"gardeners\\" in \\"pajamas\\" and becomes intrigued.  While exploring the woods in his backyard, something strictly forbidden from by his mother, he comes across the nearby camp and meets Shmuel (Scanlon), an emaciated, filthy eight-year old Jewish prisoner.  The two form a tenuous and dangerous friendship, discussing their childish similarities, but also uncovering at least one significant difference: their feeling towards soldiers.  Neither understands the precariousness of their surroundings, nor do they understand the hideous smells coming from a burning smokestack very nearby.<br /><br />Eventually their shared innocence disintegrates under the pressure of their real world surroundings as Bruno attempts to comprehend why everyone seems to hate the Jews even though his friend Shmuel is such a nice guy.  The final jaw-dropping moment shines light on the possibility of tragedy when one is ignorant, oblivious, or purposefully turning a blind eye to the surrounding dangers.<br /><br />The performances from all are incredibly moving.  Witnessing not only the loss of Jewish childhood via the stolen dignity, humanity, and life itself, but also that of the German childhood manipulated via the indoctrination of Nazi propaganda, truly delivers an incredibly heave message that resonates long after the movie is complete.  Truly stunning, this film does an incredible job at displaying the atrocities of the death camps while providing an invaluable teaching tool.

1595478728|4.0|This book is considered to be a masterpiece by many and I suppose I am on that bandwagon. My copy is littered with underlined sentences and highlighted sections. Many of his insights are keen and life-changing. However, Orthodoxy is not an easy read in my opinion. As brilliant of a man Mr. Chesterton was, his lines of thought are sometimes difficult to trace. Throughout the book I found myself repeatedly asking, \\"Now what was he talking about...how did we arrive here...where is he going with this;\\" the overall journey is a wild ride. A rather large percentage of his references and illustrations are far too localized and restricted to GK's time and town - even though his lessons are timeless. I felt myself wishing I was reading his newspaper and conversing with his contemporaries in their cafes. This is evidenced by the amount of footnotes strung throughout in an attempt to clue in the reader.  Overall, this book is a treasure.

1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin is one of my favorite authors. His stories of Ireland and its history and heritage have given me a keener sense of that land and its people. His new novel, 'Brooklyn' is a veer from his usual path. I have a sense that this novel may be the beginning of an Irish/American tradition.<br /><br />Eilis Lacey is a young woman living a sheltered life in a small Irish village, Enniscorthy. The period of time is the 1950's and there are two classes the working and the well to do. Eilis has several brothers and an older sister, Rose. Her mother is widowed and keeps the family running. The brothers have gone to Dublin to seek their fortune. It is Eilis' sister, Rose who is keeping the family fed and clothed. She is a secretary and earns a good living. Eilis is very good with numbers and a visiting priest from the United States is asked if he can assist Eilis to find a job. There is nothing available for her in her village, but Father Flood has many contacts in America. And, much to Eilis's surprise Father Flood has offered Eilis a chance for a new life and a job in the United States.<br /><br />The promise of a new life in America brings many changes, but Eilis copes with her new found friends in a rooming house and her job as a sales girl. She studies accounting at night and writes many letters home. All is as it should be. Rose assists Father Flood with meals for the homeless and attends dances at the Catholic parish. It is here that she meets a young Italian boy, Tony. Love blooms and Eilis's life takes a new turn when tragedy strikes and she is summoned home. Eilis's response to these new life's changes may be surprising.<br /><br />Colm Toibin has a knack for fleshing out the characters he writes about, and he did this brilliantly with Eilis and the Lacey family and friends in the small Irish village. However, the same cannot be said of the characters in Brooklyn. There was much more that could have been said about Tony and his family. Eilis's time at Brooklyn College and her studies of tax law seemed to fall apart. This is a nice story about a young Irish girl who finds love in a new land. I expected more than this.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 04-15-09College and her studies of tax law seemed to fall apart. This is a nice story about a young Irish girl who finds love in a new land.

0316017922|2.0|I was happily reading along until I got to the Korean Air crash in Guam and that stopped me cold. As a former USAF aircraft commander and Airline Transport rated pilot and instrument instructor, I was shocked as Gladwell essentially attributes the crash to subordinate communication hesitancy born of Korean culture.    Gladwell takes his authority from \\"an NTSB [crash investigation] black-box expert, a PhD psychologist\\"  Brenner who was on the investigation team. He apparently is not a pilot (p. 210 - some are engineers, some pilots, but some psychologists). Brenner describes a 'difficult' VOR/DME approach at Guam which he calls \\"a pain in the a$$, complicated and takes a lot of coordination\\". He goes on to say that the airliner was cleared for that approach, that is the VOR/DME approach because the glideslope was not working. Then he quotes the Captain as simply saying \\"We're doing a visual approach\\". Gladwell chimes in at this point (p.211) with a glaringly inaccurate description of a VOR beacon. Brenner is back with \\"if you follow the VOR down, it takes you directly into the hill\\".    Let me rebut the last paragraph: VOR/DME approaches are not difficult to an experienced instrument pilot. Solo pilots do them often. That's one. And in point of fact, the VOR/DME approach was not cleared by anyone (two). Another approach was planned and flown (ILS - localizer only)/DME. Subtle but big difference. The Captain's briefing was not the one sentence as Gladwell leads you to believe: It was the first sentence in a larger briefing. (three). VOR's do not lead you down into the ground (four). Not even VOR/DMEs.    From here Gladwell launches into a series of descriptions of Korean etiquette and partly attributes the crash to \\"one of the most critical moments of the flight\\": passing references to the rain by the copilot: \\"don't you think it rains more in this area?\\" [this sentence was uttered a full 18 minutes before the crash]. And anyone who has ever flown into Guam will tellyou. Yes it does rain alot. Further, Gladwell extends the copilots comment to 'mean': \\"Captain. You have committed us to visual approach with no backup plan, and the weather outside is terrible. You think that we will break out of the clouds in time to see the runway. But what if we don't? It's pitch-black outside and pouring rain and the glide slope is down\\". Not a single phrase (except the last) rings true. The backup plan was use of the charts (see later) - \\"What if we don't?\\" Is Gladwell saying that the copilot just got out of high school? \\"It's pitch-black outside?\\" No it isn't, they can see the island lights, stars are out. \\"Pouring rain?\\" Please. No experienced pilot thinks or talks like this.    None of this sat well with me, so I decided to read the accident report itself (dutifully recorded in the book endnotes). These reports, by the way, are exhaustive and issued with finality a year or so after the actual crash. They are very interesting reading (for pilots anyway) and are completely accessible online. If your eyes are glazed over at this point, all you have to know is that accident report did not agree with the book's 'expert' description nor did it come close to verifying Gladwell's guesses.    What the report says (in contradiction) is:    1) The Captain briefed a visual approach but added the navigation radio setup (ILS Primary in #1, VOR in #2) which extended the briefing considerably. He also had in front of him the instrument approach charts for the airport. He had been briefed by his company on the dangers of the fatal hill; he had flown there a month before as Captain in the 747 and had flown 7 times before as a 727 Captain. The briefing included general visual profile altitudes. This was 30 minutes before the crash.     2) They tracked the rain squalls on radar and were aware of them and went around some rain clouds on the way in. They did fly into rain before the crash (the sound recorder could hear the wipers come on after the Captain commanded them on).    3) The aircraft was \\"cleared for ILS [localizer] approach. Not VOR/DME. There is not much difference here between the two as far as a pilot is concerned, but the accident report clearly and unequivocally states the type of approach they were cleared for. If an 'expert' gets even one major detail wrong it throws off the credibility - but here we're talking several incorrect details.     4) The Captain (who was flying the airplane) thought for a while the glideslope was working (it was not) but when he realized it was not [it might have looked like it was] he clearly said out loud that he should not fly below 1440 feet - which is exactly what the ILS approach chart specified. If he had done what he just said, they would have glided over the hill with 800 feet to spare. In fact, he did not level off at 1440 feet as he should have - the flight recorder clearly shows this. He kept descending until it was too late. And no one called him on it - and not because they were deferential Koreans, but because they were not paying attention. The co-pilot and engineer (still running the before landing checklist) were not involved in the approach. In fact the Captain insisted they look outside for the runway. Standard procedure, but still the copilot should at least be monitoring the aircraft position to confirm compliance. The fact remains, the Captain flew the airplane into the hill, accidentally, but he was in full control of the aircraft at the time. Well, unless he was asleep - a possibility that the accident report does not address.    5) A man happened to be on the ground on that hill as the airplane passed very low directly over him and crashed a second later. His comment? \\"The stars were out\\" It was perfectly clear, no rain.    The point of all this is that for me, the book's factual and logical conclusions are suspect. I know this one section was mostly bogus since it talked about things I know about. It's a shame because the writing is fun and the subject interesting.

1400049628|4.0|When I first saw this book in the humor section of my local bookstore I had to take a gander.  What was inside made me wonder just what the hell it was doing in the comedy section.  Now, I know much has been bandied about regarding the sarcasm behind it all.  Every guy worth his geeky salt has sat around with his buddies, beer in hand, discussing which superhero would win a particular fight versus another.  Don't deny it, we've all done it.    But Max Brooks has taken what I presume to be the humorous, alcohol-infused thinktank minutes and turned it into the most useful, paranoid, and downright \\"hmm\\" inducing work in decades.  It reminded me a bit of \\"Airplane!\\"  Endless gags and jokes behind a thin wall of straight-as-an-arrow dialogue delivery.  It makes you wonder if Max really does take this stuff seriously, or if he laughed and got red-faced during the entire composition of the manuscript.    I was already been a bit obsessed with zombies before I'd even seen the book.  Becoming a gun owner and a role playing gamer can do that to you.  (It's too late to save me, but save yourselves!)  Suffice to say, I found it unsurprising that they have a weathered copy of this book behind the counter at my local shooting range.    It makes sense for some of us to be enthralled, terrified, and giddy at the thought of mowing down mobs of zombies and then playing a life-long game of hide-and-seek.  We all want to fight the monster and live adventure.  Max Brooks does an expert job at taking this urge and expanding it into a near omnibus of useful data.  While there are some technical aspects I found myself wishing he'd write about, there's not much left out.    The appendix on recorded zombie outbreaks and attacks was criticzed by someone as being too long and out of place.  Not so!  It's a great bathroom reader of sorts.  One or two pages per entry is easily digestible for the job at hand.    However, I would have liked to have seen more on the weapons section.  There are quite a few handguns that, in even marginally practiced hands, that can put a round in a zombie's head.  I was making bullseyes within a few trips to the range.  Granted, there is the false confidence of machismo he discusses, but come on; handguns are more useful than he thinks.    But then again, it was only after reading his book that I bought a 44 magnum lever-action rifle, specifically for zombie-hunting.  And a good friend of mine with a few acres is evolving his firing range into a zombie-terminating practice ground.    For all the fun we have wanting to blow away zombies, our teeth gritted and our eyes squinting from the shockwaves of spent powder, it's still a useful guide.  It's the kind of thing that makes sense in that one percent of a percent of a percent chance that -- and part of me wants it to be true and the other part horrified at the prospect -- he could be friggin' right!      Then what do you do?  Brains....
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Like 'The Thirteenth Warrior' before it, Beowulf puts a new spin on the ancient Gaelic saga, and the results are mixed but mostly positive.<br /><br />The main alteration here is the depiction of Beowulf as a flawed hero who's vanity and thirst for fame as a young man prove to be his undoing later in life. The battle with Grendel is preserved, as is Beowulf's final duel with the dragon, but Grendel's mother plays a very different role than the sea hag of legend. Portrayed by Angelina Jolie, who is rendered even more \\"voluptuous\\" than she is in real-life, Grendel's mother is more a siren than a monster, seducing one hero after another with her beauty and golden promises.<br /><br />All of this serves to create the necessary character \\"arc\\" for Beowulf to follow, something which is missing from the original legend's depiction of Beowulf as paragon of masculine virtue. While the update adds a layer of depth to the lead character it also creates a few weak links elsewhere. Chief among these is Beowulf's sudden inheritance of Hrothar's entire kingdom, including his wife, the queen. These shortcomings are overshadowed by the fantastic special effects and glorious action sequences, and overall the new material renders the story more mature and makes the ending more satisfying for modern audiences.<br /><br />The film is entirely computer animated which gives the film the freedom to dwell in the realm of fantasy. The characters are rendered in extraordinary detail, although you will notice a few unnatural  movements here and there. Occasionally the liberties taken with the special effects seem absurd, Grendel's mother for instance, has feet with a natural set of stiletto heels growing from the soles. Many of the scenes are also tailored to exploit the 3D IMAX format, but neither this nor the few flaws mentioned above detract from the home viewing experience.
B0000027I6|5.0|With the possible exception of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (which the Floyd did do demo work on), this is the one Waters album that literally begs for the presence of his former bandmates.  The album has a powerful dual concept:  That of the wars which were raging in the Balkan Peninsula at the time and the complacency of those who watched such a thing at home as one would a film or videogame, cozy in the padded recliner (How much time have YOU spent in front of the television or the computer screen lately?).  Waters evidently put far much more work into and emphasis upon the music than he did his previous album, which never seemed to gel on either front.  As is common with the latter-day song cycles by Waters, some lyrical editing would have been welcome, as far too many songs just simply dance round and round a point without really going anywhere.  Lyrical redundancies aside, this album is quite simply the strongest Waters has put forth since his resignation from Pink Floyd.  The songs are tough and tight when they need to be, and quietly expansive elsewhere.  Jeff Beck equals, and at some points even bests Eric Clapton's work on Hitch Hiking, but Beck is here in a session musician's status, so his playing never quite blends into the album as a whole.  It's as if he's this amazing guitarist who is trotted out at times to make the listener forget another guitarist who used to work with Waters.  And that's the rub.  From the first spin, one misses the musical empathy that the Floyd could have brought to bear upon such a project.  If Waters had been brought to bear on the lyrical front, and the full, classic lineup of the Floyd had been firing on all eight cylinders, this would have been one of their finest albums ever.  It's a shame that such couldn't happen, but that doesn't detract from the appeal and worth of Amused to Death itself.  It's an excellent album which, it seems, has been overlooked by all but the hardiest of Floyd fans.  That's a shame, as the issues examined by Waters are just as pressing today as they were when this album was released over a decade ago.  Do yourself a favor, pick this one up, and listen to it on its own terms.  And do your best to not imagine the Floyd cutting this album sometime in 1992.

B0018SWA56|5.0|Having read the prequel to this book (Something Borrowed), I knew I had to continue with the great story of two very different friends that author Emily Giffin has created. You definitely need to read the books in order, as Something Blue picks up right where Something Borrowed left off. But there's a twist: the narrator has changed from \\"brainy\\" Rachel to \\"superficial\\" Darcy. I have to say this is one of my favorite things about this pair of books because I love seeing things from two different perspectives.<br /><br />In Something Blue, Darcy, who is rather self-involved and seems to believe that she lives a charmed life, has just had two life-changing experiences. Her former fiance' Dex (the former is a very recent addition as the pair has just called off the wedding) has slept with Rachel, her best friend since childhood, and Darcy is pregnant with the baby of one of Dex's groomsmen, Marcus, who she has been cheating on Dex with for a few months. Darcy is furious with Rachel and Dex and determined to move on with her life by happily raising her baby with Marcus. Things don't go exactly as planned though when Marcus dumps her because he doesn't want the responsibility of a child and her parents are less than thrilled about what Darcy has done to her life. This leads Darcy to fly off to England to visit another childhood friend, Ethan, and try to rebuild her life there. It takes some tough experiences and a few harsh words from Ethan for Darcy to finally realize that she has been living her life as a less than caring and sensitive person and it may be time for her to take responsibility for some of the things that have happened. It is this point that I believe the story really gets going and the reader gets to watch as Darcy attempts to improve herself and her life as she prepares for the arrival of her baby. There is more than one plot twist that follows and the character development is wonderful. There are few books that move me to shed tears, but the ending of this one definitely had me misty-eyed.<br /><br />Something Blue is a fabulous story of friendship, romance, and self-discovery.

Animals from both this earth and an otherworldly one dot the enchanting landscape of the Paulina Tarot, as do characters bedecked with colorful early Mardi Gras, Victorian-influenced costumes.<br /><br />Reflecting artist Paulina Cassidy's affinity for the city of New Orleans, the Paulina Tarot reflects Rider-Waite-Smith structure, yet imparts a fresh, lighthearted perspective to the cards.<br /><br />Delightfully detailed and gracefully rendered, the artistry of this deck invites users to come along for a magical ride that, while whimsical, captures the everyday situations, emotions and dilemmas faced in the ordinary world.<br /><br />With cards measuring approximately 4 ¾ x 2 ¾ inches and featuring a subtle reversible pen-and-ink imagery on the back, the suits and courts of the Paulina Tarot follow the Rider-Waite-Smith array: Swords, Wands, Pentacles and Cups for the suits, with Page, Knight, Queen and King for the courts.<br /><br />The Paulina Tarot is accompanied by a general 47-page L(ittle) W(hite) B(ook) that provides brief descriptions as well as upright and reversed meanings.<br /><br />I've found the Paulina Tarot to be a playful deck, while still speaking to the inner world (and issues) that often brings us to do readings in the first place (especially when it comes to reminding me not to work so hard and expect so much of myself!).<br /><br />Case in point: Last week, I felt that I was behind on reviews (so many products, so little time), but I wasn't feeling well. What I *really* wanted to do was play PS2 games with my son! I did a 3-card reading with the Paulina Tarot as I was debating on how to spend my evening and drew the Page of Cups, Fool, and The Sun. Play, play, play!, the cards encouraged.<br /><br />And so I did, for hours, having a blast with my son. (Interestingly, The Sun card usually comes up in my personal readings when referring specifically to my \\"son\\"!) A few days later, I was feeling torn yet again by my desire to catch up on reviews but realizing my weakened physical condition. I shuffled for probably five minutes, just gazing nowhere in particular. My son asked \\"Doing a Tarot reading, Mom?\\"<br /><br />\\"How did you know?\\" I replied. When I deal cards for any reading, I draw based on feel and a mental rhythm in my head. I couldn't seem to find the \\"right time\\" to draw, which is why I shuffled so long. Finally, two cards popped out of the deck, landing face up on the floor. Guess what they were? The Page of Cups and The Fool!<br /><br />As you can probably tell, I love working with the Paulina Tarot, especially for personal readings and journaling! With intricate line work, fanciful characters, and muted watercolors, this deck pleases the eye and lifts the spirits. But, truly, it's not just a \\"pretty\\" deck; the Paulina Tarot imparts illuminating wisdom, emotional comfort and pointed answers for those who go beyond its lovely surface.<br /><br />(To see 18 images from the Paulina Tarot, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Bookl readings when referring specifically to my \\"son\\"!)

B0014U4X3U|5.0|I had a copy of the Complete Illustrated Novels of Jane Austen before I bought the Kindle.  It was a pain to have to drag the 1200+ page book around with me.  The book itself is easy to use, and it's great to have all the novels together.  This was the first book I bought on the Kindle and I'm really happy with it. Thank you, Kindle, for lightening my purse considerably!
B000XA5K48|5.0|If you dig mindless, nonstop action, shot with style and cleverness, Shoot Em Up! is the movie for you.<br />It's over the top, totally unbelievable, physically impossible, but absolutely brilliant all at the same time.<br /><br />Clive Owen eats a lot of carrots and values his privacy. There are many things that he absolutely hates, and he comes into contact with most of these things when he unwillingly gets involved in a plot to kill a very pregnant young woman. Suddenly faced with a nanny job, he shoots his way out of the frying pan and into the fire, each scenario more jaw-dropping-ly impossible than the last. Paul Giamatti plays an unlikely criminal mastermind and Monica Bellucci is under-utilized in but she sizzles as the proverbial professional girl with a heart of gold. Things get political, and hopelessly complicated, and of course there's lots and lots (and lots) of shooting, during any (and I do mean ANY) situation. Four Stars!<br /><br />Buy Shoot Em Up for $0.49 on Amazon.com!<br />Next mindless action/horror movie reviews: Deathproof and Planet Terror

1416562591|3.0|One of the recent book that I completed within few days.   I liked the story flow which is like an Indian masala movie with a lot of reality touch.   Some of the analogy like \\"rooster coop\\"   and comments like \\"My humble prediction: in twenty years' time, it will be just us yellow men and brown men at the top of the pyramid and we'll rule the whole world. And God save everyone else.\\" were interesting.  Also liked the comments of south Indian Coffee drinking and North Indian tea drinking.  In the story the way Balram Halwai's raise to the economical level is not so uncommon in India, but it is a smaller percentage like in any other country & society. But the caste system and the reference in all the places is very prevalent, and no one can deny it.  Some of the review comments in this forum is in both the extremes, I feel this is a book of fiction, so it has to be taken in that way and I don't think every writer has to have only a positive opinion on his nativity especially in their creative art.

B000MGVWKO|4.0|The book arrived well packaged, wrapped in plastic with dustcover, binding and pages intact. The pages were slightly yellowed; not unexpected due to the age of the book, though with a few dog-ear creases, otherwise in great condition. The shipper took time to package the material well for shipping and provided information for the anticipated and approximate delivery time, which ended up as pretty accurate. Overall, I would purchase used books from Amazon and the seller again. Thank you.

B001CTDH58|1.0|This was so annoying, I got chills up my spine watching it. My kids didnt even like it. They BEGGED me to leave the theater. I made them stay, even bribed them with candy and popcorn, they are always well-behaved, but this time, they were YELLING at the screen, and even wanted me to get my money back for the tickets!    The worst part of it was that overrated \\"comedian\\" that did the voice of the dog, that george lopez guy. I wont even begin to tell you about all the hidden adult themes in it!    It is in your best interest to destroy this disc.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a well done to all concerned series.  Detail fairly well spot on, acted well, storyline close I would think.  Worth the money, worth the time, should be seen and remembered.    One question:-    When will someone do the same for WW1?
B000BNI99K|5.0|Never in a million years would I have thought of the gravel-voiced Rod Stewart to record classics like 'Stardust' or 'As Time Goes By'.  That's why I'm not a record producer.<br /><br />These interpretations are gorgeous, contributed to heavily by the impeccable back ups; just enough to enhance, not over-orchestrate.<br /><br />If you love these, seek out Michael Feinstein's Gershwin and Berlin CDs--not the ones with the orchestras.  These ARE the great American songs.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series has been well done. Competently filmed and well acted. The story is fairly accurate and rolls right along.  This is well worth spending the time to sit down and enjoy.  Some superb acting in this, buy and enjoy.
6305127697|4.0|I'll always think of this movie as the one which introduced us to the acting talents of Edward Norton. In other words, this movie made him a star, as the cliché goes.    But Richard Gere should be credited, too, with another fine acting performance. For quite awhile there, Gere acted in one good movie after another and I believe this was one of his best efforts. Sometimes his \\"pretty boy\\" image masked the fact that he has been a pretty darned good actor in a number of film.    Not only is the acting superb in here - by everyone - but the story is very involving, too. I remember being riveted to the screen while seeing this in the theater. Some of the scenes are quite shocking, particularly when we discover the real \\"Aaron Stampler\\" (Norton). If you wait awhile (at least five years) and see it again, it's still shocking even if you vaguely remember a few things.    The bad side of this - to me, not to most people, is the overuse of the Lord's name in vain in here (mostly by Gere, who is ridiculous in this role in that regard) and the obvious anti-Roman Catholic bias in here (and I'm not Catholic).  I also didn't find Laura Linney's character, \\"Janet Venable\\" to be entertaining, just annoying. There's something about Linney's smug looks that really turn me off.     Overall, if language or Catholic-bashing doesn't bother you, this is a super film. Even if it does, it's a pretty intense crime movie and certainly entertaining.
B001PPGAIK|3.0|This is an epic film, sometimes remember me Indiana Jones. Great fotography, sometimes too candy. Great quality video and sound in blu-ray !<br />People who begins to see any kind of movies in blu-ray hardly can go back to DVD, unless the DVD has a great quality video, but when you see the same film in blu-ray ...
6305428522|4.0|I am old enough toI vaguely remember the scandal attached to it to the TV show on which this movie is based. I certainly remember the name \\"Charles Van Doren.\\"    Ralph Fiennes plays the handsome, wealthy Van Doren, a man TV executives preferred to feature weekly on their quiz show rather than a nerd like \\"Herbie Stempel,\\" played wonderfully by John Turturro. Every actor is superb in here, from crooked NBC executives to the Stempel and Van Doren families. Veteran actor Paul Scofield plays Van Doren's father \\"Mark\\" and is a standout in that role.    The sad story, if this movie is true, is that the crooks basically got away with it, at least if you read the ending credits right after the movie ends. What injustice!    By the way, it's unbelievable how much left-wing propaganda is in this film.  The Liberal cheap shots were shots against Eisenhower, Nixon and even Jesus! Well, that's Hollywood, but those digs weren't necessary. The story had enough going for it without that.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The 30 Day Shred is basically 3-20 minute progressively more difficult workouts. Each workout is basically a circuit (this could be why some have criticized it as repetitious): One part strength training (3 minutes,if I recall), one part cardio (2 minutes), one part abs (1 minute). There are 3 participants: Jillian, a person who does the more advanced versions, and a person who does the lower intensity more modified versions. The footwork in the cardio segments is NOT difficult so for those with 2 left feet, don't worry about tripping over yourself. The strength training exercises are also straightforward (I wouldn't say easy, because you will feel it).     HOWEVER, lower intensity does not necessarily mean your feet won't leave the floor. So, for those with bad knees or other joint issues (like myself) you may need to further modify the moves or just skip them altogether.     Some reviewers stated that Jillian provides NO instruction as to form. This is simply not true. Numerous times she warned not to extend the knee too far over the foot, maintain proper back alignment, etc. But, for complete novices to all things fitness, it may be difficult to remember to keep your back straight/abs in/knees not over the foot/upright row/ all while maintaining a squat position. Now that I think about it, even some more advanced/experienced exercisers might have difficulty.     Other reviewers commented on Jillian's personality. True, she is not your perky, twinkle in the eye instructor, who bounces all over the studio spreading sunshine and rainbows. For those who prefer that sort of instructor, Denise Austin, anyone? Jillian IS tough. She is NOT there to be your friend or make you feel all warm and fuzzy. She repeatedly says throughout the video that you have to want it. That this is your time, your workout and if you want to be a better you, fitness-wise you WILL have to push yourself. It's up to YOU.     The ONLY exercise that really gave me pause is in the most advanced workout: The straight-leg sit up. I am not a personal trainer or a medical professional, and maybe current sit up research shows otherwise, but I have always understood that straight leg sit ups can seriously strain a person's back.     Overall, I think this is a decent workout provided that a person understands and can maintain proper form and knows how to modify exercises that might be difficult for that person.
B000244EMO|4.0|Yeah, I know this is a low-grade simple story, one of those action flicks that oozes with too much testosterone.....but so what.? Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.    Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.    Speaking of visuals, it's disappointing that the Blu-Ray transfer is so poor...at least according to most of the reviewers here, whom I believe. I would have gladly upgraded but now I'm a little leery of doing that.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Season Two was probably my least favorite so far but I would still give it 100 out of 100 stars. Brilliant storylines paired with the brilliant acting of Michael C. Hall makes this show (in my opinion) one of the greatest shows ever!!
B00081U7HC|3.0|This was the ultimate example of Hollywood glorifying prostitutes and showing them to be gorgeous (and basically good-hearted) women. I do NOT speak from experience but from number of real-life cop-friends I can tell you this: you average hooker looks the OPPOSITE of Julia Roberts (or Melanie Griffth or Elizabeth Shue and all the rest of the hooker-hotties Hollywood throws at us.)<br /><br />However, it is still a fun movie which has entertained most people who have watched it for over 20 years. Roberts and Richard Gere certainly make a handsome couple (and still do). Hector Elizondo almost steals the show with his minor role as \\"Barney,\\" the hotel manager. He is definitely the most humorous character in the film.<br /><br />It's a funny, charming and romantic film that was a big hit. Just don't believe it when Hollywood continues to glamorize the seedy aspects of prostitution.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are very few things I can add to the almost 3,000 reviews here, but I just had to add my voice. This is probably the best series I have seen, I can hardly believe it was ever actually shown on television, the vast wasteland.  It is smart, deep, and completely entertaining. It is probably not something you want to watch with children (they wouldn't get it anyway, as it isn't children's programming) It shows a completely possible future, with those wanting to control what everyone does on the one side (the alliance) and everyone else on the other (settlers, rebels, etc) and the Chinese influence from having become the next world superpower. What a grand adventure this whole series was..and typical of Fox to cut it short (no independent thought now, people)
B001UOVP1S|2.0|I have ALWAYS been a Chris Cornell fan....His voice has just always had this ability to draw you in...Be it Solo,soundgarden, Audioslave..It didn't matter...His voice is unique.  I saw this new album...And was excited...  Then I listened to the samples before I hit \\"BUY\\".  I was so disappointed...I respect someone doing something different and diverse...But...  Lets just say....Even As a HUGE C.C. fan...I wouldn't buy it, even priced at $1.99.  But, I guess Chris is the one who needs to be satisfied with the album because he is ultimately the one who has to live it....  I can tell you....If he'd ever make an acoustic album of his earlier stuff, mixed with some new stuff that actually sounds like Chris Cornell..[...] I'd be waiting in line to buy it....  As for this Album---Dude, What were you thinking ? You are So much better than this!
B001MYIXAW|4.0|I'd absolutely recommend this film to you. It's nicely done and very emotional actually. The interesting parts are those kids acting great and Sweden in wintertime as a playground. The blueray version has an impeccable quality. I really liked<br />the eerie and somewhat dull atmosphere created in this story. Quite different a vampire tale.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|The album is soothing and smooth. I can listen to it on repeat for hours. I recently saw Melody live in London and she was amazing. Such a beautiful and clear voice that conveys so much emotion.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|A good knight had killed a monster just to father another one with a mother of all monsters, a seductive female creature picking up among the strongest knights partners for producing world-threatening predators while paying sexual partners off with a good job - a kingship.<br /><br />A movie for admiring the really sexy, beautiful bodies in addition, probably, adjusted with contemporary computing as having the scenes assembled.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Never read the memoir, but they say the movie is just like it. However, the print version is probably more entertaining. There's drama in the movie, just not very involving such as when Jake G goes nuts and almost shoots a fellow Marine, or when one of Jake's buddy's goes nuts when he is not allowed to fire a sniper shot at a distant Iraqi. I felt nothing during those scenes. This is a combo of old-fashioned Marine boot camp cliches and a somewhat updated take on what it was like to be a GI in the first Gulf War. It made me realize the U.S. has been wasting its time over there for almost 20 years now.
B00005JO5L|3.0|Cruising seemed like superficial cheap exploitation when it came out. But I decided to give it another chance when I found a used inexpensive copy recently with director's comments and all. I think now that it stands up reasonably well for the photography and Pacino's reasonably OK acting.It is interesting to get the commentary. What were they thinking?!     Also, I will take the director and producer's word for it that it is a one dimensional snapshot of a unique scene (a few leather bars) at a unique time (post-sexual revolution,pre-aids)and place (New York). They say they had to fly out from Hollywood to see if it was really true. OK, that is interesting, even though the film the scene quickly and leave. All told this is a rather three stars cheap thrills film at best.     It never gets into the heads of the leatherboys or the variety of their sex play and what their various practices do for them. The commentary implied that the leatherboys were only too happy to cooperate and be seen and filmed(surprise, surprise), and that was an interesting historical note that rings quite plausible.    Sorry, but it still seems after 30 years that Cruising was hastily knocked out to make some bucks and get some attention for those who made it. The dialogue is wooden. The characters are very thin and the mystery parts are gimmicky and even corny. Good lord! The killer is a mystery because he has no sperm in his semen. So what? And he is a nut case who has had problems relating to his father!! And they admit that they were switching voices on characters because they wanted to keep viewers disoriented and involved; but there was nothing artsy about it. What depth. LOL.     It is implied that Pacino is being lured into the mentality he is supposed to be impersonating, but there is no character development that makes that implication in anyway interesting artistically. They do keep you wondering, but why should you be very interested in whether this more or less one-dimensional cop is some kind of closet case? OK hint, hint, kinky sex can be intoxicating. I get it. But for me that is a problem -- why just hint, hint? Show some guts and talent and put it out there and explore it. Several other good films have done that with SM -- I can't remember them all. There was one with Eastwood, 9 1/2 Weeks, Belle Du Jour, The Night Porter, Love is the Devil, even Crimes of Passion -- and a fascinating French one that I have never seen on DVD, translates roughly The Prisoner. Too many more to remember.          Basically Cruising is just a kind of what's around the corner suspense flick with some leather and sweaty skin thrown in. Respectable photography, exotic setting, respectable acting by Pacino. OK for an evening of popcorn when you don't have any good other mysteries around.

B001EO2UKO|4.0|Dido's a daddy's girl. Her big loss, the death of father, is a big gain for listeners. The British songstress dug deep and came up with an introspective, late-night record which nevertheless crackles with melodic ideas and musical invention. Don't expect another \\"Thankyou\\" or \\"White Flag\\" around, though. Nothing may catch your attention immediately, but this is a polished, meaningful music that sounds best in your headphones and improves with repeated spins. From the deceitfully playful gem \\"Quiet Times\\" through meticulously arranged \\"Look No Further\\" and \\"The Day Before the Day\\" to sprawling, Celtic-tinged \\"Grafton Street\\" and hypnotic closer \\"Northern Skies\\", Dido invites you to explore her inner world. It is a brave, full, although not too optimistic record, which, nevertheless, the true fans of the singer should immediately embrace.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|I think at this point in time the 007 producers can dress up a monkey in tux, create a XxX or jason bourne or just a generic action thriller of a movie and voillah they will have a hit bond movie at their hands. Not only that the movie will out-gross all previous bond movies too no matter what the quality. This phenomanen started with Pierce Brosnan and seems to be continuing with Daniel Craig's Quantum of Solace too. I think the Bond franchise has become a little too secure atleast in terms of earning money and I hope all of this dont lead to big crash at the box-office at some point in the future.<br /><br />I just saw QoS and it felt like a copy of a jason bourne movie with all the jerky camera shots and mostly incomprehensible action sequences. It feels like the editing for the movie was done by someone with Attention deficit disorder syndrome. The movie openning car-chase and the subsquent chase of the MI-6 traitor required multiple reviewing for me to fully comprehend as to what really transpired. This kind of cut-throat editing plagues the whole movie unfortunately. They didnt even spare the iconic bond gun-barrel where it felt like they forced Daniel Craig to shoot the sequence when he was really in need of a dire bathroom break. Bond movies always had action sequences however they never felt rushed or edited in a frantic manner like in QoS. To me it felt like rather than spend time creating inovative, taut and tension filled action sequences (like in previous bond movies including Casino Royale) they opted for a less-cerebral fast & furious approach. No wonder the director of the movie is not returning for the third Daniel Craig entry as 007.<br /><br />Well in my view the movie as a whole doesnt feel like a bond movie rather just an generic action movie with the bond aura forced on it. There is no Q, no Moneypenny, no classy humor, no cool gadgets, no henchman, no high-end villian lair and yes a very weak villian. The villian Dominic Greene is perhaps one of the most non-meancing bond villian that I have seen for a while. The final fight between Bond and Greene was laughably bad. An effort was made to present Green as meancing but all that I saw was a villain shrieking loudly like a transvestite and not surprsingly bond doesnt even felt like dispatching him like he would of a more worthy, manly of a villian :)<br /><br />As far as Daniel Craig..well, I didnt see much evolution in him as Bond in the movie. He seems to be operating in the same rough & tough, sloppy persona that he adopted in Casino Royale breaking as well as messing things up and nowhere near the calibre of the bond that we knew prior to the reboot in CR. However only in the last sequence where he confronts Vesper's former lover that I saw the glimpses of the cold yet classy bond that we saw in Sean Connery and to some extent in Pierce Brosnan(and the reason I changed my rating from two star to three for this movie).<br /><br />Maybe Daniel Craig next bond entry will get to show us his much touted acting chops fleshing out the classic cinematic bond. Hopefully he will potray bond with the finesse, charm and sophistication that some of us are dying to see again. However, I'll be frank. I didnt like Daniel Craig selection of bond but since we are stuck with him now I will like him to succeed. I think he can do it provided the bond producers decides to produce a classic bond movie now rather than immitating the XxX or Jason Bourne franchise or some other more mainstream action franchise.-meancing bond villian that I have seen for a while.

B00005RHGL|5.0|Few fans of \\"Tombstone\\" may realize how close to reality this modern classic is.  Much of the success belongs to the original screenwriter and director Kevin Jarre.  The screenplay by Jarre was really fabulous and I only wish we could have seen the alternative version to be able to compare with what became the final version.  There remains an untold story about why he was removed as the director and replaced by a journeyman director who never before or since created anything memorable.      All that said this is a great piece of entertainment realized by a wonderful cast lead by Russell, Kilmer and an all-star supporting cast.  Enjoy it once, twice or many times as you'll always find something new to make it an exciting experience.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|found the movie quite good if you can get past the first 40 minute its good i dont know why when it comes to australian movies they seem to over do the australian way we talk and manerisams.scenery was great ,story line was good, and as usuall the two leading stars end up together. the aboriginal way of life was well brought out, and you couldnt wait for the bad guy to get his own. in all i enjoyed it.
0790744295|4.0|What's great about this movie is that it really shows Stephen King and George Romero's love for the pulp Horror comics of the 50's and 60's, such as William M. Gaines' EC Comics line of books. Romero tries very hard to film the shorts in both the style of the horror comics, and the comic format in general, using vivid lighting, split screens and panel formatting, as well as coaxing overdramatic acting from the cast. As campy as the film may feel, it's all intentional, and in homage to it's influences. I wouldn't go so far as to consider it comedy, though King and the cast do a wonderful job of injecting a health bit of sardonic humor into the mix, yet another quality of the film's influential roots. Watch for out of character roles for Ted Danson and Leslie Nielsen, and a starring role for Stephen King himself, campy and covered in moss.
B000FA5QEK|5.0|Five stars. A classic. A book with wisdom and foundation. Kiyosaki explains things that are easy to understand. This should be a starter business book. I highly recommend all of Kiyosaki's books. A must read.
B001QTMRXM|2.0|Being a massive fan of their first album, I literally counted down the days for this release knowing that it would be great.  Finally the day arrived and I got this album. Upon listening to it, I was absolutely shocked.    All inspiration from the first album was dead. The songs are flat with no energy in any of them. The choruses are weak and uninspired and it is actually hard to get to the end of the album without feeling frustrated by the utter lack of energy or anything of any excitement on this album.    It feels and sounds like they wrote this album in a massive hurry. The lyrics are empty and for some reason they decided to make all of the songs very weak and soft... There's nothing really fast or catchy on this release and the ballads are really flat and never quite sound the way they were probably intended to. Even Marco Hietala from Nightwish guest appearences can't save the flat and unispired songs he is forced to sing in.    I hope this album doesn't do very well and Delain are forced to make another brilliant album like their first one, which had energy, great music and inspiration. Maybe Delain should spend a little more time writing their next one.    I gave it two stars because after a month of trying hard to like it, about 2 of the songs have grown on me.. slightly.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|The only complaint I have is when trying to \\"drop-tune\\" my bass - it has a tough time picking up a low \\"D\\", but once it does, it tunes it in just fine.  Works great for that mid-gig quick check and tune-up!  I'd buy it again!
0385736002|5.0|I say worthy to follow Potter, as I have been hard to find a book that intrigues and engulfs me as much as Potter has done, and makes me want to read and re-read.  Michael Scott has done it!<br />I was recommended this book after Harry Potter ended and was told that if I liked Harry Potter (which I love!), then I would like this book.  I was hesitant to pick it up, as I was told the same thing about another recent popular book, and I ended up hating that one.<br />But I decided to pick up The Alchemyst a few weeks ago, and gave it a go, and really loved it!!  It's been the first book since Potter ended that has made me feel like it's one I want to read more than once and I'm anxious to find out what happens in the following books.  The Alchemyst starts off with a bang, and keeps going to the very end.  It's full of action and adventure, and I found most of the characters to be very likable.<br />I've heard quite a few people complain of Scott's need to constantly mention modern technology and names in the book, and they find it unnecessarily repetitive.  I didn't feel that way.  Considering the book is set in modern day San Fransisco, the mention of i-pods, laptops, cellphones, etc. fits with the book, and when they are mentioned more than once, it just fits.  It didn't feel overdone to me.<br />Scott is a very talented writer, and I am very much looking forward to the second book, The Magician, and the third coming this year, The Sorceress, and the following three after that.<br />And I think I'll be checking out other books by Michael Scott as well.<br /><br />Read The Alchemyst!!!
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I was as excited as everyone else, waiting for release day and paying for overnight shipping but after 4 weeks of use my g13 has been on a shelf gathering dust.    The device is solid and well constructed but poorly designed:     The LCD screen seems more of a gimmick, it is small and the viewing angle is locked so it diffcult to use since it is pushed away on the left side of your desk when you are playing game.     The Thumb stick has only 4 positions and offers very little resistance when pushed, it feel very sloppy and doesn't offer precise control.     The number of keys is great,a definite step up for my old Nostromo 52 but the keys are poorly arranged making some of the key very difficult to use if you are also using the thumbstick.  Also the position of the keys are staggered in each row so moving your finger forward one row can put to between two keys making you hunt and peck a bit.    The wrist rest seems out of place, when resting your wrist on the pad it is nearly impossible to hit the lowest row of keys without curling your hand into an unnatural state.      I am a die hard game controller users for 8 years and have always wanted something more than what my Nostromo offered but after giving the G13 a month to get used to I am happily back using my Nostromo 52.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I viewed the Magnolia Home Entertainment DVD publication also and never saw it in the Theaters.  But I loved this \\"sleeper\\" of a movie.<br /><br />If you want lots of CGI stuff where there's less acting and more special effects, then this movie is not for you.  But if you prefer drama where the story-telling & the actors draw you in, then this is your movie.  That is why I gave this Swedish ghost/vampire movie a five-star rating.  As cold as this movie was set-in, the actors who played Oskar and Eli really warmed my heart.  The director said it took a year to find these actors - glad he didn't lower his standards and chose to wait until he got the right actors.<br /><br />Too bad MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT that put out the DVD didn't have these high standards.<br /><br />What confused me was when I hit PLAY to watch the movie, the Swedish actors were speaking in unnatural sounding English and I could tell it was dubbed because the lips did not move in-synch w/what I was hearing!  (Which is why I prefer to hear the actor's own voice and read subtitles at the bottom)<br /><br />Glad I went back to the SET UP menu to select the \\"subtitled\\" version.<br /><br />But I see from the other reviewers that these subtitles were NOT what was shown in the theaters.<br />If that is true, then how disappointing.  And even more disappointing that a stingy and unworthy production company - MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT did not consider this gem of a movie deserving of the exra cost of the original subtitles.<br /><br />Even more insulting is that they did not consider us DVD watchers worthy of what the theater goers got.<br /><br />To:  MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT - you are now on my \\"DO NOT BUY\\" list.
B00005AG7K|4.0|The video and sound quality are really bad on this DVD, but it is better than nothing. I am a HUGE Beatles fan, but I have to say, that this is probably the weirdest movie I have ever seen in my life. After watching it, I can't tell you what the plot is, but it does have some interesting videos. I guess the idea of this movie is that a bus takes people through their different dreams. If that isn't what it's about, I told you I didn't understand it. lol.<br /><br />The two highlights of the film are the two segments for \\"The Fool On the Hill\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\". Those two things are reason enough to buy the movie. Paul looks really cool standing in front of the piano playing the bass during Walrus. Strangely enough, John and George are hardly on the movie. It is mainly just Paul and Ringo.
B000Q8QHK8|4.0|One of my favorite movies, and it looks great on Blu-ray. Book includes lots of extra information. My only problem with it is that it doesn't come in a regular blu-ray case so it doesn't fit well with the rest of my movies.
B000WX3B5Q|5.0|I am very satisfied with the Dirty Dancing 20th Anniversary Collector Pack I received. It came in a very timely manner. It came in perfect condition. Very Very Very satisisfied.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video after reading alot of positive reviews and to be truthful the bad reviews have to do with the music being \\"off\\" and Jillian being \\"mean\\"- I love the video- after running for 2 months in the morning I wanted to add to my workout in the evening without going to the gym. Day 4 and my legs are definitely feeling a burn and I am only on level 1!! Eventhough I am beat after this workout I have had soo much energy the day after! Great video! Great price!
B001R4MEYS|4.0|Crack The Skye is one of there best. I liked it as much as Leviathan and Blood Mountain, my other two favorites. I am really digging their newer stuff. Their music is getting deeper with each album, and this ones no exception. I read people in other reviews referencing King Crimson and I can totally hear their influence in Mastodon. I can also hear a Tool influence and maybe some Neurosis is in there too. Good stuff. I like how they added a keyboard player for this album. Nice touch. And Brent Hinds threw in a little banjo, an instrument which is somehow absent from most of the rest of my metal collection. This album was fantastic start to finish, but one of my favorite songs was the title track \\"Crack The Skye\\", which has such intensity and gravity that it draws me in every time I hear it. My other favorite: \\"Oblivion\\", the first track, starts menacingly slow and unleashes suddenly and fiercely. Those two songs are my favorites lyrically as well. I also love the DVDs that come with their albums. They give real insight into who you're listening to and allow the music to be appreciated on other levels. I think the coolest thing about this band is how their music makes me think. It is SO not conventional metal where you feel like your getting dumber listening to it. If your listening to a bunch of Korn and Disturbed, this music might make your brain hurt. But for the intelligent, open-minded metal head, definitely check this one out.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I already have a nice pair of headphones with better sound quality than these, but they are the big ones that cover up half your head. If you take those to the gym or go out for a run with them, not only do you look ridiculous, but the sweat just pools up and soaks them. So I was in the market for some earbuds, but I knew from experience that earbuds keep falling out and are a royal pain. These are the perfect design, and once you fit them to your head, they won't fall out, and they're so light that you barely even notice them. In short, they are perfect.    I did read the below reviews about how these headphones don't last very long before I bought them. There are two possibilities: one is that one of the internal mechanisms just falls apart, in which case there is nothing to be done. The more likely possibility is that repeated tugging of the wire eventually loosens it from the delicate structure of the headphone. So I simply tied the wire around the headphone and taped it in such a way that even if you tug at the wire, there is no pressure and no possibility of tugging the wire loose from the earbud. I'll let you know how long these headphones last - if they don't last long, then there must be a mechanical problem with these and I'd suggest not buying them.    UPDATE: I loved these headphones, they really had the perfect design. I had read some earlier reviews about them not lasting. My theory was that constant tugging of the wires would eventually pull them loose from the internal speaker, so to prevent that I taped the wires down on the first day. Despite this, they lasted 3 months until the sound in the left earbud started going on and off, and then finally died, proving that it is simply a cheap internal mechanism that was the problem, not any sort of wear and tear. There are enough similar cases as mine that should justify Sony discontinuing this product and coming out with a model that has some decent durability. If I could change my rating I would give it1 star.
B0016H969C|5.0|The island is Hawaii, a temporary paradise for many women; the man on the island is Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) also a temporary paradise. Unwilling to commit to anyone or thing but his boat.<br /><br />Then he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). After an accident she has lost her ability to transfer short term memory to log term. So every day since the accident is erased and she starts over. So the relationship starts from a bet and ends up who knows where if any where.<br /><br />At first it the film looks just like any old Adam Sandler film that only Sandlerights could like. Then it settles down to cute. Then it settles down to meaningful, finally you forget that you are watching a movie and then it is over. Drew excels in this movie and is very believable.<br /><br />The film would have come off a lot better with out all the Sandleright left over characters that contributed zip to the story. The two that came to mind is the brother Doug Whitmore (Sean Astin). And the what-not Alexa (Lusia Strus.)<br /><br />Another warning is that the version of DVD had a bunch of coming attractions after paying good money I do not need forced attractions at the beginning. Wait for a better release or just press the \\"Menu\\" button to escape them.
B00005N9CV|5.0|We have been listening to Diana Krall for a long time now, and this is probably our favorite album. You can't go wrong getting this one!
0140143505|5.0|Like many people I saw a movie first. Naturally due to media constraints, you expect certain amount of the book to be homogenized. So I wanted to read what was missing. To my amazement very little was missing or modified. I don't normally read this sort of book. So I was surprised at finding myself wanting more when it finished.<br /><br />Also until I read the book I did not realize that Charing Cross Road was a real place. The whole book is based on a collection of correspondence between Helene Hanff, an avid book reader, and Frank Doel an agent for British bookseller.<br /><br />My wife has taken this one step further and is collecting all the books that were mentioned in the correspondence. Some of these books appear to have been reprinted due to this publication.<br /><br />If you can find it there is a book called \\"The Library of Helene Hanff.\\"<br />I wonder what became of all the other people described in the correspondents after the book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CX8N 84 Charing Cross Road]]
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies so I had to own it.  I've loaned it out to friends and they feel the same way.  Glad to have it in my collection.
B00127RAJY|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout!!  It is awesome.  It is quick, so it works for those of us who are busy with life in general (who isn't??).  It also flies by as you workout.  It is over before you know it.  You do feel it the next day (or that same night).  Jillian is a great trainer; she really builds you up and makes you believe that you CAN do it.<br />Her method is done in circuts which consists of 3 min of strength (pushups, weights, lunges, etc), 2 min of cardio (jumping jacks, squat with punches, butt kicks) and 1 min of abs.  You do this for 3 circuits each.  There is NO resting; you may be able to stop and take a quick sip of water but as Jillian says, \\"you don't get to do a 20 minute workout and take a break\\" if you expect results you have to push yourself.<br />In just a week, I have lost 4 pounds doing this workout.<br />There are 3 different levels to this.  Each gets progressively more difficult.  I tried Level 2 and did okay but I am sticking with 1 for awhile longer :)<br />My only complaint about this DVD is there is no way to bypass all the fluff and just get right to the main menu.  My only suggestion would be to allow that but otherwise this DVD kicks butt!!!!  Totally recommend it!
B001JE25ZE|5.0|this was so different from the movie that you can still respect the 2 as seperate but equal. i really enjoyed all teh short stoires and had a good time readign this book, it was hard to put down

0756404746|5.0|Badgers, we don't need no stinking badgers.  (adapted from B Traven's 1927 novel).  Who would expect to see a line like that in a novel like this?  I am a book reader not a book critic.  I read pretty fast and loved having the same book in my hands for more than a couple of days.  Makes you feel like you are really getting your monies worth.     To me the world was very rich.  Not having everything explained, in my mind, means that the world has been created in a detail that I hope the author can't even remember.  I think the book is the right mix of classic flair with the psyche of a modern person.  This is the first book I read twice in the same month. I felt like I was reading an old story for the first time.  With the exception that old stories seldom surprise you; the formula being re-written, staged and commercialized long before any of us were ever born.  I experienced an old story from the eyes of someone who has read older stories (namely Kvothe), and who has wisdom to share, but is likened to a 20 year old punk kid.      If there is never a sequel, I am happy to have read what I have.  The story leaves you with all the information spelled out, implied, inferred to make ones own imaginative close.  Of course the writing is kind of like crack.  After being carried away, you're left wanting to go back into the authors world where he will guide you again.
0385340990|2.0|The lead character comes off as vacuous and childish, spoilt in fact.  Consider this: it is January 1946, WW 2 just ended a mere eight months earlier in Europe - and all this air-headed narrator can do is fret about new dresses, a mysterious suitor and her book tour. To the millions of starved, displaced and traumatized people, this tale of privilege would be a slap in the face. The whole potato peel pie society thing reads like a plot device to me to take us to Guernsey, ensure the airhead finds a husband and impart some of the horrors of war the poor farmers of Guernsey endured.<br />The book's success speaks to the apparent need for entertainment in fairy tale fashion. It's a sappy love story, predictable, and shallow.
B001QTMRXM|4.0|I originally did one review of this when it first came out, but since then decided to make a new review of this. I will first say that their first release Lucidity was a masterpiece and one of my favorite CDs. It had everything: the music, the choruses, the singing and the lyrics. Basically the whole nine yards. I was first taken aback by April Rain, because it did not sound too symphonic metal to me. The choruses were taken out, and there were no extra vocals except for Marco's from Nightwish. At first listen I thought, what the heck? It just didn't appeal to me. I put it on my Ipod either way, and after listening a few more times, I realized it isn't that bad. There are a few songs that personally I don't like on here, no way any amount of listening can make me like it, such as \\"On the Other Side\\" or \\"Control the Storm\\". That song is really annoying, mostly because it is flat and repetitive referring to \\"On the Other Side\\". \\"Control the Storm\\" I think was ruined by the beginning of the song, because I didn't like the singing, but liked it in the middle. I either way can't seem to like those two songs. However, songs that do resemble their original selves are \\"April Rain\\" and \\"Stay Forever\\". The reason I grew to appreciate this CD is the guitar playing, which is just phenomenal, it really is. Their knowledge of their instruments is just wonderful and I don't really care about the lyrics, as much as the music itself. The lyrics are nothing special, but I can't get enough of the guitar playing. I really think this could've been appreciated more if this was their first CD and fans didn't have Lucidity to compare it to. However, I think about the fact that Lucidity wasn't just Delain, but a number of other people. Considering this is their first real release on their own, it's pretty darn good. I say the same about Nightwish's first Cd, the vocals were terrible, but their second release was awesome. I think they should've used the growling more, it really could've brought more to the release, but maybe they will learn from this and through this \\"experiment\\" come out with an awesome release once again.ght more to the release, but maybe they will learn from this and through this \\"experiment\\" come out with an awesome release once again.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|I saw this movie in the theatre, and I don't recall having such a hard time reading the subtitles.    I'm not exaggerating when I say reading text in this movie is equivalent to reading 6-point font.  Much of the 1st half of the movie uses subtitles and all of the gameshow questions are WAY too hard to read.  Compounding the problem are the colored backgrounds on which the subtitles appear, some of which blend in with the background.  Not to mention that you need to be a speed-reader to read all of the subtitles before they disappear from the screen.    The story is great, the movie is great, but the makers of this DVD really dropped the ball.  It's unfortunate.  Not recommended.
B000022TSY|5.0|Wandering and Wonder over Worrying and War<br /><br />When it came time to review this movie, I could not do it. That is, I could not do it without also reviewing it within the context of two other movies that I had just recently watched because all three of them have such a similar theme. In fact, they all have so many things in common that I decided to review all three of them at the same time as a medley, something I have never done before but which seems called for. If you'll follow me, you'll see what I'm getting at.<br /><br />I was recently talking to a friend of mine at work when we happened to run into each other in the men's room. He asked me if I had ever seen the film EASY RIDER, and I answered that it was interesting and very synchronistic that he should ask me that because it was the last movie that I had just enjoyed watching at home on DVD. I said, \\"Man, you know, I was JUST watching that last week! I LOVE that movie. I wanted to get the deluxe edition but I could not find it anywhere, so I just picked up the regular one at GIANT (the local supermarket) in the bargain bin for nine bucks.\\" My friend, Ian, then said, \\"I only own three movies in my collection: EASY RIDER, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, and INTO THE WILD. Have you seen the other two?\\" I answered that I had not and that I had always wanted to see the both of them, to which he quickly replied, \\"You can borrow mine, man. I'll bring them in tomorrow for you.\\" \\"Hey, thanks a lot, man,\\" I replied with gratitude, and we both went back to work.<br /><br />I watched both of those movies Ian let me borrow over the weekend of April 10, 11, 12, 2009 right on the heels of having watched EASY RIDER just weeks before. The amazing amount of similar themes running through all three of these films is impressive. All three of these movies express a preference for wandering and wonder over worrying and war for the characters involved. Each of them seems to express the plight of characters dealing with their own, personal rejection of the reality of petty worries and war (The Iliad), and choosing, instead, a life of venturing forth into the unknown world of wonder and wandering (The Odyssey). The characters in all three of these movies depict a great love of adventure and a great joy of being out on the open road. Jack Kerouac, author of ON THE ROAD, would have loved all three of these fantastic films, especially INTO THE WILD, as he was a great lover of the books of Jack London. Also, they all have a great, cinematic and panoramic, wide-angle viewpoint of the world. Watching these films gets one out of one's own head and puts one right into the world of the film. The scenery in all three films is stunning and absolutely breathtaking. The viewer is immediately projected \\"into the wild\\" world (if you will) of the characters. It's intense! You get taken along for a ride that goes not only far and wide out into the world but, also, deep into the hidden spaces of one's heart and mind. All three of these films will make you think about your own life in particular as well as the greater meaning of life in general. They are deep, psychological films that demand conscious labor of intellectual thought and emotional soul searching on the part of the viewer. You get taken for a ride, but it is definitely NOT \\"easy!\\"<br /><br />In my case, watching these films - especially INTO THE WILD - brought me back to a time when I myself, like the character in the movie, was 22 years old and questioning my place in life: what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, where I wanted to live, how I wanted to live, and who I wanted to be with. I realize now that I was seeking a sense of place to fit in and a community to be a part of that I felt comfortable in more than merely trying to \\"find myself.\\" But understanding that when you are going through it is another thing altogether. Watching INTO THE WILD hits home on all these points and more! I remember having just seen The Grateful Dead in concert in Hartford, Connecticut with my good buddy, Jimmy, in May of 1997, and feeling like I wanted to just bust loose of all of the constraints of society that seemed to be holding me back from my true calling - whatever that was. I was feeling like a wild animal caught in a trap, and I wanted to be free. I had dropped out of college almost two years before, and I had been working at two jobs back in my hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. That summer, like the kid in INTO THE WILD, I planned to get away and I bought a bunch of camping equipment, quit my jobs, and hit the road. I first went up north to New York State to camp out with some members of the Neo-American Church in the region of Cranberry Lake. When I decided not to stay and started to trek back out to head off somewhere else, my glasses fell off of my head and into the muddy, swampy muck I had found myself in along the water's edge. It took me an hour to find them. I realized then and there that I was handicapped for this kind of wandering around with all this heavy weight on my shoulders. So, I hitchhiked back home, feeling just as lost and just as confused as ever. I continued to read hundreds of books to find an answer to my quest for authenticity and community, only to learn that I was just making the book stores richer. I tried yet again to break away that fall, and went back to western Massachusetts to see if I could find work out near my friends who were still going to school there. I could relate to the scene in INTO THE WILD where Christopher writes in his diary of all freedom seekers in the history of this country seeking it by going out \\"west.\\" Whenever I would hear the lyrics to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" by Led Zeppelin, when Robert Plants sings: \\"There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving,\\" I would feel an urge inside me to head out west before I got too old to do it. Indeed, Christopher tries to inspire the old man who wanted to adopt him in the film (Hank Holbrook) to do the very same thing! After spending two weeks looking for work with no luck, and deciding not to move into a deserted cabin or tepee built out in the back woods of a local farmer's land because of the weather and being all alone, I left the generous hospitality of my good friend, Greg, and once more headed back home to find my way that way. Years later, after working an assortment of odd jobs over many years, I eventually ended up opening my own health food store in the summer of 1989 after deciding not to buy some land way up north in Maine or Vermont near the Canadian border - the only place I could afford land at the time. I concluded that if I bought the land, I would never be able to later do the health food store (one of the last business bastions left of hippiedom in corporate America), but if I opened the store and did not like it, I could always cash-in and then go off and buy some land somewhere out in the woods. I was always talking about \\"moving to Alaska,\\" to live in freedom and stuff like that - so I can really relate to what Christopher McCandless (the real character and promising young man of the true story of INTO THE WILD) was going through. I felt like I was looking at myself re-living my past. He took the path I almost took. I turned back. He never got the chance to. God only knows where he would be today if he had lived to tell his story!<br /><br />I have a cousin who actually did the same thing once. He was even younger than me when he did it. My cousin, George, actually made it all the way to Alaska, and then Hawaii, and then Europe as well. He went all around the world. When he reached Alaska, he hooked up with some of his old friends from Dunstable, Massachusetts who had also moved up there to make money working on the pipeline and on fishing boats. He found work up there for a while, too, just like some of the characters in these three films. They worked along the way to help to make their journey. George ended up finding his friend, Jim Lavrakas, a famous photographer today for the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. Ernesto and Alberto worked in a Leper Colony for a while in Peru. Christopher McCandless worked out in the fields cutting grain for a while to help pay his way. I have a good friend named Phil who actually did do what I had once intended on doing myself. He worked his butt off for years, saved a bunch of cash, and bought himself 25 acres of land up in Maine where he lives off the grid out in the woods as an independent, organic farmer and orchard grower. He says he did it to be able to live like a free man out on the land away from all of the social evils and urban ugliness of the city. He also wanted to be free and independent of his family, like Chris in INTO THE WILD. He did it. I guess I was too much of a homebody and a Hobbit to live alone all by myself out in the woods somewhere where no one knew me. It takes courage to live alone like Thoreau out in the wild. You need guts to do this kind of stuff. I know that one reason why I returned back home from my meager attempt at wandering through the woods was that I really missed music. I am a musician. There is no way to jam with other people and enjoy music and dance when you live alone out in the woods. It is impossible. Nevertheless, till this day, the TV series that ran in the early nineties about life up in a small town called Cicely, Alaska - NORTHERN EXPOSURE - is still my all-time, favorite television program. It had colorful characters. I guess some romantic ideas die hard.<br /><br />It takes a lot of courage to leave the comforts of home and cut loose from all of your support system of family and friends and to just take off and hit the road to God knows where. It's a \\"wild world,\\" as Cat Stevens sings, and you've got to take care. All three films show the major characters getting into trouble out on the road. \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" (the vagabond name Christopher McCandless chose for himself after cutting up his social security card and all of his other documents of official identity before he hit the road) got the hell beaten out of him by railroad man one dark night when he was hobo-ing it out on a train. Both Ernesto and Alberto got chased out of town by a jealous husband and all of his hometown buddies after one of his friends saw the husband's wife flirting and dancing with Ernesto on the dance floor. In EASY RIDER, Peter Fonda's motorcycle gets a flat tire (the least of their troubles) just like Alberto's motorcycle kept on breaking down and eventually dying on them in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES. These young characters in all of these films were not exactly experiencing the metaphysical revelations of Robert M. Pirsig in his masterful ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE - at least not at first - but they certainly all ran into a lot of trouble. The spiritual revelations began to come to them later, along the way. Indeed, all the major characters have major transformational experiences in one way or another as a result of their personal quests and traveling adventures. The road changes you. Also, there are many forks in the road, as Neil Young most recently informs us. It's hard to decide sometimes which way to go.<br /><br />This changing of one's name seems to be a prerequisite to being a beat, road warrior out on the highway. Not only does Christopher change his name, but in EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda changes his name from Wyatt to \\"Captain America,\\" and the character played by Dennis Hopper begins to call himself \\"Billy the Kid,\\" both taking on the persona of Wild West characters of historical, American lore. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto begins to be called \\"Fuser\\" and \\"Che\\" (the name that stuck with him for the rest of his life!) while his buddy, Alberto, begins to be called \\"Mial.\\" It's almost as if one has to shed one's former identity as a snake sheds its skin in order to take on one's true identity - and this requires the taking on of a newname, one which reflects one's true identity.<br /><br />Another thing these movies have in common is the pairing of a more sensitive and reflective character with a more rough & tumble and more aggressive character. In the case of INTO THE WILD, the character - who is very sensitive and contemplative - is paired up against the people he meets on his journey along the way, many of which tend to be less graceful and sensitive as he is. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto is very much like the character that Peter Fonda portrays in EASY RIDER, and Alberto is, also, very much like the character that Dennis Hopper plays. The likeness is astounding. Ernesto, like Christopher McCandless in INTO THE WILD, is always writing in his journal and thinking about the deeper meaning of things. Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper. One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish. They are like The Odd Couple - but riding on motorcycles!<br /><br />Another theme that runs deeply through all three films is the powerful and destiny changing power of rivers! The awesome power of the natural world, exemplified by a river in all three films, is undeniable. You can't miss it. In the case of INTO THE WILD, it was the raging force of the rolling river rapids that prevented Chris from crossing back in the spring to the other side from which he came. It was too wide, too deep, and with waters gushing too fast to cross. He was forced to go back to the bus where he had been living all winter. It ultimately decided his destiny for him. He almost drowned in it on his attempt to cross it. In the end, it was because of the river which separated him from all that he cared about in his past that sealed his fate. The poison plants he mistakenly ingested while he was starving did not help, either. In the case of EASY RIDER, it was along the river that both characters met their fate, and got blown away by a couple of backwoods rednecks out for a spin in their pickup truck. Maybe it was their bad karma? Still, the injustice of the moment is profound, as one watches Peter Fonda's motorcycle go up in flames while Roger McGuinn of the Byrds sings Bob Dylan's song, \\"The Ballad of Easy Rider,' as the lyrics \\"flow, river flow\\" repeat throughout the song like the flowing river itself. In the case of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, it was along the river where Ernesto found himself, in the sense of his true calling, while administering to a sick, leper woman who made him realize that there are other ways to heal people - and prevent them from getting sick in the first place - than by being a physician to individuals. Society itself can be in great need of a social healer. The river separated the sick lepers on one side from the hospital care workers on the other. Ernesto refused to wear the superstitious rubber gloves on his hands from the very first day. One night, on his birthday, he had a spiritual rebirth when he took a rite of passage and dove into the river, swimming all the way across to the other side where all of the sick lepers along the shore encouraged him on. On doing so, he once and for all proved to his friend, Alberto, that he was no wimp but a true man with determination and courage. He showed an inner strength that inspired all of those around him. How they cheered his victory over the river! He would not be stopped by anything. That came later, when he was \\"Che Guevara\\" the revolutionary in Bolivia, when the sneaky CIA killed him. His nobility still shines brightly! Like \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" in INTO THE WILD and \\"Captain America\\" in EASY RIDER, he had a huge heart and a great soul. He truly cared about people.<br /><br />Another theme that runs through all three of these films is a sense of loneliness. The number on the bus that Christopher lived in depicted inINTO THE WILD is number 142. Numerologically, this adds up to a number 7 - the number of solitude and loneliness. In EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda ends up all alone in a New Orleans cemetery, perched atop a statue of the Virgin Mary while he's peaking on LSD in a death-rebirth acid trip-induced mystical experience, screaming out in tears to his real dead mother and asking her why she killed herself, leaving him all alone. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, you find Ernesto feeling more and more isolated from his friend and feeling lonely after he receives the \\"Dear John letter\\" from his girlfriend who they had visited just weeks before. His sense of loss and isolation is profound. His shattered dream of a romantic relationship with this woman cleared the path to true enlightenment for him. The viewer can sense this profoundly at the end of the film when you see him saying goodbye to Alberto before getting alone onto the aeroplane waiting to take him away toward his ultimate destiny. All three of these characters experienced major spiritual transformations along their journey out on the road of life far away from home.<br /><br />One last characteristic that all the major characters in these three films have in common is their persistent, uncompromising, diligently determined drive to all reach their goals - for good or ill. They are all absolutely hell-bent on following their dreams and dancing to the beat of their own drummer. They all choose freedom over security. Ironically, they all consciously choose the path of Odysseus - of wandering - but they all end up reaching the same end as Achilles - of dying young in a flame of glory. That's fate. The ancient Greeks called her \\"Moira.\\" Even the Gods themselves are at her mercy. In EASY RIDER, Billy was always pushing his more contemplative partner onward toward their goal of reaching the famous whorehouse in New Orleans. It almost seems as if the only reason why \\"Captain America\\" wanted to also go was to pay his respects to their long lost companion, George (played dramatically by Jack Nicholson) the attorney who got them out of jail, whose idea it was to go there in the first place. Peter Fonda's character was loyal to a fault when it came to his friendship with Billy. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Alberto (the horny rascal) was always pushing Ernesto to go out of his spiritual centeredness and jump into the dangerous fray of the more seedy side of life. Finally, in INTO THE WILD, it was \\"Alexander Supertramp's\\" intense reaction to the constant, dysfunctional fighting between his mother and father back home that pushed him on and outward to not ever end up in the same situation himself. We must also acknowledge that all of these characters were young and anxious to sew some of their wild oats, a natural condition of youth everywhere.<br /><br />One might ask what would have happened to all of these characters if they had changed their minds along the way of their respective, individual quests and decided, instead, to stay with companions they had met along the way, or turn back and go back home? I remember when I first saw EASY RIDER as a kid, when it first came out in 1969. We all went to the movie theater as a group and all watched it together, getting a kick out of hippies smoking real pot, live and on camera. Some of us thought they should have stayed in the hippie commune. If they had lived, would they have stayed together? Would \\"Captain America\\" have gone back to be with those people? The same goes for INTO THE WILD. What would have happened if Christopher had stayed longer with his hippie friends in the trailer park? What would have happened if he left Alaska before the ice melted and went back to be with the girl he sang with who was a musician and who clearly cared for him? In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, what would have happened if Ernesto changed his mind and went back to be with his girlfriend? Would there have ever been a Cuban revolution? It's interesting thatthe characters in EASY RIDER had the goal of reaching a whorehouse, and the character in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES - \\"Che Guevara\\" - was instrumental in ridding CUBA of all of its underworld-controlled and corrupt, exploitative whorehouses and gambling casinos! Who woulda thunk that - coming from this bookish, sensitive doctor!<br /><br />Ultimately, what one comes away learning from all three of these films, and which is expressed at the end of INTO THE WILD by Christopher McCandless, is that what really matters most in life is true happiness and peace of mind, and that the only way to be truly fulfilled and happy is by sharing it with other people. Happiness can only be found in community. To reach a real community where you can truly be yourself and live an authentic life is a real blessing. Billy and \\"Captain America\\" never got the chance. Christopher McCandless learned this truth - but too late to live it. Only Ernesto reached the higher octave of societal existence and sustained a life on a higher level of community involvement through his unbending will and indomitable spirit to \\"work for the good of the whole,\\" as my friend, Al, likes to say. He was true to himself; that is, he took what he learned from being alone on the road away from home and brought it back with him to transform society back home and, ultimately, everywhere. He may have fallen off that damn, rickety, old motorcycle one too many times to be content with the trust in machinery and mechanical living to the extent that most people allow themselves to fall prey to. He found true freedom from the fold by transforming the fold itself, and it was life on the road that transformed him.<br /><br />Thoreau said it best: \\"In wilderness is the preservation of the world.\\" Wandering through the wilderness is dynamically healing!<br /><br />...

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Loved this season, loved this product, it was in perfect condition and I loved watching every episode
B000ZN802W|5.0|Wandering and Wonder over Worrying and War<br /><br />When it came time to review this movie, I could not do it. That is, I could not do it without also reviewing it within the context of two other movies that I had just recently watched because all three of them have such a similar theme. In fact, they all have so many things in common that I decided to review all three of them at the same time as a medley, something I have never done before but which seems called for. If you'll follow me, you'll see what I'm getting at.<br /><br />I was recently talking to a friend of mine at work when we happened to run into each other in the men's room. He asked me if I had ever seen the film EASY RIDER, and I answered that it was interesting and very synchronistic that he should ask me that because it was the last movie that I had just enjoyed watching at home on DVD. I said, \\"Man, you know, I was JUST watching that last week! I LOVE that movie. I wanted to get the deluxe edition but I could not find it anywhere, so I just picked up the regular one at GIANT (the local supermarket) in the bargain bin for nine bucks.\\" My friend, Ian, then said, \\"I only own three movies in my collection: EASY RIDER, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, and INTO THE WILD. Have you seen the other two?\\" I answered that I had not and that I had always wanted to see the both of them, to which he quickly replied, \\"You can borrow mine, man. I'll bring them in tomorrow for you.\\" \\"Hey, thanks a lot, man,\\" I replied with gratitude, and we both went back to work.<br /><br />I watched both of those movies Ian let me borrow over the weekend of April 10, 11, 12, 2009 right on the heels of having watched EASY RIDER just weeks before. The amazing amount of similar themes running through all three of these films is impressive. All three of these movies express a preference for wandering and wonder over worrying and war for the characters involved. Each of them seems to express the plight of characters dealing with their own, personal rejection of the reality of petty worries and war (The Iliad), and choosing, instead, a life of venturing forth into the unknown world of wonder and wandering (The Odyssey). The characters in all three of these movies depict a great love of adventure and a great joy of being out on the open road. Jack Kerouac, author of ON THE ROAD, would have loved all three of these fantastic films, especially INTO THE WILD, as he was a great lover of the books of Jack London. Also, they all have a great, cinematic and panoramic, wide-angle viewpoint of the world. Watching these films gets one out of one's own head and puts one right into the world of the film. The scenery in all three films is stunning and absolutely breathtaking. The viewer is immediately projected \\"into the wild\\" world (if you will) of the characters. It's intense! You get taken along for a ride that goes not only far and wide out into the world but, also, deep into the hidden spaces of one's heart and mind. All three of these films will make you think about your own life in particular as well as the greater meaning of life in general. They are deep, psychological films that demand conscious labor of intellectual thought and emotional soul searching on the part of the viewer. You get taken for a ride, but it is definitely NOT \\"easy!\\"<br /><br />In my case, watching these films - especially INTO THE WILD - brought me back to a time when I myself, like the character in the movie, was 22 years old and questioning my place in life: what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, where I wanted to live, how I wanted to live, and who I wanted to be with. I realize now that I was seeking a sense of place to fit in and a community to be a part of that I felt comfortable in more than merely trying to \\"find myself.\\" But understanding that when you are going through it is another thing altogether. Watching INTO THE WILD hits home on all these points and more! I remember having just seen The Grateful Dead in concert in Hartford, Connecticut with my good buddy, Jimmy, in May of 1997, and feeling like I wanted to just bust loose of all of the constraints of society that seemed to be holding me back from my true calling - whatever that was. I was feeling like a wild animal caught in a trap, and I wanted to be free. I had dropped out of college almost two years before, and I had been working at two jobs back in my hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. That summer, like the kid in INTO THE WILD, I planned to get away and I bought a bunch of camping equipment, quit my jobs, and hit the road. I first went up north to New York State to camp out with some members of the Neo-American Church in the region of Cranberry Lake. When I decided not to stay and started to trek back out to head off somewhere else, my glasses fell off of my head and into the muddy, swampy muck I had found myself in along the water's edge. It took me an hour to find them. I realized then and there that I was handicapped for this kind of wandering around with all this heavy weight on my shoulders. So, I hitchhiked back home, feeling just as lost and just as confused as ever. I continued to read hundreds of books to find an answer to my quest for authenticity and community, only to learn that I was just making the book stores richer. I tried yet again to break away that fall, and went back to western Massachusetts to see if I could find work out near my friends who were still going to school there. I could relate to the scene in INTO THE WILD where Christopher writes in his diary of all freedom seekers in the history of this country seeking it by going out \\"west.\\" Whenever I would hear the lyrics to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" by Led Zeppelin, when Robert Plants sings: \\"There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving,\\" I would feel an urge inside me to head out west before I got too old to do it. Indeed, Christopher tries to inspire the old man who wanted to adopt him in the film (Hank Holbrook) to do the very same thing! After spending two weeks looking for work with no luck, and deciding not to move into a deserted cabin or tepee built out in the back woods of a local farmer's land because of the weather and being all alone, I left the generous hospitality of my good friend, Greg, and once more headed back home to find my way that way. Years later, after working an assortment of odd jobs over many years, I eventually ended up opening my own health food store in the summer of 1989 after deciding not to buy some land way up north in Maine or Vermont near the Canadian border - the only place I could afford land at the time. I concluded that if I bought the land, I would never be able to later do the health food store (one of the last business bastions left of hippiedom in corporate America), but if I opened the store and did not like it, I could always cash-in and then go off and buy some land somewhere out in the woods. I was always talking about \\"moving to Alaska,\\" to live in freedom and stuff like that - so I can really relate to what Christopher McCandless (the real character and promising young man of the true story of INTO THE WILD) was going through. I felt like I was looking at myself re-living my past. He took the path I almost took. I turned back. He never got the chance to. God only knows where he would be today if he had lived to tell his story!<br /><br />I have a cousin who actually did the same thing once. He was even younger than me when he did it. My cousin, George, actually made it all the way to Alaska, and then Hawaii, and then Europe as well. He went all around the world. When he reached Alaska, he hooked up with some of his old friends from Dunstable, Massachusetts who had also moved up there to make money working on the pipeline and on fishing boats. He found work up there for a while, too, just like some of the characters in these three films. They worked along the way to help to make their journey. George ended up finding his friend, Jim Lavrakas, a famous photographer today for the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. Ernesto and Alberto worked in a Leper Colony for a while in Peru. Christopher McCandless worked out in the fields cutting grain for a while to help pay his way. I have a good friend named Phil who actually did do what I had once intended on doing myself. He worked his butt off for years, saved a bunch of cash, and bought himself 25 acres of land up in Maine where he lives off the grid out in the woods as an independent, organic farmer and orchard grower. He says he did it to be able to live like a free man out on the land away from all of the social evils and urban ugliness of the city. He also wanted to be free and independent of his family, like Chris in INTO THE WILD. He did it. I guess I was too much of a homebody and a Hobbit to live alone all by myself out in the woods somewhere where no one knew me. It takes courage to live alone like Thoreau out in the wild. You need guts to do this kind of stuff. I know that one reason why I returned back home from my meager attempt at wandering through the woods was that I really missed music. I am a musician. There is no way to jam with other people and enjoy music and dance when you live alone out in the woods. It is impossible. Nevertheless, till this day, the TV series that ran in the early nineties about life up in a small town called Cicely, Alaska - NORTHERN EXPOSURE - is still my all-time, favorite television program. It had colorful characters. I guess some romantic ideas die hard.<br /><br />It takes a lot of courage to leave the comforts of home and cut loose from all of your support system of family and friends and to just take off and hit the road to God knows where. It's a \\"wild world,\\" as Cat Stevens sings, and you've got to take care. All three films show the major characters getting into trouble out on the road. \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" (the vagabond name Christopher McCandless chose for himself after cutting up his social security card and all of his other documents of official identity before he hit the road) got the hell beaten out of him by railroad man one dark night when he was hobo-ing it out on a train. Both Ernesto and Alberto got chased out of town by a jealous husband and all of his hometown buddies after one of his friends saw the husband's wife flirting and dancing with Ernesto on the dance floor. In EASY RIDER, Peter Fonda's motorcycle gets a flat tire (the least of their troubles) just like Alberto's motorcycle kept on breaking down and eventually dying on them in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES. These young characters in all of these films were not exactly experiencing the metaphysical revelations of Robert M. Pirsig in his masterful ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE - at least not at first - but they certainly all ran into a lot of trouble. The spiritual revelations began to come to them later, along the way. Indeed, all the major characters have major transformational experiences in one way or another as a result of their personal quests and traveling adventures. The road changes you. Also, there are many forks in the road, as Neil Young most recently informs us. It's hard to decide sometimes which way to go.<br /><br />This changing of one's name seems to be a prerequisite to being a beat, road warrior out on the highway. Not only does Christopher change his name, but in EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda changes his name from Wyatt to \\"Captain America,\\" and the character played by Dennis Hopper begins to call himself \\"Billy the Kid,\\" both taking on the persona of Wild West characters of historical, American lore. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto begins to be called \\"Fuser\\" and \\"Che\\" (the name that stuck with him for the rest of his life!) while his buddy, Alberto, begins to be called \\"Mial.\\" It's almost as if one has to shed one's former identity as a snake sheds its skin in order to take on one's true identity - and this requires the taking on of a newname, one which reflects one's true identity.<br /><br />Another thing these movies have in common is the pairing of a more sensitive and reflective character with a more rough & tumble and more aggressive character. In the case of INTO THE WILD, the character - who is very sensitive and contemplative - is paired up against the people he meets on his journey along the way, many of which tend to be less graceful and sensitive as he is. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto is very much like the character that Peter Fonda portrays in EASY RIDER, and Alberto is, also, very much like the character that Dennis Hopper plays. The likeness is astounding. Ernesto, like Christopher McCandless in INTO THE WILD, is always writing in his journal and thinking about the deeper meaning of things. Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper. One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish. They are like The Odd Couple - but riding on motorcycles!<br /><br />Another theme that runs deeply through all three films is the powerful and destiny changing power of rivers! The awesome power of the natural world, exemplified by a river in all three films, is undeniable. You can't miss it. In the case of INTO THE WILD, it was the raging force of the rolling river rapids that prevented Chris from crossing back in the spring to the other side from which he came. It was too wide, too deep, and with waters gushing too fast to cross. He was forced to go back to the bus where he had been living all winter. It ultimately decided his destiny for him. He almost drowned in it on his attempt to cross it. In the end, it was because of the river which separated him from all that he cared about in his past that sealed his fate. The poison plants he mistakenly ingested while he was starving did not help, either. In the case of EASY RIDER, it was along the river that both characters met their fate, and got blown away by a couple of backwoods rednecks out for a spin in their pickup truck. Maybe it was their bad karma? Still, the injustice of the moment is profound, as one watches Peter Fonda's motorcycle go up in flames while Roger McGuinn of the Byrds sings Bob Dylan's song, \\"The Ballad of Easy Rider,' as the lyrics \\"flow, river flow\\" repeat throughout the song like the flowing river itself. In the case of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, it was along the river where Ernesto found himself, in the sense of his true calling, while administering to a sick, leper woman who made him realize that there are other ways to heal people - and prevent them from getting sick in the first place - than by being a physician to individuals. Society itself can be in great need of a social healer. The river separated the sick lepers on one side from the hospital care workers on the other. Ernesto refused to wear the superstitious rubber gloves on his hands from the very first day. One night, on his birthday, he had a spiritual rebirth when he took a rite of passage and dove into the river, swimming all the way across to the other side where all of the sick lepers along the shore encouraged him on. On doing so, he once and for all proved to his friend, Alberto, that he was no wimp but a true man with determination and courage. He showed an inner strength that inspired all of those around him. How they cheered his victory over the river! He would not be stopped by anything. That came later, when he was \\"Che Guevara\\" the revolutionary in Bolivia, when the sneaky CIA killed him. His nobility still shines brightly! Like \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" in INTO THE WILD and \\"Captain America\\" in EASY RIDER, he had a huge heart and a great soul. He truly cared about people.<br /><br />Another theme that runs through all three of these films is a sense of loneliness. The number on the bus that Christopher lived in depicted inINTO THE WILD is number 142. Numerologically, this adds up to a number 7 - the number of solitude and loneliness. In EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda ends up all alone in a New Orleans cemetery, perched atop a statue of the Virgin Mary while he's peaking on LSD in a death-rebirth acid trip-induced mystical experience, screaming out in tears to his real dead mother and asking her why she killed herself, leaving him all alone. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, you find Ernesto feeling more and more isolated from his friend and feeling lonely after he receives the \\"Dear John letter\\" from his girlfriend who they had visited just weeks before. His sense of loss and isolation is profound. His shattered dream of a romantic relationship with this woman cleared the path to true enlightenment for him. The viewer can sense this profoundly at the end of the film when you see him saying goodbye to Alberto before getting alone onto the aeroplane waiting to take him away toward his ultimate destiny. All three of these characters experienced major spiritual transformations along their journey out on the road of life far away from home.<br /><br />One last characteristic that all the major characters in these three films have in common is their persistent, uncompromising, diligently determined drive to all reach their goals - for good or ill. They are all absolutely hell-bent on following their dreams and dancing to the beat of their own drummer. They all choose freedom over security. Ironically, they all consciously choose the path of Odysseus - of wandering - but they all end up reaching the same end as Achilles - of dying young in a flame of glory. That's fate. The ancient Greeks called her \\"Moira.\\" Even the Gods themselves are at her mercy. In EASY RIDER, Billy was always pushing his more contemplative partner onward toward their goal of reaching the famous whorehouse in New Orleans. It almost seems as if the only reason why \\"Captain America\\" wanted to also go was to pay his respects to their long lost companion, George (played dramatically by Jack Nicholson) the attorney who got them out of jail, whose idea it was to go there in the first place. Peter Fonda's character was loyal to a fault when it came to his friendship with Billy. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Alberto (the horny rascal) was always pushing Ernesto to go out of his spiritual centeredness and jump into the dangerous fray of the more seedy side of life. Finally, in INTO THE WILD, it was \\"Alexander Supertramp's\\" intense reaction to the constant, dysfunctional fighting between his mother and father back home that pushed him on and outward to not ever end up in the same situation himself. We must also acknowledge that all of these characters were young and anxious to sew some of their wild oats, a natural condition of youth everywhere.<br /><br />One might ask what would have happened to all of these characters if they had changed their minds along the way of their respective, individual quests and decided, instead, to stay with companions they had met along the way, or turn back and go back home? I remember when I first saw EASY RIDER as a kid, when it first came out in 1969. We all went to the movie theater as a group and all watched it together, getting a kick out of hippies smoking real pot, live and on camera. Some of us thought they should have stayed in the hippie commune. If they had lived, would they have stayed together? Would \\"Captain America\\" have gone back to be with those people? The same goes for INTO THE WILD. What would have happened if Christopher had stayed longer with his hippie friends in the trailer park? What would have happened if he left Alaska before the ice melted and went back to be with the girl he sang with who was a musician and who clearly cared for him? In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, what would have happened if Ernesto changed his mind and went back to be with his girlfriend? Would there have ever been a Cuban revolution? It's interesting thatthe characters in EASY RIDER had the goal of reaching a whorehouse, and the character in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES - \\"Che Guevara\\" - was instrumental in ridding CUBA of all of its underworld-controlled and corrupt, exploitative whorehouses and gambling casinos! Who woulda thunk that - coming from this bookish, sensitive doctor!<br /><br />Ultimately, what one comes away learning from all three of these films, and which is expressed at the end of INTO THE WILD by Christopher McCandless, is that what really matters most in life is true happiness and peace of mind, and that the only way to be truly fulfilled and happy is by sharing it with other people. Happiness can only be found in community. To reach a real community where you can truly be yourself and live an authentic life is a real blessing. Billy and \\"Captain America\\" never got the chance. Christopher McCandless learned this truth - but too late to live it. Only Ernesto reached the higher octave of societal existence and sustained a life on a higher level of community involvement through his unbending will and indomitable spirit to \\"work for the good of the whole,\\" as my friend, Al, likes to say. He was true to himself; that is, he took what he learned from being alone on the road away from home and brought it back with him to transform society back home and, ultimately, everywhere. He may have fallen off that damn, rickety, old motorcycle one too many times to be content with the trust in machinery and mechanical living to the extent that most people allow themselves to fall prey to. He found true freedom from the fold by transforming the fold itself, and it was life on the road that transformed him.<br /><br />Thoreau said it best: \\"In wilderness is the preservation of the world.\\" Wandering through the wilderness is dynamically healing!<br /><br />...

April 15, 2009name, one which reflects one's true identity.<br /><br />Another thing these movies have in common is the pairing of a more sensitive and reflective character with a more rough & tumble and more aggressive character. In the case of INTO THE WILD, the character - who is very sensitive and contemplative - is paired up against the people he meets on his journey along the way, many of which tend to be less graceful and sensitive as he is. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto is very much like the character that Peter Fonda portrays in EASY RIDER, and Alberto is, also, very much like the character that Dennis Hopper plays. The likeness is astounding. Ernesto, like Christopher McCandless in INTO THE WILD, is always writing in his journal and thinking about the deeper meaning of things. Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper. One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish.

B001JNNE64|5.0|This movie won a lot of awards when it came out in 1984 and it's easy to see why. Beautifully shot in Prague, Czechoslovakia, a city absolutely perfect for re-creating 18th-century Vienna; written by Peter Shaffer, based off his play of the same name, produced by Saul Zaentz, and directed by Milos Forman. This film really shines a light on its actors. Tom Hulce portrays Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and really makes one ask why he isn't in more films. He is perfect as the cocky, brilliant, yet troubled composer.  F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for his performance as Salieri, the successful, yet mediocre antagonist.     The film really is beautiful on Blu Ray. It was shot using only natural light, and the color and shadow in HD really stand out. Detail that was lost in the VHS and DVD version comes to life. The package also includes a CD of music from the film that really is awe inspiring. If you go into the film knowing only Mozart's name, but nothing else, you'll end it with a deep appreciation for the man's' gift. The wonderful composition is even better on Blu Ray than imagined.     The whole thing comes in a hardcover book that really stands out in a collection or on its own. I got it from Amazon for fewer than twenty dollars, and it's defiantly one of the best buys I've ever had. If you are looking for something to show off your HD setup with, but are tired of explosions and CG, defiantly pick this up. It's not only one of my favorite Blu Rays; it's one of my favorite films of all time.
B001MW0IY8|5.0|With a voice like a slightly wounded angel, Antony is a revelation in terms of unique and total artistry. His commitment to the manifestation in song of themes like beauty, sadness, hope, redemption, loss and love is pure and emotionally staggering. This is chamber pop with a soul so genuine it often brings me to tears. The haunting opening song 'Her Eyes Are Underneath The Ground' is worth the price of the album alone. If you are musically adventurous and are inclined to want fresh experiences, do yourself a favor and check out this stunning work of genius.
B000069KGM|5.0|Well after listening to this whole record for the first time in my life starting about a week or so ago I feel cheated I only recently discovered it!<br /><br />This record wails from start to finish.  Introduction is blasts off with changes in pace, great musicianship and innovation.  Terry Kath sings like caveman might have sounded giving it a primal feel that is missing from most rock unfortunately.  This is a masterpiece track.<br /><br />The rest of the disc rocks too.  I am pretty sick of the radio hits, but discovering songs like Poem 58, South California Purples and the fantastic, explosive finish of Liberation...  why has no one ever mentioned this record to me before!<br /><br />In the context of a double album even the radio hits sound a little fresher, and provide a little break from some of the heavier tunes.  Free Form Guitar is a little much even for me and the hyper political message of Prologue/Someday is definitely not my taste.  But these guys could really play, so I can overlook that.<br /><br />Overall I am floored at how heavy and good the guitar work is, absolutely amazing.  Joe Walsh, Jimmy Page, Hendrix...  Kath is not only in their league, I think he's even heavier.  I can't believe I am saying that but it's how I feel right now.  This record is gonna make my summer rock!<br /><br />One last note...  Poem 58 is unbelievable.  Not sure the guitar playing is all that brilliant technically, but that is not what this tune is about.  This incredible number is all about feel and attitude.  It starts off as a shifty crazy lazy heavy rocker slowly gaining a lot of steam.  Credit has to be given to Pete's excellent bass playing and Danny's equally great drumming.  I think Lamm wrote this one so the whole rock section contributes, but I believe it's just guitar, bass and drums on the first part and they sound like tight power trio something akin to the James Gang at their finest.  Really cool.<br /><br />Then sometime after the 4 minute mark the track abruptly shifts into a weird bluesy horn accented \\"love\\" song.  Well at least it's some tripped out freak on the prowl!  The last part is a languid, slithery blues adventure spiked with muscular horn and guitar riffs.  I like!nted \\"love\\" song.  Well at least it's some tripped out freak on the prowl!

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I bought this movie with some credit that I'd accumulated and had heard enough about the film to be interested in watching. I was disappointed. The movie drones on and on and while it has plot and shows some history, it lacks any creativity in presentation. I would not suggest this movie to anyone searching for a bit of entertainment. If history and social media is your bag, this one might be for you--not for me.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|[[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]] is a riveting movie with a terrific cast. The story is set in a Catholic school in the mid-1960s, fixed in time by reference to the assassination of JFK. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the tough principal who has no time for the popular, progressive priest of the parish, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). When he preaches a sermon on doubt--the lack of moral clarity and how to find your way through it--she sees it as a personal statement of his guilt about something, and warns her nuns to be on the look-out. Sister James (Amy Adams) joins the witch hunt and suggests that Father Flynn has too much interest in the school's first African-American pupil, an eighth-grade boy. There is no proof, only ugly suspicion, and the boy's mother (Viola Davis) wants to shove the question under the rug and let her son graduate and get on to high school without addressing the matter. In the end, Sister James recants.<br /><br />The story was topical and the performances award-worthy. While I enjoyed this short movie very much, there are a few points that gave me pause and are worth mentioning. For one thing, it adheres quite strictly to its antecedents as a play; some of the long scenes are occasionally static, and there is little attempt to develop back-story. We learn that Sister Aloysius also has experienced doubt--is it enough to know that, or should the viewer have been indulged with more background on what made her so hard-boiled? These decisions by playwright-screenwriter-director John Patrick Shanley are no doubt deliberate choices and they set a timeless, almost allegorical tone.<br /><br />Another question--and one I can't answer even though I was a Catholic school pupil in the year this movie was set--is whether the suspicions of the nuns are realistic in their time, or whether they are informed by later revelations. The case (if you can call it that) against Father Flynn is outlined with a very broad brush; his groomed fingernails, his progressive manner, the smell of alcohol on a boy's breath and the assumption that the priest provided it. Still, that IS the way of witch hunts, and [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]] isn't actually about Father Flynn's guilt or innocence, but about the toxic moral environment in which innuendo is as damning as proof.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is one of the greats performing today, and she played the narrow-minded harpy brilliantly. The character's flashes of humor and doubt are an interesting variation from the more augustly foreboding figure that might have been created for Sister Aloysius. Likewise, Hoffman is brilliantly convincing as the modern-thinking priest who dares to suggest a secular song for the Christmas pageant. In both these characters, true to the name of the film, the question of guilt or innocence is left intriguingly unanswered. In the end the question is not of guilt or innocence, it seems, but of our moral reaction to it.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009r, the smell of alcohol on a boy's breath and the assumption that the priest provided it.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|I truly enjoyed watching \\"Australia\\".  THe sweeping scenery of the outback and World War II era Darwin were captivating.  THe storyline was plausible and reminscent of an old American Western.  The story within a story of the lost generation of mixed blood Aboroginal children was handled skillfully and not overstated.  I was impressed with Hugh Jacman's performance and felt that Nicole Kidman has grown and matured as an actress.  The movie themes were interwoven in a masterful way and well balanced so as to give each storyline equal coverage. I was pleased to find that there were none of the typical cliches or sterotype charactizations of Australia or the people that make up Australia.  If you are looking for an opportunity to get lost in a movie and not feel cheated in the end this is a good film to own and watch again.
B000IKWBHW|2.0|I purchased these because I develop iPhone software, which means that I have my phone next to the speakers all the time.  Having the phone next to the speakers means annoying buzzing sounds.  Since these have an optical in I thought that should solve the entire problem.  I have a set of Roland speakers which these are a clear ripoff of and they do not buzz at all.  The Behringer speakers have apparently no shielding at all in the left hand speaker which is connected to the right hand side by a distincly non-optical connection.  End result is I now get the annoying cell phone buzzing happening in one speaker.<br /><br />Fit and finish of the speakers is sub par, the knobs on the front of the speakers are wobbly and cheap feeling.  There is a input for earphones in the front of the right hand speaker, but it is quarter inch instead of the now more common eighth of an inch.<br /><br />The sound isn't bad though so that is a plus.  I would recommend getting the Roland versions of these since the Behringers are simply badly made versions of the Roland ones.

Now imagine a book populated by an angel who investigated the first homicide, a little old lady pensioner who buys the Holy Grail in a thrift shop,a queen who tries to outwit a child-vampire, a stray cat who defends his master against Satan.It is a book of entertainment,wit and charm aimed at an adult audience reminiscent of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits.Neil Gaiman is an artist with the spoken word.

B0012GN0Z8|4.0|\\"Chimes of Freedom\\" holds an odd place in the Springsteen lexicon. Larger than a single but smaller than an album when first released, it holds up much better in this age of CD singles with 4 songs on them. Springsteen does a good enough job on \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" and his upbeat \\"Be True\\" is a pleasant surprise. The album also has two mellow cuts-\\"Tougher than the Rest\\" and a slow and acoustic version of \\"Born to Run\\" which is quite different from the original version. While aficionados of the Boss will enjoy this album, I suspect its appeal will be limited outside that circle. Be sure to pay a decent price for it since this is not a full album.
0646497855|5.0|This book is very helpful. It approaches the 4 skills very well  It is a very easy book to understand with an easy language, it is very specific and the tips helps you to go strait to the point this way you do not loose your precious time. This is the most important thing in this test.    I could improve a lot the 4 skills, I am writing much better and faster, with the links for exercises I could improve my reading and listening, and following the tip of the book I recorded my speaking and could see my mistakes.    Also the price is far, not like the odder material, so expensive. And Simone answered all my questions very quickly, so I had more support than I thought.
B001Q8MMGU|5.0|This \\"coming-of-age\\" story was almost required viewing for high schoolers back in the '70s. Although somewhat dated by folky Cat Stevens tunes and Vietnam War-era overtones, the main story remains a powerful one.<br /><br />Harold is a 20-year-old rudderless son of wealth. Obssessed with mortality, Harold frightens off any girls his mother arranges dates for him with by simulating his own suicide, using a variety of tricks in the process. He converts a gift sports car into a creepy mini-hearse and indulges in his favorite pastime, attending the funerals of strangers. It is at one of these that Harold first meets Maude, a spry 79-year-old lady with a zeal for living that is positively infectious.<br /><br />The two embark on several adventures, which include rescuing a dead city tree to plant it in the woods, and giving Harold's patriotic Army officer uncle a shocking surprise. Through all this, Maude teaches the youth how to play banjo and most importantly: how to embrace life. Harold declares his love for this amazing old gal and clings to her despite protests from family and minister. And then the eve of Maude's 80th birthday arrives....<br /><br />Related items:<br />Bud Cort has a minor role in Robert Altman's [[ASIN:B000BZISTE M*A*S*H]] (1970).<br />Ruth Gordon and an enormous cast of loonies appear in the cult comedy/disaster film fave, [[ASIN:B00005JLCC THE BIG BUS]] (1976).

B001P5HI4A|5.0|I saw this picture in it's first release in 1983...had anticipated it since Streisand had bought the film rights...was very pleased to know that she was both starring and directing...and it was well worth the wait.  It is one of very few films that in my opinion has stood the test of time.  The leads are great as well as the fine supporting players.  Amy Irving is luminous!!  Reccomended for all fans of Barbra!!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video because I needed a good cardio workout.  I had not intended on doing it for 30 days straight, but my husband convinced me we should do it together.  After day one & two, my body was killing me, but by the end of one week I saw my endurance and strength improve and I loss 3 lbs.  We moved on to level 2 after one week and level 3 after two weeks.  I truly felt empowered as we worked our way through each level.  We stuck with it for the 30 days and I loss a total of 12 lbs.  I now only have 5 lbs to go to get to my goal weight.      The workouts were challenging and enjoyable, definitely not easy, but gets results.  I would recommend this video for anyone wanting to commit to getting into shape.  You do not have to be an athlete to do this, just be committed to seeing results.

B000007MVX|4.0|one guy wrote that he doesn't understand this album and for that matter neither do I. I don't understand Thick As A Brick either but so what. With me it's always music first, lyrics second. On this disc the music indeed works for me. The musicianship is right on. It's progressive rock without being bombastic, just like THICK. This may not be a good choice for new Tull fans but it's a worthy addition nonetheless and gives good insight into the superb players in the band. Not quite as good an album as THICK but very good nonetheless.<br />[...]

0060558121|4.0|I don't normally read fantasy novels, but I really enjoyed this book. It is a story of a man who's involved in the battle of the mish-mash of gods that the original American immigrants brought, e.g. Odin, Ganesh, etc. The story has a hallucinogenic quality, with Gaiman leading us between the conscious and unconscious, the real and unreal. Although it has a very dark vibe, it isn't pessimistic. I read the book right before bedtime and I actually had nightmares about the book's characters!<br /><br />The book is also very well-written and very creative. I can definitely see a movie made based on this story in the near future.
B00005JO5L|5.0|William Friedkin, who directed \\"The Exorcist\\", also directs this interesting, and often at times, graphic look, at male homosexuality, circa 1979. This was before AIDS, and the S&M and leather side of gay life in New York is explored, with Al Pacino starring as a gay cop who goes undercover to investigate the murders of many gay men in the gay district of New York City. Not for the faint-at-heart viewer, this gay man was amazed and stunned at a side to my community that I had never viewed before. Very informatibe and interesting, as well as eye opening, \\"Cruising\\" has been a movie that many have wanted on DVD for years. Al Pacino is great, and the supporting players are outstanding. The script isn't the strongest, but the movie, after being viewed, really makes people talk, both for its subject matter, and the eventual outcome of the film.<br /> The DVD has a ton of bonuses, including commentary by Friedkin, the trailer, and 2 new featurettes. The picture has been cleaned from the original studio print and looks impeccable.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|The price was right, and the features. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are that the Soundforge software has TOO many features and I'm not sure yet how to use some of it, since all the manuals are electronic and searching and reading through all of the unnecessary stuff takes too long; as well as the amount of plastic used for the turntable parts. The unit has all of the features of a quality device (simple, solid tracking, good sound, easy installation, phono outputs and built-in preamp) but none of the actual metal parts to give it a solid feel and smooth operation of the controls. Does anyone remember the concept of a dampened switch or touch controls? How about hinge brackets made of something more solid than lead-chocolate alloy?

B000JMKRKC|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was very clever. But you need to be able to tolerate an ambiguous ending. There are multiple ways to interprete what was real. Ultimately, only the author knows as the characters either didn't know themselves or failed to elucidate all the details.    You may find it difficult to even decide what decade Vida and Margaret were in while Vida was telling her story to Margaret.     Author makes fun references to multiple other novels such as Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, and The Turn of the Screw. Is that a real \\"ghost\\" or not?    Identities are a real theme throughout. No matter how carefully you read this book the first time, I doubt even the most astute will see the ending coming.     Did Vida tell Margaret the truth?  Did Vida even know the truth?
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Great story line and good acting.  This was a good season but very short (only 7 episodes). However, the season finale was very disappointing.  After such edge of seat episodes I was very disappointed with the lack in the last episode.  There was no cliffhanger or anything resolved.
B00006AFF5|3.0|Ron Howard's adaptation of Theodor Geissel's (Dr. Suess) \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" (HGSC) is a problematic film for parents: it is both horrible excess and conveys an important, although flawed, message.<br /><br />Let me be clear on my perspective: I am a traditional Catholic, and I firmly believe Christmas is the Church's commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. I also believe that in keeping with the festive nature of this glorious event that expressions of joy are not to be shunned. However, Christmas is a season (the twelve days of Christmas, from December 25th to January 6th, with expressions of Christmas joy extending all the way to Candlemass).<br /><br />Jim Carey gives a Jim Carey performance, which is indistinguishable in my book from his excesses in \\"the Mask\\" or his other frolics. If you like Jim Carey you'll like his Grinch. I must admit I was amazed that he could convey any expression at all from under his makeup.<br /><br />The assorted other characters, save the smallest Who in Whoville and the dog, are reduced to cameos, so it is suffice to say that they are adequate, although they too suffer under much make-up.<br /><br />But larger than any character is the art direction: these sets make \\"Hook\\" look like a back alley, with distinct and unique cars, shops, homes, terrain, streets, light fixtures,  etc. If this didn't win the Oscar for art direction it should have, simply because of the sheer magnitude of it.<br /><br />Which leads to its flaws: the sets overwhelm everything and are too much, in a way that baroque or rococo is not too much. And Howard's direction and camera shots make all the detail so constantly in-your-face and overwhelming that you can scarcely follow the story.<br /><br />The story is mindlessly expanded from Geissel's original fable, with evident padding and a ridiculous sub-plot about a romance between the Grinch and the prettiest girl in town and her present suitor, the self-satisfied and vain mayor.<br /><br />Which leads to the story's redemptive portion: it does attack the commercialization and emphasis on the giving of presents that mass consumer culture has produced. While I'm no Jansenist, such excess is self evident. But the film's excesses itself blunt this simple message, and disarm the argument through its hypocrisy. In addition, it says, and says loudly \\"Christmas is NOT about giving presents\\" but what it offers up is that Christmas is about....warm feelings we have for each other.<br /><br />News flash to Hollywood: that is NOT what Christmas is about.<br /><br />&lt;Sigh!> it appears it will be ever thus, in Hollywood's constant safe space of always trying to be politically correct it cannot ever say anything. A pity. Given the evident success of Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion\\" and the financial success of the Narnia films over the Golden Compass you'd think their wallets would figure it out for them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I don' find HGSC all that offensive or damaging to the observant Christian home. It is piffle, but harmless piffle. The cartoonish excess is annoying, but it has some morbid appeal to children that is ultimately correctable through conversation.ck the commercialization and emphasis on the giving of presents that mass consumer culture has produced.

B00000J7JO|5.0|I remember buying this album way back in 1999, expecting just an average CD with some typical Chili pepper funky beats. Instead I was totally shocked at the strength of not only the music, but the lyrics as well. The best song on the album, and possibly the best song the band ever made, Otherside, to me is the stand out track. With lyrics dealing with the almighty struggle against drugs and alcohol, it was one of the greatest songs of the 90's, even though it was played on the radio in 2000.    Other stand out tracks include Savior, a song about spiritual issues, and the funky and positive Around the World. Regardless, I loved this entire album, a work of art the band could never top. It is way better than the somewhat disappointing \\"By the Way.\\"
1401201911|5.0|Amazing quality, a privilege to read!!!    This book is creative in every sense of the word!  The story is beautifully crafted and the dialogue is superb.  I love how it delves into the personality of the each character and the way they think.  This book gives great philosophical examples as to how we view good and evil.  On a personal note, it finally made me realize what the world might be like with an actual superhero. *puts away jetpack & batarangs*  This book will make you think!    I'm not much of a Superman fan but thankfully it dealt with other DC heroes (which is why I decide to buy).  Highly recommended!!  I would even recommend the absolute/hardcover version if it's ever released.  A profound work of art.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|A surprisingly good movie, this tale of a gunrunner over several decades of his life is not an action movie, and not just a drama.  It's an all round look at what it means to be a gunrunner - how it came about that he became one, the good times - the bad.  The effect on family and loved ones.  At times serious, at times downright funny, often poignant, it's all the way through laced with its own style - a style which manages to pull off  the difficult feat of mixing entertaining and  thought provoking.  Through frequently quite imaginative editing and narrative, the story never gets dull.  Cage is good in the role, but it's an all round effective supporting cast which make it really work - making his transition believable.  The change from just another immigrant, to a man dabbling in the guns business, to a man sucked in by his own choosing to a world of ugliness by the lure of riches - or rather, as he puts it.. just because it's  what he's good at.  A particularly effective and revealing moment comes when Cage is faced with a seemingly arbitrary murder during one of his sales pitches with the pistol he is selling.  His look of horror is quickly masked and replaced with indignation that the new gun has been soiled by use and is now worth less.  It's a theme throughout - at one point is it no longer possible to separate the business of what you are doing from the effect of what you are doing.  Does it happen immediately you start down the path - or does it happen after a time?  Of note is the contrast to how his brother, played by a fantastic Jared Leto, is affected.  How far embroiled in a world can you be without being affected... it's an interesting question, and one made all the more fascinating by the context  of how much gunrunning our own governments do routinely, as the movie points out.  Definitely recommended as an entertaining blockbuster - but with some brains to go with it.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|The Academy Awards have once again ignored another masterpiece by the legendary Clint Eastwood. However Gran Torino completely deserved it, it did however win Eastwood the reviews of his acting career. Both film and performance are consummately sly--coming on with deceptive simplicity, only to evolve into something complex, powerful, and surprisingly tender.<br />Walt Kowalski is a widower, Korean War veteran, retired auto worker, and apparently the last white resident of his side street. He also racist and agressive towards his new Korean neighbours and his pathetic family.<br /><br />As the film advances he starts to change his opinion towards the Koreans next door and develops a friendship between Sue (Ahney Her) and her conflicted brother Thao (Bee Vang). The trajectory of this may surprise you--several times over. Eastwood opted to film in economically blighted Detroit--a shrewd decision, but it's his mapping of Walt's world in that classical style of his that really counts. Every incidental corner of lawn, porch, and basement comes to matter and by all means the workshop/garage that houses the mint-condition Gran Torino which Walt helped build in a more prosperous era.<br /><br />This is by far Clint Eastwood's greatest film. Filled with Eastwood's style of film making and acting. This is a remarkable movie. Shame upon the Academy Awards for ignoring this film.
0316017922|5.0|While I enjoyed Tipping Point and Blink, Outliers is now one of my favorite books.  The concepts and examples discussed seem to come up at every party or meeting I've been at in the last few weeks.  I can't stop thinking about the lawyers, or the pilots, or the athletes or the computer gurus or even the Beatles!  Gladwell's theories make so much sense about why certain people don't merely succeed, but truly flourish.  It is empowering to think about the qualities of hard work.  It is also confirming to ponder why certain people - through luck and circumstance - have opportunities few others will ever experience. I wonder how Gladwell can top this one!

0743298039|3.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield is a very intriguing novel that tells the story of family, twin-hood, devotion, deceit, and life. It is well written and there are many traces of an experienced author for this first time writer. However Setterfield's immaturity does show in a few areas for the experienced reader.<br />The Thirteenth Tale brings us one Margaret Lea, an obsessive reader and amateur biographer employed by her (even more obsessive) father in his book store - not just any book store however, one that specializes in books that you must search the corners of the earth to find. One day Margaret is summoned to pen the autobiography of acclaimed writer Vida Winter. Although she is a book enthusiast, she has yet to read any of Ms. Winters work. After much deliberation she decides to do it, but why her?<br />From this point on we experience two stories. One: Ms. Winters coveted story of her life, her loss, her obsessions, and her trials throughout a long, tumultuous life. Two: Margaret's battle with her past demons as she slowly sees more and more similarities between herself and this reclusive writer as she unfolds her tale.<br />I thought this story was well written, especially for a first-time author. She wrote different stories from different peoples' points of view and made them very clear through distinct differences in their mannerisms and overall writing. Some analogies she used were worthy of Hemingway (I'm a guy that loves a good analogy).<br />I did, however, see some things that I think some experience would help Ms. Setterfield in her future endeavors. The end of the book seemed to take forever to come about. It didn't just end; there were one or two more things that she kept telling you. She left a couple of loose strings and tied them together in the final 3 pages, a personal pet-peeve of mine. A book should unwind itself more smoothly.<br />I would definitely recommend The Thirteenth Tale (especially if you're a twin). I also think that future writings from this young writer will be worth reading and I personally am looking forward to reading them. Please enjoy.from this young writer will be worth reading and I personally am looking forward to reading them. Please enjoy.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|I have been a fan of the Bond films since childhood and when I was in college endeavored to read the entirety of the original James Bond novels by Ian Fleming. I was astounded at the vast and ever increasing gap between the two universes. In the films Bond had become little less than a superhero whose perfectly combed hair only fell out of place ever so slightly as he decimated a legion of henchmen without thought or remorse all while constantly wooing the brilliant scientist. The culmination of this was in the last two Bond films to start Pierce Brosnan (who I actually liked in GoldenEye) where he drove an invisible car, windsurfed a title wave, fought a villain in a super suit, and literally had to kill the same guy over and over and over again, all after being tortured from over a year without any psychological damage (or physical scaring for that matter).  In the novels however Bond is a deeply troubled man, irrevocably damaged by life and his job which he sees as his only and ultimate duty, his character is both flawed and scared (physically as well as emotionally). While often embarking into the world of high society and wealth he comments numerous times throughout the series that he knows he is not and could never be a part of it, even referring to himself as out of place when he goes with M to an elite card house in London. He is simply put grittier character beat up by life and with no faith left except for those he believes mean him and his country the best, more than this he is a hopeless romantic falling in love at various points and urging to make the heartfelt connection he had in his early days with Vesper Lynd, even marrying in Her Majesty's Secret Service and having various girlfriends move in with him, more than that he is rejected on various occasions forcing him to experience the pain of an unrequited love. Bond was meant to be a hard edged character who went to fanatical and beautiful places posing as part of the world elite in order to crush and destroy those who would do his country and world harm (often absorbing the blows and losses that this entailed in a stoic but unnerving fashion, hence his dependency on alcohol, exercise, and (in some books) barbiturates or drugs).   This was the character that Daniel Craig first brought to the screen in Casino Royale, the orphaned hero raised in a world that wasn't his own and then made its defender, in the most unsavory way. It's this character that then returns, embittered by Vesper's betrayal, in Quantum of Solace. Pairing him with a woman who has equally been damaged Bond carries out his mission (a mix of vengeance and an actual op) with a detached coldness to him that is meant to echo over from the lessons of the first film. The film is big in its psychological implications for the character but is also big in scope, almost to big in some instances as a series of fast paced action takes us into the world of the Quantum group (similar to SPECTER in the original films) and introduces us to a broad reaching network of terrorism politics, and international economics. If you're looking for a quality Bond film this is it, after you see Casino Royale of course. On a side note if you liked both these films then I would recommend checking out MI:5, it's a British TV show that is centered on a task force inside the British Security Service (commonly referred to as MI5). The show, aside from being a pretty good spy thriller, investigates the nature of domestic intelligence gathering and criminal investigations, their relationship to MI6 (the international intelligence service), the personal toll that working in the intelligence community can take, and the part that economics and politics can play in defending one's country. The show is called Spooks in Europe so you may need to search for both in order to track down the DVDs, although it appears on Netflicks and is sold in the States as MI5.  PS. In the books Bond hates gadgets; he is even annoyed at having to carry asilencer since it adds to the draw time on his pistol, hence the lack of gadgets in the new Bond Films.
B000026258|5.0|I've been on a bit of a musical history / influence / anthropology kick lately and stumbled across \\"18\\" when someone on iTunes commented that Tangerine Dream's \\"Love on a Real Train\\" (from Risky Business) was quite obviously directly influenced by \\"18\\".  And, in turn, \\"8:07\\" by Global Communication influenced by Tangerine Dream; a track that just recently resurfaced on the Grand Theft Auto IV game soundtrack.<br /><br />The point of all this is that there is rarely a game-changing piece of music released these days.  A composition that truly changes the face of contemporary music is rare, but this is one of them.<br /><br />That said, \\"18\\" is not for the faint of heart.  I have been listening to ambient, minimal, abstract music for some time so I \\"got it\\" pretty quickly.  Give it a few listens.  It takes a few volleys to really pick up on the beautiful changes and timbres that come from the \\"pulsing\\" style of this recording.<br /><br />Steve is one of the few composers still alive in N. America that have had such a profound impact on the minimalist movement.  This is a good intro into what he was hoping to pass on to the next wave of composers.
B0001WGDXA|3.0|It's a thing with a bunch of conductors - Karajan did it, Eschenbach does it... but playing a work incredibly slowly doesn't really make the piece any better or more enjoyable.<br />  I wonder why Bernstein chose to do that - I have his recordings of the Beethoven symphonies and Schumann's as well, and in none of those does he stoop to this level of lethargy.<br />  I literally checked my CD player to see if it was spinning too slowly the first time I put in the 3rd symphony - it's so slow it sounds flat, as though you had your thumb on the record player!<br />  The recordings of the violin concerto and duo concerto are at a reasonable speed, and Kremer's playing on the former is wonderful, but overall I'm disappointed with this set.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Wow, good stuff.  Like many other reviewers, I do not consider myself a country music fan, but I've heard enough about Johnny Cash to be curious.  I recently took a business trip to the Nashville area and checked out the live music scene.  I had a blast.  Also, as I was listening to the radio (I think it was the Grand Ole Opry station?) in my rental car a song came on called \\"One Piece at a Time\\" by Johnny Cash.  What a great song!  I immediately wanted to hear it again.  As soon as I got back home I went to look for a \\"greatest hits\\" CD and found The Legend of Johnny Cash which contained this song plus many others.  In addition to songs I already knew (Burning Ring of Fire, Walk the Line, The Man in Black, etc), other great songs are Hey Porter, Big River, Delia's Gone, and Give My Love to Rose.  I also thoroughly enjoyed Johnny Cash's cover of Soundgarden's Rusty Cage.

The ESV Study Bible is clearly superior to the Reformation Study Bible in the footnotes, the introductions to each book, the color illustrations and maps and the online version that can be saved.  On the other hand, the Reformation Study Bible has some relatively  cryptic theological notes on reformed subjects that I have found very helpful in studying and in teaching.   The ESV Study Bible also provides a section setting forth the Old Testament passages cited in the New Testament that are helpful in explaining how it all ties into God's plan.  There are also articles on Christian ethics as well as articles explaining the differences in the world's religions.    In my view, not enough can be said about the online edition that comes free when you buy the Bible.  The online edition can be saved and enables you to highlight in six different colors.  That online edition also has a large margin for you to write notes that you will now actually be able to read years after you first wrote them.  I often summarize the notes from the Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible which also has very extensive and helpful footnotes.   When I study, I sit online with those two Bibles and compare and contrast the footnotes of the two.    Finally it is truly a Reformed Bible.  Wayne Grudem is the General Editor and J.I. Packer is the Theological Editor.  A more comprehensive study bible would be hard to imagine as would be a better translation than the ESV.    Samuel J. Orr, III

B000002H70|5.0|Thank you Robert Smith and The Cure.  Miraculously, we're approaching the 20 year anniversary for this musical and lyrical masterpiece.  Whether you are a Cure fan or not, this album is required listening.  Listen through a few times with good headphones and you'll see how hypnotic, haunting, powerful, and addictive it is.    Listening to this album at night in the dark feels pretty paranoiac.  The tone of the album is dark and edgy, full of suspense and drama.  Read the track titles and you'll soon realize this album is no walk in the park.  What truly sets it apart is its unique atmosphere.  It feels like Robert Smith is trying to drown the listener as the songs seem to sink deeper and deeper as the album progresses.  Oddly, once you get to the title track *Disintegration it feels like a breath of fresh air - until the lyrics start.    This album cannot be categorized:  At first blush, you'll think Alternative or Goth given The Cure's persona but do not be fooled.  This album is full of raw energy and emotion and it rocks.  It's hard for a melodramatic album to pull off such a feat but this album is proof that drama can be edgy and funky.  On many songs, the lyrics do not even start until well over a minute into the song.  Nearly every song builds to a powerful ballad.  You'd think this wouldn't work but it is truly masterful.    If you're looking for a \\"The Cure\\" alternative pop album from the 80's, this is not that album.  This is much more relevant, much more influential, and much more fun to listen to.
0425166805|5.0|I found this book intriguing. Von Daniken points out certain anomalies and asks simple questions to spur thought. I will keep this book in my library.
0345479092|4.0|This is a great book, but like anything, you have to make this book work for your family and your child. My favorite part of the book is the sleep section, and the section on scheduling is helpful too. I was able to teach my son to fall asleep on his own without crying due to this book, though it took a lot of effort. i don't know if I will have the time to follow this book when I have 2 children, it is very labor intensive (ex. you have to put your child to sleep at the first sign of tiredness in order to get your child to fall asleep on his own without crying, like a yawn or rubbing the eyes, with 2 children this isn't always possible). Secondly, I don't agree with the pick up/put down method. When my son was 5 months old, even though he could fall asleep on his own, he would still wake up every couple of hours during hte night. I followed the advice in the book \\"healthy sleep habits, happy child\\" and let him cry it out. It took 1 night and he sleept through the night the next night. He is a wonderful sleeper as a result. Finally, the baby wisperer gives interesting insight into your childs personality with the baby quiz. my child was very sensitive or \\"touchy\\", so it was helpful undersand his unique personality. Overall, this is a great baby book. Many friends of mine suggested that I read babywise, and after reading it, this book worked for me much better. It is the same idea as far as \\"eat, awake, sleep\\" which I think is really important, but it is not a rigid and I don't know if \\"crying it out\\" is appropriate for a newborn baby like babywise suggests. As far as baby books go, I recommend Babywisper, Baby 411 and Healthy sleep habits, happy child.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|It arrived in a timely manner and is very good condition.  However, the film itself is a dog.  I was very disappointed as it has a wonderful cast.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Some have criticized \\"Gran Torino\\" as being too simple, cliched and hurt by the performances of the film's first-time actors.  But this is one of those rare movies that's bigger than the sum of its parts. In recent years, I have yet to see a film that managed to get both men and women to cry. And that it would provoke such strong emotions is not evident until the last act.  It may seem simple and cliched on the surface, and while I knew that Clint Eastwood's character Walt would eventually warm up to his Hmong neighbors, I didn't expect that the movie would also have me, a guy who doesn't cry at movies, wiping my eyes. And not just once, but the three other times I saw the film at the theater. And I heard other people crying at every viewing.  Each time I viewed it, it was just as powerful, if not more.   Walt is an old, bitter racist, who just about hates everyone, including the young pastor who visits him regularly at the request of Walt's late wife, and his own children and their families.  On paper, the story seems simple, but its power is hard to deny. It's part drama, part comedy, part tale of one man's racist surface, but as the credits roll, you realize that the power of the movie, the emotional buttons it pushes, make this a movie that rises above the acting, above its direction, above its script, to make something deeper and emotionally touching than most would have expected.  There are subtle touches and small scenes that any other director would not have folded into the film. And they do go by like a breeze for the most part. They'll have you laughing, smiling or shaking your head.   And it's good that Eastwood's character does not make a complete (and unrealistic) 360 degree turn, as you see in most American movies.  And given what Eastwood has delivered in most of his movies, most notably as Dirty Harry and his various Westerns, you expect a big showdown to come, and that showdown does come, but not with the ending you expect.  Eastwood has made powerful movies before, but this one really seemed to touch the core of many people, across many age groups, and racial/ethnic designations.   On a side note, Eastwood has also done what so many Hollywood studios and filmmakers choose not to do, which is portray Asian-Americans as regular, everyday people, living in America. That's no small feat, as most Hollywood studios go out of their way to not cast Asian-Americans and not show the lives of Asian-Americans. They rather change the race of the characters, even when they're basing a movie on a real-life story about Asian-American people, or offer easy, ignorant stereotypes.  Eastwood only deserves credit, because it's something that should have been done decades ago.   And while this movie may not get much kudos from the snobby critics in the big film world, it has a emotional pull that even some recent Eastwood movies don't have.  It may not have won any big awards, but it's a movie I plan on watching for years to come.
006117758X|5.0|As another reviewer pointed out below , Ham On Rye falls into the tradition of self-revelatory novels in which an author recounts their early developmental years. Bukowski sets Ham On Rye in Los Angeles during the depression and his settings and characters are poignantly realized. These are people you feel you've met.<br /><br />The narrator/protagonist Henry Chinaski suffers through isolation in his early childhood, adolescence and young adulthood and he gradually grows to accept and embrace his isolation in some unexpected ways.  Bukowski is brilliant when it comes to portraying the cruelty of adolescents toward those who don't quite fit in.  Henry , always the outsider, has some moments of social acceptance and budding friendships but they never seem to develop. The real turn here is that while Henry struggles to understand his world the reader is gradually drawn into a sympathetic view of this guy.<br />Bukowski can be crude but ultimately this was a very engaging read for me, and I will certainly pick up his other novels as a result of having read this.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|The  Dark Horse CD is an excellent CD and if you like energetic hard rocking tunes, this is the one for you. Having it produced by Mutt Lange was the best decision they could have made as the sound quality and song arrangements are exceptional and the whole CD just plain ROCKS.  This CD definitely has some more straight up rock songs, which I prefer, and I believe this is Nickelback's best effort to date. This has become my favorite CD and I can't go a whole day without listening to it.  Exccellent.

B0012GMUZY|5.0|The other reviews give you a good feel for the wonderful music you'll hear on this CD and some idea of what kind of person Hurt was.  A few words about his guitar style . . . .    Guitarists first hearing Hurt had a hard time believing that it was just one person playing on the recordings.  That's because Hurt does three things at once:  play bass accompaniment of two or more alternating notes; trace the melody in the higher register; and add repeating riffs and comments on the melody.  To do this, you have to ground yourself in the bass line with your thumb, gradually learn to add the melody with your first two fingers, then use notes already being played and notes that can be plucked with a spare finger (either simultaneously with or between notes already being played) to form comments and riffs.    If this sounds complicated, it is (although it's actually fairly natural once you get the hang of it).  Whole styles of folk and blues guitar have been spun off Hurt's style.  If you're a folk, blues, or country guitarist, you need to know Hurt as well as you know Mother Maybelle, Robert Johnson, or Woody Guthrie.  And it's hellaciously fun to listen to, too!    For more on Hurt's guitar styles, see [[ASIN:0786671408 Shake That Thing The Guitar of Mississippi John Hurt, Volume 1 (Mel Bay Presents Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop Audio Series)]]; [[ASIN:0786671394 Avalon Blues (Book & CD) (Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop)]]; [[ASIN:B000UJP6S2 Blues Guitar Legends In The Styles Of Lightin' Hopkins, Blind Blake, Mississippi John Hurt, Blind Boy Fuller, And Big Bill Broonzy [Includes CD]]].
B001N26GFC|4.0|Happy-Go-Lucky is a small British film that was one of the most acclaimed films of 2008. It didn't get any attention from the Academy, but was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes and star Sally Hawkins won a Golden Globe for her performance as a perpetually happy school teacher named Poppy. As I will explain later, it wasn't her performance that most impressed me.    Written and directed by Mike Leigh, Happy-Go-Lucky stars Hawkins as Poppy, an elementary school teacher who is one of those people that is always happy. One of those people who are so happy it almost makes you angry. After stopping in a bookstore, Poppy's bike is stolen, leading her to take driving lessons. Her driving instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan), who is Poppy's polar opposite; humorless and straight-forward. The two don't get along very well, but when Poppy gets involved with a social worker she unexpectedly gets a jealous reaction from Scott.    I have to add that it's hard to think of Poppy as simply \\"happy\\" There are times when it seems like she might be slightly insane. Scott doesn't seem completely sane himself though.    The film does have a consistent British charm that makes it hard to stop smiling. It has the tone of a typical romantic-comedy, but it's more well-written than any of those films with more memorable characters as well.    The dialogue has its shining moments too. The banter between Scott and Poppy upon their initial meeting (and later ones) is fast-paced, brilliant, and hilarious. Scott is right when he says \\"you won't forget Enraha.\\"    Ms. Hawkins has a sort of insatiable, spunky charm that is really delightful. She doesn't give any sort of tour de force performance but she's so perfect in the role. It's a relatively simple character, yet it seems like it must have been challenging.    Marsan is pitch-perfect as the no-nonsense, uptight instructor. It's Marsan I really want to talk about. He is just as impressive as Hawkins, if not more so. This is an actor thatcomes out of nowhere and totally nails this character, warts and all.    Through the entire film, I enjoyed his presence but didn't necessarily like his character. When he confronts Poppy in the film, I found myself instantly empathizing with him. It's really a perfect, Award-worthy performance. No reviews make much mention of Marsan, but he's the true breakthrough in this film.    I don't know about Happy-Go-Lucky being one of the best films of 2008, but it's a charming, somewhat sad film. It's worth recommending on the basis of its witty script and the performances of Marsan and Hawkins.    GRADE: B+
B0017V7GTY|5.0|ONe of the first cds in a long time that I have loved every song. I don't know why this band is not one of the biggest bands in rock but they really should be. The lyrics are amazing and very thought out. I just ordered their first cd and I heard it was good, but I hope I won't be let down after this cd. Buy this cd, it will be worth every single penny.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Whether you care about the politics of The Insider or not, as far as sheer entertainment goes this film will hook you instantly.    The film is directed by Michael Mann, with a script by Mann and Oscar-winner Eric Roth. Mann is a talented director with just a few failures under his belt. The Insider is one of his strongest directorial efforts and also one of his most overlooked (despite being nominated for 7 Academy Awards in 1999).    The film is based on a true story with some added content for dramatic effect. Russell Crowe plays Dr. Jeff Wigand, recently fired from his job at one of the biggest tobacco companies in America where he worked as a tobacco scientist. Al Pacino plays \\"60 Minutes\\" producer Lowell Bergman, who sees the ultimate insider in Wigand. The problem is, Wigand has a confidentiality agreement with the company and with an asthmatic daughter he doesn't want to lose his medical coverage that was part of his severance package. Of course, the more Wigand discloses to Bergman, the more the truth comes out about corruption in the tobacco industry.     And it wouldn't be a political-thriller without Wigand being follows and receiving death threats.    I doubt much of the talk about the harmful effects of nicotine and cigarettes will be entirely new to viewers, yet this doesn't keep both the film and Wigand's testimony from being riveting.    In a film that's already very well-made, the stand-out was the acting. Pacino, Crowe, and Christopher Plummer (as \\"60 Minutes\\" anchor Mike Wallace) are all at the top of their form. Al Pacino is, of course, one of the most highly-regarded actors of all time so this statement isn't too profound. But Pacino is fascinating here, keeping you glued to your screen. The man has a screen presence that is unmatched and delivers some truly Oscar-worthy work here. Crowe plays the conflicted everyman very well. His performance is much more subtle than Pacino's flamboyant one but equally satisfying. Finally, Plummer comes out ofleft field with his performance, easily one of his best. He just about steals the show from Pacino and Crowe.    First class entertainment with a powerful agenda, The Insider is quite simply a great film. Not only that, it's one of the best films I've seen in the political-thriller genres (in which I'd include films like [[ASIN:B000F7CMRM Syriana (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00121QGPY Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)]]). This is great filmmaking, with a powerful script, explosive acting, and terrific dialogue (made even better by the intense delivery). The awe-inspiring performances of Pacino, Crowe, and Plummer are reason enough to see the film. It might be 2 hours and 33 minutes long, but as you'll see...It flies by.    GRADE: A

0757302661|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I gave it a 4 because although it had some great information regarding hypnobirthing, it didn't give enough information about how to do it without going to a class. (Unfortunately, no classes in my area are offered, so it was discouraging in some ways to read about positive birthing and not really know how to achieve it.) However, it did give some good ideas and prime information on changing your mindset to have a good birthing experience and it didn't slam doctors and leave you on the defensive against them, like some other methods tend to do. Easy to read and informative.

For some reason, Amazon does not make this clear. And, oddly enough, the Deluxe Edition now costs a dollar less on Amazon that the regular edition! If you don't already own the regular edition, then this is a really good deal. Even if you already own the regular edition, you may want this one for the DVD extras. The performances by Ringo and the Roundheads are tighter than his live work with the All-Starr Bands. See the reviews of the regular edition for details on the music. It's a fun set to own.

B000065U1N|3.0|And no I do not have a problem with the fact that there is not a single spoken word by any woman in the whole film. Black Hawk Down is a film I avoided watching for a very long time. One reason for doing so was the fact that I wanted to read the book but you know how much effort and time books can take when you're working six days a week. Anyways, so BHD is about a situation in 1993 in a country called Somalia somewhere in Africa. Once again Americans play peacekeepers, there are many characters, many familiar faces, a lot of dialogue that goes over the head but then that is what the film is supposed to be about. Many rounds are fired, many words are spoken and many lives are lost and then in the end, a high rank soldier ends the film by saying only a soldier can understand why they fought the war, why they indluged in this fascist madness. Overall, I must admit I was not intrigued, war films often fail to move me, BLACK HAWK DOWN was sheepish too in this particular respect. Quite a waste of 150 minutes I dare add unless you're the kind of guy who just can't get enough of playing halo and other FPS games on your Xbox. Puhleez. Ridley Scott has done better films. American Gangster remains his best.
1416550542|5.0|Kate Morton has written a gem of a book.  I was completely taken in by this story, the fairytales, the mystery, the different time periods and the locations of Australia and England.  What a fabulous book.  If you loved the [[ASIN:0743298039 The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel]] and have been waiting for that pure joy of reading a book that well written again, the Forgotten Garden is your story.  It reads like Jane Eyre, Dickens, Grimm Brothers and My Fair Lady all rolled into one.  The blazing sun of Brisbane and the scowling storms off Cornwall.  What an amazing book, that takes you on its journey through time and place to unravel a mystery of how a young girl arrives in Australia with a little suitcase all be herself.     I seriously could not put this book down.  I spent the weekend with it and it did not disappoint.  I kept thinking I had figured it out, but the endings still surprised me every time.  The twists and turns of the book are like a garden maze, which is a symbol that plays prominently in the book.  It ends happily for most if not for all and my only regret with the book is that I have finished it.  I loved it.  I wish it could have never ended.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The stunning conclusion to the Wachowski brothers \\"Matrix\\" trilogy comes to life. Highly controversial at it's release, the film has since never quite redeemed itself in eyes of the fans of the series. As a side note, this film might recieve better reception as time goes on, much like \\"Alien 3\\" although this is simply speculation.    The film begins almost the second its predecessor ended, Neo is unconcious, with the he's-got-to-be-up-to-no-good Bane lying right beside him. The film almost immediately throws itself back into the computer world with the revelation that the Morovingian isn't quite done with our leather-clad heroes yet.    One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the extended focus on the people of Zion. It frequently breaks away from the main characters to focus on the less developed ones which were introduced in the previous movie. While the ominous buzzing of the machines comes ever closer, the people of Zion prepare for what they know will be their final battle. I particularly liked the development of Kid, a character only breifly touched upon in \\"Reloaded\\" gets a nice portion of the spotlight while defending Zion.    While humans and machines clash, Morpheus, Niobe and their crew come to aid in the battle at their home. Niobe's character undergoes much development during this period, proving her loyalty to the human race.    One of the films only weaknesses is the lack of focus on Neo and Trinity, who are completely absent for a large portion of the film. Their characters never really undergo any development, with the exception of an extremely powerful sequence toward the end.     The reason that Revolutions, in my mind, was a success was because of the ending. The Wachowski brothers don't waste time showing what occurs afterwards, they simply end the story, telling it the way they wanted to tell it. This is one of the things I really like about the brothers, they don't sell out on their vision and let the filmmaking norms taking over their story. They tell their story, not the story that the audience EXPECTS or WANTS to see, but the story THEY want to tell, which is what filmmaking is really about.    If you are a die-hard fan of the Matrix or just a person who has a tendancy to like deeply misunderstood movies, watch this.    9/10 stars

1405737115|5.0|RUN OUT AND GET YOUR GREEN BOOK NOW!<br /><br />Essential in the practitioner's library and indispensable for members of the judiciary whether in the High Court or the County Courts, `The Civil Court Practice 2009', known as \\"The Green Book\\", is now out in a brand new edition for 2009.<br /><br />In two volumes plus a hefty paperback volume of forms and an accompanying CD, the new 2009 Green Book emerges into an economic landscape markedly different from that of 2008.  As the Preface drily states, we live in interesting times in which, for example, the Special Account rate (formerly the short term investment account) has fallen from 6% to 3% from 1st February of 2009 - a significant indicator, you might argue, that the credit crunch had well and truly taken hold.  Now at the time of writing, some three months further on, the base rate has plummeted almost to zero.<br /><br />Battling against the perplexities of a changed economic environment, practitioners and litigants alike will continue to be grateful for the Green Book's solid, reassuring, reliable and absolutely definitive voice of authority in this atmosphere of uncertainty.'<br /><br />`The Civil Court Practice', in the words of the editors, is 'the essential guide to bringing, defending and appealing proceedings on all three litigation tracks...,' adding that this prodigiously thorough and authoritative work.<br /><br />Interestingly, it's also intended for those who, in increasing numbers, `are conducting their cases without legal representation'.<br /><br />To my knowledge, this is likely the first time that one of the stated aims of the editors of The Green Book is 'to provide a handbook that is suitable for DIY as well as legal practice'.  `DIY as well as legal practice'?  Well I never!<br /><br />But on reflection, I'm pleased that the Green Book is being presented as a user-friendly work (which basically it is). It's appropriate and right that the rules of civil practice be accessible to ordinary litigants, (they are after all entitled to represent themselves in court if they so wish), although I cannot see this as being wildly popular either with most of the judiciary or with some of my fellow practitioners as a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing!<br /><br />However, when one recalls the dictum (with which I cannot entirely agree) that 'ignorance of the law is no excuse' -- The Green Book is out there to, at least partially, alleviate that ignorance and is available to all via the publishers, or your local legal bookshop of course in person and online.<br /><br />So far from being the exclusive preserve of the august legal profession, \\"The Green Book\\", is accessible to anyone willing to read, note and learn from it.<br /><br />Logically structured, the work is divided into three parts, with Part I dealing with rules and procedure, Part II with the general jurisdiction of the courts and Part III with the specialist jurisdiction of the courts under appropriate titles arranged alphabetically.  Such features as paragraph numbering, Index, shaded sections and edgemarks are all designed for simplicity and ease of navigation.<br /><br />For those new to the Green Book, or those who need reminding,  there is a `How to Use...' section - and for quick reference to the most recent changes in the law as of 1 March 2009,  see the section on `Developments Since the October 2008 Edition'.<br /><br />As in all previous editions of `The Civil Court Practice', the editorial team, under Lord Neuberger's guidance, has provided `comprehensive guidance in as clear a way as possible'.  They have amply succeeded in this aim and will no doubt continue to do so.<br /><br />General Editor, PKJ Thompson QC, adds a final note in the Preface about the new Supreme Court which is `not here yet' (although the building now is) but nevertheless subscribers to this year's (2009) Civil Court Practice have been promised `a special supplement in the summer which will contain all they will needto know about the practice and procedure of our new and highest court which will take over the judicial functions of the House of Lords on 1 October.'<br /><br />So, we have a lot to look forward to and all I can say this year is run out and get your Green Book now!e over the judicial functions of the House of Lords on 1 October.'     So, we have a lot to look forward to and all I can say this year is run out and get your Green Book now!
B00008DDRX|4.0|My parents took my sisters & me to watch it at the Euclid Avenue Drive-In in Wickliffe, Ohio, ca. 1971.  In those days, they had swing sets & monkey bars beneath its huge screen.  Unfortunately, I tried to follow Rachel ONE too many times across the monkey bars.  That is, I slipped, fell off, and ended up with two broken bones in my right arm.  My Mom stayed up with me all night on our hide-a-bed couch in our living room.  No surgery was required and Dr. Mast set it the next morning.    I don't remember when we actually watched it, but I think I still have the \\"FREE\\" poster from that memorable evening.

The conclusion to the series might as well have been tied up with a bow.  Everything wraps up just a little too neatly; even Bella letting her father know what has become of her and Jacob imprinting on Renesmee ruined the book for me (even more so than the final chapters, which were worthless).    It concerns me that Bella could be considered a role model by anyone, especially by young and impressionable girls.

B00007LTIC|5.0|In November 1976, Yes went to Mountain Studios in Switzerland to prepare the follow-up album to 1974's \\"Relayer\\".<br />Vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Steve Howe, bassist Chris Squire, and drummer Alan White found themselves in conflict with keyboardist Patrick Moraz's ideas for the new material.<br />Moraz was summarily dismissed, and Yes management hired in former band member Rick Wakeman as a session keyboardist.<br />Upon hearing the new material, Wakeman was convinced to rejoin the band.<br /><br />The new material was all of a positive nature, and Wakeman's return brought about a happy, creative period in the band's life.<br /><br />  The Tracks:<br /><br />\\"Going For The One\\" , the album's title cut, is a blistering rock & roll number that kick-starts the album.<br />Jon's really high vocal is counter-balanced by Chris's \\"counter melody\\", and Chris also adds a solid backing on an 8-string Rickenbacker bass.<br />Alan holds it down tightly, and Rick adds a subtle texture to fill the background.<br />The key part of the song is Steve's steel guitar, which is overdriven to the max, and Steve just cuts loose - going for it, if you like.<br /><br />\\"Turn of the Century\\" has a very Rennaisance-type feel to it, as the first section features Jon's vocal matched by Steve's acoustic 6-string, as The story of the sculptor Roan is told.<br />Throughout the song, Chris plucks his bass in the upper register, while Alan adds a slew of percussion.<br />The 2nd section is about the soloists, Steve & Rick.<br />Rick's grand piano solois shaped around the chordal structure, as Steve's electric guitar punctuates the piano's statements with volume pedal swells and swirling chromatic runs, for an incredibly dramatic effect.<br />The 3rd section modulates up to E-Major for Jon's vocal conclusion, and the playout has Steve's acoustic 12-string complimenting Rick's electric piano.<br />A very well- crafted piece.<br /><br />\\"Parallels\\" is a Squire composition about the fact that drugs aren't the answer and love yourself before loving others.<br />For this straight rock number, Chris switches to the deeper tone of a Fender Jazz Bass, while offering great harmony vocals to match Jon.<br />Alan is most at home in a rock setting, as reflected by his drumming on this track.<br />Steve, like Chris, joins the Fender club on this track, going all out on a Stratocaster - whammy bar and all.<br />Rick's organ gies a slight gospel feel to the piece. The organ itself, was not in the studio, but in fact some 10-20 kilometers away at a church, and recorded from a signal sent down the telephone cables. Rockin' stuff.<br /><br />\\"Wonderous Stories\\" says a lot in a short time, as Jon's tale of ancient times is highlighted by Rick's keyboard solo, while Steve lends a medieval feel with his Portuguese 12-string, and a jazz feel at the end with some great octave runs on a Gibson L5-CES.<br /><br />The last piece of this 5-song masterpiece is Jon & Steve's 15-minute epic,\\"Awaken\\".<br /><br />This is arguably the greatest single piece of music Yes ever made.<br />From Rick's high speed piano intro, which leads into Jon's angelic vocal, backed by a flanged, echo-y pedal steel.<br />The first major section has a 3-part harmony,backed by lots of percussion, a fretless bass a powerful organ, and a Rickenbacker electric 12-string, which Steve plays at breakneck speed during his solo.<br />Next, another vocal section, with every single major chord played in the sequence.<br />The next long instrumental sectio has Jon plucking a harp, Rick's classical organ, Chris' octave bass and Alan's tuned percussion.<br />The next section opens with Steve's electric setting up the group's return for the majestic finish. There's even a choir backing them up as a powerful crescendo gives way to the coda, which recalls the ethereal opening.<br />The piece ends on a jazzy little guitar part from Steve. Awesome...<br /><br />The bonus tracks include various outtakes from the sessions.<br/><br />For my money, Yes' best album-5 stars.
B000008HPE|4.0|Once Huey Lewis and The News took control of their sound on [[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports]], their canny blend of R'N'B, Rock and Pop made them superstars. They established themselves as a first-class live act, their videos were polished and clever, and as a front man, Lewis had become a star in his own right. The follow-up was \\"Fore,\\" an album that seems a bit caught up in its own desire to please and sound serious, losing some of the fun of \\"Sports\\" but still having enough ace craftsmanship that two of the songs went to number one.<br /><br />Lewis and the band were far from over-night sensations, so the musicianship was already focused and top-notch. But the album sounds a bit too professional at times, stuck in the \\"everyman\\" mold a bit too obviously to sound like the hungry happy-go-lucky's that \\"Sports\\" made them out to be. Two of \\"Fore's\\" biggest singles lay that point on pretty thick. The number one \\"Stuck With You\\" is a smart and somewhat cynical look at romance where the couple stays together not out of love, but because it's easier not to break up. Then there's \\"Hip To Be Square\\" where, without a trace of irony, the band extols the virtues of conformity while backed up with a chorus of pro football players. It's catchy and funny, but it is hard to be a \\"square\\" when you're hamming it up with Super Bowl champs.<br /><br />However, talent wills out all the way through \\"Fore.\\" The pop of \\"Doing It All For My Baby\\" is terrific, as is the acapella \\"Naturally.\\" \\"Simple as That\\" is corny but closes the album on a solid note. And as cynical as I am about \\"Hip To Be Square,\\" there is no way to get caught up in just how fun and catchy the thing is. \\"Fore\\" is the sound of a band seizing their moment in the sun and enjoying the heck out if it. There's no reason you shouldn't enjoy it as much as they are.

B001SN78JO|1.0|I checked out Amazon reviews just to see if anyone was going to give this sham of a movie 5 stars. As expected, some people did. Apparently there is a market for every piece of garbage that Hollywood produces.     This is a movie that Jim Carrey will want to forget quickly. It's almost sad watching one of Hollywood's most talented comedians turn into a pale shadow of his former self, trying to force some laughs out of this miserable script. The plot is obviously an attempt to replicate Liar Liar along the same lines but whereas Liar Liar was clever and funny, Yes Man is dumb and unfunny. Watching Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel read those trite script lines is almost painful.

Until they produce \\"The Motion Picture' Director's Cut in Blu Ray I will not be getting it either. he sad part is \\"The Motion Picture\\" could be visually stunning in 1080p Blu Ray, but the Director's Cut would make it less \\"boring\\".

B001N26GFM|5.0|A German soldier is promoted and has to move his family next to a camp that is holding Jews during World War II.  The German family goes through many changes.  His children are not happy and his wife certainly isn't.  His wife doesn't approve of the way they treat the Jews and the fact that her husband won't do anything about it, a decision he regrets in the end as two innocent 8 year old boys lives are lost.  All movies do not end on a pretty note and this is one of them.  This movie is very educational especially for young children who may be studying this time period in school.  It will help them to understand what the camp was like and what the Germans did to the Jews. They will be left with one big question and that is \\"why didn't someone stop this\\"?  Someone should have stood ground and said no.
B000GFLAI0|1.0|Bob Dylan is one of the worst artists of all time. His voice sounds like an old man's, his lyrics make about as much sense as a meth trip, and he cannot shred or do guitar solos. And where is he on MTV? This guy really needs to kick the bucket.<br /><br />Oh, and I hear that he's making a new album. Great. Kurt Cobain died early yet this man is still ticking. Forget his new album, get the upcoming Limp Bizkit album instead. It's going to kick major azz.
B0011UF79C|5.0|A little masterpiece of science-fiction from and about the time when everything will be governed by the genome of every individual. You will be identified through it, you will be followed from birth to grave by it. Good morning Vietnam, good morning genome-drome, genoism. You will be nothing but a complex DNA identity.<br /><br />Too complex to memorize, but any machine can memorize even more complex things and recognize them. But here we have several couples of interest and rivalry. A child born naturally and whose fate is doomed to be deemed bad and it is supposed to be bad, and life expectancy is as low as some odd 30 years. On the other side his brother was genetically correct and perfect.<br /><br />Unluckily the former has a dream and the latter has none. The former is motivated to do what only the genetic elite can do, and he is not. The latter is motivated to do nothing except be a bureaucrat that will trace out all the &#34;fakes&#34;, the non-genetically perfect who are trying to go through nevertheless, frauds in other words, like his own brother. The latter will find a way to go through the genetic selection by assuming the identity of a genetically perfect man who suffered a severe accident and cannot be anything any more.<br /><br />That is hard work, but that is possible because they are only dealing with machines, as long as they are dealing with machines. But there comes a time, and it is a lot earlier in the story than you may think, that one will trace the fraud but will say nothing because he has a personal reason to see if the fraud will go through and that the fraud will go through.<br /><br />Remember: it is a Mark Twain trick: a right handed man normally holds his [...] with his right hand when he urinates, and a left handed man does the reverse.  The details of the end are not interesting here. One thing is interesting though. If the future world decides to become genetically correct we are going to cheat a lot because success anywhere depends on only one thing: motivation, first and foremost, and intellectual and even physical qualifications are only second to that motivation.<br /><br />A small prodigious marvel to be seen by anyone who believes man is better and more important than science which is only an extension of man's mental and nervous system, not a replacement, a prosthesis.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUrst and foremost, and intellectual and even physical qualifications are only second to that motivation.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|I gotta go with most reviewers on this outing for Diana Krall... it's a lax thumbs down on this album. It sounds like a live recording session where everybody is on downers.. The drummer is as about rudimentary as one can get and keep time, I don't even want to know who it is playing at drums- it mocks the gentle casual certainty that Brazilian players who grew up with the samba and bossa nova feel like a heartbeat. Sad... the guitar is just as unimaginative.  AND  man, Diana Krall sounds like a near-amateur with a nasel reality that would sound good in bed if she were beside you, but in comparison to somebody from Brazil is just laughable.     Diana Krall is getting to be our Julie London, and this is her first LP in that great tradition of the sulty fem- fatale crooner who looks great, sounds good and ultimately is a sex symbol made for wallpaper music.    I don't know what went wrong here, but ultimately, Claus Ogerman's orchestration is the only thing worth actually listening to, and he's done stuff 20 years ago that was more robust. I'm thinking Michael Brecker (Claus Ogerman Featuring Michael Brecker), not Frank Sinatra, though Frank's Desafinado with Jobim and Ogerman of 2003 (re-released) is much more worthy of listening than this one by Ms. Krall.    In fact, this whole CD is bust, not robust. And as slow as maple syrup, not as bracing and sensuous as a Caipirinha. It's best to leave the Brazilian sounds to those who live it.  There are many beautiful Brazilian singers to choose from.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|We are not used to seeing Will Smith playing the father taking care of his son alone. Especially in his world under Reagan. He lost his wife, then his apartment, then a second apartment, then he had to go to homeless people's shelters, with his son mind you, sleep in BART toilets, with his son mind you, work like hell to get a new profession in the world of finance, go on selling some of the medical machines he was selling before to just make ends meet, to avoid the worst possible, losing his child, his son. And he manages to keep his cool, to remain friendly with everyone, even those who obviously exploit him, and he proves himself and he gets the job, one out of twenty. The whole film is dominated by a quotation from the Declaration of Independence, the \\"pursuit of happyness\\". And this pursuit is a real chase but a chase that does not so much take place outside, because outside it is a hunt not for happiness but for the game that is homeless, defenseless, out of luck and deprived of the minimum. But the chase, and the pursuit, is in one's mind first and foremost. If you are not free in your mind, if you have no project and if you do not have the motivation and the determination to get it going, you will not overcome the difficulties life will bring. Though I think this is true for everyone, that motivation and determination are the basic qualities you need to get anywhere in life, the end result will be quite different and vary a lot according to the point where you started and the opportunities that will come along across your own path and that you will be able to catch. We definitely are equal potentially, but the end results of people in their lives vary tremendously and then at this point equality is no longer the main characteristic. That makes the film slightly sad. For one financial success, how many meager survivals?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but this re-imagining of P&P swept me in. The world of the Bennetts is turned upside-down when a modern girl suddenly shows up claiming to be Lizzy's friend. Crazy things happen, romance goes haywire, and no one is immune to the chaos. Kudos to the cast. Very well done. Mr. Darcy is just as smoldering and sexy as he was in the Colin Firth and Keira Knightley versions. Rented it, loved it, going to buy it!
B000ROALE4|5.0|This is a solid album all the way through. I was a little on the fence at first, but I saw them play in 2007 and it was a great show, great music, and many songs on this album have continued to shine after many, many listens.     Of course \\"Jihad\\" is the clear fan favorite, the album has many other bright spots.     The only song I don't really like is \\"Consfearacy,\\" but I can skip it easily enough. It sounds like they were trying for a hit with that song but it comes across as them trying too hard.    If you're a Slayer fan, definitely recommended.
B00005N6KG|5.0|After reading the reviews here I picked up a pair of these yesterday. I have been desperately searching for some kind of small headphone to use with my mp3 player. The ones I had been using were the over the ear type, and despite having the inline volume switch set at the max- I could barely hear them.<br /><br />I can't use any type of ear bud or in-ear type headphone because of my freakishly small ear canals. That type of ear phone not only doesn't stay in my ears- I can't even get them in- even with the smallest tips. One reviewer said that type was like trying to shove soda cans in his/her ears- and I completely agree. Great analogy BTW.<br /><br />Anyhow I took one look at these (at a local B&M store) and thought I was going to hate them. They look weird. They look uncomfortable. The speakers are at a right angle. But I figured for ten bucks I was willing to take a chance.<br /><br />I used them last night as usual in bed listening to audio books. Not only were they comfortable, and hallelujah- actually stayed put- but they were loud- much louder than my other on ear headphones. I was able to set my mp3 player on volume 10 instead of volume 30 like before.<br /><br />These are basically a pair of ear buds attached to a very thin and light headband- period. But for what they are, they are loud, they are comfortable, they stay where they belong, and the sound is decent. Oh, and they're cheap too. I can't attest to their longevity, but I'm going back today to get another pair to keep as a spare.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Excellent - right up there with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle in Pride & Prejudice in acting, directing, scene location, costumes and story line with the book.
0375842381|1.0|SOOOO not for kids. There may be deeper meaning and all that, but children will read what is written: a story about kids' and  parents' worst nightmares - children being kidnapped, tortured and murdered. This book is being compared to books that are read by kids in junior high or high school for its controversial undertones and even openly stated iconoclast ideas. Promote it for that audience and purpose, and I am OK with that. I don't care about the religious aspects, but don't want my child reading about castration in a \\"children's\\" book. I also didn't like the writing (sorry everyone) and the ending didn't follow through on the storyline. This book is OK to read along other philosophical works and would probably be great for such discussions about religion, life/death, politics, etc., but is not an outright fantasy as it has been publicized to be - on the surface it is just plain creepy. Blech!
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it many times.  The pace is perfect and the fantasy exploration of angels, demons and hell is a real trip.  Great special effects.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Just wanted to say its a great album for those long time Pearl Jam fans. It takes you back memory lane, to when it all began. I must have...
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|It was definitely worth the time to sit down and watch this movie.  It has all the \\"emotions\\" you are looking to experience and great for the entire family.  Actually I wish it hadn't ended!  Amazing....and ADORABLE!  Enjoy it!
B00000JNO1|5.0|For those fans looking to update their records to cd's, this is a must.  Great Skynyrd music in the early days!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|\\"The Ark of Truth\\" is a good ending to the Ori story arc and the series (not counting \\"Continuum\\"). Therefore, it's probably better for a fan of the series who has seen seasons 9 & 10. The movie itself is good; it plays a lot like an episode. I mostly like the extras too. Robert C. Cooper runs on a lot on the commentary. He even talks over Peter Woeste on more than one occasion. It may be just me, but I usually feel this way about his commentaries. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this DVD, and highly recommend it.
0763630497|5.0|This is a seriously gorgeous book. Downright stunning, actually. A poetry volume cleverly disguised as a field guide that offers beautifully written haiku on twenty-four birds. As if the prose weren't enough, the pages are also filled with most wondrous watercolors by Stan Fellows.<br /><br />The selections are arranged by season, beginning with the Eastern Bluebird of Spring and closing with the Purple Finch of Winter. Brilliant colors appear in the plumage of Golden Finches, Cardinals and Blue Jays. Even the American Robin, which is so common in our own backyard, is spectacular here with her puffed orange breast and white speckled throat. She sings \\"cheerily, cheer up, cheer up, cheerily, cheer up!\\" Every detail of the book is carefully arranged, right down to the perfectly chosen fonts.<br /><br />Author Michael J. Rosen says \\"Now I live on a 100-acre farm in the foothills of the Appalachians. Writing about wildlife is really writing about my own life.\\" He offers us a delightful peek at what he is privy to on a daily basis. Here there are feeders heavy with Purple Finches, Morning Doves building their nests and Belted Kingfishers catching fresh fish for dinner. Pileated Woodpeckers drum in the forest while the sky turns black with by the wings of a thousand Starlings.<br /><br />It's lovely to find a book such as this - a children's book that is just as much a joy for adults as well. Readers of any age will take so much pleasure in this volume. If readers are not already fascinated by birds, this is an amazing introduction to the how amazing bird watching can be. Be prepared to be hooked, as this is one book far too beautiful to be relegated to the bookshelf.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This is the second Shinedown CD I have. This is better than the first one. It shows how versital this band really is.They can go from soft rock to headbanging stuff in the different titles that appear on the CD.  I play guitar maybe that's why i like it so much. I even purchased the music book to the CD so I can learn all the songs correctly.If you liked the first album that Shinedown put out go buy this one I think you will be impressed.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|After reading the insane number of 5-Star reviews here on Amazon, we purchased this series thinking that we could watch it with the kids. We turned it off after our kids spent more time hiding their eyes, than watching the screen. Only after we wasted our money did we learn that the ludicrous number of positive reviews here was due to fan-spam.<br /><br />Even for those who have grown up enough to discover that life is not about what is between their legs, shows like this are just plain embarrassing. From worrying about inappropriate or random flashbacks from whores (a.k.a. \\"ambassadors?\\" OMG!), partial nudity, testosterone rage, and null-value sex scenes... unless you are hormonally about 23, then Firefly is a sad excuse for science fiction. (Intergalactic social disease, anyone?)<br /><br />Indeed, why waste time televising support for sustainable, tax-free, extended family values? The Chinese have family networks. They will give U.S plenty of loans. Today, rather than rewarding happy families the very President got into office by promising handouts to EVERY dysfunctional family. --Just like HIS mom wanted! (LOL)<br /><br />You go Hollywood, go... Just - please - as our supply of effective antibiotics dwindle, do not forget to broadcast the reason why this type of \\"science fiction\\" was \\"good\\" during the plagues!<br /><br />In short, we could not believe that this type of intergalactic garbage was ever allowed on television. THANK YOU FOX for dumping this generation-x infection before it's official season ended... good call!
B0019LY5IM|3.0|This last season is full of short interleaving episodes from the future and the past with jumping through the time without any contribution to the plot, other than to allow resurrection of some long dead characters, it all becomes chaotic, aimless and erratic. The main characters are quite pushed to the sidelines, other secondary characters are magnified for no apparent purpose, and, though the plot contains some brilliant sparkles, the general impression of watching the episodes is of being drawn into a vortex with ever increasing speed and clueless about the future... And after it all, I am doubtful that all \\"mysteries\\" will be resolved by the end of this (last, I think) season.
B00005AQE8|5.0|What a brilliant double disc album, considered a classic in all circles of the rap/hip hop world. Listening to the first disc it's hard not to agree, the whole first disc is brilliant except from Whatz Ya Phone #. I didn't like this one but every other song is fantastic, standouts include: Ambitionz az a ridah, Life Goes On, I Ain't Mad At Cha, 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted and No More Pain.     Disc 2 is a slightly different story. A mixed bag here, mostly good tracks but I didn't feel either Check Out Time or Run Tha Streetz. Otherwise the second disc is good, not near as excellent as the first. From disc 2 I especially liked All eyez on me, Can't C Me, Picture Me Rollin', Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find and Shorty Wanna Be A Thug.    Overall a classic album much like the album released a year before this one (Me Against The World). Even though I felt Me Against The World had more thoughtful and original lyrics this album displays emotion, heart and drive. Worth a place on your CD shelf. Go get a slice of rap/hip hop history!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I'm a Baz Luhrmann fan, but this one is my favorite of them all. He really only uses his frantic film making at the very beginning to establish the characters, and I think it works. It's funny and gets you straight into the story much faster and more effectively than if he had dragged you through it--I think some of the reviewers here didn't know Luhrmann's style or they wouldn't have been surprised. This is the same guy who made Moulin Rouge! I think Luhrmann can bring in some new fans with this one, but he is who he is and some people just won't like it.    The rest of the film is touching, engaging, fun, and romantic. I thought there was strong chemistry between the two leads, but there was also a wonderful chemistry between the rest of the characters that is just as important (I don't want to give away why).     Overall, it was old-fashioned storytelling at its best. Settle in with a box of popcorn and enjoy!
B001HDYK6Y|5.0|When I bought this album and started playing it the car on the way home, I was initially a little disappointed. I couldn't really get into the Eighties thing going on at first, with the silly \\"whoop\\"'s of Spiralling grating in my ears. I was about to give up on it when, a few days later, I got the idea to listen to the album starting with cut #4, You Haven't Told Me Anything. Voila! Try it if you're having misgivings. It's the only way I'll listen to it now, but I love what I'm hearing. Tom's voice is maturing and I am hearing bits of Freddie in the mix now where there was once only a choir boy (turn up the volume - please!). And the subtle Bowie influences are a delight. Listen to the opening synth on Bowie's Ashes to Ashes and you'll see what I mean. But, these are compliments, not criticisms. If I have any criticisms, they're not for the band. My jury is still out for a verdict on the production, not the music. Although the members of Keane refer to themselves as just average players, nothing special, their collective genius deserves an equally capable producer. Or one who, at the very least, appears to understand their music. I get the impression that the producer came in with a game plan for the album that didn't necessarily resonate with the band. I feel like, this time around, I've gotten someone's interpretation of Keane, rather than a masterful facilitation that allows them to shine through as they really are. I look forward to their next album with great anticipation.
B000W7JWUA|1.0|[[ UPDATE ]] FIVE STARS FOR THIS GAME!<br />I received a replacement box from Amazon very promptly and can finally write an accurate review. The bottom line is that my wife and I absolutely love this game! Not only that, I have actually turned my brother into a fan.<br /><br />My brother and I usually play FIFA 09 on the PS3 on weekends, which usually leads to our wives complaining about us playing too much. So I decided to look for a board game that we could all play. My brother made comments like, \\"I'm not gonna sit around the table and play some stupid game\\". So finally this past weekend I convinced him to at least give it a try. After the first game, his comments were, \\"Wow, this is actually a really fun game\\", and \\"This is very well designed and intelligent\\". Then we proceeded to play the game ALL DAY! We're happy, and the wives are happy!<br /><br />[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW ]]<br /><br />I do have to add that we played the game with the Seafarers expansion. I haven't tried any of the other expansions yet, but the Seafarers is really an excellent addition. The fact that you can create different scenarios makes the game even more customizable. Also, with a little creativity and experimentation, you can come up with your own scenarios and add your own twists to the game.<br /><br />I waited for this game for over a week and a half only to receive a box missing all 95 resource cards and all 25 development cards. Suffice it to say, I'm quite angry. What kind of quality control are they doing with these? Apparently this game is so popular that they just rush the boxes out of the factory without bothering to check twice. By the way, the Robber was also missing. Ironic?<br /><br />This is obviously not a fair review of the game because I haven't played it yet, but since quality control IS part of the game and has already ruined my experience of it, I believe it's fair to write an early review. I will update as soon as I get an actual complete game.
0345357116|5.0|While sitting in a library lately, I was staring at the rows of thousands of books and one book only caught my eye.  It had on it the word \\"Tolkien\\".  I quickly perused it and decided to see if Amazon had it.  I had recently finished the Silmarillion, again, and this came just at the right time.  If you love the genius of Tolkien's writing, and you like the Silmarillion more each time you read it, then you will love these additional stories un-earthed by J.R.R.'s son Christopher.  I can't imagine the mountain of work it took to compile all this material.  Thank you, Christopher, for bringing this to the fans of excellent writing.  Another treasure from Tolkien filled with wisdom and meaning.
1416914307|4.0|This is the third in a fantastic urban fantasy series. Clare writes an exciting, fast paced story about interesting and relatively complex characters. The brief-yet-specific detail in the characterization is something rare and much appreciated. Simon in particular is a wonderful character. I know I'm going to have trouble keeping this one on the shelf in my classroom library.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|When I was in my mid-to-early teens, I was first treated to the No Doubt hit, \\"spiderwebs.\\"  When first I heard it, I was kind of disappointed.  (A part of me thought it was all about Gwen Stefani's looks.)  The same sort of thing went for Creed's first record, My Own Prison.  However, as I went through my early twenties, both groups' music became something special to me, and they became my main pics for (what had been) the best \\"current\\" groups (before they both disbanded).  That same kind of \\"It grew on me\\" accolade can be given to Keane's third album release, Perfect Symmetry.<br /><br />I first got into Keane's music as a twenty-five-year-old during the popular period surrounding their first US release, Hopes and Fears.  I enjoyed it far more than most other material that came out in 2004-5.  Their second release, Under the Iron Sea was obviously different, but I enjoyed it just as much as Hopes and Fears.  When this record, Perfect Symmetry was new, I was glad just to purchase a new Keane release, no matter what was on it.  I've got to admit, I was a bit \\"blindsided\\" by how different it was.  For one thing, the \\"Treacherous Threesome\\" of Tim Rice-Oxley, Tom Chaplin and Richard Hughes were supplemented by a fourth \\"member,\\" bass guitarist Jesse Quinn.  (They also employed the outside assistance of additional musicians/vocalists for the first time.)<br /><br />But, the biggest change was obviously in the music, itself.  This record was produced by the members of Keane themselves, with the assistance of Stuart Price and Jon Brion.  (Their first two offerings were co-produced by Andy Green.)  Aside from being a self-produced album, one key change is evident from the lads in the group: guitars.  There were no guitars present on Hopes and Fears or Iron Sea; all the guitars were simulated by pianos and synthesizers plugged into amplifiers and amp simulators.  In this case, Tom, Tim and Jesse decided to break out their guitars and integrate them into the fold.  This would be the first instance of electric or acoustic guitars turning up on Keane recordings since the 2001 departure of founding member Dominic Scott.  And, They endeavor to explore plenty of other stylistic changes beyond their \\"formula.\\"  While songs like the title track and the lead-off single, \\"Spiraling\\" perpetuate the Keane sound, they also branch into classic R&B with \\"Pretend that You're Alone,\\" ska with \\"Better than This\\" and hard rock with \\"Again and Again.\\"<br /><br />The mix here is the sort that may not immediately sit well with longtime Keane fans, because it doesn't sound exactly like the old sound.  But, it's still played by Tim, Tom & Richard, and it's still written as well as ever. And, it's played as well as ever.  They definitely know how to put a record together, no matter what the finished product sounds like.  And, I understood that as soon as I played the record the first time.  It just took me a while to fully enjoy it.  Perfect Symmetry may not have been a hit right out of the box, but it's definitely a worthy record to give another listen.<br /><br />My first copy was damaged, but I was instantly willing to get another one.  If I identified with some of the other reviews on Amazon, I may not have been interested in getting it again.  But, I believe it was more than worth it to buy it again.instance of electric or acoustic guitars turning up on Keane recordings since the 2001 departure of founding member Dominic Scott.

B000FBGBPC|4.0|Let's face it..the music business is in the toilet.  One look at the Billboard charts tells you the lack of quality and originality that dominates today's popular music.  If you are a rock fan like myself, good luck finding anything decent.  Which brings me to Three Days Grace.  If you haven't listened to these guys, I highly recommend giving them a try.  Both of their cd's stand out from the crowd.  Is it the best rock music ever made?  Of course not.  But Three Days Grace does rise above most of the music being played on the airwaves.  They are one of the few groups around today for which I can't wait until their next cd comes out..and by the way...it's three years now...I think it's time.  These guys also do a great job in concert.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This movie was funny and very smart.  I think this was Tom Cruise's best role ever!  All of the actors in this movie did an outstanding job and I laughed the whole way through it.  However this movie is not for everyone.  This is a dude movie, not for women or children.  If you have a good sense of humor and your a dude this movie is for you!

B00000273M|5.0|Greatest Hits by The Bangles takes me back primarily to the 1980s when this group took the airwaves by storm. We danced to these songs in clubs and The Bangles sold quite a few records and LP singles in their time, too. These ladies can really belt out a tune with strong musical arrangements that leave you wanting more; and the songs on this album prove it. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is nicely done.<br /><br />The CD starts with these ladies performing \\"Hero Takes A Fall.\\" \\"Hero Takes A Fall\\" is true `80s pop and dance music combined; The Bangles bat this straight out of the ballpark and I'm very impressed. The guitar work is also excellent on this opening number. \\"Going Down To Liverpool\\" has a good beat to it and The Bangles perform this very well; but for a true Bangles hit listen for the next number, \\"Manic Monday.\\" \\"Manic Monday\\" was--and still is--a song so many people could identify with--it's all THAT good. The Bangles sing and play this one with all their might and with just one listen you can tell why it was such a big hit for them. It got lots of airtime and sometimes I still hear on an \\"oldies\\" radio station in my local area. \\"Manic Monday\\" is definitely a major highlight of this CD.<br /><br />\\"Walk Like An Egyptian\\" also hit the airwaves and the clubs very big; The Bangles got a lot of mileage out of this tune. \\"Walk Like An Egyptian\\" had a music video to go along with it but I remember focusing on this great song and it still sounds just right for dancing today! The percussion works wonders for \\"Walk Like An Egyptian,\\" too. In addition, \\"Walking Down Your Street\\" has a very strong vibe; it's very well written and The Bangles do this one up right. There's also the tune by Simon & Garfunkel entitled \\"Hazy Shade Of Winter;\\" \\"Hazy Shade Of Winter\\" has a fine beat that still make me tap my feet to the beat of this number today. \\"Hazy Shade Of Winter\\" wasn't exactly their very biggest hit but it has quite a strong feel to it anyway.<br /><br />\\"In Your Room\\" has that `80s pop sound with a few psychedelic vibes; and the next track entitled \\"Eternal Flame (La Flama Enterna)\\" was always very beautiful in my mind. I think \\"Eternal Flame (La Flama Enterna)\\" is a tune you either like or dislike because it is somewhat unlike the majority of the work The Bangles did together. I like it because it just plain sounds pretty. \\"I'll Set You Free\\" is an awesome number that uses the guitars very well in the musical arrangement; The Bangles perform this with all their hearts and souls and it comes off smelling like a rose. The CD also ends very strong with The Bangles performing the memorable \\"Where Were You When I Needed You.\\" \\"Where Were You When I Needed You\\" is quite a number and it leaves me wanting more.<br /><br />The Bangles still tour but I don't get the idea that they make quite as much new music as they once did. Believe me, even if they stopped altogether they could never be forgotten by people like me who danced to their tunes every Saturday night in the clubs and at the parties our friends gave. I highly recommend this for fans of The Bangles; and this is also a strong introductory album for people just discovering the talents of The Bangles.oom\\" has that `80s pop sound with a few psychedelic vibes; and the next track entitled \\"Eternal Flame (La Flama Enterna)\\" was always very beautiful in my mind.

0143038583|3.0|Pollan just seems to ramble away and string together his various musings.  The message of this book could have been delivered in about a quarter of the space, but apparently this kind of conversational style is what some readers prefer.  Personally I found it hard to stomach.
0143038419|4.0|I met Elizabeth Gilbert in 1997 and have been following her career ever since her first novel. As an American expat who has lived for almost 11 years in Germany as well as spent several months in Israel, I was excited to hear about this novel of her trip around the world. I enjoyed every minute of reading the book, even if some of the passages particularly around spirituality and finding God are a bit long-winded. This is a wonderful story of travel and transformation. You feel so free while reading it, as if you too had a year off to travel and find yourself. The novel gives everyone much to think about of your own spiritual being.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it, particularly for people that have lived abroad for more than a few weeks.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Ever since the Gothenburg scene began just before the 21st century, I have had a hard time finding heavy, riveting, melody-strewn American metal that lived up to my new expectations--with the exception of a couple bands (Nevermore, Killswitch Engage). But when I came across this album, and listened to the tracks, a wonderful smile came upon my face. With the Gothenburg babies (In Flames, Soilwork) fading into more commercial mush these days, it was refreshing to find a band that stayed true to their roots in their latter work--unafraid to keep the solos long and brutality harsh. And even among the heaviness I love, Machine Head perfectly laced their tracks with melody, causing their haunting choruses to become drugs.    This album is worth every penny in the headbanger's pocket. Do not think twice.    The songs most notable to me are Beautiful Mourning, Now I Lay Thee Down, and Halo.    My only disappointment in this album was the onslaught of profanity; too much is never a good thing. Profanity, for me, does not equal artistry.

B001J1O848|4.0|I missed this flick in theaters but saw it last night on BD (UK ed). Fox presents an adequate transfer (unfortunately rather rare for the studio), but the DTS sound was a pleasure. It was watched on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and Panasonic BD35 player. Given the extensive fighting, shooting, and other action scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the DTS treatment. The picture was grainy in some dark shots, but overall very crisp.<br /><br />Though some reviews across numerous sites have remarked that Liam Neeson was an odd cast for this highly physical film, I disagree. In order to take on an underground women prostitution smuggling ring, singlehandledly, a mature, seasoned and perfection-driven type would need to be cast. He portrayed the girl's father and his skillset in a convincing manner.<br /><br />The pace of the film is very fast, and was a bit too fast for me, in rushing along the character development. The acting was a bit robotic in parts, especially of the daughter, who seemed overly excited and hysterical in normal scenes (not after she had been kidnapped, obviously). In parts it seemed like the director or actors \\"tried too hard\\" to create drama, and whether in the script, or the execution, it was a little \\"over the top\\". The story was over the top, of course, and quite dramatic, but the delivery seemed a bit overblown.<br /><br />Still, I can see how this was dubbed one of the best action movies of the year, as the centerline story of a dad fighting for his daughter in a very dangerous situation is a very powerful concept for humanity. The story was relatable and fast paced. Highly recommended!
0743497465|1.0|Well, there should be!  I bought this book after enjoying the Da Vinci Code and now I know why there are libraries...to read a bad book and thus avoid paying good money for crap!  The plot of this book has so many improbable and far-fetched contrivances that it should be an example in a writing course of what not to do.  First off Brown has a little blurb at the beginning that states that all of the technology described in the book is real and actual today.  Is that right?  Remotely controlled spy drones with cameras the size of a large mosquito?  Golly,  I'll bet our boys in Iraq and Afghanistan wish that they had a few of those.  How about rifles that shoot bullets made of ice?  Brown must have missed the high school physics class that taught the rest of us about friction and the heat generated at any kind of velocity that would make a bullet lethal.  Okay, how about a couple of people on an arctic ice shelf that breaks off and falls about a thousand feet into the sea?  Wow!  They not only survive but Rachel (the lead character) remembers that U.S. Naval submarines patrol the area so she pounds on the ice in code to summon one to their rescue.  After this slow start things start to really speed up.  The couple goes through many travails and assassination attempts before ending up on a ship out in the Atlantic with sharks swarming around as the bad guys descend upon them.  And now we're told that if you're bleeding profusely and tossed among a host of starving sharks that you can be safe if you just pee yourself to cover the \\"scent\\" of your own blood.  As another reviewer wrote:  sharks don't \\"smell\\" anything, they use chemical receptors to identify enzymes associated with wounded prey.  But Brown doesn't let reality or facts get in the way of a bad story so why should we?  Oh,  I forgot to mention that the entire storyline takes place in a period of time of 24 hours or less.  This is one of only three books in my entire reading life that I seriously considered putting down before finishing.  Unfortunately, I kept reading in the (forlorn) hope that some miracle would occur.  It didn't.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time checking it out from the library!<br /><br />[...]ting down before finishing.

B001DPHDCY|3.0|Once again, they replace the simple moral theme of a classic story with convoluted cheezy and dated humor. When are they going to learn that good stories can be serious, or at least have a serious scene or two without the one-liners cluttering the writing. Children can be drawn in for other reasons. One of my favorite films as a kid was Alice in Wonderland. You'd have to stretch to find a one-liner anywhere in that film, yet kids even today still love it. Life isn't always about a laugh. I'm getting sick of the recycled fart type jokes cluttering kids movies these days. With all of that said, this Movie was better than I expected (it did retain a lot of the magic from the book and the cartoon while only bringing in bad humor once and awhile), but much worse than it could have been.
6304493681|1.0|The only reason I am even commenting on a movie that I care so little for, is its unanimous praise.  This is not just a review on \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", but a critique on the wider world of anime.  As a long time student of illustration and fan of 2D animation, I can honestly say that this movie encapsulates everything that is wrong with anime and its fans.  As in most touted anime films, most of the animation and set design of this movie are excellent.  The basic plot is also highly creative.  These have never been weak elements in anime.  The problem is that fans and creators of anime obsess over these things and forget that they are  not what carry a film,  characterization and human expression carry a film.  Whether animated or live action, characterization and a dynamic between characters are what draw a viewer in.  The problem with this is that actors emote with there face, and anime characters have stone-dead ones for some reason.   It is predictable and excruciating how characters in \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", and all anime films, will be allowed to monotonally dribble lines back and forth at each other for minutes at a time with less emotion than a crash test dumby; there mouths will part and unpart robotically, while there faces and eyes do nothing.  If there faces do do anything, they are forced and exaggerated attempts at suprise, pain, or fright. The great Disney animators understood that for every word a person speaks, there is an elaborate dance that takes place within the structures of the face.  This is why there is more humanity in any one disney character than  all of the anime characters you will ever watch.  People like anime because they appreciate 2D animation as a form of moving paintings and want it to be more than a vehicle for children's cartoons.  The truth is, this movie is no more than a contrived meditation on artificial intelligence and existentialism.  Most anime movies are contrived meditations at best and senseless filth at worst.  Thisis how it will remain until anime animators and writers understand that 2D animation will not hide there inadequacies, only bring them out.
B00006AFF5|3.0|This version of the Grinch is not true to the original. First of all, this Grinch does not act at all like the old Grinch. This Grinch is hyper: It is as if the Grinch somehow came down with A.D.H.D. The old version of the Grinch was soft spoken, yet wicked.     This Grinch was a pack-rat with all sorts of crap, whereas the old Grinch was a simpleton who lived modestly in a cold, dark, empty, lonely cave. This Grinch had a history with the Who village. The old Grinch wasn't an active member of the Who village and never had been. Dr, Seuss left this part out on purpose: To give the Grinch wickedness for no other reason than just because. If they wanted to elaborate, they should have made it dark and tried to explain the real Grinch. Instead they just stared from scratch and made him obnoxious.    This story missed a valuable opportunity. When you remake something, may it be a story or a song or whatever, you should try to tell it in a new way but by staying true to it's essence. It is not every day that a classic is reborn. This film could have been something special. Instead, it is filled with cheezy, dated humor. Worst of all, it misses the theme/moral of the Dr. Seuss story. Dr. Seuss wrote poetry with meaning for children of all ages. This Grinch actively spoke against rhyming. I don't understand it at all - not funny. Worst of all, the meaning is gone. The original story was about a single act of kindness towards a weary soul, and the outstanding impression that it can have. This story has missed the target. This Grinch seems immune to kindness. Even in the beginning of this movie the little girl is kind to this Grinch, but he remains grinchy until the very end. The moral of this story is, \\"don't bother, people don't change unless they want to themselves.\\" Although this may sometimes be true, it's not a virtue.     Also, the magic of Whoville is lost. Esthetically, this film was amazing, however, the Who people were ordinary. Dr. Seuss books were meant to take us all away from the modernity of life to a timeless place where things don't make much sense. There was too much BS in this film. The Who people are supposed to be a pure breed. They appreciate Christmas for all the right reasons. Here, the Who people are covered in human flaws; greed, jealousy, competition, etc. And worst of all, they talk about and do very normal things. This was not a magical place. It was an average town where people just looked different. I gave 2 and 1/2 stars because the set was very very good, but the writing sucked.      I don't think I will ever watch this again. It is a dated film and will be lost along the wayside in years to come, while the original cartoon version of this story will last forever. I think Dr. Seuss would be ashamed that his name is associated with this film. It isn't worthy.

Over time we see how their stories interweave but Murakami is so skillful its like a stream of consciousness dream. You're there before you even realize it and like the soft edges of a dream it passes you by as you attempt to hold on. A wonderful novel for anybody interested in superior writing and a great story but I warn you its a slow one. Don't expect action packed adventure and don't press it for too much too soon or it will just frustrate you. Rather, let it carry you.

B001PPGAIA|1.0|Okay. Granted.   Part of the reason this review is so barbed,  is that I am actually embarrassed that I sat all the way through this movie and wasted that portion of my precious human lifetime.  That being said ...    Forget the advertising hype.    This is one of the worst examples in movie -making of commercial hype and profit- mongering tripe.    I am usually reserved in my criticism of artistic efforts.  Since my opinion is that this does not really qualify as an artistic effort, here goes....  Do not waste even a moment of your lifetime on this mess.  No fooling.  It is really that bad.  A ridiculous and an obnoxious waste of film and talent.    There are elements of history portrayed here that are worth noting, but  not in this manner.  The  script, directing, and therefore the acting, are TERRIBLE.   Most of the human interactions are insultingly stupid, and  much of the scenery is thinly contrived fakery.    It is exploitive of an appropriate historic interest and the affection one may feel for the country itself and ALL of its people.    If the originators had spent their huge advertising budget on even a fair story/script, perhaps this costly waste could have been avoided.  It is an expensive sick joke on a trusting public.     At the peril of your faith in movies, Do not watch it.  To save regret , do not buy it!  I am not exaggerating .  My gullible wife and I were aghast with disbelieving laughter, nearly retching through it , trying to believe it could somehow redeem itself.  Nope.    We still like Australia and its people though.  But not because of this movie.

B000002UAR|5.0|IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS CD TODAY, PLEASE WAIT!! ON SEPTEMBER 9th, 2009 (number 9, number 9, number 9...) THE BEATLES ARE RELEASING ALL THEIR ALBUMS REMASTERED WITH THE MOST RECENT TECHNOLOGY! THAT\\"S NOT ALL!! Each remastered CD, will have a QUICK TIME film included, that has film clips from the sessions, of the Beatles talking, sound bites, and other goodies. AND THERE\\"S MORE!! THE BEATLES will be releasing ALL THEIR ALBUMS THAT HAD MONO EDITIONS ONTO CD!! THIS MEANS, finally, we can buy (legally) MONO CDS OF REVOLVER, SGT PEPPER, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, AND WHITE ALBUM! Since the Beatles waited for awhile before they  mastering their LPS onto CD, the technology was still little better than 4 bit mastering. That was the real reason why the early CDs didnt have the \\"Warmth\\" of vinyl. While other 60s classics have been rereleased many times, as CD mastering improved, APPLE RECORDS DID NOT. We who have waited impatiently for YEARS, will get their wishes granted this fall.  The remastered EDITIONS will be gatefold, with a hefty booklet explaining each album, but the Quick  Time movies will only be on the early pressings of the CDs. (So, pre-order on AMAZON, as soon as the new editions are listed.)  SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW TO WAIT, here's why you should DEFINATELY HAVE REVOLVER as a first purchase, along with Sgt Pepper and the White album.<br /><br />Its been a BIG debate among fans, critics, and even the Beatles for a LONG time, when did the Beatle's \\"PEAK\\"? For many people, its on REVOLVER. For one thing, for 1966 their sound is so far ahead of its time, it  surpases MY GRANDPARENTS MUSIC, or my parents music, or my kids music. This is music for EVERYBODY, EVERYWHERE, ALWAYS.  It could drop now, and still sound incredible.  Even John's \\"ACID\\" songs sound like something ANIMAL COLLECTIVE might release. It was the beginning of ELECTRONICA, and AMBIENT SOUNDSCAPES on rock songs. The producer GEORGE MARTIN used overdubs, backtracking, Variable Speed Osilators (VSO), and even playing the vocals thru Leslie rotating organ speakers, to achieve an extraterrestrial  sound. TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS, is the most far out psychedelic song that ANYONE recorded. The Lyrics are lifted right out of THE TIBETIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD, as deciphered by Mr. 60s Acid Guru, TIMOPHY LEARY....TURN OFF YOUR MIND, RELAX AND FLOAT DOWNSTREAM. One of the MOST famous lyrics from the rock era, it set the tone for the incipient hippie-psychedelic culture. The tatoo beat that Ringo placed on this song, was minimalist genius. Its a drum machine, without the drum machine. Simple, hypnotic, its the center pole around which the YIN and YANG ambient sounds revolve faster and faster, as the song blows your mind.  When Moe Tucker cites RINGO as her influence for the Velvet Underground hypno-beat, she's talking about this song. The sound effects predate ENO, and ambient soundscapes, by years. In interviews, John Lennon always said that Tommorow Never knows his \\"ONE TRUE\\" acid song. It was certainly his first. By REVOLVER the Beatles had found their encylcopedic style that followed them thru to the band's end. No matter WHO you are, or WHAT your taste is, they wrote a song for you on REVOLVER. The album starts out with Harrison's biting social commentary, TAXMAN, with the most famous 1,2,3,4 count in rock.  The song is hard, the pulse driving, the guitar sound raw. Next comes ELEANOR RIGBY, one of Paul's best songs ever. It's simply a string quartet matched to a tragic, poetic lyric about the futile isolation of modern life, that ends in death. Tho on a rock album, its pure classical music, no guitars, no drums. After that, John hits us with a minor psychedelic classic, about \\"DREAMING\\" in bed, I'M ONLY SLEEPING.  John viewed the DREAM STATE, as the flip side to the SUPERCONSCOUSNESS of the psychedelic experience, so he wanted to merge the two states, within the thick smoke of hash.  From John's first psychedelic folk rock song, George Harrison's LOVE YOU TO is completelyorchestrated by Indian sitars, tablas, tambouras, and George's vision of DIVINE LOVE a metaphor for PHYSICAL LOVE. Again, like ELEANOR RIGBY, its not a rock song at all. Its George's first completely INDIAN composistion, haunting, learning, and simple. After that comes PAUL upbeat ditty, HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE. John considered this one of Paul's best lyrics, and it is. And the melody...golden. Then, RINGO gets a \\"KIDS SONG\\" to sing, YELLOW SUBMARINE. Its' psychedelia is of the SID BARRETT variety, where the innocence and purity of vision of children, become a metaphor for the NEW WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD.  The original LP ended SIDE ONE with JOHN's other early PSYCHEDELIC vision, this time about his LSD trip with The BYRDS and PETER FONDA, who kept telling Lennon about how LSD showed him what its LIKE TO BE DEAD. It flipped Lennon out, who always had a errie feeling he was going to be shot.<br /><br />We flip the album over, and the Beatle's album flips from LSD bummer, right into GOOD DAY SUNSHINE. Leave it to PAUL.  Its a cheery, peppy, good vibe SKA song, the happy warmth of a sunny day.  John checks back in with AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING, another of his cynical anti-love songs, with one of the earliest HARMONY GUITAR LEADS on record.  JOHN sang an anti-love song, and so did Paul, with FOR NO ONE. Here, PAUL is alone again, playing  a piano ballad, with the solo given to a French Horn. An isolated musical setting, for the isolated lyrics of a lost love.  Again, this is Classical music, not rock. Just when things get TOO serious, JOHN writes a ROCK song about scoring drugs from DR ROBERT, a famous doctor in NYC, where everybody in the Warhol crowd would go to get a shot of meth and vitamins.  Then, HARRISON's \\"I WANT TO TELL YOU\\", came back to the acid theme, and the inability to get your point across when the Lysergic is spinning your brain around at 33 REVOLUTIONS A SECOND.  But Paul (who still had not turned on) shouted out another scourcher, this time with a FULL HORN SECTION, total R&B sweat and heat (later copied, but never bettered by bands like CHICAGO). The song....GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE.  Again, one of Paul's best songs he EVER wrote. Its a LUST song, not a love song, where the desire is screamed, and the yearning for the lady in question UNquesionable. Finally the ALBUM ends with TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS. Or does it start there? After all, the album is a REVOLVER, just  going around  and around, the beginning is the ending. TNK's PSYCHEDELIC EGO DEATH, leaves us right back to the world we started out in.

The new remastering is NOT going to \\"FIX\\" the stereo imaging problems that occur in a few places, because the sacrosanct nature of the BEATLES music, for so many billions of people around the world.  For neophytes to the Beatles, this is a great place to start to discover their music.  The excesses of lifestyle and experimentation that drove the FAB FOUR apart, were still in check here. For those who love the early Beatles, this is the last TRULY GREAT BEATLES album. For others who love their experimental phrase, this is the first TRULY GREAT album. REVOLVER shows their composistional technics, and poetic flair, and musical craftsmanship, coming together with producer George Martin's first attempts to reproduce the PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE on album. One this is for sure....I have NEVER seen a TOP TEN ALBUMS OF ALL TIME list by publication, which didnt have this album right on top.

0312360266|5.0|This is a great series. I read them after twilight. I was a huge twilight fan and still am. When I started reading this series I wasnt sure if anything could be as good as Twilight but it was. After the first few chapters I found I couldnt put it down and went on to read all the books out up to Haunted the latiest release in just 3 days. They were amazing and you will be glad you read them.
1600242197|5.0|This book is amazing and renews my pride in our service men and women.  My Husband and I listened to it on a long road trip.  I would recomend it to everyone.  I sure have a lot more respect for our Navy Seals and other service men and women.  We listened to this just before our Navy Seals rescued the hijacked ship captain.  It doesnt suprise me at all that they were able to carry out their mission.  I hope that enough americans read this so we can change our Washington policies (politics) that limit the Militaries ability to fully carry out their  missions.  A person that we put into harms way should not have to fear their own countries reaction more than the enemy.
1595141979|5.0|This series is great. I think it is right up there with Twilight. This book is even better then the others. It is a must read...the whole series is a must read. I couldnt put it down. I read all 3 that are currently out in just a few days.

0385340990|5.0|I must confess I had no idea of the role the Channel Islands played in WWII until I read this book. Although it is a novel, I can well imagine that it portrays the fortitude of the British citizens in the face of Nazi occupation. The conceit of telling the story via letters never feels forced, and it is fun to watch the story unfold from several points of view. The novel is also a salute to book lovers everywhere.
B001O7JHVG|4.0|Before I picked this up on Blu Ray, I searched for reviews but couldn't find any. I decided to blind buy it from Amazon, because of the great deal offered. Well, sure enough, it doesn't disappoint: the picture quality is very, very good - in direct comparison to the DVD, it blows it out of the park! Contours are sharp and precise, colors are rich and vivid; it is as big an improvement over the DVD as the DVD was over VHS! I couldn't believe how bad the DVD looks (I guess it's been a while since I watched it...), with colors all washed out and the screen flattened. I'm no pro at this, but trust me: it does look great on Blu Ray! The only downside is there are no extras except the trailer. Since we didn't even get a Special Edition on DVD, chances for one on Blu ray are slim at best. I didn't see this movie in the theater, but thanks to the Blu Ray it looks like it's unfolding right before me.
B001B71NOI|4.0|Though I do not think that it is the best NIN has done, nor they could have done, I have to credit them and Trent for this album. Considering they just finished the previous few albums in such a short time period prior to releasing this one, it shows how talented the band really has grown to become. I like it a lot!
B000MV8ZD6|4.0|A family takes up temporary residence in a New England home haunted by a horrifying secret. Strange occurrences and violent deaths lead the new residents on a search for the truth as their small son's relationship with a mysterious girl only seems to grow more bizarre. Undeveloped/unexplained plot points abound, yet it is still pretty decent for Italian horror, despite the awful voices chosen for the dubbing of certain characters. In the end, the viewer will likely find this Fulci classic to be a fun bit of moody ghost story/horror entertainment, though with quite a few questions left unanswered or ideas left open to interpretation. Get set for some over-the-top gore moments and a few goofy ones too, but I've seen much worse on both counts. Worth picking up if you are into Fulci, mystery/ghost stories, or Italian horror in general.<br /><br />The Blue Underground DVD has some nice extras with this widescreen presentation. The audio doesn't sound quite perfect though. You get a U.S. and an International theatrical trailer, a TV spot, a short gallery in the much appreciated and underused thumbsaving slideshow montage format, and text bios of the filmmakers. You may be left a little confused by \\"House by the Cemetery\\", or maybe not if you don't mind a shortage of plot exposition, but you will probably still have fun watching it. I'd say it's better than a lot of Italian horror I've seen so far. I've definitely found myself, generally speaking, to prefer British and American horror (more the supernatural than the slasher stuff), though I love what I've seen of Asian horror so far too.

B000JBWWBK|5.0|I love the Peter Mayle stories. I love the concept, the beautiful old French manor house, the vineyards, and the interesting French characters. I spent a year and a half in France in the US Army and I loved every minute of it. It was MOST interesting and exciting and I especially loved the countryside and the quaint, ubiquitous French villages and especially the tremendous historical treasury that fills the entire country. Peter Mayle, in his biographical work, \\"A Year in Provence\\" used John Thaw to portray himself during the year it took to restore his wonderful old chateau in Provence. But in this movie, \\"A Good Year\\", a fictional story decorates the same chateau (I believe it is) and region that has several love stories combined. First, there is Russell Crowes' love for himself (very nacissistic) and his growth of character which leads to him falling in love with a charming French girl and his long lost niece all the while his love grows for the legacy his late uncle has left him...the chateau and the environs. A very satisfying movie visually and emotionally and I loved every moment of it! I recommend highly, especially for Peter Mayle and Russell Crowe fans!

(They could have spread all the singles/b-sides/live tracks on the newer Police albums´ five discs if they fit on these four discs!)    My FAVORITE BOX SET, hands down, because there´s pieces of the ¨Police puzzle\\" that are filled in quite nicely with non-album tracks!    Message in a Box is not EVERYTHING. (And I don´t mean those awful rap remixes!)  And don´t get me started on the MIA Message in a Box Volume 2!!!

0375826726|5.0|This is the third book in the Inheritance series, and I think my favorite. I was skeptical about reading the first two, but found out that I enjoyed them more than I ever thought I would. The author Christopher Paolini was quite young when he wrote the first book \\"Eragon\\", and people gave him a lot of criticism for it. I think he has done a wonderful job with his series, and they just keep getting better. You can tell the difference between his writing in the first book to how much he has grown as an author. This book seems to have so much more detail than the other two, which I love. I really like to know what the character is feeling, and the scenery around them.  I love the story, especially the dragons. Saphira is an amazing character, and I love reading about her relationship with Eragon, her Rider. Eragon, has grown very powerful, and isn't as unsure of himself as he was in previous books. He actually knows what he is doing, and I really found myself liking him a lot more. The other character's are great as well, but I can't name all of them or I would be writing a book myself!:) The story flowed wonderfully, and I never felt lost while reading. This was the best book of the series I believe, and I cannot wait to read the 4th one whenever it comes out. It is sad to think it is almost over, but I am excited to read them none the less.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies is one of those special films that no matter how old you get, it never loses its magic and wonder. I remember seeing The Goonies back in 1987, when I was a young kid, and gosh, it was probably the most entertaining and fun movie I've ever seen in my few years of living.  Now that I've grown up, I'd thought I'd watch the film again to see if that magic and excitment of a great and humorous adventure movie would still be there. Surely it was, to an even greater extent than when I was a kid. Though Sean Austin and Josh Brolin have all grown up now, I still think their best movie is \\"The Goonies.\\" And the Cindy Laupier song is more catchier than ever. Even the long video is awesome!

Actually, I downloaded the audio version of the book and listened to it while out walking in the Florida sunshine in February. Hey, it's pretty darn good! The four agreements: Be impeccable with your word; Don't take anything personally; Don't make assumptions; Always do your best. These are simple in concept, and damn difficult to live out. I'm continuing my journey to being a better person.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost is undoubtedly the most original and well-written series ever, and this season has kept up the tradition.

0143038419|5.0|I read this at my daughter's insistence, and found myself underlining and folding over pages like it was a textbook! Certain themes in this book completely resonated with me as I continue to conduct my own journey toward happiness. The author is admittedly self-absorbed, but then this is her search for personal identity, not about anything else.  There is so much here to contemplate, even if it is just about watching how one woman engages (or not!) with the world.<br /><br />Four other people recommended this book; all insisted \\"it will make you think\\" or some variation on that theme. WARNING: I am aware that this book is not universally adored. You will either love it or totally hate it. Just to help you out, keep in mind that Ms Gilbert did not promise a social commentary - all she promised was to chronicle her personal journey. Some find her annoying and whiny. I found it great fun to experience!

1593975635|3.0|There are enough reviews about the storyline here to satisfy anyone's curiosity. I thought it was good enough.  My comments are about the audiobook version of the story, by produced by Audio Renaissance. Let's start with 'I'm a over-the-road truck driver' and work mostly at night. Seeing things while driving down the road, at night, bouncing around, is not easy.    The numbers on the disks are WAY TOO SMALL; disk 1 is nowhere as easy as DISK 1 (I can't manipulate the text enough here to really illustrate how frustrating this is) to read. I need to be able to see them quickly and easily so my attention is not diverted nor focused too long.  There is NO SIGNAL or SIGN that a disk has ended - except hearing parts of the book you've already heard. Other companies state \\"This is the end of disk...\\" or have some other easily identifiable signal.  There is NO INTRO to each disk. It just starts and you have to hope that it's actually the next one. Other companies intro each disk \\"This is disk...\\" and at least one re-reads the last sentence of the last disk! Huzzah to that!  The TRACKS ARE TOO LONG meaning that, if you miss hearing just one word clearly (and it's important to the story) you might have to listen to the last five-to-ten minutes of the disk again. One company puts 99 or 100 tracks on each disk. It's heaven to back up no more than a minute or three to catch anything missed.    Otherwise, it was pretty good.
B001TK3XO0|5.0|\\"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls. (172)\\"    There isn't a better way to describe this book than by calling it a beautiful travesty. This book is the amazing story of two women over a course of more than forty years surviving. Essentially I believe that is their goal; simply surviving the brutality which never ends within Afghanistan especially for women.     The  book begins with the first woman, Mariam, who is in fact the illegitimate daughter of a married man who visits her mother and her at their hut on the outskirts of town once a week, which is in fact her favourite time. Of course wanting to be a part of her father's life she attempts to go be with him and his family resulting in her possibly epileptic mother's suicide, and her brutal rejection from her father. Thus she is then forced into marrying a man some 30 years her elder and moved straight to the capital to live a married life of abuse, negativity and obedience.    The next heroine is Laila, born in one of the neighboring houses of Mariam and her husband's. She is born of an intellectual father who pushed her to be a great leader and fighter for the women of Afghanistan, and an extremist mother waiting on the success of the jihadists against the Soviet Union. After the fall of the Soviet Regime in Afghanistan, more fighting continues amongst the different tribes and a stray rocket hits her home and kills her parents. Laila is then found and recovered by Mariam and Rasheed (Mariam's husband) and when she learns she is pregnant with the child of her best friend who already left to be a refugee, she is forced to marry Rasheed as well. From here the story truly begins.    These two women endure the most frightening scenarios and realities that will have you shaking in your bed. This story truly gives men and woman around the world an eye opener to the world outside, and opens up a whole new level of respect for women living inthese countries. Mariam and Laila together do whatever it takes for them to survive under the brutal rule of the Taliban and their abusive husband Rasheed.    The author Khaled Hosseini is beyond marvelous. He puts so much detail into every sentence of the book you feel as if you are right their in the story. He describes every emotion, thought, touch, and smell especially during the intense parts so that your emotions run parallel to the women in the story's.      Basically I loved this book because of its integrity. It was not written pro-west or pro-Islamic, it simply told the truth for the women of Afghanistan who need their cries to be heard. I feel as though every person in the world could gain so much from this book and open their eyes to the world beyond the west, and hopefully stir up enough courage to fight for change.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|I wish Working on a Dream was as good as it should be. I wish Bruce Springsteen recording while in between tour breaks created a vibrant, energized set of songs that felt infected with the rush of his live performances. I wish I could, but I'd be working too hard to believe that, the truth is this is a depressingly average album missing Springsteen's previous perfectionist streak.<br /><br />On Born to Run's 25th Anniversary DVD Springsteen acknowledged that he worked very hard on lyrics to avoid falling into clich&eacute; on that record. On Working on a Dream his songs can't avoid falling into that trap. Queen of the Supermarket is the best example of this as the lyrics just don't dance the tightrope of sounding like an authentic slice of life tune that zeroes in on our quiet daily crushes. Instead Bruce spouts some truly awful lines like 'each night I take my groceries and I drift away.' Really Bruce, did you wander down to the Wal-Mart in between tour stops?<br /><br />In between such cringe inducing moments Springsteen does give us a solid track or two. Outlaw Pete gets the album off to a great start as this eight minute epic is a great showcase of Springsteen's grandiose abilities that he showed off on Born To Run. It gives the album the sort of large scale beginning that Thunder Road did. The rest of the CD however, never even attempts to climb such heights and jumps by with very few memorable moments. The real problem may be the rushed nature of the recording sessions. Springsteen usually takes his time in between records but Working on a Dream comes very quickly on the heels of 2007's Magic. Great Springsteen songs feel like a lot of work has been put into them. That feel doesn't take hold here as songs like Kingdom of Days feel below Springsteen's songwriting ability with choruses and over-the-top production that make the songs about everything but their lyrical intent.<br /><br />Springsteen may have made his reputation originally by putting on great live shows, but on Working on a Dream the time and work it takes to make a great pop rock record appears to be no fantasy. Maybe Bruce should've waited until the tour ended.am the time and work it takes to make a great pop rock record appears to be no fantasy. Maybe Bruce should've waited until the tour ended.

0307455874|1.0|\\"Words, just words, 'I have a dream', just words\\"- Barack Obama (another tedious stump speech):: Unfortunately, yes, just words Barack.    Anyone can write or talk. I'm the King of Siam, I invented the internet, I have a 12 inch ****.  Truth is vindicated in action, responsible action.  I've now read this book as well as \\"Dreams From My Father\\" and, while it is infinitely more likely Obama had more of a hand in contributing to this particular book, Both books were definitely NOT written by this man. Words, just words, until the teleprompter goes whacko and you actually have to come up with an independent thought.  The Obama who supposedly wrote these 2 books is not the same Obama who we see stumble when the telepromter fails and he \\"Um, Um, Um's\\" himself through press questions. Or makes massive mistakes while reading the prompter(Like calling the somalian piracy \\"somalian privacy\\" without skipping a beat.  It's clear he doesn't know nor care what \\"words\\" he's saying.   I'm giving this and \\"dreams\\" 1 star because plagiarism and/or fraud should not be rewarded and there is no option for zero stars.  I've read numerous blogs, internet theories and commentaries from literary experts on both sides of this \\"did Obama or Ayers or whoever write these books\\" and, frankly, all I need is my own two eyes and ears. The \\"words\\" in these books do not mesh in any cogent way with the actions(obvious illiteracy without tele-prompting) of this man Obama.  Nothing more needs to be said. I could go into several paragraphs of the inadequacy of the content of this book as well, but I don't need to do that. Obama did not write these books. And don't think I'm a conservative, I voted for Obama, as well as Kerry in 2004 and Gore in 2000. I made a huge mistake this time. I'm also sorry I donated any cash to this phony buy purchasing his fraudulent publishing's.

1563894696|5.0|After being somewhat underwhelmed by the supposed classic Dark Knight Returns I decided to check out the other most highly praised Batman tale. I have to admit, I was blown away. This is the perfect batman. Everything about this book was just perfect for Batman. Although this is not as good as the amazing watchmen, it is certainly on par. If you enjoy the recent batman movies this is sure to please you. It starts out somewhat slow but picks up considerably when we start getting more familiar with the plot and characters. My only complaint is that they always seem to review what happened in the previous chapter in every new one. It can get somewhat annoying but doesnt at all diminish the amazing story. This is basically required reading for all batman fans.

140120841X|4.0|This graphic novel is no doubt a revolutionary masterpiece. It is dark and compelling. It is easy to see why this is one of the most popular and well received graphic novels of all time. For me, however, I didn't find it particularly fun to read. I still liked it but I felt as though the second act of the story was somewhat boring and almost lost my interest. Luckily the finale is well worth it. Maybe the main reason I didnt love the comic as much as everyone else is because I had read watchmen right before it and was absolutely blown away. This is good but still, in my mind, does not compare to Watchmen. Overall it is a must read for every graphic novel fan. Just dont go in expecting a happy go lucky fun book.

If you have not read Brown before, I would recommend the book as exciting and shocking. However, I've discovered that Brown uses the samebasic plot for all his stories. A widower falls in loe with a beautiful girl, they uncover a huge plot, save some lives, escape sure death, and live happily ever after. The details vary, but this book is just more of the sam efrom Brown.
034544678X|5.0|This was one of the most informative book about dogs that I have ever read and I know that I will find it helpful in training my Australian Sheep dog, a wonderful find at the humane society. I had never thought about how my dog was reacting to my body language as well as to my verbal commands. The author's examples are to the point and the sense of humor she injects into the book make it an easy read.

B0015XHQTE|5.0|Always a Dirty Harry fan, this was a \\"blast from the past\\".  I enjoyed being able to purchase the movies in a boxed set collection that had extras regarding each individual film. Clint Eastwood ages well and stays true to character over the years (the only thing that got thinner was his hair).  This is a good addition to our collection.
0316067598|1.0|I have extreme pathos for Marcus Luttrell, and if you consider \\"Lone Survivor\\" contextually, through the painful lens of PTSD sufferer, then Mr. Luttrell's constant neurotic, misguided and flawed reasons for a critical decision he and his fellow 3 SEALS made -- namely, to kill or not to kill unarmded goat herders who blew their cover  -- becomes acceptable, and OK, to a point.     Unfortunately, on top of the neurotic rethinking and reformulating of answers to why they made the fateful decision, the book is poorly structured, and terribly written. It doesn't get going until late in the 5th chapter.     It is a worthwhile read if you're interested in the speed with which things can go terribly wrong fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan. It's also an exercise in tolerance with someone who suffered a terrible loss that reinforced a set of ideas foreign to your own. Having said that, Mr. Luttrell's book made it clear to me that, had I been on the ravine and discovered by goat herders who were going to turn me in, I would have done exactly what Mr. Luttrell wished he did. In all, the book does paint an interesting picture as to the degree the modern SF operator remains politically conscience of liberals during their missions -- in Mr. Luttrell's case, it seems to the excess. An interesting read all in all, and despite one's viewpoints on the \\"liberal media\\", Mr. Luttrell was extremely brave and served his country tremendously. He should be remembered as such.

B000PMFS2I|5.0|I know that I'm not going to get any popularity for this but, sombody has to give kudos for it. Yes, I heard every bad thing in the book about this movie and I heard enough. Let's STOP the Madness!! for less of those who did like it, No more negative, controversial feedback! It's time to go back to our real memory lane. Nobody likes going back there for this movie's sake, but oh well, too damn bad, we're going anyway. In a positive sense, SHOWGIRLS wasn't bad at all. This movie was a message-spreader. But, we've read it all wrong. And Elizabeth Berkley playing Nomi, she's a human being that wanted to dance and make it big, that's all. And what do you guys do? Take away her popularity, call her all sorts of negative names and tell her to keep her clothes on all because of ONE MEASLY ROLE! That's a shame. Her character learned her lesson, I guess. I bet that Elizabeth is a nice person to talk to,I betcha. She didn't do anything wrong by taking the role, in my P.O.V. She needs a break, ladies and gentlemen, let's leave her be. And as for actor Kyle MacLaughlin playing Zack, I didn't trust him because he wanted to find out some information on Nomi after they slept together, so he was just using her. I don't know why Gina Gershon's character bugged me so much, but she did. Crystal always had the upper-hand, she wanted Nomi to stay on her level because she found her attractive, she had dance moves better than her and she never liked her flirting with Zack. Plus she played mind games and sniffed cocaine and was extremely bossy. Was it right for Nomi to make her fall down the stairs? I don't know. Crystal just needed to chill for a while. Nomi's african-american friend, Molly was nice. She has a kind heart. I mean, who else would help out a female with temper tantrums and waste a basket of fresh, warm and tasty fries? she would. She allowed  her to stay at her place, and share some of Molly's clothes untill she got her suitcase back. What happened to her was completely un-called for. She just wanted to meet the guy she admired for days, what a disgusting way of thanking her. That's why Nomi took matters into her own hands and kicked his no-good butt! That's what friends are for, Nomi had Molly's back, and she gets much love for that. Anyway, I just wished that guys weren't so cursed by this film everytime they're reminded of it, but it's too late. That's more SHOWGIRLS for me! 2 thumbs up! Loved it!!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I must say this live show on dvd is one of the best I've seen so far. David Foster has given us a taste of what everyone can enjoy in viewing a 2 hour live show without getting bored. A great producer like David made sure that the quality of video & DTS 5.1 sound is rich and worth the money to spend. I myself noticed that when his guest Peter Cetera walks on stage...grabs the mic and starts to sing...wow! his voice comes out crystal clear. There is a long list of singers that we all know who give outstanding performances without errors in pitch. Forget about thinking should I buy this dvd? GO NOW AND BUY IT! You won't regret it.
B001TOD92C|4.0|This movie is the story of an aging wrester going through struggles inside and outside the ring. Stunning performances from Rourke, Tomei, and Evan Rachel Woods as his daughter. I thought Aronfsky did a fantastic job with the movie. One of the reasons why i watched this movie is because I heard it peeved of the country of Iran (when \\"Ram Jam'\\" breaks a Iran flag in half) so I thought that was pretty funny too. Definitely check out this movie though. Its a movie that I think anyone can get into and it kind of shows a dark side of wrestling also but its definitely not just a \\"wrestling\\" movie, it gets much deeper than that.
B000002N3J|3.0|Madonna is known for dance and pop music, but she has also written and co-produced amazing ballads of note. She may not have powerful vocal capabilities but she certainly gets better with every album, and uses what she has to the best of her ability. The 1st and only ballad compilation album by the star.<br /><br />Songs that stand out for me is the incredible #1 hit 'Live to tell\\" from True Blue, her #2 hit \\"I Remember\\" from OST 'With Honours', her #1 'This used to be my playground\\" from OST 'League of their own\\", her biggest US #1 \\"Take a Bow\\" her top 10 hit \\"Rain\\" from Erotica new songs \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Once more Chance\\", songs that the album could of done without or replaced with another ballad (in my opinion) are \\"Love don't live here anymore\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\". Wasn't \\"La isla Bonita\\" a ballad, \\"Promise to Try\\" from 'Like a Prayer' would of also fit perfectly. A good listen.
B001FB55Y4|4.0|I Liked this movie since saw at cinema, I didn't like the combo because the only extra was de bonus dvd with a digital copy, nothing real interesting.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions is trully an amazing production, these powerful songs flow seemlessly into each other, you never wanna skip a song. I was at a stage in my life when I thought I could never be blown away by an album the way I used to when I was young, but this album did it for me. Stuart Price did an amazing job in production, you hear beats that will take you to orbit, Madonna vocals are incredible, she seems to get better with every album. All the songs are a great listen but a few outstanding songs for me are:    Hung Up: This leading single needs no intro, #1 in over 40 countries one of her biggest hits and rightfully so, the track is a pop/dance masterpiece, cleverly crafted by Madonna and Stuart Price containing the sample of ABBA's Gimme Gimme,great video, Madonna is brilliant in creating music that leaves an impression and this track fits the bill.    Get Together: I love house music and this track has that feel, amazing production, put this track on your mp3 and play it loud using headphones, it will take you to a place somewhere beyond the ordinary. Absolutely amazing.    Sorry: Another gem, we all know this one, the track reached #1 in Europe, yet again the production is impeccable, a rather angry song from the Queen herself, great dance track that leaves an impression.    Future Lovers: A futuristic journey in the realm of Madonna's vision, this trance like production, the opening to her amazing Confessions tour, will make you high without you taking a drug.    Let it will be: I appreciated this track even more when I saw her performance of it on the Confessions Tour, so much energy, a strong liberating track.    I Love New York: I am not really a great fan of Madonna the Rock Queen, but this track is great, very sassy, very gutsy.    Forbidden Love: Another beauty you must blast on your head phones and close your eyes, amazing production, I love the futuristic tones on this album, a slower track than the others but you can still dance it, a mellow emotion vocal over a hard electronic beat, perfect.    Jump: Probably the best dance track on this album, great message for the ladies out there, its simple and straight to the point, love the bass-line, I wish she did more on the video, the Confessions performance out did the video by far.    Push: Turn your volume down for this one, it blasts you from the word go, a great hard beat with a positive message, I'd like to think she was talking about her hubby at the time, \\"you push me to go the extra mile\\". Would of loved to see this track performed though, but hey I can't have my cake and eat it too.    Like it or not: A great track to end this elaborative production, \\"this is who I am you can like it or not, you can love me or leave cause I'm never gonna stop\\", that pretty much somes up Madonna in a nutshell. Absolutely loved her solo performance of this song on the confessions tour.    Confessions was a surprise to many, especially after the dissapointing commercial failure of American Life, Madonna reminded all the pop/dance wannabes that she reigns in this field, and although she will never repeat herself this is a reminder that will never be forgotten, Confessions trully is the best dance album created.
B00005JPY2|4.0|It's not often an adaptation comes along that consciously tries not to veer too much from the source material.  I went into this movie having read the comic and found the same problems and genius in both.  Thankfully, the latter greatly outweighed the former.  There's little point in delving too greatly into what most reviewers found negative -- the stilted love scenes and the phoned-in performances of half the cast -- so I can only review here what, to me, the story and the imagery meant.    As a piece of cinema, \\"Watchmen\\" has been unfairly treated as mere comic book fare.  The fact that it was meant to provoke thought and change how we view heroes (among other brainy topics) was largely ignored by the American market.  That has been reflected in its lackluster box office starting with week two of its release.    It's a shame that all too often we as moviegoers look at a film on a bland surface level and only critique a par of quality based on other movies.  What I figured out after reading the comic, and was hit in the face after watching the film, is that \\"Watchmen\\" is about archetypes, symbolism, and a hard look at our own culture.  Every costumed crusader represents a facet of crime-fighting comic heroes: Manhattan is the god-like power; Rorschach is the Batman-esque thirst to avenge crime; Night Owl II is a bored rich kid; Silk Spectre II is obliged, etc.  Like a Star Trek world of extreme narrow behavior of its inhabitants, the Watchmen characters reflect what we think of ourselves and how we interact with society and all its ills.    If one looks past the bright colors and the shlock Hollywood aspect of catering to the masses with obligatory action film elements, you'll find that \\"Watchmen\\" is deep.  Very deep.  The only problem, is of course, its massive complexity.  My wife told me, when walking to our car, that she gave up trying to focus on details early into the movie and tried to look at the big picture.  Ah, I told her, the big picture is what's really important.  But she fully understood the meaning of the characters and the moral quandaries, ala \\"Batman: The Dark Knight.\\"    I think my favorite line in the movie comes from the Comedian, in response to Night Owl II.  \\"What happened to the American dream?\\" Dreiberg asks.  Blake says \\"This is the American dream.\\"  (Or something to that effect.)  Wow!  I got the energy of \\"V For Vendetta\\" in that moment: who is really watching over us, and why shouldn't we pay more attention?  We've achieved the American dream of prosperity and being lulled into security.  Ah, but what a paradox!  That moment of seeing Blake amidst the ruins of the riot and silhouetted against the wall of the American flag was brilliant.  He is the protector and the oppressor all in one; I'm so glad they kept his original costume from the comic: the red, white, and blue shoulder armor makes him a perverted Captain America at the same time that he brutally fires upon the discontented.    Who really watches the watchers?  Hopefully, after seeing this movie and digesting it a bit, we will.  The visceral nature of a film, full of bloody motion life and sound, will always hold that edge over print.  Although I prefer to think my way through stories and problems instead of simply watching them at 24 frames per second, I highly recommend \\"Watchmen\\" because of one reason:    It made me think.  And thinking is the foundation for any healthy society.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|\\"Like a Virgin\\" honestly is not my favorite album from Madonna, but I do remember it vividly as a kid, it was the first time I noticed Madonna, this beautiful, playful, spunky young lady with the confidence to match. I remember how the title track rocked the world along with its video. Other songs on the album that I remember well are \\"Dress you up\\", \\"Over and Over\\", \\"Angel\\" \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Pretender\\". This is the album that made Madonna into an MTV Pop Icon, a classic.

1416550542|5.0|I actually groaned out loud when I saw how big this novel was. Lately, I just don't have the time for big novels and somehow, they always seem to disappoint. Not this one. This one was worth every single page. It was delicious, mysterious and definitely spell-binding. Just when you think you have got it figured out, it changes course and throws you for a loop. It has been a real long time since I've been taken in for a ride ... especially with a novel. This book did it.    It sounds confusing. The author skips back and forth from generation to generation, from the early 1900s to 2007 and in the mid-70s as it covered several women's voices. It starts out with a little girl found abandoned on the ship that landed in Australia. On her 21st birthday, the man she thought was her father told her the truth about how she came to the family. Ever since then, Nell was on a quest to find out who she was. Why was she abandoned? Who left her? Who was the Authoress? Nell died before her answers came to fruition, but her granddaughter, Cassandra, took up the cause after her funeral, when she discovered that she inherited a little seaside cottage in Cornwall, England.     The voices of Eliza, the Authoress, Nell, Cassandra, Rose, Nathaniel all came alive in this book. The secrets that seem to haunt them finally were revealed ... and Cassandra, suffering from a tragedy of her own, finds hope again.    It is a very well-written novel. It entertwines the stories of generations at the same time it prods the reader along the mystery that is meant to be discovered. The center of the novel is the little garden that Cassandra has started to clean up ... a truly forgotten garden held with lots of secrets. This novel has it all ... historical fiction as well as contemporary fiction and mystery all combined into one big book. Like I said, it is worth every single page of reading.     4/16/09
031237593X|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman transforms Richard III from all-time villain to tragic hero in this rich and well-told historical novel.  For someone with only a basic knowledge of English history I expected the Richard III of Shakespeare lore, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the direction this novel took me.      Penman takes us from Richard's childhood, through the reign of Edward IV, into his own brief tragic reign as King of England.  All of the details are there and are accurate.  I couldn't help but do my own research and yes, I found all of the events as described. The story of the Princes in the Tower has always been shrouded in mystery, but Penman gives a plausible explanation that vindicates Richard III.      It is Penman's ability to bring life to these historical characters that make this novel stand out.  It is a heart wrenching, sad tale, and Penman does not glorify the horrible violence of that civil war, but she helps us understand the motivations of this late medieval time period.  I highly recommend this novel for fans of both history and fiction.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|Well first off i would like to start this review by saying that Jon Avnet is not really a very good director, and the only film he is really recognized for is Red Corner(1997 Richard Gere), which was pretty good but not stunning. Secondly it seems Al Pacino(my icon) likes his direction because this is the second film that Al has done with him(88 minutes)in the past 2 years which was stated as being one of Pacinos worst films ever. I did think 88 minutes was cliche' to say the least but it was 10 times better than this film mainly because Pacino acted his butt off for a very sup par film. So that said al and robert being on the big screen together was one of my dreams come true, but that dream fell short when i started about 10 minutes into the film and realized what i was about to witness.        This movie is riddled with horrible dialogue, a cliched script and screenplay as i said before and just a horrible sense that the film was rushed. This could be in a literal sense of the word considering when you watch the movie nearly all the scenes between al and Robert and anyone else for that matter seemed very rushed and they never had any time to just sit and feed off each other like it should have been. Heat was the first time they actually talked face to face and in that short 10 minutes or so it is still one of the greatest most classic scenes in movies today. Now as for the movie itself basically the whole premise is the two detectives trying to find a serial killer who's basically murdering the murderers but eventually points towards a cop, thats it, thats all. The ending of the movie while clever still cant hold together the overall plot and really you may be suprised but disappointed because you wished it had been the end of a \\"better\\" movie. So in closing of this short review the only thing that saves Righteous Kill for even a casual viewing to see these two legends together and is in fact themselves that barely hold it together, they are the only reason to even bother. Any other actors that may had been chosen for the film would have sent this straight to DVD. And while these performances arent even close to there best, they both bring there own unique talent to a very tedious, rushed and at times boring movie. Lets hope they have enough in them before 70 hits to maybe reunite again, with a very great director. Michael Mann where are you?:(    Also note Jon Avnet trys to get away with slick suprise endings, well it didnt work very well in 88 minutes, nor does it in this film. Also i find it amusing that it says a Jon Avnet film, like he's a grade A top director. Not so either. Just pick it up you'll see what i mean.
0060763280|5.0|I thought this was a very revealing book regarding the attitudes that we carry, and how they can be detrimental to our ability to create wealth.  It makes you stop and think how you think about wealth, and people that are wealthy.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their attitudes about their aspirations of what they can attain, and just see how each of us could possibily be holding ourself back, just with our attitude.  Very inspiritional!
1416550542|4.0|In the hands of a less gifted storyteller, the act of telling the tales of three generations of women, stretched across eras and continents, would have resulted in an unmanageable mess.  Instead, after a short period of introduction and adjustment to Eliza, Nell and Cassandra, the reader finds herself jumping effortlessly back and forth between their three stories as one family's great secrets are finally exposed.  At first, when you don't know the three women as well, the unannounced jumps between turn-of-the-century England, 1920 Australia, mid-1970s Australia and England and finally current-day Australia are jarring.  But stick with it.  Once you make friends with these women (and you will), and as their stories begin to lead to the same conclusion, you hardly notice being pulled back and forth across time, in and out of each of their narratives.  And after 550 pages, you'll surprise yourself by wishing the book were longer.

To this day, songs like \\"In my Dreams\\" \\"It's not Love\\" and \\"Unchain the Night\\" stand up, not to mention stuff like \\"Lightning Strikes and \\"Jaded Heart\\" If you like melodic hard rock with killer guitar, this is a must have.
B001AUKUTU|5.0|After 1985's \\"Sacred Heart\\", the ensuing tour, and the 1986 release of the \\"Intermission\\" EP, Dio had released four recordings in four years, and seemed to have \\"jumped the shark\\" in terms of repetitive lyrical content (dungeons, dragons, fire, stone, rainbow, etc.), pop-metal compositions (\\"Shoot Shoot\\", \\"Hungry For Heaven\\", \\"Mystery\\", \\"Rock And Roll Children\\"), and an overly elaborate stage show (Ronnie James Dio battling a dragon!).  Not to mention that original Dio guitarist Vivian Campbell, a wonderful player, defected in 1986.  What would become of Dio?<br /><br />The answer comes in the form of this dark, slightly decelerated collection of songs featuring new Dio sideman Craig Goldy, previously of Rough Cutt and Giuffria.  \\"Dream Evil\\" is a sophisticated Dio record that is more than the sum of its parts, with songs that are all at least very solid, some spectacular, and certainly the most impressive Dio collection since 1983's seminal \\"Holy Diver\\".<br /><br />The mood of the album is dark, with little reprieve, beginning with \\"Night People\\", the album's standout track; a furious bit of machine-gun riffing and effective keyboards from Claude Schnell.  \\"Dream Evil\\" features a guitar riff that is first cousin to that in Rainbow's \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\", a mid-paced rocker.  \\"Sunset Superman\\" carries a ferocious groove, while \\"Overlove\\" is a fast track with a thirty-second opening showcasing Craig Goldy's ability to play it fast and fluid.<br /><br />The songs that begin to veer toward pop territory, \\"All The Fools Sailed Away\\", \\"Naked In The Rain\\", \\"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\\", and \\"When A Woman Cries\\", are all cut short of that point either thematically or musically, leaving tracks that ache with regret and anguish.<br /><br />Individual performances are all excellent on this record, with RJD delivering his typical, high-caliber metal vocals, Craig Goldy turning in an impressive debut (although his playing certainly lacks something of Vivian Campbell's pyrotechnics), Jimmy Bain and Vinny Appice ably locking down the rhythms, and Claude Schnell supporting all of it behind the scene with tasteful, unobtrusive keyboard work.  The only track that sounds dated perhaps is \\"When A Woman Cries\\", the one song in which keyboards are featured prominently and lend that peculiar \\"80s\\" quality.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a fan of classic heavy metal, or a Dio fan who hasn't yet purchased \\"Dream Evil\\", do so now!  If you're new to Dio, this is a good place to start, as well.

0061438294|5.0|I have been in law enforcement for close to 30 years on a large agency- I am always on the lookout for useful tools of the trade that I can use and pass along to my investigators.  This book is great!  It is packed with useful information.  No, I am not a shill for this book and do not know the author- although I have met many professional law enforcement investigators who have written good books and manuals.  I am impressed with the insights and natural techniques contained in this book.  I am ordering a copy for all the investigators in my unit, I am that impressed with this book.  Sure, there is always something about any book that does not satisfy a reader- but I honestly must say there is little about this book that I didn't like.  UPDATE 6/2016: It's been over 7 years since I wrote this review.  Time flies... I still regard this is a &#34;great book&#34; and highly recommend.  I since have retired from my command position with the department I worked for (retired 3/14), where I was in charge (Captain) of the investigative units that handled homicides, sexual assaults, child abuse, domestic violence, internet crimes against children, juvenile division, elder abuse, financial crimes.  Feel free to look at the size of the agency- [...]  My rank was Captain, and the entire investigative division was the Central Investigations Division.  Over my nearly 4 decades in law enforcement (since retirement I have joined another agency as an investigator), I have raked in hundreds of training hours attending countless classes, seminars, conferences dealing with advanced investigative techniques- including interviewing and interrogation, reading body language, etc. Additionally, I still teach in-service and college level criminal justice courses to investigators and those majoring in criminal justice.  I am presently an adjunct college instructor in criminal justice.  I believe I can rate this book with some &#34;authority&#34; as to its subject matter, and my rating of it as a 5 star book still stands, and still being great, is based on my experience(s).  I have in fact purchased copies of this book for those who have worked for me.  I still highly recommend this book.  A few &#34;commentators&#34; over the years have attacked my initial review and tried to discredit it by questioning the veracity of my claim to being in law enforcement in a command position over an investigative unit.  They based their opinion seemingly on the basis of their &#34;CSI TV influenced deductions&#34; that because of the venacular I used in my review, I &#34;obviously&#34;, by one commentator's deduction, was not from any known (at least to that persons vast experience) law enforcement genre. Nor would any law enforcement command-type person, again in their opinion or vast LE &#34;experience&#34;, ever purchase anything for their subordinates.  All I can say to them is wow...&#34;get a life&#34; and please move on (and I hope you never get jury duty for anything truly important).  To those 600+ people who found my intital review helpful, thank you for apparently believing I am who I professed to be in my initial review, which was the basis for that review.  The author of this book, and this book, is deserving!
B000ICLRIE|4.0|the first hour of the K of H BD is so-so.  after that first hour - the picture quality jumps up considerably - a fact noted by a couple of online forums.  great 3-D pop and revealed visual details.<br /><br />considering all the extras, and the better-realized director's cut - this is a recommended buy!
B001608QVS|4.0|Everyone should already know the plot to these movies, so I will tell you why I rated these a 4 instead of a 5.  The Transfer to Blu-Ray was soft. I saw very little difference between a regular upscaled DVD and the Blu-Ray edition. I watch it on a 60 inch 1080P Sony, which really upscales with excellence.
6304712936|5.0|This movie was absolutely astounding!!!! I loved it... The costumes, the scenery, the actors and actresses... Just amazing! And the music... Indescribable! I loved how they put this together...    I've been studying Mozart for a while... And I won't make any assumptions, but most of the facts were true I believe. Of course I haven't been researching his life for years and years... But most of it is quite accurate my by studies. : )    I know Mozart was in fact very spontaneous and loved to 'live life' as he told his father in his letters. He also did love women as well. He ALSO was witty and had a very 'wicked' sense of humor. Tom Hulce played him with just the PERFECT amount of eccentricity! It was great!    I LOVE THE LAUGH TOM HULCE GAVE HIM!!!     Ahahaha!!! Ha! Ha..! Ha... Ha?    ***** 5 STARS!

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Based on the award-winning play and adapted for the screen by John Patrick Shanley, who also directs this film, \\"DOUBT\\" is a riveting, powerful film full of raw emotional drama that registers as something truly worthy of praise. It has been made outstanding by the exceptional performances that would give you goose bumps and enough meat to talk about after the first viewing. It is just a film almost impossible to ignore with its superb direction, beautiful but simple cinematography--truly an awesome blend of solid storytelling and powerful performances. I was truly awed.<br /><br />A year after the Kennedy assassination, in a Catholic church with a school in its grounds, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a progressive priest with ideas that defy tradition. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is a traditional nun who is also the school's principal, who believes in protecting and preserving known rules and old-school beliefs. The two are meant for a battle of wills and on the sidelines is naïve sister James (Amy Adams). When Sister James brings her observations to Sister Aloysius about the things she had seen about a lone African-American student, Donald. The school principal is pushed to believe that Father Flynn may have an undesirable relationship with the young student, without the benefit of solid evidence. Flynn denies the charges that leads the elder nun to pursue an audience with Donald's mother (played by Viola Davis), leaving Sister James confused and the matter eating away at her conscience...<br /><br />I know what you're thinking--who is right and who is wrong? Did Flynn really molest the boy? With the film's very strong Catholic overtone, the direction presents a very suffocating screenplay. Both Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius appear to have the best interests of the boy in mind, both characters are sympathetic and believable; even Sister James have her heart in the right place. I suppose if there are any bad guys in this film, it would be our own PERCEPTION. It sends us to a wild moody set piece that bring us to the uttermost places of uncertainty.<br /><br />Catholic authority is also somewhat called into play as this church is obviously one divided by gender (as illustrated with the separate scenes of social intermingling at dinner). One may think that Aloysius has the motivation to grab power from Flynn, the script effectively represents the psychological dissertation between our two main characters. The film goes into the opposing viewpoints--things that need to be changed within the confines of the rectory and things that need preserving. It was a nice to touch to see Aloysius annoyed when Flynn wanted sugar in his tea. Both sides have a point, but it is difficult to take a side and nor does Shanley point an accusing finger. The dialogue is very strong and the material is well structured; the screenplay is very enthralling as it takes the viewer to behavioral actions that provokes our curiosity. Director Shanley also takes a look at the premise and methodically shows the larger picture, at the same time it kept on generating a strong uneasy feeling that can get under your skin.<br /><br />The lingering suspicion is powerfully played to its fullest and I will be honest, it is driving me crazy. The excellently staged exchanges of dialogue between Streep and Hoffman are truly awe-inspiring. I have always loved both performers and this movie just justifies my reasons as to why. The more they bicker and argue the more the truth becomes cloudy. The two have good reason to protect the details from each other's eyes, and I have to commend the script by Shanley; he obviously chose the words carefully--with the sole purpose of confusing, provoking our senses and engaging the viewer in its sequences.<br /><br />Aside from Hoffman and Streep's exchanges, there is also a very emotionally charged exchange with Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), Donald's mother. That scene almost made my jaw drop as I was very moved with theirconversation. Donald is a child with a huge problem--is Father Davis helping or is he taking advantage? Sister James doesn't think so after she had a conversation with Father Flynn in the garden. Amy James does feel a little too ditzy, and I guess that is just the way her character needed to be portrayed. The film is just a marvelous roller coaster of emotional exchanges and when you have such performers as Hoffman and Streep, you will have to prepare to be absolutely impressed.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" has marvelous writing that fabulously challenges the viewer to question and well, \\"doubt\\" the film's resolution. Shanley made a wise move in not dissecting the truth, and express the insidiousness of rumors and gossip. It also makes a bold statement about faith, tradition and trust that sometimes we need to listen and restrain our potential for damaging perceptions; and Shanley amazingly does so without discrediting religion. \\"Doubt\\" is a powerful motion picture since I am certain that I will be pondering its final act long after the end credits stop rolling. Those who like their moral dramas with an absolute resolution may be a little disappointed, but for those who doesn't mind pondering what they've seen are in for a treat. I like films that leave me asking questions, it is a welcome departure from the usual Hollywood fare that spoon-feeds the answers.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!!

B001PPLJJ0|5.0|One of the truly spectacular performances by arguable the best actress of our generation. This movie is not a mainstream commercial movie,  so please do not expect a popcorn movie like plot. This one is for more mature movie watchers who look for depth in movies. The movie is set in Nazi Germany during world war II and starts with an affair that Anna Schmidt(Kate Winslet) has with a 15 year old boy. As the they go their own ways, their paths cross when Anna is convicted for war crimes in the post war time. As they grow older, their past haunts them...<br /><br />Excellent casting for the movie and beautifully directed. One of the best movies of 2008 and one of the best female acting performances of all time.
B001PR0Y4Y|4.0|\\"Adventureland\\", the new film from writer-director Greg Mottola (\\"Superbad\\") is a pretty good film. A coming of age story set in the late 80s, Mottola weaves a realistic story about recent college grads who are trying to earn some money and have some fun over the summer. The film is surprisingly intimate, and reflective and I would have to guess it is based on Mottola's own experiences. But it isn't that funny and proves to be another example of a bad marketing campaign promising one thing when the film is made to deliver something else. This may eke out a few dollars for the studio, but it will probably back fire and cause the film to lose more prospective viewers than it might gain.<br /><br />James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, \\"Noah and the Whale\\") graduates from college and tries to eke out a couple of hundred additional dollars from his parents; they have already promised to pay for a graduation trip to Europe, before he goes to grad school, and he and his friend want to extend the trip a little, so he needs more money. But his parents (Wendy Malick, Jack Gilpin) have some bad news; Dad is being transferred and will make less money. They can't afford to send James to Europe and grad school is doubtful as well. James tries to find a job, any job, but can only get hired at Adventureland, a run down theme park run by Bobby (Bill Hader) and Paulette (Kristen Wiig, both of TV's \\"Saturday Night Live\\"). James is thrust into a job running Games, despite his desire to join the more interesting and cooler group of kids running the Rides. On his first day, he meets Em (Kristen Stewart, \\"Twilight\\") and he seems surprised that she is actually responding to his goofy flirtations and sensibility. And Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), the head of maintenance, walks through the park with the approving eye of the girls and the awe of the boys.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg is near perfect as James, the nervous kid who is getting closer to being on his own, making his own way through the world. He is still a kid, despite graduating from college, and is disappointed and shocked to learn he won't be able to join his best friend on their planned European tour. He is a smart kid, the type of kid who uses these smarts at inopportune times, inadvertently making others look stupid, which gets him into some trouble. He is also unsure of himself and seems to be shocked every time a girl even gives him the time of day. When he and Em start to hang out together, he is delighted but also more nervous because she really seems to like him.<br /><br />Eisenberg has primarily played high school kids, so it is nice to see him playing a college graduate, however immature. It works to his favor that I kept thinking he was in high school, because James is not very mature despite his education. When Em invites him to a party, she coyly asks him if he wants to go swimming. She proceeds to strip and jumps in the pool. He is game and strips down to his underwear before jumping in. After a few minutes, she wants to get out and dry off. He has to wait a few minutes, before getting out of the pool. It is a nice, touching, very human moment.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is also very good as the unpredictable Em. Already very confused, she meets James and they become friends, flirting consistently. She really likes him and they go out on a date or two. But she has other influences in her life, influences that are hard to kick or hard to correct. Throughout, you can see little glimmers of hope in her eyes. Maybe my life can become less dramatic, less plagued by trouble. But one of these influences is very familiar, and easy, despite the consequences, so she keeps finding her way back to this.<br /><br />And because these kids are young, and aren't paying rent or mortgages, if anything gets too heavy, they simply face the problem by announcing \\"I quit\\" and run off to be by themselves. When the problems follow them home, they realize the solution isn't that simple.<br /><br />Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig provide some whacked out laughs as the couple who are \\"in charge\\" of the theme park. Bobby immediately runs to the rescue of any of his employees, fending off bullies with a baseball bat and a psycho attitude. Paulette stands on the sidelines, admiring Bobby when he is called into action to run one of the games, remembering back to why she fell in love with him in the first place. Despite their relative young age, you get the feeling they have been in this business for a long time and they have the answers to every situation.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds plays Mike, an older guy who performs maintenance throughout the park. As he struts through the grounds, everyone seems to regard him in awe. His age and his status as a struggling musician make him cool to both the boys and girls. The guys want to be him; the girls want to be with him.<br /><br />There are a number of other memorable kids who work at the park and intersect with James and Em.<br /><br />But \\"Adventureland\\" is not a comedy, not really. There are some funny moments, but these are more observational moments. And they are few and far between. It seems misleading to advertise the film as a comedy, but this genre is easier to sell and will probably generate more ticket sales. But as word spreads, how will people deal with the fact that the film is a drama? A good drama? It seems like this practice would alienate people. People looking for a comedy will probably be disappointed. People, who want to see a good drama, won't realize they have a potential film under their nose. It just seems like a lose-lose situation. Why Miramax? Why?<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" may seem a bit like a retread, but it is actually fairly unique. Most coming of age stories deal with high schoolers, kids either in high school, soon to graduate or graduating. This film depicts kids who are a little older, college graduates, but they still don't have everything figured out. As we watch them deal with the problems they experience, we identify with them. Most of us didn't have everything figured out when we graduated college (and many still don't) so the story of these kids speaks to us in a way.<br /><br />Written and directed by Greg Mottola, the film is based on his own experiences in the same situation. I am sure much of what happens to James probably happened to him, in some form. And because so much of the story comes from a personal place, all of the characters seem more real, more interesting. From the nervous energy surrounding James, to the laid back attitude we see in Em, to the cool vibe coming from Mike, we have seen these types of characters before, but Mottola gives each a new level of detail, bringing them more sharply into focus.<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" is a good, interesting coming of age film.

0425152251|1.0|This book was terrible! I actually enjoy philosophy but even the philosophic parts were terrible. This book was incredibly slow and dry and the plot was ridiculous. I can see what the author was trying to get at but it was just completely awful, if i could give this book negative stars i would.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|\\"Let the Right One In\\" is another film I missed during its theatrical run. The Swedish horror film was released in the frenzy around \\"Twilight\\", trying to capitalize on the similar themes, but I suspect it got lost. That's a shame because \\"Right One\\" is a better film than \\"Twilight\\" and one of the better horror films I have seen in many years.<br /><br />I don't go to a lot of 'horror' films anymore because too many (most) are simply excuses to try and gross the audience out. Very few try to create any real horror, any real suspense. The days of \\"Psycho\\", \\"The Haunting\\" and \\"Halloween\\" (the original directed by John Carpenter) are long gone. The best horror films create a mood and place and leave a lot of the horror to your imagination, letting us fill in the gory details. This is much better because our minds know what makes us shiver better than watching images trying to frighten us with blood and guts. Grossed out is not the same as scared.<br /><br />\\"Let The Right One In\\" tells the story of a 12-year-old girl, Eli (Lina Leandersonn) and her grandfather who move into a new apartment in a bleak complex in the dead of winter. They don't come out often and the gossips start to cackle. Oskar (Karl Hederbrandt), a little boy with few friends who has to deal with constant bullying at school, lives in the next building over. One night, he sits in the middle of their snow-covered courtyard and they meet. Oskar and Eli, both outcasts, become friends. As their friendship grows, Oskar begins to suspect his new friend may be a vampire, but seems to be more intrigued by that, rather than frightened. Eli's guardian, caretaker, lover? goes out and tries to find fresh blood for her. But he is getting older and starts to make mistakes. After he is no longer able to supply for her, she ventures out on her own, afraid of what she has to do, out of practice. But Oskar has problems of his own and seems to become more and more empowered by his friendship with the strange girl.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" has moments of blood, moments of violence, but these seem designed to punctuate the story, focus our attention, to remind us of the gravity of the situation. A lot of the more horrific moments in the story are hinted at, or occur off-screen, allowing our imagination to fill in the blanks. This is exactly how a horror film should be and what made this little film so memorable.<br /><br />Director Tomas Alfredson weaves the story back and forth between the two children, showing us how their lives are different and, in many ways, similar. Then, when they meet, he adds a third element and gives us moments of their lives together, showing us how each is changing the other. It is a very nice portrait of these two very different kids and how they cope with their individual problems.<br /><br />Apparently, others feel the same way, Hollywood has already purchased the rights to make an American version. I hope they won't, but know they will, make this new version as gory and bloody as most other Hollywood offerings.<br /><br />Catch \\"Let The Right One In\\". It is surprisingly good, surprisingly subtle and surprisingly wonderful.<br /><br />It also has one of the most memorable climaxes I have seen in a film in some time.

B00000K0EA|5.0|This DVD arrived earlier than expected.  It was an excellent copy of a very good and exciting movie.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie is so excellent. Ledger's performance is really shocking and creepy. He leaves you expecting what he will say or do with every scene. If you are a comic book fan you can really appreciate Ledger's performance of the Joker. The movie overall is shot great. Its a pitty comic movies are never up for best movie awards. This one is certainly better than those other nominees.

B001AEF6D6|5.0|It well may be.  I've never been a fan of  his although in early adolescnce I adored his father, Lloyd.  Still, every time I see him in a movie my estimation of his ability rises notch by notch.  And in this inspired farce he's simply, complicatedly wonderful.  It's a buddy flick, and he plays against John Goodman, that inspired farceur who earned his stripes and paid his dues playing the tender side of the mad, manic, monomoniacal virago ROSEANNE, in the TV Sitcom of the same name.  A decade in that well-paid hell gave him nuts enough to do anything, and here he shines as a psychotic Viet Nam vet.  (Satiric portrait of Ms. Barr?)  But then, the entire cast is so brilliant they make your teeth itch.  Can't name them all.    But without going any further I have to tell you that there are several intense sections in this flick that have some of the best effects of good Jazz, and by good Jazz I mean the best jazz.  Particularly, here, Count Basie's music.  Basie's approach was to float a secure, framework of familiar song in blues mode, and to let the band's soloists work their specialities in the time alotted, when their turns came up.  Simple, but with Basie, the soloists were so fantastically good, and so (mutually) energized by being free to improvise and encouraged to do their 'thing,' they rocked the house and each other to hights beyond nightclub high.  And its much the same here.  The \\"Mistaken Identity Whodunnit Flight From Armed and Merciless Crazies\\" is a standard in movies, since Silents, and though brilliantly revived here by Les Cohens, the seance comes to life when the soloists get their cue.  Bridges & Goodman play as close as nested spoons, riffing and grooving with such great timing and virtuosity they're like Jimmie Noone and Joe Poston at the Apex Club.  Weep for joy!  You can go back again and again to try to see how they do it.    Is this the best edition of the film available on DVD?  Don't know.  Can't comment.  Mine features the Cohens themselves, in an interview about how the film came to be, and to my mind its worth extra bucks to watch those two sitting, side by side, twisting their fingers, tearing at their cuticles, wringing their hands, scratching their heads and rubbing their eyes -- not quite in unison; its not quite a choreography of Ritilin-fueled siamese hyper-activity -- and talking in manic but repressed monotone about the creation of one of the best movies since the end of WW II.    The plot?  Read another review.  Its a take-off on or homage to Chandler and Hammitt's novels, stories and screenplays, set in the chromium glitz and glare of East Hollywood's neon-spangled hamburgeries and bowling alleys.  Amazingly, in all its dizzying detail and with its huge cast of extras and bit-players, everything fits.  The attention these geniuses pay to every detail of the production is awe-inspiring in total, but to try to describe the film adequately would require a piece of writing that demanded more time to read than the movie requires to watch.  Not worth it.    My particular favorite bit?  The recital of the Dude's Landlord.  The Landlord himself (a short, balding, pudgy, middle-aged schlepp) is so tiny a part -- of only two or possibly three short lines -- that it's obviously a throw-away character.  And then, somehow, and without explanation, The Dude and  his crew find themselves members of a tiny audience in a makeshift theatre, watching a one-man performance of some kind; a dance and pantomime performance to brilliant modern symphonic music, as highh-minded, intense and serious as it is ridiculous in its ineptitude.  And then, long after the scene is over I came to realize that a crucial part of the Dude's rental agreement is or must be, that he he appear with his friends at the Landlord's Performance Art events.  Throwaway.  High Art in L.A.  And eventually, in this Mardi Gras parade of geeks, freaks and wanabees, the Dude impregnates a chic, international dyque-as-femenist and certifiably crazed Performance Artist -- though we never get to see her in action in one of her own works -- we see her in a Buzby Berkley Bowling Ball Ballet dream sequence of the Dude's.  Don't ask.  Its like those great insights they told you you were supposed to get when you first took LSD or Mescaline.  Such insights didn't exist, but the rationale within the fantasy of easy enlightenment was just so damned interesting.    If you haven't seen this movie you've nobody to blame but yourself.
B00006JDVV|4.0|This was a bit different than one expected. There was no nonsense, no tongue-in-cheek humor or special-effects just for the sake of it: this was simply a humans vs. dragons story taking place in the future. No laughs and nothing hokey, which is what I expected. They played it straight, simply as a fight story between the two parties.    Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure. The dragons were realistic-looking, the scenery dreary but the story interesting and intense in spots.    I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a night of adventure on film. You could do a whole lot worse, especially with two young actors who have arrived as stars: Christian Bale and Matthew McConnaughey.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|I can't understand how people can say this sequal is not as good or not better than the first.<br />Do you miss Vin? He's kinda irrelevant to this story. The action is there. great driving and stunts. Paul Walker is just a fun guy to watch. I recommend it. I own it and watch it all the time.
B001P9KR94|4.0|I thought the best part of this award-winning film was the photography, and this Blu-Ray disc makes this movie magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! This DVD transfer is very sharp and the colors are bold as can be. It makes me glad the film won the Oscar for cinematography.    Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of \\"City Of God,\\" about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.    The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" quiz show. Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that. It's one of those stories where all the little pieces fit together in the end to explain why things happened in the start of the film.    Overall, it is entertaining and certainly a feast for the eyes on this Blu-Ray disc..
031606792X|1.0|For me, this series was getting progressively worse since the end of \\"New Moon,\\" so I really didn't have very high expectations for \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" However, even those relatively low expectations were too far reaching. Simply put, Stephenie Meyer Can. Not. Write.     What plot there might be in \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is simple enough. Bella and Edward continue on with getting married. Jacob - who we all thought would be left well enough alone - somehow manages to find his way back into the story to become Meyer's whipping boy. (What DOES she have against this character, anyway??) Bella and Edward finally consumate their relationship, and, wonder of wonders, Bella actually gets pregnant! Not entirely a bit surprise, Bella achieves her life's single goal in becoming a vampire, and the Volturi make a comeback. And it takes almost 800 pages to tell this tale. T E D I O U S...    Now, there may be some SPOILERS in this, so preceed with caution! Ms. Meyer actually does bring up several interesting situations:     - Edward suddenly turning into an incubus (which IS different than a vampire, something I know and I'm not even into the whole vampire thing) is casually mentioned.     - The concept of a vampire impregnanting a human - HUH?? - and the possibility of a mutant vampire child is just glossed over completely. Ms. Meyer comes up with the idea, but really has no explanation for it that makes any sense and it is simply left there for the reader to accept. It never worked.    - After Bella becomes a vampire, there is the complex issue of \\"facing her father.\\" Here is where Jacob gets to play the heavy, for what reason, I've no idea. However, this was a complex issue that could have really been delved into. Instead? Charlie has the equivalent of sticking his fingers in his ears, closing his eyes, and yelling \\"La, la, la, la.\\" That is, until Emmett turns on a game. Now, I have issues with the way Charlie is portrayed. He is always some lame, doofus, always in the dark, means well, but just doesn't \\"get it.\\" Hello!! The man is the Chief of Police for Forks. And granted, Forks is not as sophisticated as New York or LA or even Seattle, yet if you look at the credentials for the REAL Chief of Police for Forks, Mike Powell, you will find he is college educated, is in an executive level of management, and is responsible for a number of staff - hardly the bumbling idiot Ms. Meyer wants to portray a small town hick police chief. (Perhaps Ms. Meyer might have done better creating a fictional place, hmmmm???) This whole scene was played out very poorly, very poorly indeed. But, if an author wants to present older adults as foolish and incompetant, well, then...    - What is the author's beef with Jacob? She likes him, she hates him, she likes him. He's sweet, he's nice, he's got an attitude, he's okay. He's off into the woods to find himself, he mysteriously shows back up to subject himself to Bella. He's there to keep Bella warm - WTH!?!?!? You mean with all the supposed money the Cullens have, and the fact they can't feel temperature, they can't turn up the heat in the house? Or buy an electric blanket? No, Bella insists on Jacob? And anything bad that happens is the fault of Jacob? And, while everyone else gets a happily ever after, Jacob falls in love with Bella's kid? What, the poor guy is never to be rid of this *itch? Now, she's to be his MOTHER-IN-LAW? And she's going to live forever, so he is NEVER going to be rid of her? Sheesh, Ms. Meyer, you really thought of a way to torture the guy, didn't you?    - The whole Bella as a Mary Sue was tiring and the number one thing one should NOT do when writing. How so? Well, everyong marvelled at how Bella was so in control for a newborn vampire - she was able to control her desire for blood. She had super-powers to outdo everyone. Bella is, quite simply, perfect. Bleh!    - One thing that truly bugged was the out and out ridiculous nature of this book. It went beyond laughable and into the eye-rolling, wanting to bang my head against a wall. For example: when Bella first \\"comes to\\" as a vampire, she and Edward go hunting. Naturally, Bella doesn't notice what she is wearing. (Huh? How could one not?) Now, I don't know what I would wear, but I'm thinking traipsing around in the woods, killing woodland creatures - probably calls for scrubby jeans and an old top. Not for Bella - blue cocktail dress and heels. (Compliments of Alice, supposedly, but just a sample of the stupidity)    - One thing that will drive me to distraction with a book is poor editing and proofreading, and this book is filled with that. For example: on the morning of her wedding, Bella fixes pancakes for Charlie; however, 2 paragraphs later (on the very same page) it states that Charlie is scowling into his cereal bowl. Interesting way he has of eating his pancakes. Later on, wearing the blue dress mentioned above, we are initially told it's silk, then suddenly it's satin a page and half later. Evidently, there was a BIG hurry to get this book out.     Overall, this book was really no surprise. Twilight was okay, especially for the audience intended. New Moon was alright, except for the exceptionally cheesey ending. Eclipse was a disaster, and this is just a natural outcome from that. I can say I read the series, but I would not give Stephenie Meyer anymore consider than I have at this point. She is not worth it. I feel sorry for the teens and young adults being swept up into her tepid writing and considering it \\"good.\\" There is so much really good writing out there, and to be taken in by this drivel is such a sad state of affairs.
B00003CXC7|5.0|It took me several viewings over many years before I really appreciated this film. Now I absolutely love it. Next to Psycho, it's now my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film.  Having it on a pretty-clear DVD transfer didn't hurt, either.  Eventually, I'd like to see a sharp Blu-Ray version of this movie.     \\"Rear Window\\" still dated quite a bit with the dialogue, but the focus of the story, namely Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment, never gets old.  It is a storyline which entertains and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart provides the fun and Grace Kelly is there for looks.  The people Stewart observe are really interesting.    Speaking of dated, can you imagine all the people in the crowded  apartments keeping their blinds open all the time?   Maybe it was just a more trusting world back in the 1950s!
B001EL6EH2|1.0|Reading the advertisement you are left to believe this would be a re-mastered version, but it was only a rerecorded copy on Blu-Ray.  Not any better than could be expected from a good DVD.     Missed to mark entirely for blu-ray.  Great movie - but DVD would have been the correct choice
B00015YVDG|4.0|If your ears can withstand a ton of profanity and usages of the Lord's name in vain, then this movie offers good entertainment. Otherwise, obtain one of those profanity filters or skip this film because there is a ton of swearing.    There also is a ton of suspense as the police race to save a young boy from a vicious kidnapper. That's not exactly something new, story-wise, but it keeps your attention for the full two hours. Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Deroy Lindro, Gary Sinise, Lily Taylor, Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg make for a deep and talented cast.    The action wasn't overdone and the story was a very involving one. I only had one criticism of it but if I mention it, I ruin the ending. Suffice to say this was an intense, interesting movie marred only by overdone verbal blasphemy, most of it by Gibson (in his pre-\\"Passion\\" days, obviously.)

B000001GX8|5.0|This particular recording shows Herman Prey at his finest and in one of his most performed roles!  In my opinion, he is the greatest Figaro that we have on recording!  Fischer-Dieskau's dark nature which he put into the Count is done very well, but at times he over-darkens his voice.  I enjoyed his singing in the ensemble numbers but in 'Hai gia vinta la causa' I felt that he put more weight that was needed and should have made it a bit more lyrical.  Even though the Count is enraged, that does not mean that you sacrifice good lyrical singing for choppiness.  At the end of the aria where he has a trill on E3, I felt that it was more of a trillo than a trill and it felt as though he was just pulsating the voice in a choppy manner rather than doing an appropriate trill.  If one can not trill appropriately one should not attempt to.  The entire cast, as a whole, is very good but I will say that I purchased this recording mainly to hear Prey and Fischer-Dieskau, and although I was not impressed with the counts aria, both performers pleased me in their respective roles.  As a whole this is definitely a recording worth purchasing!  In reccomending another recording I would say that the Met's production with Te Kanawa, and Hampson would be the best one over all, especially if you are wanting a recording which has great singing from the Count and the Countess. This recording with Prey I would suggest more for those interested in hearing a good Figaro!
B001CZVVW8|2.0|The singing is splendid but the production was unacceptable to me. The lighting was so dim that in many places one could barely make out what was going on. The famous letter scene was sung against a dark blue background that was so dark one could see almost nothing. The minimalist scenery was dead dreary and what was there from time to time was so ill lit one could not appreciate it. Such a pity as the cast was good. If you just want to listen this is fine but if you also expect to watch this performance give it a miss. I doubt I will watch it again and regret the purchase.
B000001GXI|5.0|Within this recording of Mozart's Die Zauberflote, one finds an impeccable recording with some of the greatest artists of the mid-twentieth century.  Fischer-Dieskau performs a wonderful Papageno, and is probably the best operatic role that he every performed!  Wunderlich was an amazing Tamino!  If there is any reason to buy this recording it is because of those two artist alone.  Bohm does an excellent job with selecting tempi and keeping the opera flowing.  This recording, performed by German Cast, definitely brings out the essential qualities of the Singspiel and truly maginifies one of Mozarts Greatest operas, next to Don Giovanni! I highly reccomend to anyone, to purchase this amazing recording!

Soon Fuller is found dead. Naturally, his college is suspected. Douglas must find the message before he is incarcerated.<br /><br />So far, this seems standard formula. That is where the formula ends. Douglas must go into a computer simulation to retrieve the message, not so easily done.  The simulation takes part in the 30's.<br /><br />Meantime back in the real world Fuller's daughter shows up to everyone surprise, as no one knew he had a daughter. How will she figure in the mystery?<br /><br />For people that grew up in L.A. you may recognize some of the locations such as the RMS Queen Mary.

1439102813|5.0|This is a really very interesting (and emotional) story about the early onset of Alzheimers.     To read about the early symptoms, effect on the person - Alice - and her loss of control of her life due to this disease, made this an eye-opening read.     I learned a lot from this story whilst enjoying the well written story that unfolded on the pages.  The author has captured the emotions and experiences that many families (and sufferers) must go through when Alzheimers is diagnosed.      Highly recommended book to all readers (with a box of tissues by your side).
0525478183|4.0|Before ordering this book, understand that it's geared toward the young adult reader.  Once you know that and keep it in mind, \\"Paper Towns\\" is a solid book, written well.<br /><br />It's a fun story, and easy to understand and follow.  But the characters and the plot aren't very deep. (Again, remember the target audience!)<br /><br />John Green manages to capture the emotion and chaos of high school life quite well.  At least, as *I* remember high school!  And he also deftly sets up the main plot without giving away any hints. While the core of the plot is rather simple (Where is Margo?) sub-plots spin away so effortlessly that the average reader might not even notice the ride.<br /><br />I found a quick, but rewarding read.<br /><br />I'm passing this book on to my niece.  I'm sure she'll enjoy it more than I did... even if she doesn't pick up on the nuances.
0385339585|1.0|This book came in horrible condition even though it was labeled \\"very good\\" When I contacted the seller his explanation was \\"what do you expect?\\" I expect the book to come in the condition it was described or at least a refund.
0525478183|5.0|This is the first novel I've read by John Green, so I wasn't sure what to expect. All I can say is that I got hooked from page one and felt myself being reeled into this crazy young world that turned out to be not what seemed.  Paper Towns is original, creative, thought-provoking, and funny as hell. I laughed, became worried, felt and loss hope and was just exhausted emotionally once I finished the last page. Honestly, this was a great story. I won't put in any spoilers, only a recommendation to read Paper Towns, no matter what your favorite genre is. It's for all types of readers and for all ages. I'm sending this to my niece with instructions to send it back to me when she's done!

B001PR0Y4Y|5.0|If you're expecting a Judd Apatow comedy or a raunchy teen sex romp with little-to-no sentimentality or meaning behind it, rethink your viewpoint on this film's marketing campaign.<br /><br />What Adventureland is, in my opinion, is nothing less than maybe the Breakfast Club of today; no other teen film has had such an impact on me as the classic Jon Hughes film has, until I saw Adventureland.<br /><br />You will definitely laugh, yes; but if you have the brains to do so, you'll have affection and empathy for these characters(not only the two leads; nearly every player here is important) and feel the touching coming-of-age romance between Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart(who is millions of miles better here than in Twilight, giving a much more superb performance and playing a much more interesting character than bella swan ever was).<br /><br />What am I doing? Trying to give this a calm and professional review? Let me just come out and say it: I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!! I can't think of a teen film this decade that can compare with this one. I saw it a second time 2 days after opening night, because I knew it deserved a second viewing, and I'm excited for my third, because I cannot stop thinking about this movie. It made me happy at the right times, sad at the right times, and as for Greg Mottola, this is a great improvement over Superbad(which I actually find to be very overrated). I thought that was okay, but this is a much more personal, and real project for him.<br /><br />This is one of the best teen movies I've ever seen and without a doubt my favorite film of 2009 so far (yes it beats out Watchmen, much to my own surprise). I went in expecting to have the kind of good time that most Apatow-esque comedies give me(like the recent \\"I Love You, Man\\"), but I got much more than that.<br /><br />(oh, and if you're into the kind of 80's music I am, you will love the references to Lou Reed, David Bowie, The Replacements, and Husker Du)<br /><br />...I still don't think I did this film justice, nor do I think I ever will.r will.

0743582055|5.0|This is the first, and to my knowledge, only, reference guide to conduct that applies exclusively to bros and their conduct with each other.    It is being hailed as a \\"wonderful work of satire\\", and \\"great for fans of the show.\\"  I am glad that the curators of this tome have found success for connoisseurs of parody and situational comedy.  While this may be valid, this work is, in fact, a definitive source of guidance on how one interacts and behaves with, in regards to, and around, his bros.  As such, it should be treated with reverence and honor.  Any humor to be found within is usually found from situational references, either from this \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" series (I may have to watch it, someday...), but more likely from one's own history with his (or her) bros.    I have used this guide as a reference to dictate actions in no less than two critical bro-related situations, and it has helped me to maintain my bro-status among my bros.  While there is nothing saying I would not have made the same decision without The Bro Code, it provides me a set of rules to reference in times of doubt, or at least to help justify my position.    While not discussed directly in The Bro Code, I believe that bro-type behavior should not be used exclusively with one's bros.  Rather, brohavior should be practiced in most areas of life and relationships.  To that end, I have provided copies to all my bros, to help guide them in their decision making.  I even provided copies to my supervisor and my brother-in-law, even though I would not technically call them bros.    In truth, this work applies to all walks of life.  While it is geared specifically for bros and bro culture, it centers around the theory of \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\"  That philosophy could serve to be explored in a more expansive work, possibly using stories and a mythology to help provide examples of how one should live their life according to a code of morals and ethics.  Such a work could be religious in its impact...    But I digress.  I can say this without hesitation:  This guide has merit.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to be a better friend, a better person, and, naturally, a better bro.

159102594X|4.0|I've read a lot of fantasy novels and tend to gravitate towards either very thorough large worlds (George RR Martin, Steven Erikson) or less large worlds, but shot through with humor and strong characterization (Feist).  Abercrombie is more towards the latter but with strong writing skills that really draw you in.  He tends towards a very active pace and doesn't have a huge amount of patience for lots of exposition or world building.  No maps either which drives me crazy as I can't quite figure out his world layout.  But no matter, he has built strong multi faceted characters that do things in human and unexpected ways and he has a very good and strong sense of satire and humor that undercurrents everything in a winning way.  Not recommended for the squeamish - one of the main characters is around torture a lot and there are many scenes of torture and physical abuse in the book.

B0007TKNII|1.0|Here is the deal, lets summarize this.. I realize I am the 1600'th person to review this on Amazon, so no one may ever see this, but I couldn't let all these 5 star reviews pass.  I love Phantom on stage.  I really do.  I have no problem with the most of the casting of this movie as well.  I'm sure all the actors can sing and they seem to fit their roles.  But let me sum up the issues.  As a movie musical this movie SUCKS because:  * Joel Schumacher is an idiot  * it plays like the play was rewritten as a romance novel (a bad one), then that romance novel was rewritten into a screenplay then they filmed it.  *Gerard Butler should be much much uglier in his phantom makeup.  MUCH uglier  *this the biggest one - the lip synching is just awful.  Nobody expects the singing on the soundtrack to be the singing that was actually sung by the actors on set - BUT - they should actually full on sing their parts when on set.  Rossum at times look like she is barely breathing but and her lips are a split second off and yet the soundtrack would have us believe she is belting an aria off the charts.  *sets are shot to close and not used to good effect to give us the grandeur of the setting - it undercuts the themes and music    I was basically angry for 2 straight hours watching this

B0014Z4OL6|4.0|It is normally believed that if a prisoner starts accepting ideas and principles of his captors (think Patty Hearst) they suffer from Stockholm syndrom. But what happens when a prison guard starts to see truth in the words and actions of his prisoner?<br /><br />\\"Color Of Freedom\\" is a story of two men Mendella and his prison guard Gregory.  Gregory earns his job by virtue of knowing african language used in South Africa.  He uses that to censor Mendella's mail and monitor conversations during visits from Mendella's family.  While Mendella spends 27 years in prison fighting for the equality of South Africa's blacks, Gregory simply wants to earn means for his family, he has no high ideals.  That does not diminish is his genuine humanity.  By being part of the system he gets to see what is happening between blacks and whites in his country firsthand.  His decency forces him to open his mind to what Mendella is truly trying to change in South Africa.  Slowly, Gregory and Mendella establish bond through their personal tragedies and political changes in the word that force South African leaders to eventually free Nelson Mendella from political prison.<br /><br />How much of the story is true will be known only between these two men.  All we as viewers have to do is accept well meant intentions of the message of the movie.  That we are all human with our basic emotions, needs and desires.  It takes time to attain our ideals, purpose or subdue the emotional (invisible) pains of our souls.  Freedom has no color - it just is.

B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" was the beginning of a time when The Beatles could be taken seriously for their music.  They were developing as artists and their early Beatlemania days were just about over.  Don't get me wrong, I like the early hits (\\"She Loves You,\\" \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand,\\" etc.) as much as the next guy, but if you're a musician, it's also good to get variety and depth into your repertoire.  The period of late 1965 through '66 marked that period of evolution, making the Beatles more than just cute faces.    Every song here is good.  \\"In My Life\\" could possibly be the greatest song Lennon ever wrote.  The sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood\\" adds an interesting touch, because it was something different than just having bass and guitars.  \\"Nowhere Man\\" proves that the Beatles were still able to maintain their unique harmonies.  And others, such as \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"Run For Your Life.\\" are just plain fun to listen to.    This album, and its companion, \\"Revolver,\\" are the two best albums The Beatles ever made, in my opinion.  Sgt. Pepper is a close second to these two.  But then again they had so many good songs, it's really hard to pick favorites.

B00006I53S|4.0|Purchased this to go with my XSi and have been pleased so far. I used it on a recent backpacking trip and it really produced some great quality shots. I also have a 17-40mm L and to be really honest I can produce about the same quality pictures from both lenses. I do slightly favor the L for its wide angle, but this one is a definite plus with IS.     The build quality is pretty solid overall, except for the lens creep. It seems to be \\"standard\\" on this model lens for the zoom to extend out while carrying it. Can be annoying, but still worth buying. This is the only reason for the 4 start rating instead of 5. As far as the lens hood, forget about it. Have taken numerous pictures with and without it and it really doesn't make a difference, it just takes up added room and a pain to keep it on while in a case. I also noticed that in some circumstances I was getting a little lens flar, until I discovered that it was from my UV filter and not the lens itself. All that they say is true about cheap brand filters-avoid them. I would recommend this lens, but be aware of the lens creep, good quality for the buck, especially if you can get a mint copy of a used one.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Don't get me wrong: I'm Roman Catholic and I like Mel Gibson. But this is one Holy Turkey, for behind all the blood, violence, controversy and gore, lies a very silly picture.<br /><br />At its core, the film states that Christ redeemed humanity by enduring more physical abuse than any other man in history, if not mankind altogether. That's not only false but absurd, and taken to extremes, utterly ridiculous. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop Mr. Gibson: his Christ goes through such outlandish beatings -one more preposterous than the last- that any skeptical viewer ends up laughing well before Our Lord gets nailed to the cross. Is this Jesus Christ we're talking about, or is it John McClane?<br /><br />No, seriously: early in the movie, even before he's taken to the Sanhedrin, Jesus is thrown off a bridge while tied to a rope (a torture not recorded in any Scripture but Mel's). Inches from the ground the fall stops in what surely looks like a paraplegic lesion at its very least. Any human body subjected to such injury would be unable to stand up or walk, let alone sustain a flogging, or carry a heavy burden. But this Jesus takes that and more. Hell, if Martin Riggs can take it, why not God? That's why He gave his Only Son such chiseled Caviezel abs!<br /><br />And what's with the demonic fellow, by the way? Why must there be a physical bad guy in the movie to incarnate Evil? Isn't all that violence enough? Satan is such an obvious clich&eacute;, audiences can anticipate his every move. For instance, having betrayed Jesus, Judas is on his way to hang himself when he sees a woman carrying a veiled child. Just as the baby's head starts to turn, we already know he's going to be a ghoulish sight. Sillier still: at the very moment Christ expires, the Devil shouts in agony \\"NOOOOOO..!\\" and disappears, just like a vampire on a stake would. A choir of angels singing \\"Ding, Dong, the Demon's Dead!\\" should follow.<br /><br />Superman vs. Goblins. Come on; is this the extent of Mr, Gibson's faith? Let's hope not. If so, he'd better go back to Sunday School next weekend and get his Christian basics right.so, he'd better go back to Sunday School next weekend and get his Christian basics right.

B001LRJH0K|4.0|Westerns are few and far between anymore. Fortunately most of the ones made now are pretty well done. Appaloosa is in fact, very well done. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, and Renee Zellweger give fine performances along with the rest the cast. The costumes and sets will make you feel more than this is a re-enactment. Harris directs this one with a mixed style. The story is a tale of two lawmen in the old West. Plenty of realistic action in this old John Wayne like story (two lawmen against big corrupt rancher, e.g. [[ASIN:6305754969 El Dorado]]) with modern hard hitting style like [[ASIN:B0000TANUI Open Range]]. This is a movie that should entertain any adult or youngster with adult consent.

0385474547|2.0|I read this recently for a university African Lit class (though I am 40 yrs old), and found it rather dull and uninspired. I realize that its simplicity is parts of its appeal, but it felt overly simplistic to me. Some memorable passages for sure but the writing just did not resonate with me. The message is worthwhile but the writing not so much.    In fact, this is one of the least interesting books I've read so far in the African Lit class.  Much prefer Ngugi's \\"Grain of Wheat\\" and Mahfouz's great \\"Miramar\\" (though it's not sub-Saharan Africa).
031606792X|1.0|I was afraid to read any of the last three books after reading Twilight because I didn't want my vision of Edward & Bella to be tarnished, but I couldn't resist the love story, that thought consumed my day. I was very satisfied with New Moon and Eclipse.  I found that each book was better than the last.  I should have stopped at Eclipse in retrospect. Meyer took a beautiful love story and turned it into a bloodbath (literally).      I wanted to stop reading Breaking Dawn several times.  I laughed outloud at some parts, not because I was amused by the line but by the ridiculousness of ALL of the nonsense that was the story.      I would love to ask the author if she read this book when it was completed and if she was proud of her work.  Doesn't she have people that would tell her how badly she ruined Edward & Bella's love story for all of us readers?      For a week as I was reading the first three books I lived vicarously through these characters lives wishing I had a life filled with hot vampires and werewolves.  I laughed and cried and couldn't wait to keep reading.  Meyer ruined those feelings for me with the conclusion of this Edward & Bella story.
B000EDKQPC|5.0|For a student of any type of music, there is so much to obsorb just listening to these clever, inventive and pleasant compositions. It is truly the one of the best collections of true musical invention. Everytime I listen, I hear something new, it is great.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z is one of those books you hope never ends.  The characters are well written and just seem to come off the page with true emotion.  This book really goes into what our world climate would look like should a zombie apocalypse take place.  How would the nations react?  What drastic moves would world leaders take to defend their homeland?  Also, it really goes into the human condition.  How far will a father go to provide food for his family?    This book feels totally real.  It takes a popular fantastic idea, and puts it into the real world to see how real people would deal with this dark war.  You must read this book!

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|This album by Madonna was released in 2008.  It is a dance-pop record, with an urban pop vibe.  It's a very good album with a contemporary feel to it.  Madonna adapts with the times and remains relevant.
B000063V8T|3.0|I found the episodes in season 5 to be a bit lackluster. There seems to be a very large change in the writing staff.   Many of the episodes felt like reused ideas from earlier seasons and the more original ones just weren't very good in my opinion.    Too much Troy and Riker, not enough Data. There is almost no Picard. While he is in almost all the episodes, he doesn't ever do anything (except squeel \\"Abandon Ship\\" once like a scared girl, totally out of character).    I was VERY surprised at how many episodes there were in season 5 that I had not ever seen before. That was a pleasant surprise, but I think I see now why these episodes are not re-run very often.    One of the episodes in season 5 is one of the best of all the TNG episodes. Inner Light is the title I think.    I still plan to buy season 6 however.

0316067601|5.0|Luttrell's rant about the liberal media, really, IMO, concerns the American press and their lack of coverage of Israel's well-documented record of atrocities against civilians (tens of thousands of civilian murders since it's founding, including 500 in their latest \\"punishment\\" in Gaza) including the aforementioned murders, policy of collective punishment for any settlement suspected of harboring resistance fighters, their policy of constantly firing on ambulances and preventing red cross/crescent or press access to areas for a week a more, etc..And, in the latest Gaza Massacre, there wasn't even a clear objective but for the ruling party to show it's \\"tough\\" stance on the Palestinians.  The US media are such careful watchdogs and ready to scream bloody murder for any US action vs civilians taken in necessary protection of themselves, yet Israel NEVER receives any criticism from the same US press. Does the IDF or Mossaud worry about civilian casualties and attacks in the US media and thus the possible cutting off of their 4 billion per year in aid plus arms? No.  Why?  Especially given that America's Israel-based policy in the Mid East led to the 9/11 attacks and thus the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  This is what the US media hides from the average lemming.  Why?  And this, I suspect, is Luttrell's frustration, though he could not cite \\"Israel\\" or no major publishing house would touch it.  This is what he cannot come to terms with; it's the 800 lb elephant in the room.  Why one standard for Israel in the US press, one standard for American forces?   I'd love any explanations.      And save your \\"anti-semite\\" accusations, as my jewess wife feels the same as I do.  Israel must be treated as any other nation and must be held to the same standard and the same geneva conventions the US is held to.  It's simply not right for the \\"american\\" media to scream bloody murder on our own troops and ALWAYS give the IDF a free pass regardless.
0525478183|4.0|This book really doesn't enrapture the reader in the story as much as you go along for the ride because you hope it is actually going somewhere.  However, it is fairly well written and is of more interest to boys than girls since it deals with a male viewpoint despite the appearance of a girl on the cover. A young man learning about the mysterious ways in which girls, or at least a few, behave.  The ending is good and less depressing than most teenage fare.
1427206031|5.0|I've never tried an audio book before. When I opened the box for \\"Paths of Glory\\", I looked at the 9 discs and wondered where I would find the time to finish listening. Once I started, however, I got pulled into the story and found myself listening to a disc per day driving to and from work.    Paths of Glory is a compelling novel about the life and times of George Herbert Leigh Mallory, a man who may or may not have been the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Born in 1886, his father realized that George had no concept of fear by the time he was 10 years old. As the story unfolds, I grew to like George very much - he was presented as a very forward-thinking young man, believing his sisters should have the same opportunities as he for a good education. He also was a bit of a show-off, climbing up and down Ben Nevis ahead of his climbing group and earning 6 belt swats from his teacher in the process!    The lifelong friendship between Guy Bullock and George was also well told. Their exploits in Paris at the Moulin Rouge and George getting arrested for trying to scale the Eiffel Tower had me laughing out loud more than once.     George never was one to let anything get in his way - be it a locked door at Cambridge, a sheer rock face, a building in Venice, or the love of his wife, Ruth, he was able to surpass any obstacle that presented itself. I found myself respecting him all the more when he felt it was his civic and moral duty to fight for his country, even though schoolteachers were exempt from this service.     Once George started on his mission to conquer Everest, he met up with a dear friend and a great rival at the same time, George Finch. Even though he would do anything to reach the top of the world before Mallory, both Georges had a deep respect for each other. Mallory threatened to quit the Royal Geographical Society when the committee tried to have Finch removed on the grounds that he was Australian and not educated at Cambridge. His pioneering work with using oxygen at high altitudes was not initially shared by Mallory or other climbers, but this proved invaluable for future expeditions.    I found myself wishing, hoping, that George would come back down from the summit and make it home to his wife Ruth and his three children. Alas, this was not to be. It would be 75 long years before anyone found George's body, and even today, there is wide dispute as to whether he reached the summit or not.    The story was told by Roger Allam, who is best known to me as Louis Prothero from [[ASIN:B000PC0U1W V for Vendetta]], as \\"The Voice of London\\". I can think of no better person to narrate the epic tale of George Mallory than a man who once exclaimed, \\"ENGLAND PREVAILS!\\". His captivating voice held my interest throughout each of the 9 discs - he was able to pull off French, English, Latin and Italian verbiage with no difficulties whatsoever.    I was truly sad when this audio book finally ended. I want to know more about George Mallory and his trek up Everest; and thankfully, there is no shortage of books on the subject. If Jeffery Archer wanted to get people interested in the tale of George Mallory, he definitely succeeded with me.     I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mountain climbing, or anyone who has a long trip and needs a good story to listen to.

Most of his hits are in the DVD.  Of course, not all of them are.  But then again, with the multitude of hits he has, you can't expect him to sing all of them in a 2-hr. concert.  Rest assured, though, at least 2 of your top 3 Stevie Wonder songs will be here.

B00168OIP8|2.0|I am a great fan of Risky Business, but this edition is pretty disappointing.  The picture quality and sound are fine, but you'd think with the advent of Blu-Ray and all of its storage capacity, that they could have actually spliced the director's cut last scene onto the movie!  Instead, you have to watch the scene on its own, so it's impossible to tell how it really flows with the film.     Also, I'd love to watch the commentary, but I refuse to watch it picture-in-picture, which is really distracting.  Once again, where is the option to turn off the picture-in-picture?    I'd love to buy Blu-Ray, bit it seems that you really need to wait and buy discs that take full advantage of the medium...otherwise it's a waste.
B000002AQQ|2.0|2 CD set, 1 CD with many scratches, first 2 songs dont play, one of them being best song.  Very dissappointed
B001QWBM62|5.0|I am aiming this review at the guitarist or soloist on any instrument who likes to study/copy lines from recordings of their favorite musicians or create their own backing tracks out of anything from their cd collection.    After working with the H4n for a couple of weeks, I am truly amazed by the features of this recorder when you delve a little deeper into the manual, especially in the MTR (4 track) mode.  The manual could be better written, but with a little experimenting, it's pretty easy to understand.  The Karaoke section of MTR mode is really useful not just for Karaoke, and here are some work-arounds that the manual does not explain.    What if you want to change the key of a recording you have made, and then change its playback speed also?  Changing playback speed is available only with a stereo mode file, while changing key in playback is only available in MTR mode.  If you record a song off a CD in MTR mode, do so by setting \\"stereo link\\" which will record stereo on tracks 1 and 2.  For playback, turn on Karaoke which allows you to change playback key as well as a center cancel useful for removing vocals or lead instruments if you want to make a backing track to practice over.  When you are done, use the \\"bounce\\" feature to create a stereo file, and then the \\"move\\" feature to move this file from MTR project to a file in the stereo folder.  You now have a stereo file in the key of your choice and can alter playback speed and use the A-B repeat to loop a section for practice. This will make sense and be easy to do if you have the manual in front of you.      For doing your own music transcribing, this recorder is great.  If you have directv or cable, look for the OVTV (Ovation) station which is always running programs of the Montreux Music Festivals.  You can find some great music to practice with here.  On Directv it is located somewhere around channel 260.    Summing up--the H4n is a brilliant little device with great sound and a deep set of features.  Musicians should check it out.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The Second Season of Supernatural is even better than the first one! You won't be disappointed: the show is epic, enthralling, gripping and often breathtaking and frightening! A masterpiece!
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory has humor that geeks will get and love, but also make these jokes in a way that you don't have to exactly know what they're talking about to roll on the floor laughing. There are so many jokes in each episode, it's excellent. There's also a storyline, so the story is going somewhere. My only complaint is that there weren't enough episodes in the season, but b/c of the writer's strike, every show in the 07-08 season was shorter than normal. More extras would also be nice, but there's never a lot of extras on TV DVD's.
B001R88C6I|4.0|In 1999, `The Thirteenth Floor' was a film with an interesting concept but since it came out after `The Matrix', the film kind of wasn't all that popular in the US.  But if there was one thing that `The Thirteenth Floor' would be known for during the beginning of the DVD era and most likely now with its Blu-ray release is the fantastic audio.  For audiophiles looking for a film that is up there there in quality HD sound, `The Thirteenth Floor' sounds absolute beautiful in Dolby TrueHD!<br /><br />\\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" is a film based on Daniel Galouye's book \\"Simulacron 3' and directed by German director Josef Rusnak and produced by Roland Emmerich (Director and Producer of \\"Independence Day\\", \\"The Patriot\\", \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" and \\"10,000 BC\\").<br /><br />The film takes place in the late 1990's and starts off with Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl), an owner of a multi-billion dollar tech company known for it's work in virtual reality simulation.  As he quickly visits the bar and gives an urgent letter to the bar keeper Jerry Ashton (Vincent D'Oforio), Hannon visits a local bar and meets up with someone he knows but is stabbed to death.<br /><br />The film then shifts to his good friend and protege Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko) who is contacted by the authorities specifically by LAPD Detective Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert) for questioning in regards to Fuller's death.  While both Hall and McBain visit Hannon's suite, they run into a woman who says that she is his daughter Jane (Gretchen Mol) and just came to town to visit her father.<br /><br />As for Hall, he is shocked that his boss and good friend is dead but he feels that perhaps Fuller may have left him a clue in the virtual reality world that Fuller has been downloading into.<br /><br />The concept of virtual reality with Fuller's technology is that a person has the ability to download themselves into a player and thus acting them out in almost a real-like world.  For Douglas, he downloads himself into John Ferguson during the 1920's where he sees a version of Fuller and also meets up with the barkeeper (who has the urgent message written by Fuller and has read it).  He tries to visit the online world and the first time he gets into that virtual world, he is shocked by how real it is.  But what Ferguson doesn't know is that the barkeeper has seen Hall/Ferguson switch bodies and thus causing implications in the virtual world.<br /><br />Things get out-of-hand during the second visit in which Ferguson meets up with Fuller to discuss this urgent letter that he wrote to him.  Ferguson meets up with the barkeeper to find out why he has taken the letter meant for him and the barkeeper tells him that the letter contained information about the End of the World.  In other words, driving to a location and finding out that the world that they (the characters in the virtual world) live in, is not real.<br /><br />With someone from the virtual world now knowing the truth that their existence is not real, he shoots Ferguson to see if he will die.  Fortunately, for Hall, he returns to his reality.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Detective McBain and the authorities have a received an eyewitness report that Douglass Hall was responsible for the murder of Fuller and thus arrest him but release him out on bail when they have no real evidence against him.  When McBain tells him that Fuller's daughter is not who she thinks that he is, Hall becomes even more confused.<br /><br />That is until he drives to \\"The End of the World\\" and realizes that all this time, the world he lives in is a virtual world and he is a virtual character.  Shocked by this development, Douglass tries to find out the truth of what is real and what is not real and who may have killed Fuller in his world.  The person who may have the answer is the woman pretending to be Fuller's daughter.  Thus Douglas begins his search for her.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 2:40:1.  In some scenes, the picture quality looks good but for some other scenes, it looks aged.  So, picture quality is a bit uneven at times.  The film tends to use a lot of darker colors.  A lot of blacks and if there is one thing that makes the film look cool is the actual use of city lights, the city look and just its use of darkness.  The setup for the virtual world is OK despite it being ten years since the film came out.  There are some technology featured on the film that shouts \\"1990's\\" but overall, the way the film goes from present time, to the past and then to the future, I liked that aspect.  Granted, comparing it to \\"THE MATRIX\\" which came out a few months prior, unfortunately budget wise, the film didn't have the same quality or high technology type of feel.<br /><br />If there was one thing going for the film, it was its use of audio.  I remember during the initial home theater discussions for DVD's, \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" was among the top DVD's around 2001-2002 that were looked at as \\"reference\\" DVD's to show off one's home theater system because of the awesome audio.  I remember testing the audio in my older receiver and just to hear the glass shatter, the virtual reality beams making its' noise to gun shots.  The film's audio quality was just awesome.<br /><br />So, needless to say, I had high expectations for the Dolby TrueHD audio for this film and sure enough, it didn't disappoint.  The film came out loud and clear and I felt the sound all around me.  The glass shattering and the virtual reality beams just sounded enormously sweet and overall, if I had it any louder, I think I could busted my eardrum.  Now granted, with newer films that scream of gorgeous sound like \\"Quantum of Solace\\" and \\"Transformers\\",  for an older film,  \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" is just audio goodness and despite being ten years old, the film is just amazing to listen to.  Its definitely a disc worth picking up to showcase Dolby TrueHD sound.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" unfortunately does not come with as many special features as its original DVD release. Included on the Blu-ray are:<br /><br />  * Commentary with Director Josef Rusnak and Production Designer Kirk M. Petruccelli - The commentary track features Josef Rusnak but if anything, with the film utilizing so much production design, it was a good choice by Rusnak to include Kirk M. Petruccelli to discuss a lot of the work he had to do for the film.  If there was anything that I found quite intriguing in the commentary was Rusnak's comment about the end.  He filmed so many different endings and even 'till now, he is not sure if he chose the correct ending.<br />  * Music Video of \\"Erase/Rewind\\" by the Cardigans - An older music video by the Cardigans.<br />  * Previews: Film trailers<br /><br />The original DVD had a few more special features such as the audio test utilizing the film \\"Godzilla\\" which Emmerich did direct, production notes, conceptual art gallery and special effects gallery.  Not quite sure why they eliminated those.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Personally, I actually enjoyed \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\".  It was an interesting concept about virtual reality worlds and what if those virtual reality worlds created other virtual reality worlds and thus, I'm sure it can get quite confusing.  Especially if one is able to freely travel to different eras.<br /><br />But part of the problem with \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" is that with a $16 million budget, there is only so much you can do.  And with a film like \\"THE MATRIX\\" coming out a few months before \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" back in 1999, they have their similarities but special effects-wise, \\"THE MATRIX\\" was just a significant film, while the \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" didn't have any super star power behind it and didn't do well in the box office.<br /><br />But I watched the film several times over the years andthere's something about the film that has that \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" holodeck vibe, the adventure of visiting other worlds in different eras and combining the sci-fi time travel, suspense and in the end, \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" is a thrilling story.  I felt that Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol did a fine job with portraying multiple characters and their mannerisms.  But It's just that with a small budget, there is only so much you can do in terms of special effects.<br /><br />But despite its shortcomings, \\"THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR\\" is one of those films that is worth giving a chance and who knows, you may enjoy it. I certainly did.  And as for the audiophiles, this  film will definitely be a pleasuring auditory experience.as its original DVD release.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|I loved the movie, Return of the King, especially the background music.  I just had to have that music.  It's hard to find a particular item at the local Border's, Best Buy, etc., but I know I can always depend on Amazon to come through with the product and at a very reasonable price.  The Lord of the Rings was an amazing trilogy, and the music was equally amazing.. . especially for Return of the King.  My sister introduced me to the trilogy, and I remember it as a wonderful time because we were engrossed in this movie, and ate popcorn and junk food, and it was a nice memory in my life.  Listening to the soundtrack brings that memory back to me. . but the music in itself is truly beautiful.  I bought 2 copies; one for her as a gift, and she was so pleased because she had been looking for a copy and couldn't find one.
B00003JA7P|3.0|Barely a year after the triumph of  [[ASIN:B000MU4F5Y SGT. PEPPER'S]] and their subsequent numerous Top 40 singles, the unparalleled and cohesive unit that was the Beatles lay in total disarray. Cooperation and co-inspiration between band members had given way to backbiting and blatant avoidance. This sad turn of events was unintentionally chronicled in the double-record set known as the WHITE ALBUM.<br /><br />These recordings are not so much the Beatles as they are John and friends, Paul with backup, etc. Quality on the WHITE ALBUM varies widely. The excellence of \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" \\"I'm So Tired,\\" \\"Long, Long, Long,\\" Blackbird,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" is offset by throwaway trivialities like \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" \\"Martha My Dear,\\" \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey.\\"<br /><br />John Lennon comes off worst here, for several reasons. Because some were busily parsing his songs for hidden meanings, John responded by creating nonsensical lyrics for many of his WHITE ALBUM contributions. \\"Glass Onion,\\" \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun,\\" \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and others are the result of his ill-advised playfulness. The inclusion of Yoko Ono in the chorus of \\"Bungalow Bill\\" was as much in error as was the chorister who kept singing \\"Buffalo\\" instead of \\"Bungalow.\\" \\"Revolution #9,\\" Lennon's Opus Dopus, defies description even as it defines drugged-out excess.<br /><br />Paul McCartney's Dylanesque storytelling (\\"Rocky Raccoon\\") makes his schmaltzy side (\\"Honey Pie\\") that much more of an enigma. George Harrison's few efforts are fairly consistent and clearly demonstrate his too-long overlooked talents. Ringo's \\"Goodnight\\" lullabye lies in stark contrast to the jarring \\"Revolution #9\\" aural nightmare that directly precedes it.<br /><br />And as for dreams, the WHITE ALBUM sessions are an eyes-wide-open indicator that the Beatles dream would soon be over.
B000000I0H|5.0|Hi guys ! I have all Mike Oldfield's albums and this is my favorite. Well, you do not need to know more about it right now. You'll realize later why the one may consider this album as his best work. Just take in consideration that this album is considered as \\"the best Mike's album\\" by one of his biggest fans. Grab it now, before it's out of stock and do not reed other commentaries. If you have a good stereo equipment (as I do) you'll be amazed. This is truly a state of the art in music performance, experimentation and spirituality. A masterpiece !
B00001QEE9|3.0|When I was a kid, I loved this movie so much I wore out two VHS copies of it, even though Monstro scared me silly. But watching it again now more than 15 years later, I have to wonder what I found so special about it. I can't really describe it, but I just feel so \\"blah\\" towards it now. Monstro is still pretty frightening, but that's the only part of the movie I like anymore. Maybe it is just me, but this movie is not as good as many of the others Disney has done.
B001SN78JO|2.0|It has a poor storyline that meanders, and often stalls. The Characters are under developed.  And then, sarcastic sexual situations or jokes are called-in to save the situation. But they do not help, they just make the movie inappropriate for family viewing. Anyway, the cast does manage some funny moments here and there.

The first one got banged up a little and went out after about 2 years. Be sure to handle with care and keep the plastic covers and keep the connections covered if you transport it around. I'm a teacher, so I take it back and forth to work and it got banged around a lot. Handle with extreme care to avoid buying another one. Probably this is the only place it's sold. It's hard to find it elsewhere.
B00005JPTK|1.0|I was not at all impressed with this film. In fact, all I remember about it was that it was very, very sad, and that I ended it vowing I would never watch it again.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This film by Danny Boyle is an interesting take on a film with a primary theme of Optimism. It's not your typical way of going about or showing us how to achieve said optimism; it shows us through real, hard life scenarios based on the book from Vikas Swarup. Through thick and thin, good vs evil and against the odds, this film takes us on a visual and audio journey within India to prove that sometimes, hope and love prevail. Is it a masterpiece? No. It's clever filmmaking from an atypical novel, shown to us in a way that explodes the senses. I see this as a twisted, optimistic love story and I personally wouldn't have it any other way.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It's a great buy.  cheaper than others like it, but still the same quality.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|I love Angelina Jolie as an actress, so I was rather excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, it bored me so much I found that I was tuning out most of it, and I even dozed off at one point. The characters were all thoroughly unlikable, the plot was nonexistent, the dialogue was uninspired, and the action was very difficult to distinguish at times. The only time I remember looking up was when Angelina stepped out of the bath. I have to say, this is one of the worst \\"action\\" films I have seen in a long while.
0312944926|2.0|This book is a technological thriller that would make a good movie, but the book needs serious revision.<br /><br />It bungles even the most basic concepts in cryptography and computer science.  I don't believe that the author has written his first \\"Hello world!\\" program; he demonstrates no understanding of computers.  Now I can usually suspend disbelief for a good story, but with each chapter the technological aspects become more ludicrous.  If you are technical, don't bother with this book.<br /><br />While the handling of technical concepts is annoying, a non-technical person might not find this a problem.  Unfortunately, the book falls short in many other ways.<br /><br />It should have explored the conflict between national security and privacy, but it sidesteps the issue in favor of action.<br /><br />It should have explored issues of good and evil and power and corruption, but it avoids them with shallow character development.<br /><br />It should have delved into legal and political issues surrounding cryptography and espionage, but in a glaring omission, it avoids them altogether.<br /><br />And finally, the climax takes forever.  The ending is so obvious and easily anticipated that it is a chore to finish the book.  Then, in the end, the falling action isn't really very satisfying.<br /><br />One star for disappointing, with a bonus star for a lot of unrealized potential.
B001993Y3G|5.0|people who slate this film remember one thing film is here to entertain not educate go back to school if you want histroical facts this film is about action  love and comic appeal it is purley here to entertain nothing else its a great movie with great actors and it has a great sound track 2 most films nowadays take this music listen carefully next time u watch a disney dvd people take films way to serouisly just enjoy them its a great movie to watch with friends and family
0439813786|5.0|I purchased this book for my 8 year old grandson's birthday after seeing it featured at my local library.  Before gifting it, I read it myself.  What a fantastic read...  This book will appeal to anyone of any age.  I couldn't put it down - the illustrations were amazing, sometimes blanketing the entire span of two pages and the story is well told, easy to follow in words and pictures but challenging enough that a person of any age will enjoy it.  I would highly recommend it for all...  It is a great book.
B001F7MSFM|2.0|I have seen both movies, and I just can't seem to warm up to any of the characters in either one. They are either annoying or all out jerks, and the girl is really waffly. I was very impressed with the special effects, however, especially the winged harpy. But the story didn't grab my attention at all and special effects are not enough to carry a movie.
031606792X|5.0|Wonderfully written. Lots of ups & downs. I could laugh & cry on the same page I loved it! I would have liked a little more detail on Isle Esme, but I understand that this was intended for young readers. Meyer definitely did not disappoint me!

044024367X|1.0|This book started out very promising, but what a let down.  A ridiculous conspiracy theory, and a political view that would best be preached by a Berkely graduate, ( or any liberal, for that matter).  This viewpoint does not sound like Reacher. I am tired of agenda's, we've had enough of that in the political arena.  Keep you political viewpoints to yourself, and just entertain us.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Definitely top-shelf, high-quality music.  I put in the same quality league as stuff such as Kind of Blue, Shostakovich #5 by L Bernstein and the NY Phil, and the 1960 recording of Antiphonal Music of Gabrieli by the brass sections of the Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia orchestras.  This is music from a band on an incredible growth curve.  I have a version of Statesboro Blues that was recorded a week after the Fillmore concerts in Atlanta -- it is even better than the classic Fillmore version.  Compare the formative version of Blue Sky from the September 1971 concert to the Eat a Peach version recorded a handful of weeks later.  Simply astonishing.    In all the reviews I have seen of Eat a Peach, I have never seen specific mention of the song Stand Back.  This was Duane Allman's last recorded work on slide guitar.  Even in comparison with the best of his earlier slide work (appropriately recognized for its brilliance) it stands as an astonishingly sophisticated bit of musicianship that gives tantalizing hints of what we have missed due to his passing.  The band offers intricate rhythms, propulsive and melodic bass playing, and serious humor in the lyrics.  And then there is the slide playing.  A masterpiece of clearly articulated melody and tight interplay with the rhythm section, culminating in a spine-tingling bit right at 2:00 into the tune.      Touch, Tone, Technique, and Heart.    Check it out.
1931955085|5.0|The book is a beautiful hardcover book with amazing pictures and sketches by Mark Ryden.

0375707972|5.0|One of this year's best books which spawned one of this years best films. The movie house only had one other viewer  on the day we attended but folks who haven't read this book and watched this movie are missing a real, realistic treat.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Keanu Reeves, you sure have a penchant for. . .interesting. . .roles.  And playing a daemon-fighting supernatural pariah in the quirky film CONSTANTINE is definitely one of them.  Wow.  The machinations and grandstanding and political posturing between Good and Evil, Heaven and Hell, are every bit as diabolical as what goes on in Washington.  Who would've thunk it?<br /><br />Reeves chain smokes, and mumbles, and sleepwalks through this role as if he wished he were somewhere else, thus making the viewer equally ambivalent.  Tilda Swinton as an androgynous Gabriel is quite the howler.  And Shia LaBeouf, isn't your fifteen minutes just about up?  Yet for everything that really annoyed me about CONSTANTINE, there were some definite pluses.  Djimon Hounsou is always good, and Rachel Weisz plays an easy-on-the-eye victim of the forces of Hades.  But I really liked Peter Stormare as a most lascivious Lucifer; Stormare comes along at the knick of time, and saves CONSTANTINE from falling apart.  Yet I still don't know why I give this movie three stars.  Guess the devil made me do it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
0316286850|4.0|Some of the makeup ideas are far fetched however the one that shows you how to look incredible with applying makeup to the right places on your face is amazing.  I have done my friends makeup at their wedding using this book and saved them lots in make up costs the day of the wedding!
0385338732|5.0|The main character Lexi Smart is lovable right from the beginning of the book.  Kinsella does a great job keeping your attention.  I read this book in 4 days (which is a record for me), because I could not put it down.  I wanted to know what happened next.  I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who likes chick lit!
1934648035|5.0|I had read the translated book in my native tongue (Greek) at an early age, but now I discover a whole new world by reading it at my 40's in English... I hope you will enjoy its wise thoughts as I did.
0060765380|3.0|A page-turning read that was a modern day blend of pseudo-science with mystical undercurrents and cold science to offer a firm jumping off point. The depth of research also gave credence to the plot's liberal scientific core, allowing you to believe and look up the various facts and test whether they are in fact true. The result was a spy novel, with heavy-hand of modernity that was basically a mystery-chase book. It brings to mind Criton, The DaVinci Code and the Patriot Games universe all rolled into one.<br /><br />The novel travels around the world in an obvious ploy towards Hollywood appeal, a la National Treasrure. Which is the main undoing of the novel- too much detail and too much over the top sequences of events. Everything fits together so-perfectly, like a Bond book, and leaves a great deal of disbelief to the whole story. Still, it was an engaging enough read, if the authors attempt at stylistic prose could be waded through. The attempts at poetic scenic descriptions were more tedious and brutal than helpful as their intended pauses were obviously meant to reflect on the various beautific locations described in the book. The characters too were entirely one-dimensional; for instance Kowalski was hinted at being more-than-meets-the-eye, yet no depth was even charted there. The writing was also at times both confusing and too detailed. Some memorable moments though were executed well, specifically the \\"Crab Wave\\" scene. Also, the good-guy bad-guy clich&eacute; was overfed to the point of distaste. It was however interesting to see each 'villain' become victim to their own vices, so the failed attempt at poetic wordplay was revived by the authors clear fascination with the horrifics of justice, or its inclusion meant to be purely for the benefit of the reader, which I suspect was mostly the case. It was a quick read, more for its pulp, Hollywood-esc distraction appeal than anything else.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|It's true that this isn't really historically accurate, but who cares? This is an ACTION film, and we're supposed to be entertained by its action-packed images that would have our adrenaline overflowing. Ridley Scott sure knows how to mix action with drama. I was greatly inspired by not only the battle scenes (both in the forest and in the coliseum), but also the visual spectacle that is Rome. Yes, it's CGI, but it looks so beautiful. The acting is also a plus. Crowe, Nielsen, and Phoenix are excellent here, though I was devastated to see that Crowe won the oscar instead of Tom Hanks for Cast Away. But anyway, they're all brilliant I enjyoed watching this film very much. Grade: A

B000PXUA5W|4.0|The instructions about how to size the strap were not included. While attempting to size the watch, one of the pieces chipped.  I did have extras and when I figured it out, was not that difficult.  I hope the 'catch' will last long.  My son was very happy and it is unique, the little soccer player and ball were a hit too.  I would recommend the watch for all soccer fans!

B0002IQEHI|5.0|This film is truly iconic.  The look of the cityscape, the beehive activity depicted from the opening frames is classic.  People use to dress in those days and they actually cared how they looked.  Grant's suit set the standard for decades.    While this film is fantastic - from beginning to end, it angers me to see the lack of recognition over the last half-century for Bernard Herrmann's music. I've never heard a movie score so stimulating, from the moment the MGM lion leaves the screen to the ending scene - incredible.      Then it struck me: Philip Glass is a an out-in-out thief.  He ripped Herrmann off - completely.  Glass is a total fraud.  Herrmann's composition and arrangement in this movie has been cannibalized and stolen by Glass in many of his supposed \\"classic\\" offerings.  A true crime.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This is an addictive game that everyone who tries it or watches it played, wants in on the action.  Playing only once is never an option!  I love it when friends of my college age kids (21+) come over and demand to play it!  When I tell their parents, they're speechless - and want a game for themselves.     I *think* each color is supposed to have the same number/set of pieces. We got duplicates of two different pieces (in place of other pieces) and another color doesn't have the same number of pieces as the others.  Is this a problem?  maybe, but it doesn't stop us from playing with it anyways!
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Thank goodness for 4X fast speed - other than the beautiful photography, which is across the country from the car,  NOTHING happens except for the highly publicized sex scene (which could have been tastfully edited to a few shots, rather than coming across like a porno).  This \\"could\\" have been a good 10 minute short.  I cringed when I just read that it was originally 118 minutes.  THANK goodness I rented....
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I give some weight to what professional movie reviewers say, but their yap that Daniel Craig is perhaps the best James Bond ever is so much hogwash. This new Bond is not handsome (indeed, he has the face of a brawling longshoreman), suave, or debonair.  He's utterly humorless.  Irony, cheeky responses, and any kind of word play are strangers to him.    Admittedly, I haven't seen \\"Casino Royale,\\" but given the critics' praise of this sequel it appears Craig is still in character.  And it's not much of a character.  Defenders of this new Grond, er, Bond, will say that his grimness is the whole point--he's out for revenge.  But all vengeance and no play make James a dull boy.      Plus, he's a pig.  When his sort-of buddy is murdered (whom Bond convinced to go with him on a dangerous trip) Bond simply picks him up and dumps him into a trash bin.  Not to hide the body (which it doesn't), not to clean up the scene or keep the corpse from further damage, but for no apparent reason at all.  Maybe the show's producers just wanted to rattle our conception of the James Bond character, or drive home his maniacal lust for revenge, or some other witless reason.    The show itself is reasonably well done and photographed, but most of the action scenes are made up of the oh-so-current quick cutting back and forth between antagonists.  The result makes the fights hard to follow and dizzying for the viewer, and the violence seem more fake than otherwise.    If it's spy vs. spy type thrillers you like, I recommend any of the Bourne movies over this latest Bond series.  They're far superior in just about every aspect you can think of.
0762434279|3.0|If you don't know anything about handling money, buy it.   If you have decent knowledge of how money and an economy works this book is useless.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have all seven books and love them even after watching the show. But it is an addictive, if you are not too careful.The books do not mention V OR Tara's Mother.  Also the whole Sam and Tara is also not mentioned. The one thing about TV is that they always have to add more details, add spice. And on more thing, the show does show parts of sex and after effects. As long as we all adults here, nothing bad happened expect some shadowing of this and that. The idea is to like or not!
0312539517|5.0|Jeffrey Archer, one of the world's foremost storytellers, has done it again with his most recent novel, Paths of Glory.  The story is a compelling tale about George Mallory and the Royal Geographic Society's attempt to place a British citizen atop the world's highest mountain peak, Mount Everest.  The novel is laced with historical backdrops and steeped in mystery as we learn what could have happened on that historical climb.
B001DU8T6S|1.0|This really sounds like a bran new Bad Company album.  And I hate Bad Company!  This paring was a real bad idea in my opinion.  paul Rodgers just doesen't have what it takes to be with Queen.  The music and the lyrics are very cheesy.  Definetly bar band sounding like Bad Company.  And the guitar!  You will not hear the signature Brian May guitar sound that you have heard in all those other Queen albums.  This doesen't sound like Brian's style at all.  It really sounds like he was trying real hard to play like Bad Company and not himself.  None of the songs are good in fact the album is so ulistnable I couldn't even hear the whole thing.  C-Lebrity is one of if not the worst songs on the album.  The lyrics are extreemly awful and self indulgent.  Paul is a horrible songwriter as well as Brian and Roger on this album.  I think what The Cosmos Rock proves is that Queen really died when Freddy died.  This is NOT a Queen album.  What it is though is pure trash.  Stick to the 70s albums.  Do not buy this unless you happen to really like Bad Company but even that isn't saying anything because nowhere on here will you find a Queen sound.  This album sounds absolutley nothing like Queen.
B0015AARJI|3.0|For close to $50 this thing had better come with the cord that you use to charge it. Alas, it did not. For shame. Seriously? They couldn't throw in a $5-10 cord after you're already ponying up $50 for this thing? Tacky nickle and diming bullcrap. At least the darn thing works.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|As a latecomer on this scene, I must tell R. M. Williams? that, whereas he is no doubt an empathizer/sympathizer with \\"Tibet\\" and \\"Tibetans,\\" this singularly powerful and evocatively \\"truthful\\" evocation is but one aspect of Tibetan life today.  Without going into the pros and cons and political yeasays and naysays of lamas and monks and the other 20 milions of Tibetans' lives and livelihoods or lack threrof, this film gives the ultimate lie to the Gollywood variety.  I had access to this fictional/real account of the handful of high plateau idealists vs. their cynical opposites, but left it unwatched for at least a year, simply because the title sounded like more of those inane, vapid, and tiresome juvey flicks about young people on the make in glitzy alpine spas.  But, vision waning, hearing impaired beyond appreciation of the original score, I found this flick a reaffirmation of basic human values and human communication.  Unlike Williams, I sense the underlying message of just-the-fact-ma'am. And the facts suffice.  This daily blog of a Beijing reporter's account of a fortnight's excursion with a self-appointed mounmtail patrol projects the auteur/creator's unblinking and unerring vision, from the opening muirder swiftlyi followed by the mindless massacre of antelope to the closing bathing ritual, the observations are true.  And every other chapter and verse is equally stunning, including the lingering quicksand death and the incredible survival of an ancient who has been forced by circumstances to join the depredation.  Those who presume to judge, either sanctimoniously or wrathfully, the lives and predicaments of others of other cultures and other creeds and other climexs and other strctures, had best look to their own injustices.  This Mountain Patrol is worthy of better support and better understanding, but, most of all, humility in assessment.
0312945973|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. It was actually a reading assignment for my ancient history class so automatically I thought it would be lame and boring. I procastinated reading it for weeks until there was only 1 week left to read it. I read this book for hours a day until i finished it in about 5 days. I ended up absolutey getting aborbed in the action of it. It was great! I absolutley reccommend it to anyone who likes to read.

B000001FMC|4.0|I usually listen to classical music, so this CD was a big departure from my usual programming, but I like what this group does.    Swing out Sister is almost like listening to a big band with a female singer- albeit a band of electronic instruments.    I particularly enjoy Ms. Drewry's bell-like voice, and she seems to be the anchor around which the group pivots.    Some drawbacks.  Often the lyrics are tailored to rhyme, not to make sense, and Ms. Drewry doesn't have much range.      The remixes on this CD are uneven.  Some of them are fun and bright, and the others are not.  When the group is having fun with a piece, you can tell it.  When they are going through the motions it's obvious too.    So what if it's not Wagner?

B000PAAJYW|3.0|Okay, I give the technical aspects of this film 5 stars.  But 1 star for content.  I like look-at-me camera work to an extent.  The acting is all the way from pretty good to extraordinary. I can feel the actor's excitement at getting such actorly things to act upon (but, still, maybe a little too James Lipton \\"Actor's Studio\\"?  Just maybe?).  The energy to keep all the balls in the air on this film is very high.  But I agree with the criticisms desiring substance over style.  This is a perfect academic case of a director going straight up his anus all the way up the alimentary canal and out his mouth again and then proceeding to take another roundtripper through the digestive system.  I get the redemptive elements, I get the human elements. I get the secular quasi-eschatological elements.   I get it. I just don't think the substance is that good.     I think the director DOES prepare us for the frogs from the very beginning of the film.  Yeah, it's a hard biblical rain that's 'a fallin' and it portends something apocalyptic.  And, lo, here comes the angel of the lord in the raps of that little ghetto boy and the psalms/jeremiads being pronounced by the little boy genius on the quiz show with the angel/caduceus symbol in the background making him look so cherubic and so forth.  I get that.  But, from what I can understand from reading commentary from the director and others, is that he was bolting all this stuff on as he went along in the filmmaking process.  Okay, that's fine.  A lot of films are made in an ad hoc, improvisatory style.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Here Mr. Anderson has made a huge stew of a movie that's never uninteresting to look at it's just. .  .look, if he's making a humanistic sermon about whatever he's thinking about in life I would prefer an actual religious sermon from a preacher who is trained at that kind of rhetoric.      Three more things: (1) the profanity.  I know it's moralistic and nancy to say so, but using it so muchjust IS lazy writing.  If I want to hear somebody spouting the \\"F\\" word in anger I can do that anytime in my own room for free.  I'm good at writing that kind of dialogue on my own.  What I want in a movie is some semblance of eloquence.  It's hard to really understand Julianne Moore's (or some other's) anger because it's all F___ this and F___ that.  In the pharmacy she went all ape caca over those poor pharmacists when she could have just demurred by saying to them \\"it's for someone i know\\" and then quietly leaving.  I understand her going off on the lawyer she's known for years and leaving a whole mess.  For me, if I'm the actor I would want more than that.  I just can't dig this Big Lebowski dialogue and come up with a real deep characterization.      (2) The self-help guru's seminars.  Tom Cruise's acting is great but if you've ever had real exposure to self help seminars and the actual content of those seminars it's some of the most brilliant balloon juice you've ever heard: Wayne Dyer's Power of Intention, Susie Orman or Dave Ramsey's financial shows, etc., etc.  The material that Tom Cruise is working with is so turgid and painfully unaware of what really motivates a crowd.  It's like listening to those old \\"Married With Children\\" episodes where Al Bundy is having a meeting with the No Ma'am group of guys, only without the truly raucous humor Al and the rest displayed.    (3)  That game show has been on for 30 years?  Not on any major television network I would know of.  It's way too nerdy and wonky.  Alex Trebek and \\"Jeopardy\\" never gets THAT rarefied.  Some variant of \\"Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader\\" might last 30 years but not this.  Only some rare opera buffs on the Metropolitan Opera are going to give you a riff from Carmen in the original French along with the melody. Only an eminent historian like Shelby Foote or David McCullough is going to be able to figure out who those quotes from coming from. But Luis Guzman?  Are you kidding. Whatever Luis Guzman is like in real life, he mostly plays hoods and lowlifes and all of a sudden he's playing some genius polymath to go up against the young geniuses.  Who's going to believe his posse.  And why do the young geniuses only have the one kid to carry them?  They've got two spoiled brats and this genius doormat.  Come on! This resembles, maybe, an old college bowl quiz show that would show up local public television stations or public access.  Maybe it is a quiz show from the magical realist land of Mr. Anderson but it sure ain't never been seen on NBC, ABC or CBS for no three decades.    I could go on.  Summing it up.  Exasperatingly watchable.    And keep saying to yourselves, people, \\"it's just a movie.\\"  It ain't kids starving in Africa.

B000003B6J|1.0|This is probably the most overrated rap group ever! I mean, their lyrics, beats, and rapping are all whack, as well as the people who like this smut.<br /><br />For good rap, I recommend Soulja Boy, 50 Cent, Limp Bizkit, ICP, MC Hammer, or Fat Joe.
1881273156|5.0|The \\"languages\\" discussed in this book are all things we know about but may not thought of in the correct way. Saying nice things, spending time together, giving presents, performing tasks, and touching are all things we may be doing already but understanding how to compliment or spend time with one another changes everything. This involves more than a quick fix, it's a life changing effort. This book has really put me in my partner's perspective of things and how he best feels loved. It's not the same way I feel loved but that doesn't matter. By showing him love, I get loved. It's an awesome thing!
0440238609|1.0|After the first book I was enthralled and couldn't wait to read the rest. The second book isn't great, but the middle book of a trilogy never is. The third book, however, made me so angry at the time I wasted reading the others. It was not some \\"anti-religious\\" aspect that made me angry- it was poor writing, creating a whole useless world in the last book and then making the major conflict resolution at the end weak and pointless. The \\"anti-religious\\" controversy was probably trumped up to boost sales; it barely figures into the meandering conclusion. So upset, so upset was I that I wasted all that time reading this series.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|These triggers are great, for shooting games.  I dont use them for every game but for shooters they are awesome.  They give the controller better ergnomics.  If you have ever disliked the L2 and R2 you will love the triggers.  They are well worth the $5.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Ever the bore Krall outdoes herself as the consummate Jazz stiff on this outing. I have a deep love for Brazilian music, the bossa movement in particular. I was never enamored of Klaus Ogerman's syrupy arrangements. While many consider him amongst the best of the bossa arrangers, I do not. Bossa is a world where less is more, take Joao and a guitar. The more you add the less you seem to get back, beyond that. Couple Klaus with Krall's marketing scheme, of pretty album covers of an average (at best) looking performer and breathy valiummy sounding vocals and voila the result .... Bossa Coma.     One star and it is there as a nite light.
1416594884|3.0|While as well written as ever John Le Carre is beginning to show his age. The novel, set in Hamburg, piles one improbable development upon another. A naive Islamic medical student, the son of a KGB general and a Chechen mother, who possesses the key to his father's Swiss (in this case German) bank account. The bank account happens to be with the bank of a disillusioned Scottish owner of the above private bank. The German and American security apparats believe that the innocent (in more senses than one) is an islamic terrorist and the banker and a young (blonde and attractive) female lawyer try to help him. Though as well written as ever and as full of verisimilitude (Le Carre has, after all, finally admitted that he used to work for MI6 in Germany) the plot seems weak when compared to his epic cold war Smiley novels and the finale seemed contrived.
1595141715|4.0|I honestly have mixed feeling about this book. When I read the summary my thoughts were \\"oh sweet! This sounds like a good read,\\" It was. It kept me turning the pages. I thought Hannah's story was interesting. The author tries to make the reader feel bad for Hannah, but I can't see why. I felt more sorry for the people (except two) who were called out on the tapes. That was the only problem I had with the book. The plot was amazing otherwise. After giving it a lot of thought, I would recomend this book to really anyone who is into reading.
0307386171|2.0|Given that the stock of real Victorian novels is as limited as petroleum reserves, and that many avid novel readers have already exhausted it, it's no wonder that Ian McEwan is popular. \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is fundamentally a Victorian novel, and not just because the leading lady in it, Florence, is burdened with Victorian sensibilities, but also because the author passes just the kind of moral judgement on his own characters that George Eliot might have passed. Oh, mention is made of pubic hair and engorged penises, but it's still an archaic structure of a novel. Imagine all the \\"implicit\\" sexuality of a novel by Austen or Trollope, make it explicit on a bed with silk sheets, and you have Ian McEwan. Genteel voyeurism, ladies and gents!<br /><br />The story told by \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is of a couple on their wedding night, with ample flashbacks to their earlier lives and courtship. They're both virgins. She is preposterously repressed. Intercourse fails, they flee from each other, and neither ever recovers from the trauma. The central bedroom catastrophe might have made a decent short story, but the flashbacks are mere back-fill, and the final chapter, rushing through the next forty years of the characters' lives, is schematic, smug, and dull.
B00008972S|5.0|Some DVD box sets are complete and utter over blown wastes of money. Like of both [[ASIN:B0018O50W0 How the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000F0V0LI The Searchers (Ultimate Collector's Edition)]] which were over padded and miscolor films. This film box set isnt that at all.<br /><br />The normal DVD is in full screen. This collection is in wide screen format and a great digital transfer. The soundtrack is tweaked upward in sound quality.<br /><br />This multi Oscar winning,  musicial adaptation of Romeo and Juliet is a winner. You will see more and more  details with every airing of this modern day classic<br /><br />What amazes me is this film from the early 1960's is still timeless. The second disk has trailers and documentaries on this film.<br /><br />What also comes in this collection is a film book that reprint the film book that you bought at the theater in the 1960's with a press book that newspaper would have and a history of the film. This book alone is worth the price of this collection for any film fan<br /><br />Worth the money for any film fan on your list. Its a FIVE STAR hit<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I loved the movie anyway when it came out in theaters. This is a lot better because it has additional footage that I personally thought they should have left in the movie. Will watch over and over again!
6305907145|3.0|This movie could have truly been in gem in our family. I know it makes it more realistic, but the two scenes (sexual slave drawings and the scene were fanny walks in on Mr. Crawford on Maria) ruin it for me. I was shocked after watching a perfectly clean movie so far to see those things thrown in. They were totally useless. I cannot allow my children to watch it nor would I watch it again.     If these scenes were not there, this would be one of my favorite movies. Is there a version out there without them?
B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie was very deep and thoughtful. The fact that they were at Aushwitz, the biggest \\"death\\" camp there was makes it that much more powerful. It makes you really realize how much innocence a young child, such as bruno, has. There are so many movies and books about the holocaust but there arnt a ton that tell it from a childs point of view and I think they did this movie very well. I have yet to read the book but it's on my list.    The only think I didnt truly like about the movie was the ending. It left me with so many questions and longing for a longer movie. I tend to analaze movies so thats just what im doing. But overall, an exellent movie and worth watching.

It fills out some plot holes and origins.<br /><br />Are you still reading this review? Hurry up and click Buy Now!
B001MVYUPC|5.0|I just saw this movie today for the very first time. It really made me think about the events of today. If all the violence in the middle east suddenly went this route how powerful would that be.    The Blu-ray transfer was great, not grainy at all. Good color and clarity
B001EN71DG|4.0|Was very pleased with this purchase.Although there have been some minor changes to these movies from the originals they are equally entertaining. If you grew up in the 70's, and saw the originals in the theatre, you will be able to see the subtle changes in the movies. This is a great addition to your collection whatever your age.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This DVD is a good workout, you'll work up a great sweat. But it's not for those with knee or hip problems. It's a lot of lunging and jumping so if those things bother you then I wouldn't suggest your purchase this DVD. Jillian isn't big on stressing proper form on some of the moves either.    There are lots of old gym class moves like squat thrusts, jumping jacks, and bicycle crunches. The 3 levels are challenging and you'll feel stronger by the end. I'd recommend doing each level until you've mastered it, even if it takes longer than 30 days to finish all 3 levels because moving to the next level before you're ready will probably lead to injury or burn out.    The warmup and stretching for the vids are pretty weak.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|In his epic love letter to his native continent, Baz Luhrmann has crafted a sweeping three hour fairytale, filled to overflowing with beautiful people, scurrilous villains, music and dancing, danger and romance, music and magic. \\"Australia\\" is an old fashioned romance, and your fondness for it will depend on how you feel about grandiose pictures that were made with the intent to shamelessly grab your heartstrings while visually zapping you right between the eyes.<br /><br />While not perfect by any means, the scope and sheer WOW factor of \\"Australia\\" will give deep satisfaction to those movie watchers frustrated by cinema that seems pre-destined to small screen viewing or just load CGI-effects in ever increasing mania while forgetting about the magic that can be made by simply letting the backdrop tell the story. And for the first two-thirds of \\"Australia,\\" Luhrmann does just that. The impossibly good looking Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) finds herself a widowed ranch-owner forced to fend off the leering advances of Cattle Baron King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his slimy henchman Fletcher (David Wenham). Only the rugged \\"Drover\\" (Hugh Jackman) can help \\"Miss Boss\\" save \\"Faraway Downs\\" from the wicked ranchers. There is a wild west kind of scenario as the Faraway Downs race against time to herd 2000 head of cattle to the docks at Dover.<br /><br />That is the first part of \\"Australia.\\" After that, it suddenly lurches into a WWII drama. The Japanese are poised to attack while Lady Sarah must undo what Fletcher has done to split her, Drover and Nulluh (the half-breed Aboriginal who spends the movie as its Greek Chorus). Somehow, Luhrmann ties all of this together (along with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and a social comment about aboriginal assimilation) while making it pretty entertaining. If this sounds like a good way to treat yourself to a movie night, by all means go \\"Australia.\\"
B0016CP1Q4|5.0|ranks right up there with \\"train a comin\\", \\"guitar town\\", and \\"the mountain\\"  the sound seems better than on the original, so there must have been some good \\"remastering\\" don.  and, the bonus cuts from live shows are great.
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|I'm a relatively new Porcupine Tree fan. I was lucky that Insurgentes was released shortly after I ran out of Porcupine Tree CD to buy.  Insurgentes is superbly produced.  The layers and textures are moody and amazing.  My favorite part is when the choir comes in for 2 seconds on Significant Other.  I don't give out 5's, but this was darn close.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love this movie and watched it in Ireland in March.  I bought the North American DVD and just watched it to discover that the scene of Amanda singing \\"Downtown\\" has been cut from this version.  Does anyone know why?  The deletion of this scene means the comments of Darcy and Bingham make no sense.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I am a fan of the 007 series. This movie however is a big drop off from the quality of Casino Royale. I really liked Craig in his first Bond role. I wanted to like this movie and was excited to see it, but sadly it was disappointing. I understood after seeing it why it was getting such bad reviews across the board. Just too boring for me, lacking cool 007 gadgets. Hopefully, the next one will improve.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|this book was very good a thrillimg adventure for all types of readers  a definate page turner. but make sure you read the other two books first though
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I only wish that the CD contained all the songs on the DVD. Otherwise an inspiring show.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I own the older box set with the first 5 Rocky films included in it. I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.<br /><br />What more can be said about this lovable lug?! Stallone has never been better than in this heartfelt and inspiring story. With a colorful cast and exciting fight scenes, this film is simply magic!<br /><br />The DVD I own is OK, but if your a big fan the 2 disc special edition is the way to go!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been listening to Metallica since \\"Ride the Lightning\\". I remember when \\"Master of Puppets\\" came out and I was floored! I could not believe that they could get even better than \\"Ride...\\". I think the feeling I get from \\"Death Magnetic\\", is the same feeling I got from \\"Master of Puppets\\".  After churning out crap for three albums (For the money I'm sure), they have renewed my faith as a metalhead. The \\"Black\\" album was just okay, even though they scored high marks from fans and reviews, but honestly, Bob Rock almost ruined this band as much as made them rich..    To me the Bassless \\"And Justice For All\\" was the last Great Metallica album until \\"Death Magnetic\\". They went with a producer that knows how to get actual SOUND out of his bands. I can't believe the reviews talking about how this album sucks. They must've liked the albums were the band wore make-up and sang about hotrods and stupid crap. These people really need to start from the beginning and listen to every album from \\"Kill Em All\\" on through this one.  KILL EM ALL- 8/10 Not a bad start. Really started the Thrash movement.  RIDE THE LIGHTNING- 10/10 Changed my taste of music for the better. This album really was the best when it came out and still holds up pretty well.  MASTER OF PUPPETS- 10/10 Keeping up what they started, toured with Ozzy. Got tons of fans. Cliff Burton was a god! But then he left us forever. Still one of the greatest albums ever made.  GARAGE DAYS- 9/10 Raw and still thrashy. Newstead gets on board and does well. I still love this CD.  AND JUSTICE FOR ALL- 9/10 Would have been the best they put out if not for the crappy mix. (I still can't believe they haven't added the Bass yet). Great song structure, very mature and yet very heavy. No Bass, Drum Kicks to high end and trebley. Vocals rock! This will get 10/10 once Lars and James re-mix it.  THE BLACK ALBUM- 7/10 Other than a couple of tracks, the album has a slow boring vibe to it. This was a decent mix by the team, but the music lost me where it picked up a whole new legion of fans...Not quite a sell out. But you can feel it coming.  LOAD- 5/10 They are SOOOO much better than this album. A complete sell-out in my opinion. Even though I liked \\"Hero of the Day\\" (and I am ashamed), this is for the most part- garbage.  RELOAD- 3/10 No comment.. I'm sure your girlfriends like it.  I am going to skip a couple because they aren't REALLY albums, okay?  ST. ANGER- 3/10 not because it's a sell out, but because they needed to put out a really crappy album and explore why they do what they do, and FIX IT! The drums reeeeaally suck on this (Lars, listen to other people). James's voice was really irritating, but I felt like they were coming back musically, but this still sucked.  DEATH MAGNETIC- 10/10 - Because they pulled their heads out. and gave the true fans what they wanted! A cross between \\"Master...\\" and \\"And Justice...\\" With really good tracks. Really, I can't find one track on this album that sucks. It's like they reinvented Metallica all over again. And like I said before- It gave me the same feeling \\"Master of Puppets\\" did when it came out.  I hope with this release it's just the beginning for the new Metallica of old. So, to sum it up- Great songs, great vocals, great topics and a renewed faith in Metal for all!!!
B00005JLZN|4.0|You may think this film is a thriller about the death penalty, but it is not. It looks like it, true, but the end reveals it is something completely different. It is about the way the media can be manipulated in any direction, provided you are intelligent. Once a brilliant university professor was confronted in a TV debate to the governor of Texas about the death penalty. The governor asked him to give the name of one executed person that was innocent and could be proved so. The professor could not answer such a question for the simple reason that there is no post mortem investigation in the case of an execution, except... And the professor started, with his main assistant in his fight against the death penalty, to think of how to prove that point. In the mean time he is tricked by some dumb girl student into doing exactly what he should never have done: have sex with her. She sue him for rape, even if later she will drop the charge. The damage is done. He is kicked out of academia. His wife takes his son away and gets a divorce. She sells the house. He cannot even get a job as the manager of a technical store. He is reduced to nothing, to being a rapist forever. But he does not want to move. His main assistant in his fight is going to die of leukemia. When he learns that, the plan to trap the governor germinates in their minds and they put it through. He is going to be accused of the murder of his assistant though it is not a murder. The evidence it is not is a tape, the recording of what really happened. But it will come in three pieces. The man will be sentenced to death. Three days before his execution he asks a famous journalist from New York to come and take the first and last interview he is going to give her in six hours spread out over the three days before his execution. The first excerpt of the tape we have mentioned will turn up in the journalist's motel room on the second day, before execution, too short and a copy. Worthless. Then after some adventure the journalist manages to recuperate what she thinks is the whole tape that proves what she was thinking, after some personal experimentation, is right: the woman killed herself, but who worked the camera? A man that is seen at the end of the tape, a man the journalist has seen here and there and in whose shack she has found the tape. But that too is too short though not worthless. It  creates havoc and it proves an innocent man can be sentenced to death. During that time the $500,000 for the interview travel to Mexico and the ex-wife for the son. The father had been vindicated in the mean time. But the journalist finally receives the last excerpt of the tape, the end of the suicidal demonstrative s&eacute;ance and there the professor is shown coming at this very moment, just after the death of the woman, just as if he had been behind the camera all the time and he turns that camera off, after checking the woman is dead. The media had been manipulated about the guilt of the man and about the fairness and justice of the death penalty, then about the man's innocence and the suicide of the woman, and yet the truth was that the death had been planned in such a way that the execution would demonstrate how an innocent person can be sentenced to death. Manipulation all along by a woman who wanted to make her natural death useful for the cause she advocated and by a man who did not have the courage to move on and start a new life after having been destroyed by an unscrupulous student and by his own dumbness: students are out of reach as long as they are within grading distance. He preferred to make his death (which becomes a very special suicide) useful for the cause he advocated and for his own son. But the film is short because two men helped the woman and staged her death and the man lied all along the way of his confession and ordeal. The media are so naïve that they believe anything provided it smells slightly sulfurous or sulfuric.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDs 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I brouse books all the time and one day I picked it up at my local book store. It was one of the best books I've read!!  I have since learned that this was the first book the author has written.  Though it is fiction I can't help but believe that most of it was not.  I have recommended it to several people and they have all come back with a very positive reaction from all.  I truly believe it is a must read.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|This film, a tender masterpiece, is an anomaly in Hollywood.  It's a mature, intelligent, thoughtful, real romantic film, and in the end, sad and heartbreaking, but not despairing.  Some have expressed surprise that Eastwood directed this film so well, but I'm not.  Eastwood is a great film artist, one of the greatest working today, and he shows his sensitivity and brilliance in this film.  This film reminds me of how surprised people were that David Lynch directed The Straight Story (a wonderful film in itself and one of the best of 1999).  It's the same principle.  Two artists, Lynch and Eastwood, are simply thwarting expectations and surprising their fans with a sincere, heartfelt movie.  They do it all the time.<br /><br />This film is also very mature and intelligent.  It is not a chick flick where everything is wrapped up in dumb dialogue, dumb characters, and foolish situations.  It is an honest film of two middle aged people who bond almost immediately and really fall in love.  Eastwood and Streep (the Academy didn't nominate either of them) give wonderful performances, especially Streep.  She's also drop dead gorgeous as well.  The film unfolds at a beautiful, leisurely pace (like most Eastwood films).<br /><br />The film also doesn't make any judgements on the lead characters.  Streep's character is married, but she's very unhappy and bored, like many people who have been in a long term marriage.  Eastwood's character is not a playboy, but someone who really reveals himself to Streep, something that's brave to do.  There's also a powerful scene in a diner where another woman, who was caught having an affair and the small town knows about it, walks into a diner and everyone starts looking down on her.  Except Eastwood's character, who offers her a seat next to his.  There is not one ounce of moralising here.  Clint shows people who are simply human, and it's beautiful.<br /><br />The Bridges of Madison County is a story for adults, and considering it was made in 1995 (when idiotic teen comedies were polluting the multiplexes), it's even more of a treasure (I wished I had seen it then, the 90's was a rather poor decade overall for films, especially from Hollywood).  Hollywood should do more adult romances, and not silly, vapid chick flicks.  Chick flicks do more damage to romantics than realistic romance.  I prefer my romances to be more grounded in reality and intelligence because there's just as much beauty there, and it's much more fullfilling than any vapid chick flick can offer.  This is one of Eastwood's best, most unique films.hen idiotic teen comedies were polluting the multiplexes), it's even more of a treasure (I wished I had seen it then, the 90's was a rather poor decade overall for films, especially from Hollywood).

B000LXHK22|4.0|This movie is really underated. It's light and romantic and colorful. The flash backs work well in this movie to set the background of a young boy and his uncle. Russel Crowe is endearing as Max, as a young boy, then a greedy and selfish man who becomes so smitten by a beautiful and independent French woman against the picturesque backdrop of his uncle's Provence winery. It is truly beautiful and immensely enjoyable...  The scenery and actors are delightful...  Buy it, watch it again and again...enjoy!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Involving, beautifully shot drama set in 1984 East Germany centers around Wiesler, a member of the secret police who routinely undertakes surveillance of outspoken artistic and political types.  Played by the excellent Ulrich Muhe, Wiesler is initially a hardline socialist ideologue, but- through his constant eavesdropping- begins to sympathize with his subjects, to the point where he alters his reports to his superiors in order to protect them.  Wiesler's change of heart is further helped along by the frequent corruption he witnesses among his colleagues, as they use their political power not to further the socialist cause but to advance their careers and even remove romantic rivals.<br /><br />Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck keeps things moving along and involving, and is thankfully not one of those directors who thinks he has to mirror the drab lives of Cold War-era Eastern Europe with drab visuals.  Here the colors are deep, resonant, and quite beautiful, yet still somehow keeping with the melancholy nature of the film.  I was pleased to see him mention this very aim- his desire to avoid the dull look of past films with a similar setting- during an interview in the DVD's special features section.  But I shouldn't have been surprised, as good work doesn't happen by accident.  I also liked that the engaging von Donnersmarck is quite unpretentious.  He enthusiastically talks, for example, about how the Indiana Jones movies have a unique color palette to underscore their flavor and how he wanted to use their example to create his own color palette to underscore his own themes.<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" is the serious, worthy film I expected it to be. But I was surprised at how involving and entertaining it was on top of that.  It certainly deserved all the attention it garnered a year or two back when it was making the rounds in this country.  You can't go wrong spending an evening with this thoughtful, moving, and often exciting drama.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I gotta say I never buy DVDs, but I couldn't say no to this one, and I'm so glad I got it. If you remotely like science fiction, you will love this collection. All the documentaries are amazing and informative; they really do go beyond the movie itself. And if you already like the Matrix, do yourself a favor and get it; you'll get your money's worth.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|This is the only version to watch!  Blu-Ray corrects the video and audio problems previous versions had.  The picture is gorgeous (you will see things you probably hadn't seen in the past).  Outdoor scenes are clear and indoor scenes seem to put you right there in the scene.  If you like Jane Austen and the Jennifer Ehle version of P&P, get the Blu-Ray, you won't be disappointed!
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I loved the first three books in this series and was deeply diappointed with this book. I would have liked to have seen a better plot to tie up the loose ends of Edward and Bella's story.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I like the way this new 007 beats everyone up.  The action sequences are awesome and very Bourne-like.  It's funny to watch M ask \\"you killed him didn't you?\\"
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The acting in this version is wonderful and spot on. To begin  Jane and Mr Bingley are a perfect fit for their characters and each other. Both actors show a goodness and quietness in their manners so that one has trouble imagining them together and the issues that this couple faces along the way. The biggest issue no doubt is sharing their heartfelt emotions and love for each other.<br /><br />Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are also a perfect match. Elizabeth is just the right amount of independence and vulnerability that her character comes alive. Elizabeth shows that she is sensitive to others opinions, as when Darcy comments on her appearance and behavior at village dance, after his cutting comments she seeks out her best friend to help confirm her beliefs that he is wrong and has a great prejudice. She assumes and exhibits an attitude that she has everything figured out and as a result judges things much to quickly - including Darcy. The development of the character throughout the movie is played so expertly! You really do see her character grow and her opinions rendered incorrect - she too has prejudices.<br />To me this is the best acting of Mr Darcy's character that I have seen. I found it easy to see the shyness in Darcy hiding behind his pride. To me I found this portrayal so right on with what I imagined in from the book. He is quiet and aloof, yet you find yourself drawn to him, much like Elizabeth does as she gets to know him. Darcy does not seem as harshly played in this production as he is in others. It is not as hard to imagine Elizabeth falling for him as in other films. In other productions his change from \\"bad\\" guy to \\"good\\" guy seems too fast, here the character has time to grow and we see glimpses of his true self - small in the beginning and then revealed more throughout the film.<br /><br />The scenery of the English Countryside from the village to the residences is beautiful - with incredible scenic shots that will make you want to pick up and move directly to the English countryside.<br />The costumes are simple for the country ladies - One of the greatest examples is the scene in which Elizabeth comes to check on her ailing sister Jane, at the Bingley residence. Elizabeth appears as if she has had a terrible journey to arrive there. Standing in front of the proper ladies and Darcy she is a sight to behold - and so believable.<br /><br />This is definitely worth purchasing and if you love Jane Austen's works or simply a good period piece you will no doubt return to this film again and again.<br />In a word beautiful.lish countryside.

0679720200|5.0|\\"Maman died today.  Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.\\"  This is the voice of Mersault, the main character and narrator.  Camus perfectly captures Mersault's detached almost indifferent relation to the world.  Not only is Mersault somewhat indifferent to the details of his mother's [Maman's] death, his relationship with his girlfriend is one more of tolerance than attachment, he tends to have acquaintances rather than friends, and, on the whole, has drifted through life.  His mother's death sets in action a chain of events that effect a dramatic change in Mersault and, likely, the reader.    Mersault has to attend his mother's funeral and there meets several interesting characters, though only one seems truly to mourn the death of Mersault's mother:  her elderly fiancee, Perez.  And yet, Camus is able to make gently comic use of the pitiable gentleman.    \\"We [the funeral procession] got under way.  It was then that I noticed that Perez had a slight limp.  Little by little, the hearse was picking up speed and the old man was losing ground...I turned around again:  Perez seemed to be way back there, fading in the shimmering heat.  Then I lost sight of him altogether.  I looked around and saw that he'd left the road and cut out across the fields.  I also noticed there was a bend in the road up ahead.  I realized that Perez, who knew the country, was taking a short cut in order to catch up with us.  By the time we rounded the bend, he was back with us.  Then we lost him again.  He set off cross country once more, and so it went on.\\"    This early sketch is but one example of how Camus, through Mersault, comically captures and illustrates the absurdity that is his subject.  Among the many memorable characters that populate the plot are the aforementioned Perez, Salamano and his mangy dog, Mersault's neighbor Raymond, Mersault's girlfriend Marie, and the defense attorney.  The plot involves, essentially, Mersault's killing of a stranger on the beach and his trial therefore.  The killing and the surrounding circumstances are absurd, as is Mersault's trial.    Mersault's court-appointed defense attorney is \\"short and chubby, quite young, his hair carefully slicked back.\\"  In the first meeting of attorney and client, the attorney focuses primarily on Mersault's apathetic reaction to his mother's death.  Mersault does not see the relevance:  \\"I pointed out to him that none of this had anything to do with my case, but all he said was that it was obvious I had never had any dealings with the law.\\"  To Mersault's chagrin, the attorney leaves in a huff.  \\"He didn't understand me, and he was sort of holding it against me.  I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else.\\"    This passage is important, I believe, to a full understanding of the novel and, particularly, the final paragraph.    In THE STRANGER, Camus manages to communicate on multiple levels, including the comic, the philosophical, and the psychological.  While Camus did surpass this effort with later works, notably THE FALL, this remains his most accessible and, therefore, most widely read novel.  Camus manages a great deal in such a short book.  I highly recommend this book.

B001MYIXAW|3.0|Not only is this one of the best horror films of 2008, it is one of the best films of 2008 period. Which is why it is so disappointing to find that the subtitles on this particular edition are not in line with the theatrical release. Both the dvd and blu ray's subtitles have been cut significantly to make them easier to read. Beware of which edition you purchase, because the theatrical release is far superior and it is in the wild as well. Sadly the only way to currently tell is to by looking at the back of the case. The quality version will say: SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (theatrical). Happy hunting.
0307165485|3.0|I usually am pretty laid back about books. I don't freak out about implied meanings or search desperately for coincidental stereotyping in children's books like I've seen other parents do, but I have to be honest and say that I find this book very odd. Why does the cover have a lion SMOKING a pipe? Why is there a 'story' about the different things to do with an ear of corn - lastly making it into a pipe?! I have other questions, not so serious, but more simply asking 'why'? I don't want to promote stifling creativity but can we not randomly draw an image of a massive snake constricting an airplane full of people...the last thing I want to deal with is a toddler convinced on our next trans-atlantic flight that a snake is attacking the plane. It isn't even part of the story...just, let's throw in a snake that is wrapped around a plane full of passengers! Very strange. I guess for older kids this book is okay (minus the pipe smoking), but I have no interest in letting my little toddler leaf through it unless I rip out some pages.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I saw Leonard Cohen and his fantastic band at the exquisitely intimate Paramount Theater in Oakland, CA last night. I'm still buzzing with both giddiness and a deep feeling of grace for being invited to 3 1/2 hours of soul massage. Aside from a sublime sound created by a 9-piece ensemble of talented musicians who have mastered the art of filling in just enough to let the greatness of these songs shine right through, I can hardly put in words how nice it felt to be carried through this musical journey by the simple power of . . . words.    There are love songs, the kind we are force-fed ad nauseum in daily radio and television diets, mostly shallow, formulaic professions of \\"Oh baby, you broke my heart, and I either want you back or you can go to hell.\\" Then there are Love Songs, the rare kind that strike a chord so deep that they make a connection between our individual human condition or predicament and the infinitely more expansive and universal mystery behind our collective suffering and joy. The latter, of course, is Mr. Cohen's kind, tickling your soul's G-spot with his poetic feather until you can take it no more and surrender to the sensation of tears and smiles running side by side.     Inviting you in, through, and beyond, is the essence of poetry, and words are the cosmic training wheels that take you there, wherever there is. The most powerful words, however, may be the ones that -- like a caring guardian -- slowly fade into the distance once you're cruising, leaving you to explore all on your own the magic realm from whence they came while still feeling safely connected to their familiar ring. If these words are imbued in a deep dark whisper of a voice and carried by a cloud of sweet and gentle music, then you may find yourself catching a blissful glimpse of creation's finest, right through that crack where the light shines in.

B0000062S0|3.0|Page & Plant's Walking Into Clarksdale was released March 1998 to much expectation. After all it was their first album of new material together since Led Zep's In Through The Out Door - released 19 years before. Unfortunately it doesn't offer much in terms of creativity and sound which are both Zeppelin trademarks. The album has its moments - Heart In My Hand, Most High, When I was a Child, Blue Train - but it falls terribly short when you think of comparing it to any Zeppelin effort or even some of Robert's or Jimmy's solo albums. It just makes you miss John Paul Jones and John Bonham, and that's sad.  Another thing that bothers me is the production. Did they really need Steve Albini's hand??? The sound is flat overall and the drums don't sound right. For a 1998 production, I'd dare say it sounds way below average as if the mojo wasn't working. And that coming from Jimmy, the producer, is just unacceptable. I believe this album needs some remixing and a good remastering job. I'm giving it three stars because I'm a fan but two could be more accurate.

B0013D8LCW|4.0|This is just one of those rare great movies you'll find in gay cinema.  It has a story that is unique and poignant, great writing, and some great acting.    What it's missing is the sexual tension.  I don't see those looks of lust between Zack and Sean.  When they're not in bed together, they act as if they're two straight guys hanging out.  Yes, it's clear that they learn to deeply care for each other and be vulnerable - but that's not lust.  Every moment leading up to the make-out session is without sexual tension.  No lingering looks or ever so slightly too long touches.  Not that we need that to be over-the-top, but we something - anything!  People that are about to hook-up need to look to each other as if they're wanting each other -- which they don't.  Frankly, it just seems under-rehearsed.      Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright never seem to take on their characters as whole different people than who they, themselves as the actors, are.  The way they walked, moved, spoke -- it just didn't seem that there was any stretching or altering of themselves to play these characters.  They never change their own individual vocal patterns or posture to become different characters.  We've all seen many straight men play gay characters.  But this was the first time I was really just not buying it. I didn't believe either of them were gay.  I understand and appreciate not wanting to \\"act gay,\\" but all gay men have this look about them that says they've been through repression and hard-times.  They just didn't.  It's hard to explain - but it wasn't there. This resulted in the sex scenes' passion to be mediocre -- hot, but mediocre.      In addition, I got a distinct feeling that the Zack/Sean relationship needed to be explored and analyzed more by these actors.  I saw an interview where Rowe said that he got the script three days before filming.  It shows.    Sadly, it's the film's star, Trevor Wright, who never really rises to the occasion in his acting.  He never seems to truly makes Markowitz's lines his own for most of the movie.  He never fleshes-out a character that would really speak these lines.   All his subtexts and actions seemed very directed and mannered.  It was clear that he did a lot of work as an actor to understand Zack's story, but rarely did I see the inner torment a gay man who's scared to come-out goes through.  It just wasn't enough to really succeed.    Brad Rowe is an incredibly natural actor - making Markowitz's words his own and really come to life.  We grew to like Sean and feel he was a real person.      Tina Holmes was the stand-out actor of this film.  She embodied Jeannie, made her relatable, and earned our understanding and sympathy.  We can tell she understood and empathized with the character's situation.  She's a great actress and did a phenomenal job.       In the end, it's because the film is so touching that makes the audience root for it.  It touches any romantic's heart.  I highly recommend that everyone watch this.  Slightly critical of this movie, I was.  Disappointed, I absolutely wasn't.

B0017098GO|3.0|Mistborn: The Final Empire is a 2006 fantasy novel by Brandon Sanderson. It is part of the Mistborn trilogy, but is a complete story on its own (although not everything is wrapped tidily at the end) and can be read as such. In the Mistborn world, an immortal tyrant has ruled the empire for a thousand years. Now, a group of thieves and magic users undertake a plot to overthrow him.<br /><br />Mistborn's magic system is refreshingly novel. Most magic users have access to one of eight special abilities, which they activate by ingesting trace amounts of the appropriate metal. The more powerful Mistborn have access to all eight metal-based abilities, plus more, making them in essence a poor man's hybrid of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto. Mistborn's main character is Vin, a sixteen year old petty thief who has just discovered that she is a Mistborn, and who has joined this conspiracy to overthrow the empire.<br /><br />Most of Sanderson's supporting cast has been drawn from the bin of generic, flat, cookie-cutter fantasy characters. His treatment of Vin, though, makes us wonder what he was thinking. Particularly early on, both Sanderson as the narrator and his characters point out repeatedly that she is timid and has low self-confidence. But Sanderson doesn't write her that way - Vin is headstrong, stubborn, nosy, fussy and sarcastic. This is not the only time that what the characters do and what the narrator says about them do not agree. Either way, Vin isn't a particularly interesting or likeable character.<br /><br />Sanderson's writing keeps him from getting the most out of his story, which is a shame because the magic is interesting and the plot is perfectly good. The story develops slowly. Sanderson spends the first 150 pages of the novel belaboring the magic system and having his characters speak in stiff, expository history-lesson paragraphs, almost as though he were writing this so it could be followed by small children. At 530 pages, Mistborn is at least 100 pages too long, and it's often tough to get through.<br /><br />Mistborn does get it together over the last 100 pages and has a genuinely solid and reasonably satisfactory climax. There are flashes of brilliance here, but it may be too little, too late to persuade readers to read the sequels.<br /><br />In On Writing, Stephen King said, \\"The adverb is not your friend.\\" But the adverb is Sanderson's very good friend indeed. He flings them liberally, distractingly, throughout the novel, and not only are there too many, he often makes some jarringly curious choices. And Sanderson's dialogue throughout the novel is wooden and clunky - bad to a degree one typically finds only in world-building genre fiction like this.<br /><br />Sanderson has done a good job constructing his world and his magic system, but he's done a terrible job actually telling the story, making Mistborn: The Final Empire a frustrating and disappointing work.it's often tough to get through.

B000EBDCWS|5.0|this review of this particular album is really about the sound quality of this cd. western copies were, and still are abysmal,leaving the whole production sounding flat.this japanese copy, on the other hand, restores beautifully the full grandeur of the original sound recording making this a must for all vangelis fans and in particular, fans of this amazing and over the top album!also it,s a cheaper alternative to the recently announced Shm recording, provided of course, that you can still find any copies left!these japanese items have a nasty habit of disappearing quickly.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|Psychedelic, elusive, bizarre--these are all words I would use to describe Mastodon's Crack the Skye, and I use these words only as a benefit to the band. Each song seems to grab a different part of my soul and extract it for paranormal pleasure. The songs are not heavy (as heavy is compared to other metal bands); they are powerful and lyrically provocative. Each song takes me to a place full of imagination as I try to see the story of what is being told through the eyes of the band--much like what a book does for the reader. This is an album that must be listened to over and over again.    My favorite tracks:    Oblivion - When the singing begins in this song, so does my journey into my amazement. \\"I flew beyond the sun before it was time.\\" I don't think album beginnings get much more mysterious, intriguing, and alluring as this. The words resonate something deep down inside me--horror and excitement all at once. And then the chorus comes in, packing a Stone Temple Pilot, Alice in Chains grunge-like prowess. Awesome.    Ghost of Karelia - Haunting. I can't get enough.    The Last Baron - The words used for my review title are sung at the beginning of this track. This seventh and final song of the album sums up my experience. Within the complicated music structure of this entire album, melody vividly comes through on this track, unleashing a hope in something that the listener cannot even at first know or understand--creating a wonder of whether or not there should even be that hope instilled. That is the feeling of the mind crawling for answers, for images, for more.    Sharkchild  Author of [[ASIN:0982314116 The Dark Verse, Volume I: From the Passages of Revenants (Imitation Leather)]]

B001PJRAUS|4.0|Imagine that once upon a time in the early  21st century, a devout  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" fanatic and unintentional time traveler named Amanda Price  wandered through the door behind her Hammersmith bathtub and switched places with Elizabeth Bennet, only to discover that most of the romantic principals in Austen's story were set on hooking themselves up with the wrong people.<br /><br />Imagine, too, that while trying to fix this muddled mess, she inadvertently drove Bingley to drink, found herself engaged to Mr. Collins and just in the nick of time discovered a savior and ally in one of Austen's most despicable villains. Toss in assorted other wild and crazy contrivances, throw in a new variation on the famous Colin Firth wet shirt scene, cast the whole thing well nigh perfectly--with special  kudos for  Jemima Rooper as Amanda, Tom Riley as Wickham,  Lindsay Duncan as Lady Catherine, and Alex Kingston and Hugh Bonneville as the best pair of Bennet parents ever!--and wow!  What fun!<br /><br />Warning: This wonderfully well imagined, over-the-top variation on one of literature's great classics  should not under any circumstances be critically compared with or considered a valid substitute for genuine Austen.  But for everyone who's ever fantasized about going back in time and grabbing Darcy for herself (which pretty much means all of us, right?) this is three hours not to be missed! A big bravo to writer Guy Andrews!

Our family of 7 loves this storybook. Cross-cultural British vocabulary evokes a few queries as does his start in darkest Peru to a home in London, England -- which is good for more than a few trips to the map on the wall. A small, colorful illustration on almost every page keeps the young engaged but not so mesmerized in the art as to take them away from the storyline. Good, solid literature for all ages.
0553384775|1.0|Wow.  How do I describe this book?  Well, let's start here - if you like reading about how a guy nearly kills himself on drugs, prostitutes, and other articles of hard living, this is the book for you.  If you want to hear of how some back-room deals on stocks occur, and the fall of Steve Madden (founder of the shoe company), then this is for you.    Disappointments: Why didn't Jordan talk more about his starting of Stratton and how that all came together?  What would have also been interesting is what did he do with all his money (other than buy drugs)? Where was the remorse for all the actions that ripped people off from over-inflated stock prices and back-room deals?  Why didn't he delve deeper into the behaviors that got him in the most trouble?  Not many people I know do illict drugs just to stay energized enough to make it through a day's work...    I didn't enjoy this book, but I finished it.  I guess it's hard to turn away from a train wreck......

The reference, of course, is about the first world war, as these two middle-aged strangers sit in a room amidst the swirl of young adults who were barely born then.

A lovely, amusing period piece.

1603580557|3.0|I first learned and practiced systems analysis back in the 1970s, and it's a skill that seems neglected in the training of many young professionals I come in contact with.    \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" is a book I hoped would be informative and accessible for people who need to develop the skill or just refresh their own talents. It does present its subject systematically and without confusing jargon.    While I found the writing clear and well-organized in its development and presentation of the subject, I found many of the illustrations less than helpful. I would have liked a less holistic and more concrete development of the analysis of the examples in the book.    For use as a textbook, an appendix with a glossary of terms of art and sybols would be very helpful. Nonetheless, reading this will give the novice an appreciation of what systems analysis is, and why it is critical to problem solving. Its informal approach may be more suited for young people today than a more formal and rigidly structured treatment.

1439138311|3.0|Colm Toibin's novel Brooklyn begins in Ireland in the 1950s. It's the story of Eilis, a young Irish girl who lives with her mother and sister. With no prospects of serious employment or any sort of future, Eilis leaves Ireland for Brooklyn where she works in a large department store and lives in a boarding house. All of Eilis's brothers work in England, so Eilis's move to New York doesn't initially seem such a great step. Eilis is courted by a young Italian man, but tragedy takes her back to Ireland.<br /><br />This is not a particularly easy book for me to rate--primarily because it's not the sort of book I would normally read. While it's a well-written, bittersweet tale of the immigrant experience of homesickness and loss, overall the story was too romantic for my taste and reminded me of the novels of Maeve Binchy.

0930289234|4.0|Watchmen (Paperback)by Alan Moore (Author), Dave Gibbons (Illustrator) is an important work of fiction, both to the comic book world and just as a work of fiction.  The Watchmen stands out as a revisionist history tale that captures the feel of the real world 1980's and the tensions that were building towards the end of the Cold war and blends them with the sometimes ridiculous nature of comic book escapism.  Like any good story that paints a true picture, it's sometimes difficult to look at, but you are compelled on by the characters and the tensions that drive them.  The end hasn't aged as well as the rest of the story.  But the point is still there, and still as sharp as ever.
0061537934|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. I am a big dog person and have recently taken an interest into racing, due to my husband, and so Enzo was a character I could relate to. My own dog, Jimi, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, so this book touched a special place in my heart.    Even if you aren't a dog or racing person, you will find the narration different and inspiring. Seeing the world through the eyes of our four legged friends has never been more fun and heartwarming.

B0013XS8A2|4.0|I've liked Mike Oldfield's music since the first \\"Tubular Bells\\" when I was a early teen way back in the 1970's. I have most of his LP's and now CD's, and had read about how this CD was very cinematic in it's sound. I fully agree about that, much less \\"New Age\\" and much more \\"Film Soundtrack\\", that's NOT a bad thing! Not in this case. In all his music I've always liked the all or mostly music only CD's, for me not so much on the vocal CD's and tracks. Overall this CD is very good and I enjoy listening to it. Not one track is a total stand out yet, but very good.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Finally, this great movie is coming to DVD!  In my opinion, this is Clint's best movie since 1976's \\"The Enforcer\\" his third Dirty Harry film.  In recent films, Clint has been a little soft and too nice of a guy. He is back in action in this great film that is also a wonderful story!  This movie reminds me very much of John Wayne's last film, \\"The Shootist\\".  In both films, Duke and Clint take a boy under their wing and mentor them.  There are many other similarities that I won't say because I'll be giving away the plot.  I can't wait to own this great Clint Eastwood film!

The scripts are great and never fail to make me laugh (although, be warned, given that the main character is a chronic womanizer, many of the jokes are a bit off-colour), but what really makes this show stand out it its cast. It's not just the two leads, Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer, who make this show (although both fit perfectly into their respective roles, and often, just seeing the look on Sheen's face, is enough to get me chuckling), but also Holland Taylor (one of the funniest, and most underrated, actresses of all time) as Sheen and Cryer's self-absorbed and domineering mother, who steals every scene she is in, and Melanie Lynskey as Rose, Sheen's slightly-psychotic ex-girlfriend, who also happens to be one of the most surreal characters on prime-time television. If you haven't already seen an episode of this excellent series, I strongly recommend that you give it a try.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I first read this book years ago when i was in gradeschool and the memory of the book has never left me. acouple years ago i looked for it at barns and noble so that i can read it over and over should i be so inclined. when i find a good book i read it every once in a while when im bored. i probably read sabriel 5 times before i bought the sequals and then read the whole series a couple of times over again.<br />i absolutey loved the first book. the writing is imaginative and captivating and the characters are interesting and likeable. well for the most part they are. there was very little not to like about this book. many parts of the book had my eyes flying across the pages so riveted was i in the story and horrible anxious to discover how it would unfold i could not put it down.<br />while the sequals are not as worderfully amazing as the first book they are still well worth the read. however i wish that Nix had continued the story about liriel and nick. i hate that the whole series was left unfinished with that little bit of information about nick. i had the feeling it could have been as riveting as sabriels story.<br />if you ever read this Nix please Please finish the story!PLEASE!

B000ZM1MG4|5.0|If ever there could have been merely a gimmick movie this should have been it. What takes it another level ?  1) I'd easily watch a complete movie about the Dorothy Michaels character regardless if a man played her or not.   2) If the hospital soap opera shown in the movie (Soutwest General) really existed, I think I would enjoy watching it on a daily basis.  3) If the \\"Return to Love Cannal\\" play really existed, I think I'd also like to go see it.  4) If the movie's central character was either George the agent, Julie the actress or room-mate played by Bill Murray, it would still be worth watching.  To have all of this things work in a single movie is nothing less than a miracle. Add Dustin Hoffman's performance & Dave Grusin's terrific score and you can understand why this is such a true classic.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|\\"The Mist\\" is another superb adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King story, but this time instead of redemption, Frank's going for terror - hoping to get you to soil your jockeys or at least nibble your fingernails more than you normally would. He achieves a bit of both actually in this terribly endearing Seventies-feel Sci-Fi schlock fest.<br /><br />First up, Darabont cleverly doesn't go for big names in the lead roles - there are faces in there you'll recognize (William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn - who were both in the mighty \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" for instance), but it's mostly actors you vaguely know or don't recognize at all. It has the effect of making their predicament more real - ordinary townsfolk locked into a battle for survival - where common sense quickly takes a back seat and bravery becomes a luxury few are willing to deploy...<br /><br />Here how it goes - the Army's been experimenting up in the mountains (aren't they always) and have unleashed something nasty on our world (don't they always). As the 'mist' creeps in over a small US town after an unnatural storm, half the not-so-bright populace gets trapped in the local supermarket where it becomes quickly evident that it's probably not a good idea to go outside into the dense creeping fog, because people who do tend to either not come back or get eaten. Ropes that were attached to torsos - fall limp, there's a sound; a scream and someone's entrails end up on the potato chips stand...(thoughtless of them you have to say)...<br /><br />All the usual elements are in place - the irritating stupid ones who do something they shouldn't and end up as fodder, the lying Army types covering their uniformed asses, the wise old ones who sacrifice for the young, the cowardly big talkers who then sit in corners and whinge - the women who are ballsier and brainier than the men - all manner of parents who are just trying to protect their families...the resourcefulness and guts of those who do fight back and win...<br /><br />Darabont also cleverly ratchets up the tension by having no music for ages so that when the sinister synth drone does kick in - it really kicks in - and when the wailing vocals of Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance on \\"The Host of Seraphim\\" comes in towards the end - it has the emotional impact of a fist in the face. It's on an album called (not surprisingly) \\"The Serpent's Egg\\"...<br /><br />Toby Jones is superb as the grounded Supermarket owner, Thomas Jane as the father who must keep safe his son at all costs and Andre Braugher as his difficult neighbour who doesn't buy into the hysteria and conspiracy theories and pays the webbed price.<br /><br />But the film belongs to Marcia Gay Harden who is stunningly effective as the town's religious zealot who seizes her it's-the-wrath-of-God moment with non-stop apocalyptical-jabbering. Of course after two days of ranting about sins and the End of the World and her being God's conduit, she begins to make twisted sense to the terrified folks desperate to placate the beasties outside. Enter the inevitable Lord Of The Flies scenario - a sacrifice must be made...<br /><br />There's something terribly old-fashioned about The Mist. It wants to make your girlfriend go \\"yew!\\" a lot and it achieves this on several occasions with genuinely squeamish aplomb. Coming over a bit like an Irwin Allen Seventies epic, The Mist is basically a very, very good B-movie.<br /><br />For Blu Ray owners - the special effect creatures are Jurassic Park meets Alien meets the bug scene in King Kong - creepy, scary and deliciously icky. The Blu Ray images are really clean and crisp and even when huge things lurk over cars in a blurry haze, you still see their monstrous outlines and 'feel' their size as the pumped-up audio does its thing. The 'black and white' version on Disc 2 is even creepier and a very clever addition.<br /><br />By the time the unexpected and staggeringly downbeat ending finally comes (some have truly hated this though) - you know someone has done their job right, because you've been rightly and royally entertained. And more importantly - you've rooted for these people - so much so that you end up thinking about them and their decisions - days later...<br /><br />Recommended.en rightly and royally entertained.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I loved when I was little, and my daughter loves it now! It's great.    The only thing I would have liked about it more, was if it was remastered more (Like Sleeping Beauty)But it still looks great on Blu-ray!
B001H5X7IO|3.0|I know 2 people that have this $200+ Boxset and are miserable with it. The pressing quality is awful, with multiple discs having to be sent back for replacement. The company that pressed them is very hard to deal with and it took months to get replacements. In one instance the replacement had to be sent back because it had the same problem as its predecessor. In another instance when the replacement came it wasnt an LP at all but a booklet for a Sigur Ross LP?! The mastering is very good, much better than on the original CD, but the constant skips and noisy vinyl make it hard to enjoy. Shame on the company who produced this set!
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Like my title says, Slumdog Millionaire is essentially a Disney movie for adults.  Whether or not that's a good thing is up to you.      If you like highly predictable and highly improbable feel good stories, then this is right up your alley.  For me, it was the definition of a mediocre movie: good enough to hold my attention, but not good enough to really suck me in and make me care about the movie's world or its characters.  It had a couple of memorable scenes, but it was ultimately a forgettable two hours for me.      I also find it highly ironic that many have said the ending somewhat redeemed an otherwise boring film.  I'll agree that the movie slowed down and became somewhat boring, but the ending only made things worse in my eyes.  The director takes the easy way out, ending the film in the most predictable way possible.  And then there is the closing credits sequence -- I'm shaking my head now, just from envisioning it.  Absolutely terrible.    Worth watching, but don't believe the hype.  There were many other films released in 2008 that were better than this.
B0017MO10U|4.0|Not as good as many of the TV episodes, but I own them all so I couldn't let this one slip by. This one is slow to start and never exciting but still worth owning to keep the whole set. The time travel paradoxes are always fun to figure out.
B001C4CI8A|5.0|Be careful,the Blu Ray no longer comes with the Digital Copy like it shows on the picture,mine had just the Blu Ray Disc(dont worry it has all the extras!),just no Digital Copy disc.I'm sure there is still some of the 2 disc Speacial Editions out there,after the first run it seems that the Digital Copy is no longer included. Great Ridley Scott movie though,I'm not a huge fan of Digital Copies but I'm just warning people out there who do like em'! No more slipcover either,guess Warner saved a lot of $ by doing this! I'm sure this will be happening more and more w/ Blu Ray releases in the future!
B001ECQ6E2|1.0|This is one of the better biblical specticales and what did they do unletterbox it.  Picture quality is blu-ray perfect as well as the sound.....I just don't get it.  The industry (director's) boast how pan and scan ruins films...I guess they missed the boat...I'm a true fan of this film but I may not watch it in this format.
1427206031|5.0|I love a good book....though I usually tend more towards thrillers, I love just plain old good stories and this is one that I enjoyed immensely.      First off, even the best story can be made boring if you do not have a good reader on an audio version.  Roger Allam reads this book and he is wonderful.  I would listen to him read the toothpaste tube and I'm sure I'd find it interesting like never before.     Now to the book itself-Everyone has heard of Sir Edmund Hilary, who was the first to conquer Mt. Everest, but have you heard of George Mallory?  No?  I hadn't either.  This story is about George Mallory and his passion for climbing....he quite possible could have been the first to conquer Everest though we will never know for sure, as the book starts off in 1999 where Mr. Mallory's body is found within several hundred feet from the summit.  Did he make it?  We can't be sure, though he had promised that he would put a picture of his beloved wife Ruth on the top if he indeed made the climb to the summit.  When he was found, they did find his wallet, but there was no picture.  (I would like to believe that he DID make it).      Now, once I heard that, right off the bat I was a little disheartened-now we have 9 disks of story that we don't know how it ends?  Well, yes, but somehow it seems very complete anyway.  In the story you get to know George, and his love of climbing.  He once was late to an interview at Cambridge and was told the gate would be locked so it was crucial he make it on time.  This did not stop George as he scaled it and came over no worse for wear (Good for you, George!).  George makes a fine career for himself as a teacher but continues his love for climbing, and scales many mountains in his path, but his one goal is to make it to the summit of Everest.  We learn much about George in the book, we learn of his love of Ruth, whom he marries and fathers three children with, and how he puts others above himself, in fact going back on one excursion on Everest to help a fellow climber.  George is unassuming, charming and driven.      I found myself drawn into the story and his life and wished we knew for sure that he had made it to the top.  Still, the mystery does not take away from the book in the least in my opinion.     At the end of the book there is a breakdown of all the characters in the book and what happened in their lives, which I liked, it brought a closure to all of the characters and left everything with a tidy ending...except for that mystery part.      I am very happy that I chose to listen to this audio version and learn about George Mallory.  Whether he made it or not it was a fabulous life and story that is now so well honored by Mr. Archer's rendition of his life.     If you are looking for just a good listen/read, I would highly recommend this.  I very much enjoyed it and believe all that like a good story would like it as well.

B001AQO3WY|1.0|I am a big fan of HBO series and I was extremely disappointed in this one, I Just finished 24 years in the US ARMY as an Infantryman and this depiction of the Iraq war is a joke, from the less than realistic backdrops to the absurd tactics, not to mention the wooden performances of 98% of the actors. After seeing this series I would be pretty upset if I were a Marine, because they are not even close as to how they are portrayed in this mess. If you want to see an outstanding HBO miniseries spend your money on \\"Band of Brothers\\". Otherwise run far from this one. There is just too much anti-war stitched through the episodes that takes allot of the \\"wind out of its sails\\".
B000286S8S|4.0|Edward, Alexander, Michael, Samuel and of course Diamond David are all here to rock you on this long-awaited, double disc of jams.<br /><br />This is your ultimate Van Halen experience. The only things missing are the newer songs from THE BEST OF VAN HALEN VOL. 1 and anything from Gary Cherone lead disaster, VAN HALEN 3. The songs spiritual sensing \\"Learning To See\\", horny getting' \\"Up For Breakfast\\" and reunion exhaustion \\"It's About Time\\" are not bad for their super long hiatus but nothing close to the vintage hits like the genesis \\"Running With The Devil\\" to Journey-vibin' BALANCE album. It's here. What's also here are 3 live tracks which VAN HALEN could have given one VH3 tune (just to make Gary feel important to the band), \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" from LIVE: RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW  and \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" in its place.<br /><br />Too much time and bitter feuds have caused Van Halen standing in darkness for long over a decade of a new album. But time changes things and people. Within time, maybe a new album will appear hopefully before a posthumous one.

B001FBSMF8|5.0|OK, from jump, I'll say this is one of those releases either people really love, or really hate. It definitely polarizes music fans...but before deciding to hate it, give it a chance.    I will admit; when I first gave this album a listen, I thought to myself \\"what the HELL?????!!!!\\" I didn't think the Timbaland/Cornell collab was such a good idea. And I honestly shelved it.     I say the following to put this review in context: I am a huge fan of music in general - as well as a very harsh critic at times - and it seems as if I go through genre seasons where I'll find musical satiation in different realms. Predominantly that had been w/ jazz, but the evolution is ever happening.    A good month later - about now - I decided to give this album another chance while in the office trying to get work done...and now I seem to be addicted to Chris' voice. I had of course heard him before, but sometimes it takes an artist deviating a bit from their norm (or what their fans BELIEVE is their norm; its all relative) to really give them the attention they deserve. And yet, having said that, Chris' norm appears to be deviation...and I really dig that (being an artist myself). He had/has the courage to follow where the muse leads, and wasn't afraid to do so. That's one of the main reasons I gave this album five stars.    The man's voice is phenomenal...its a living contradiction; a damn sonic boom. It has a weathered quality that makes listeners subconsciously know the experiences; feel the pain and happiness he's lived through. He can gently soar to echelons, then flip it and give you one of the earthiest growls you've ever heard.    \\"Long Gone\\" gives me goosebumps. I don't know...there's something about the way he sings \\"you need to let me fly alone...\\" that rings and reverbs in my head.    I dig the calm w/ which he approaches \\"Scream\\". In this track, he's the stability amidst chaos. And, there's something primal about they way he belts out \\"hey...\\" You have to listen to knowwhat I mean.    I like the funk of \\"Ground Zero,\\" and the masochism of \\"Enemy.\\"  Really the only track on this release I could do w/out is \\"Part Of Me.\\"     In my opinion, this album was designed to be listened to in one sitting. The songs mesh into one long, continuous track w/ instrumentals making the segues. Its important to listen to the songs in their respective contexts to really get it.    This release has some rockable beats as well(its hard to mistake Timbaland's contributions).    Lastly: after seeing Chris perform \\"Scream\\" live, I'm really hoping he releases an acoustic and/or live version of it. The guitars just take it to another level and minimize the sometimes pop-like feel.

B0009X7664|5.0|This 2 cd package is unbelievable.  The movie is wonderful and the remaining sections of the cd and the 2nd cd contain wonderful interviews with main characters years after the filming as well as Gregory Peck's accceptance of the academy award.  Terrific!
B000002MUN|3.0|3 1/2    The second side looses a bit of pulse, but Wildflowers remains one of Petty's most engaging works, the only one I've cared to own actually. Not being a classic rock fan in particular, some of his deepest and diverse studio work sounds evident throughout, likely your classic case of a Rubin sandwich artist revitalization.
B00000I07Q|4.0|Although `Slippery When Wet' was where Bon Jovi solidified their reputation as stadium demigods, `New Jersey' is the better record. I may be in the minority here but with the exception of \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" from the former, I like the hits from `Jersey' more.  Maybe Jon was trying to channel Bruce Springsteen and maybe he wasn't (I tend to agree with the critics on this one) there was no denying the band and its frontman had the chops if not the appeal of their Garden State elder.  \\"Bad Medicine\\" was another #1 and a great hair metal hit! \\"Born to Be My Baby\\" is not so much and it is an obvious \\"Livin' on a Prayer \\"II.  \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" is a pulverizing, feet out of your seat opener and \\"Blood on Blood\\" is probably the most Springsteenesque track (cept for \\"Living in Sin\\").  Overall, a long made for the CD age record with twelve songs of varying quality though overall the team of Fairbairn, Rock and Child remake the magic of 1986. \\"Love for Sale\\" and \\"Ride Cowboy Ride\\" continue the unplugged ride that was kick started by Jon and Richie sans the rest of the boys circa 1987-88 on MTV.  `New Jersey' may have not sold the amount of flapjacks that its predecessor sold, but seven million plus is no dud and Bon Jovi looked to remain the one American band who could rival the commercial onslaught of Sheffield, England's finest- Def Leppard.  We were so young....one for all and all for one...did Joe Elliot rip-off Dumas as well?
B00005LANG|4.0|What is often called his strongest synthesis may be a little too synthesized for purists but pound-for-pound stands as high as any other release from himself and in such, the genre.
B00000I07P|4.0|With `Slippery When Wet', Bon Jovi became America's answer to Def Leppard, a hard rock band that could sell a multi-platinum album to both the girls and the boys.  The third time was the charm as Jon and Richie hooked up with Bruce Fairbairn, Bob Rock and Desmond Child to create their most lasting document and one of the signature albums of the `80's.  Megastar status was now secured as \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" blasted out of radios during the summer of '86 and \\"Livin' on a Prayer'\\" provided the perfect follow-up later in that fall.  Both #1 hits mind you and the Bon Jovi express was going off the rails.  \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" would have to be considered the album's most classic song, not as dated as the aforementioned hits or \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" (never cared for that one).  When Jon and Richie played the song unaccompanied by the band on the MTV awards show and created the `Unplugged' phenomenon!  \\"Raise Your Hands\\" and \\"Social Disease\\" are two of my other favorites, unapologetic rockers celebrating sex drugs and rock and roll, or maybe just sex... `Slippery' was a document of the times and made Jon Bon Jovi the king of MTV and radio-friendly heavy metal...if you could call it that.

B001K3JF7K|1.0|This album is, not to put too fine a point on it, awful. Ms. Krall whispers into the microphone over the dullest string-heavy arrangements you can possibly imagine, containing a vaguely Latin beat but not the slightest musical imagination, and occasionally throws in a few bars of cocktail lounge piano. In a couple of spots she amateurishly sucks in some air in the middle of a phrase. There is no variety, just the same format over and over. The album is a virtual clone of her dismal \\"The Look of Love,\\" still occasionally heard in North America's better elevators. This gets one star because it would be fine background music for a wine-and-cheese party where no one would really be listening to it. I'm thrilled that Ms. Krall is happy as a wife and mother, but if she is going to make records she should buckle down and play. She knows how to make better albums than this; maybe someday she will again, if she hasn't totally sworn off jazz in favor of the lucrative temptation to do her worst instead of her best.

This is the book that opened my eyes to the world of graphic novels. The only problem is that every other book iv read (besides long halloween, recommended as well) has paled in comparison to this masterful work of art. I recommend this book a thousand times over!

B001EN71DQ|4.0|Although everyone can comprehend the idea of a \\"prequel,\\" it becomes confusing when talking the first or second set: \\"...do you mean the earlier story, or the earlier release?...\\"<br /><br />Which of the two box sets is preferred, will probably depend on how old you are. I saw the original \\"Episode IV,\\" if you will, in the theater in the 1970's and liked it. I saw the subsequent installments as they came out in the empty, early '80s, and thought they were very good movies, especially given they were out at a time when there weren't very many films of this type playing. With this in mind, the \\"prequel\\" series is a stark contrast to the earlier release. In ultra high resolution, with digital technology sharp enough to make the old TV I use seem like a Hi-Def state-of-the-art piece of brand new technology, real life now looks bland and blurry by comparison. But it seems, no matter how good the technology, CGI simply isn't convincing. It doesn't look real. But, you may say, this is a fantasy story, it isn't real anyway, why does it matter? It does, because the whole idea was based on the precept that real people interacted with all these creatures, in what looked like a real world, even if this world is \\"...in a galaxy far, far away.\\". But here, I often feel I am watching a video game. On-set camera work often dissolves into obvious animation, throwing a wrench into the flow of the experience. And good as it looks, it's just missing something. But things like Yoda's facial expressions are the the benefits of it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's a good piece of work, with a whole lot of effort used to make it what it is. This is undeniable. Just incongruous.<br /><br />The story itself is that of one Anikan Skywalker, known as \\"Ani\\" to his friends. Imagine a boy his friends and foes call, phonetically, \\"Annie.\\"  But when I see him I think of \\"Seven\\" Bundy, the ill-fated \\"Married...With Children\\" character. With much effort, I pushed my bias aside, and followed his journey, from a likable little kid, child prodigy, if you will, to his ultimate transformation into the villain we all now know as Darth Vader. Don'tcha hate when people call him \\"Dark Vader?\\" As the story goes on, it becomes more intense, as he becomes more and more self-absorbed and evil, climaxing with a high-speed sword fight with Obi-Wan, resulting in (I can NEVER process this kind of thing) his complete dismemberment. Even in a fictional story, I just can't wrap the brain around this. It's the one thing that simply freaks me out, every time. He is dismembered and burned beyond recognition, where upon he is rebuilt in a \\"Six Million Dollar Man\\" fashion and fitted with his helmet, black suit, and breathing device.<br /><br />And the stage is now set for the second half of the story, the three older movies to begin.<br /><br />As an aside, I thought the whole Jar Jar Binx thing was an insult to my intelligence. He was obviously scripted as an inept, silly character, plainly used for comic relief, but all attempts at humor fall flat. My dislike for him is based only on how stupid the whole thing was. And remember all the black activist groups making a stink about him portraying black people unfavorably? Hey Dee-Doo! He isn't even human.

Don'tcha hate when people call him \\"Dark Vader?\\" As the story goes on, it becomes more intense, as he becomes more and more self-absorbed and evil, climaxing with a high-speed sword fight with Obi-Wan, resulting in (I can NEVER process this kind of thing) his complete dismemberment. Even in a fictional story, I just can't wrap the brain around this. It's the one thing that simply freaks me out, every time. He is dismembered and burned beyond recognition, where upon he is rebuilt in a \\"Six Million Dollar Man\\" fashion and fitted with his helmet, black suit, and breathing device.     And the stage is now set for the second half of the story, the three older movies to begin.    As an aside, I thought the whole Jar Jar Binx thing was an insult to my intelligence. He was obviously scripted as an inept, silly character, plainly used for comic relief, but all attempts at humor fall flat. My dislike for him is based only on how stupid the whole thing was. And remember all the black activist groups making a stink about him portraying black people unfavorably? Hey Dee-Doo! He isn't even human.

B001TH16DS|5.0|I just got my copy by UPS and it's well worth the price. All the HDDVD extras are here along with beautiful transfers of the remastered series. BUT THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS ON HERE NOW. The best part is that you can, if you so choose to, can watch the original series in mono exactly as it was made. And if you want, you can even switch between the original and the remastered as it's playing. This is 24 hours of content for $80 which is a pretty sweet deal.
B000002KOQ|5.0|Put on the coffee, early morning, put in \\"Ladies\\" and start your day with \\"Morning Morgantown\\". You will immediately be drawn into the world of Joni. And what a place that is. This lady is beautiful inside and out and this is easily one of her 2 or 3 greatest albums. After all, it includes \\"Rainy Night House\\", right? Maybe her greatest song ever......I picture her looking out the window of her Laurel Canyon house all those years ago and just penning the entire album. The L.A. music scene in the 60's/early 70's was a magical place and time and Joni was a big part of it. I highly recommend this album, \\"Blue\\", \\"Court and Spark\\" and the amazing \\"Hejira\\" as albums that belong in every music collection. Buy this one or all of them and wear them out. It will be worth it. This will sadly be your only way to enjoy Miss Mitchell as she doesn't record or tour any longer. What a catalog of riches.......
B00000IMYA|4.0|The back cover of the CD mentions new extensive liner notes by Phil Schaap. Where are they? Inside I find only a listing of the track breakpoints and a miniature version of the original liner notes. Nothing by Schaap.
B000002GWN|5.0|This is a wonderful album and it caught Joni when she was still singing her confessional folk tunes to her long time fans but expanding out to reach new fans with her jazz-influenced songs. There is a LOT of introductions, pre-song rambling and general chatter in between the songs and it is totally edited from the CD. If you love Joni's enchanting speaking voice you will be disappointed in the CD version. If you can track down the original vinyl then the entire album will be included the way it was intended. \\"Rainy Night House\\" is so overwhelming on this album that the proper word to find is difficult. Spooky? Dark? One of her best recordings ever. The concert was recorded mostly at the old Universal Amphitheater and sounds perfect. I wish I could have been at this show. I have seen many shows at the old Amp when it was a open-air facility. They ruined it by putting a roof on it to rake in money year round. If you wanted to start a Joni collection, this would be a great place to start. Buy it and wear it out. She was one of a kind........
B001EQP9UK|4.0|Bookends is 29 minutes and 13 seconds and released April 3, 1968. Bookends reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums Chart and went Double Platinum. This was the duo fourth studio album. Five of the songs charted and is interesting to note not one of the song reached the Easy Listening charts since they are a folk group. I am no die hard Simon & Garfunkel fan; so I can be more liberal in my opinion. I did not care for the album. One side the music is soft and you need to turn the volume louder then usual while the other side the music is little loud and the volume can be adjusted to normal. I can only give Bookends a B+.

1439138311|4.0|This story takes place in the early 1950s and focus on an Irish girl named Eilis, whom we follow first in Ireland, then in her new life in America, then once more back to Ireland. This book does make you feel for Eilis and you get carried along in the story without realizing how much you have actually read. However (and this is the reason it did not get 5 stars from me) the ending seemed forced. It was like a different ending had been written and the author had been told that people would not like this ending so he went back and rewrote it to be a happier ending, and didn't exactly make perfect sense. But besides this you can't help but like this book, you get caught up with Eilis and the situations she is in, you can't help but feel for her when she gets homesick, or when she has to rush home (to Ireland) leaving Tony behind. This is a wonderful little semi romance book, and I would recommend it, despite the contrived ending.
B00003CXB4|5.0|If there is one word to describe this movie, it is perfection. Music, animation and storyline, everthing was done just right. It was meant to be a masterpiece, and it is.  Although many people criticize the fact that it might make younger children fearful or sad, I personaly find the painful elements a standout from many other disney movies. I was especially impressed by the death of Mufasa and the scene in which Timon and Pumbaa laughed at Simba for citing his father's comments about the stars. Simba experienced death of his father, and he was forced to accuse himself for the crime he did not commit (he suffered no less than anyone from the crime). And the wound could only be ignored (Hacuna Matata) but could never be cured, Until Scar revealed the truth himself of course(Well, it's a Disney movie after all). Even at the end, when the kingdom was restored, there is still something permenently lost. The story was based on a tragedy and it's not surprising that there remains some element of it.  While you might laugh over a comedy for hours, the remaining pain from a movie can make you think for days. And I find it easier to make one laugh than to make her cry. So some pain does have its merit.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|When one suspends disbelief anything may be possible. This is what the screenwriter, Eric Roth is banking on as filmgoers tread through the turnstiles to view this somewhat serendipitous form of artwork. Roth installed a similar mystic formula with Forrest Gump, and what a success it was. Button may not be as effective, but is of superior quality to say the least. This being said, the two Roth screenplays stand alone on their own merit, and should be adjudicated separately.    There is a subtly smooth poetry attached to the dynamics of the picture. I found myself enthralled by the effective musical score. It is one of the best I've ever been entertained by in film. Though the length of the film is a staggering 167 minutes, the time spent is critical to the plot and story. Enigmatic yet talented director David Fincher uses these minutes to allow the story to regressively age much like the main character. Those who attempt to deliberate the story with rhyme or reason will assuredly be repelled by the films length, viewing it as an ordeal. However, the suspension of disbelief has its privileges, and the imaginative will cherish the extension.    The cast is exceptionally talented, including Cate Blanchette, Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson, Julia Ormond, and Elias Koteas. All performances by the aforementioned were well done and very professional. The trouble for me is that some were too professional, and with a hint of starch. The most engaging from this group was Julia Ormond who plays Daisy's forlorn daughter. Swinton delivers an illuminating depiction as one of Button's lovers. Taraji P. Henson, playing Benjamin's mother, proves to warrant 'major force' status in cinema. As for the intricate Mr. Button, Brad Pitt unleashes a rock solid performance; displaying a fine texture of consistency and veracity from age 70 to 17.    So often it occurs, where screenplays for fantasy and romance type films become stuffy and arduous, but this wasn't the case here. Screenwriter Eric Roth never attempts to enlarge upon the essential intimacy of Benjamin Button's private hell vs. the grand nature of the surrounding events. The characters are uniquely capsulated and do not overwhelm the story. Equally admirable, is the editing, which is transitionally effortless. The cinematography, art direction, and set decoration are all outstanding. Visually, this is astonishing and superb film making.     Depending on one's sense of imagination, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button may lead you along for an enchanting expedition or a dismal exposé. Pertaining to self, it was the former.
B0020VKZ4I|2.0|I can't find any difference between this album and the previously realeased, \\"The Look of Love\\" except for the song, \\"So Nice\\". It sounded more ballad with full orchestra instead of B-3 Hammond in the original version by Astrud Gilberto. Overall, \\"Quiet Nights\\" is quite a disappointment.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\" Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />BEWARE OF SPOILERS.<br /><br />There is a certain segment of the German mentality that is Hanna Schmidt.  English Kate Winslet captures the intent of novelist Bernhard Schlink in her interpretation of the character.  Hanna was an ordinary but proud woman of discipline who always did her duty, a woman without the ability to separate herself from what she knew was right and what was wrong, but a woman who was able to hide from herself what she did that was wrong.<br /><br />She seduces fifteen-year-old Michael Berg.  She finds him doubly useful as a reader of great literature. She knows it will not work.  Of course how could it?  She indulges herself but, being strong and proud, is able to divorce herself from him emotionally when the time comes, as it must.  When he reads D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover to her, she is genuinely offended at the open sexuality, but we viewers are taken back since what she is doing with 15-year-old Michael Berg is on the screen and naked before our eyes.<br /><br />In a sense this is the somewhat familiar story of the young man of station and potential had briefly in his youth by the older woman who has neither station nor potential.  They take advantage of one another for the time being, both knowing that they will move on.  But young Michael is not fully aware of this old story because his station in life is, although above hers, still rather modest, and being fifteen and knowing a woman for the first time, he is in love as much as--or even more than--a fifteen-year-old can be.<br /><br />She is short with him and selfish because she knows she will be tossed aside and so instinctively knows she needs to get something now.  She calls him \\"kid\\" and consumes him, as would be the case in such a relationship.  Yet there is his \\"reading.\\"  He has a talent for it and he enjoys reading to her.  At one point she instructs him, reading first and then making love.<br /><br />What is love?  Hanna Schmidt does not know.  And so her character is triply flawed.  She has low self-esteem, hiding her illiteracy from all.  She is removed from her feelings because of the past.  That is how she has coped.  What she has done she knows on one level was something horrendous; but on another level she only took the job at Siemens.  What else was she to do?  She was a guard.  She had to guard the prisoners, otherwise there would be chaos.  This is her defense. This is her belief.  And finally, she cares for young Michael as she cares for herself, as one might care for valuable livestock, but she neither loves him nor herself.  For again \\"What is love,\\" as Tina Turner once had it, \\"but a second-hand emotion\\"?<br /><br />At the end we see her, an old woman in prison being visited by the adult Michael Berg.  She has put out her hand to him, and he, being human, has touched it.  But he has withdrawn his hand.  And now they stand and she leans, ever so slightly toward him to be hugged perhaps, to be touched for perhaps the first time in decades.  But he does not respond.  He cannot.<br /><br />This echoes back to an earlier scene when he, as a young law student suddenly finds himself observing her trial.  He realizes that she is taking the blame for the deaths of the Jewish \\"prisoners\\" because she would rather do that then reveal that she cannot read or write.  It is interesting that young Berg realizes the truth of why she liked to be read to only then.  And so he thinks to save her by letting the court know that she could not have written the order that condemned the prisoners to death.  And so he makes an appointment to go to the prison and see her.  But as she waits for her unknown visitor to arrive, he suddenly turns away.  What he realizes, one speculates, is that there is nothing he can say to her or to the court that will change anything.  Whether she wrote the actual order or not really doesn't matter.  The others get off with lighter sentences, but all of them are equally guilty of whatever it was that was that allowed the German psyche to allow the holocaust.  And too Berg is not clear about how he feels.  Here is a woman he once loved who now is revealed as a monster.  Yes, she is a monster, but strange to say almost an innocent monster.<br /><br />It is curious that Berg so deeply loved her that he acquires her trait of emotional distance.  He learns he can only sleep alone.  His marriage fails.  He is not as close to his daughter as he would like.  And finally he is not able to help Hanna when she is alone in prison.  He cannot bring himself to respond to her letters.  And yet he reads to her.  Hour after hour after hour he reads the classics into a microphone and sends the tapes to her to listen to in prison.<br /><br />I wonder how this was received in Germany.  There is such a guilt that hangs over the generations after the war.  I wonder what they think of the humanization of a certain familiar mentality.  And I must add that this mentality that follows orders and does its duty to the exclusive of its humanity is not something special with the Germans of that era.  It is a human trait that is expressive of a human type that can be found in any society.<br /><br />This is a deeply moving film, exquisitely written and directed and wondrously acted by especially the great Kate Winslet, and Ralph Fiennes who plays the older Michael Berg, and David Kross who plays the younger Michael Berg.  The Reader is easily the best film I've seen during the past year.ers get off with lighter sentences, but all of them are equally guilty of whatever it was that was that allowed the German psyche to allow the holocaust.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|it started with my girlfriend being obsessed with the show. And then Sci-fi channel was showing the Pilot episode late one night, and upon watching just the pilot, i was hooked.<br /><br />Ok, first i can see why this gets bad reviews. its not for everyone. its intense. its deep. and lately i have noticed that everything has to be dumbed down for mass consumption. I am glad Abrams refuses to dumb it down.<br /><br />anyway, I went out and bought the first four boxsets and consumed the whole series (so far) in little over a month. my sister is actually moving through quicker than I!<br /><br />Yes, you are left with many unanswered questions at the end of every episode, but so far every single one has been answered.<br /><br />every episode adds another twist. and i like that. its \\"out-there\\" as i say and i like that too. equal parts drama and sci-fi.<br /><br />if you dont like to think, then this probably isn't for you.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|Supposably an adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with the insertion of a modern day character.  The modern woman through a fanciful plot twist has to substitute for Elizabeth Bennett.  This in its self could make an engaging alternative telling.  HOWEVER, this ploy is used to denigrate this classic novel.  The characters completely turn the plot on its head in an attempt to substitute late 20th Century liberal mores.  The movie has the modern character inform Mr. Bingley that Jane Bennett is a lesbian.  This completely ignores the perfectly valid customs and culture of the English country Folk of the early 1800s. It goes on to infuse Elizabeth Bennett with a modern \\"career woman\\"  mentality. Even a cursory knowledge of Jane Austen's letters would refute the intentions sometimes ascribed by modern feminist Literature professors to this work.  Save your time and money, instead pick up A&E's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Better yet, savor once more Jane Austen's original novel.
0783231202|3.0|I ordered this movie as a last minute buy for a retreat I was working on.  After reviewing all the merchants, I chose the one I did because he was located in the same state I am, and I thought the package would get here quickly.  I even paid for the expedited shipping.    It turns out that it actually took about the same amount of time to receive the product even if I didn't pay for the expedited shipping.  For whatever reason, the package went from NC to GA in order to be shipped to my house which is in NC.  For something that only would have taken maybe 2-3 days by US Mail, took 5 days by DHL....makes no sense to me!!  I had to go out and buy the movie at a Best Buy since the movie did not arrive to me in enough time for the beginning of the retreat.
0525478183|4.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable book! I stayed up until 2:30am last night reading, and not many books can do that to me. I just had to see what would happen next, not to mention the hysterical one-liners and dialog between characters. I would recommend this to anyone. My only peeve with it, in all honesty, was the ending. It just remains completely unsatisfactory for me. I'm not entirely sure why.<br /><br />One other thing to add, is that I now am going to start reading Whitman; I WANT to, desperately. And I basically hate poetry. So, thank you, John Green!
0316168815|5.0|Used book, great value, great speed in delivery.  It is next on my list to read.  Highly recommended by members of our book club.
038533348X|5.0|Wow. Wow! I just finished this spectacular read, and it left me breathless. Multiple times, throughout the book, it had me laughing hysterically so, that I was forced to actually put the book down, and walk away for a few minutes. How hard it was though, indeed! I hardly put this book down, which is a rarity for me.<br /><br />This was my first Vonnegut read, but it most certainly will NOT be my last! A great place to start if you aren't familiar with his work. Thought-provoking, gently pokes fun at most every topic, and is guaranteed to make you question. Read it, read it, read it!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|I have read a few reviews that bashed Slumdog, and though I see a point to them, I LOVE this film. I have lived in Faridabad ( just outside of Deli), and have firsthand seen some of the things the film touched on. In the spirit of Mira Nair, Boyle opens ones eyes to this incredible country, but he doesn't sugar coat things like most Bollywood films ( which are basically musicals, some with depth others that are laughable but enjoyable nonetheless).<br />Slumdog divulges what real India is like: a fight for survival, but one that has moments of beauty in it as well. Again, MOMENTS. The amount of children MUTILATED and forced by parents and others to work is disgusting. It is beyond belief. I was in the Deli area, and that has nothing on Calcutta or some of the bad areas of Mumbai.<br />And despite this, one can see a beauty in these people that simply does not exist in the West. One brief scene ( SPOILER) in the movie when Dev is about to play the last round of Millionare, a woman on the street taps on his window and says 'go and win it all'. THIS type of genuine 'I'm happy for you', aka namaste, aka respect exists amongst the dire poverty.<br />And then Slumdog dives into the Muslim-Hindu tension. In the kashmir region, fighting is horrendous. This type of confusion, dislike, and sometimes hatred exists between these two religions, and now with the recent terrorist attacks, things aren't looking too good.<br />Slumdog Millionaire shows how hard working, diligent, determined, and driven many ( most) Indians are in their fight to survive and feed themselves/their families. The main character has to do this from when he was born, which is a sad reality for many infants/kids there.<br />THE FILM IS ARTISTIC, FAST PACED AND TYPICAL BOYLE STYLE, WITH A GREAT SOUNDTRACK.<br />Please watch it, and then DO something about what you have seen. Go and visit the country. It will change your life.

B001E5FYS8|4.0|Excellent, daring, insanity driven person.  I compare him to the man  who lived amongst the Grizzly Bears, who ultimately killed him.  Man on  a Wire had me on the edge of my seat with his daring feats.  Amazing, but  absolutely insane.  Loved his charismatic personality that drew others  into his dream to tightrope across the Twin Towers in N.Y.  They loved  him even after his fame caused him to abandon them in the end.
1401207529|5.0|I am new to the world of Batman graphic novels. I'm a fan of the recent movies and decide to try some comics. This was an excellent read, great story of how he became this legendary character. The artwork is very nice and the writing is tight and mature. This graphic novel is over 20 years old and it holds up well. Fast reading and perfect for any age, any type of fan. I highly recomend it.

B000NVWXWO|4.0|After the fierce White Light/White Heat, this third album saw the Velvet Underground in a calmer, more contemplative mood exploring their softer side which first surfaced on songs like Sunday Morning and I'll Be Your Mirror on the [[ASIN:B000002G7C first]] album.<br /><br />The exceptions are What Goes On with its shimmering guitars and Beginning To See The Light with its urgent rock riff and almost Stones-like flavour. Some Kinda Love is softer although there is still that unique driving edginess in the rhythm.<br /><br />The gem of the album is Pale Blue Eyes, where [[ASIN:0859651649 Lou Reed]] surpasses himself as a poet with intimate, arresting images. This wistful ballad must be one of the most beautiful songs of all time. The melody is amongst the legendary group's most appealing whilst the delivery is perfect.<br /><br />There are plenty of other beautiful ballads like Jesus, I'm Set Free & That's The Story Of My Life. The Murder Mystery consists of spoken and sung parts over a brooding backing that becomes dissonant toward the end. This classic album concludes with the playful acoustic number Afterhours.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Synopsis:  Robin Randzinski, though better known by his ring name Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (played by Mickey Rourke), is an aging wrestler who went from selling out the Madison Square Garden in the late '80s to splitting time between wrestling at a semi-professional level and working as a butcher's assistant just to make a living.  Living alone and close to poverty, he befriends a stripper named Pam, who herself is better known by her stage name Cassidy (Marisa Tomei.)  After wrestling in a particularly brutal hardcore match, Randy suffers a heart attack and learns his body can no longer take the strain of competing as a wrestler, thanks in a large part due to years of drug abuse.  With a new outlook on life, Randy realizes his biggest regret:  Losing contract with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).  He does what he can to adjust to normal life, but can Randy escape the self-destructive behaviors that got him to where he's at in the first place?    Mickey Rourke's portrayal of a faded wrestler was the largest reason why I was floored after I saw this film.  I've met people who've wrestled semi-professionally and have seen wrestling documentaries such as [[ASIN:B00004U8H3 Beyond The Mat]], so I use my experiences with both as a yard stick in saying this.  Rourke's performance was beyond remarkable in regards to authentic it felt.  He put himself through what many others put themselves through on a regular basis to demonstrate the suffering these performers go through to maintain the sport and entertain it's fans.  Rourke didn't just play the role in the film; he became Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson and you couldn't help but give your empathy toward his character, no matter how much of a screw up he was.    I also enjoyed Marisa Tomei's role in the film (and no, not just because of the nude scenes.)  I've met women who, like wrestlers, have had to sell their body just so they can get by.  She demonstrates the balance of having to use your sexuality to make a living while having to protect herself from both abuse and emotional attachment.  Much like Rourke's character, she can't escape her stage persona simply because she isn't working; it's ingrained into who she is because of what she does.    In the end there were no fireworks, no glory, no spectacular situations for anyone to claim champions of.  There's no Hulk Hogans or Stone Cold Steve Austins to excite thousands in attendance and millions watching at home.  There are only the gutsy up-and-coming semi-pro wrestlers trying to be the next star, over-the-hill semi-pro wrestlers trying to recapture who they used to be, and small venues jam packed with the hundreds of fanatic fans who'll keep coming as long as the door's open for them.  The wrestling can be hard to watch but it's nothing that's overexaggerated; it's only what many do to themselves for the love of what they do and the entertainment of those who cheer for them.    This has managed to become one of my personal favorite movies.  I recommend it to all.    Update:  8/19/2014 - I went back and re-watched the film.  To my delight, many of the \\"semi-pros\\" who were featured on here are now showcased in the WWE or TNA.  Cesaro, R-Truth, and Robbie E are all here in their pre-National television personas.  Perhaps the real life story is better than the one painted here...
B000PMGS8G|5.0|I'm not really the biggest science fiction fan, but there is no denying that \\"Flash Gordon\\" is a real masterpiece.<br /><br />I say it is much better than \\"Star Wars,\\" because for the most part, \\"Star Wars\\" is basically a good guy, bad guy, shoot em up series. (With the one exception of \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" which shows Anakin's tragic fall into evil.)<br /><br />\\"Flash Gordon\\" is a much deeper story. Flash is an ordinary football player who finds himself suddenly thrust into space, and he discovers that Ming the Merciless is going to destroy the earth. So, Flash tries to stop him with what knowledge he has. (Football knowledge!) So rather than superheroes, we have ordinary people who use what knowledge they have. (Great!)<br /><br />Moving on, we see that there are different factions who oppose Ming, but the different factions don't care much for each other either. So, our football hero has to do what he can to not only make friends with the different factions, but get them to work together against Ming as well. (Even better!)<br /><br />Max Von Sydow makes Ming very, very bad. But he carries a charm that makes it virtually impossible not to like him a little. (Especially when he has a one on one chat with Flash and expresses that he would rather have Flash on his side.)<br /><br />Dale is a great woman of interest for Flash. She can be romantic, but she also shows a little 'girl power,' and she has a now and then explosive fury which adds some comic relief: \\"Let go of me! I just got engaged!\\"<br /><br />All in all it is a great story full of menace, suspense, and the much needed comic relief. It also has a great coming together of different subplots, not to mention the totally awesome music by Queen.<br /><br />I'm not even a science fiction fan, and I say there is NOT ONE dull moment.<br /><br />An interesting side note is that this movie has a nice transition from 70s-80s feel.
0553381687|5.0|I'm relatively new to the fantasy genre, so A Game of Thrones was an incredible treat. Let's forget a moment that it is a fantasy, with swordplay, magic, and talk of dragons, and look at it just on its merits as a novel. It's easily one of the best crafted novels I've ever read. The plotting is superlative, with multiple story lines converging then going in unexpected directions again and again. The actions sequences are intense and vividly drawn. There's intrigue, suspense, tragedy, love. The story grabs you by the collar and pulls you pell mell into a world unlike any you've ever experienced.<br /><br />The best part, however, is the characters. No mere cardboard cutouts, these. Martin has brought to life people that are all too fallible and therefore decidedly human. You believe these people exist in a way too few writers are able to achieve.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that grabs you and keeps pulling you on and on, GET THIS BOOK. Again, forget the \\"fantasy\\" tag. This is one powerful novel period. Highly recommended.
0452289963|5.0|Found A New Earth so enlightening that I wanted to share with my family and friends. I've purchase 10 so far, given 9 away. As this book was passed along to me by a friend, so it goes. I refer to it quite often if I find myself getting off track and letting the ego take over, as well as stimulating its readers to share enriching conversations regarding it's knowledge. I've also found The Secret to be a fun addition to this book. If we all used this knowledge daily, made it part of who we are, it indeed would be a new earth.

The beatles went defunct in 1970. So popped up zeppelin and the torch was passed. They became in the 70`s what the beatles where in the 60`s. A freaking creative juggernaut. Even the albums considered bad or not so great by zep (PRESENCE AND IN THROUGH THE OUTDOOR) are superior to many bands others. I personally like physical graffiti the most. Presence though is a close second. The rest are a close 3rd. I must say the natural progression from the beatles to zeppelin has not been replicated. The most dominant group of the 80s was genesis and phil collins. So much for progression. I guess u could say metallica. But they did not dominate the 80s. They were underground. And were not as experimental as the beatles and zep until 1996 load.     I say the 90s grunge movement was influenced by the heavy zepsters. Alice n chains, nirvana and soundgarden were all heavily influenced by zep. They had some experimentation in them. No one today carries the torch. Glad the music lives on. Buy in through the outdoor.carouselambra kicks ace. Though considered one of there weaker albums, it demolishes many of there peers and even current rockers. TTYL
0141439688|5.0|Would you let someone persuade you to leave the one you love?  That is what Anne Elliot does.  Frederick Wentworth is a dashing naval officer, but well beneath Anne's station.  She is, after all, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, baronet and master of Kellynch Hall.  Not only is Wentworth a penniless officer, he is also ambitious and confident.  According to Anne's particular friend Lady Russell, those qualities are unbecoming in a man.  And so, out of safety, Anne severs her engagement to Wentworth.  Fast-forward eight years.  Anne is now twenty-seven, still single, still disinclined to marry.  Her father has little money and is now forced to let Kellynch Hall to a well-respected admiral.  Among the admiral's society is Anne's former fianc&eacute;, now Captain Wentworth, well respected and very rich.  Anne's love for Wentworth reemerges, but is it too late?  Is his indifference so big that he won't even speak to her?  Could she somehow persuade him to give their love another try?<br /><br />This is Jane Austen's final finished work.  It was published in 1818, one year after her death.  Persuasion is a masterpiece and my second favorite Austen (after Pride and Prejudice).  This novel contains Austen's signature comedy of manners, but it's not her funniest effort.  It is, however, her most romantic.  Whose heart doesn't break when Anne watches Wentworth court both the Musgrove sisters, and listens to her sister and brother-in-law argue over who Wentworth should choose to be his bride?  Who hasn't choked up with The Letter?  (Persuasion fans know what I'm talking about.)  This is the third -- or is it the fourth? -- time I read this book, and I still tear up when I read that bit!  Persuasion is a wonderful novel, but it isn't perfect.  Various secondary characters are either one-dimensional or underdeveloped, and I would have liked the scenes in Lyme to be expanded, for those are my favorite scenes.  Alas, if you're an Austen fan, there is plenty of her signature stuff here: the pretentious gentry, the unscrupulous opportunists, the parties and get-togethers and courtships and descriptions of the countryside.  I like that this novel is partly set in Bath, giving it the genuine Regency setting that makes Jane Austen unique.  If you've never read Persuasion, I cannot persuade you to read this enough!  And if you've read this and are a fan, may I perhaps persuade you to read it again?ff here: the pretentious gentry, the unscrupulous opportunists, the parties and get-togethers and courtships and descriptions of the countryside.

067088278X|4.0|This would be a wonderful children's story if it were not for a critical plot flaw.  The rhyme and meter roll off the tongue and the pictures are engaging.  The flaw comes in the subplot developed in the pictures.  The Wicked Witch is being attacked by Robin Hood in the middle of this book.  Yet with no explanation these characters reconcile by the last page.    Overall this is a good book.  It would be excellent were it not for this glaring inconsistency.
1400063515|1.0|I bought this book after seeing Taleb on CNBC and being very impressed with what he had to say then.  I was very disappointed in the book....probably one of the more poorly crafted books I have read in a long while.  He claims in the introduction that the effort to write his book was effortless and that 'the book just wrote itself'.........and it shows.  It was a chaotic read and at first I thought that that was his PLAN to keep us in chaos given the theme of his book and that somehow then it would resolve itself in a fun ending of some kind. Didn't happen. The author could have made his point well in about 20 pages (and don't get me wrong, there were EXCELLENT points in this book) but instead it just droned on . Frustrating as well would be he would introduce a subheading within a chapter as if he was going to address that topic, and then never did.  If you want a much more enjoyable way to cover this same kind of material....and done so much more informatively.....I'd recommend the 1978 BBC video series of James Burke \\"Connections\\".  It's amazing how much Burke covered in 1978 that still is relevant today and stated far much better than Taleb.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|You know.... Movies are an art form, and like any art form taste is a personal thing. I reluctantly watched Slumdog Millionaire, as my wife insisted due to the overwhelming high praise lavished on this film, and while it isn't the worst movie I've seen, it wasn't really my cup of cocoa.<br /><br />For me it had a few issues, for one thing for a movie about some Islamic characters, it was an ironically, Hindu tale in that it was heavy in Karma, but that may be quibbling. More to the point, it was so depressing and violent. Not action movie violent, but sadistic and disgustingly violent. As a movie about India, it is not much of a tourist invitation.<br /><br />What did work for me was the overall message about why would someone be murderous in the name of religion? That the events of your life for good or ill, make up who you are.<br />That true love should win in the end.<br /><br />As for the rest of it... The metaphors were largely lost on me, and the stupid American bit who buys away all trouble, was a bit ham fisted. The music video during the credits... I guess that's a cultural diversity educational bit.<br /><br />So were there things to admire about the film? Yes.<br />Was it the film of the year? Not for me.

I'll be nice I put you back before Cliff died R.I.P. So all of yall can swing your long hair till you break your necks. This is a great album the best since And Justice. I do like the black album and Load for that matter, RELoad I can do without it just ok. It goes to show you can't make some people happy. And whats with everyone saying this abum sounds messed up. Its sounds fine to me with or without my head phones. I have a really good stereo with a subwoofer. This damn album will blow the roof off of your house.

It contains nuggets of cinematic drama and beauty that still move me eight years after first hearing this disc.  If I had to pick a theme, it would be a wounded lover reminiscing about a distant affair of once-in-a-lifetime passion conducted in several beautiful cities. At least that's what runs through my mind :)    True, there are few bits of wonky experimental filler, but the rest of the album more than makes up for it.
055357342X|5.0|With this book, GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire has been cemented as my favorite fantasy series of all time.  Martin's epic saga is able to draw you in, mesmerize you, beat you up, and spit you out as nothing else in literature.  A STORM OF SWORDS continues the same powerful, gritty, complex, and enormous tale, and maintains or intensifies the same fast-paced, emotionally-draining pace as the first two books.  Some of the world-altering, storyline-changing twists found in this book come as such surprises (for me) that you'll find yourself needing a pause just to really consider what just happened and the implications for the rest of the story.  Most of the same great characters (except for those that have been killed off) continue to develop here, and some of those you previously hated begin to earn your grudging respect and admiration.  Also, in this third book, you finally get a little more in the way of maps.  Both the Eastern continents (partial) and the lands north of the Wall are detailed in the same convincing way as the old maps (which haven't disappeared).<br /><br />I should be used to it by now, but Martin's twists and sudden redirections of the plot continue to catch me off guard.  Every time you think you have the feel for where the plot is taking you, something major and usually unexpected occurs to send it off in a totally new direction.  And Martin doesn't take his time with this development.  Every single chapter chronicles some plot-altering event that you just couldn't imagine leaving out of this tale.  No wasted space here, even with a book approaching 1000 pages.  I hate to see other reviewers complaining about how long his books are taking to get published because I'd much rather Martin take the time he needs to write this story as masterfully as he has up till now than throw something together that is less than perfect.  He has built this story up into something so huge and amazing that it would be all to easy for it to come tumbling down into disappointment with a couple of poor decisions or corners cut.  Even though it is torture waiting to find out what will happen, the reward is sure to be well worth the wait.  I only feel sorry for those aging fans that may not live long enough to see this through!<br /><br />I do have a couple of friends that have read this series up to this point and been less than pleased.. It has always puzzled me as to how that could be, when the series is so powerfully written and intense.  I've come to the conclusion that it must simply be too much for some people.  This emotionally-draining roller-coaster ride with never-ending and catastrophic twists, turns, and wrecks can be completely exhausting, and for the less-than-dedicated reader willing to give their full attention, this book is too complex, too intense, and simply too big.  But for those of us that love getting lost in a world this well-developed and vivid, this series is the absolute best!<br /><br />I am making myself wait to read the next book, [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows]], for as long as I can so that I can prolong the enjoyment and so that I'll have as short a wait as possible for the book after.

B00062IVKS|4.0|Here's a gritty, film noir-type story of real-life former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, a film that has features some memorable aspects to it.    Perhaps most memorable is the physical transformation of lead actor Robert De Niro, who gained somewhere around 50 pounds to play LaMotta at the end of this film.    The story moves well with few, if any, lulls and each fight scene is fairly credible although a little too brief. I'd like to have seen more boxing but it's better than having to sit through the overdone action as we saw in the \\"Rocky\\" pictures. The black-and-white photography also is excellent in here and makes me wish more modern-day films were done in black-and-white.    Usually the Hollywood actresses are a lot better looking than the real-life people they portray but that's not the case here with LaMotta's wife, Vicki. Cathy Moriarity doesn't hold a candle to the real \\"Vicki,\\" who was a knockout, a voluptuous woman feature several times in Playboy magazine.     A warning for families: there is excessive profanity throughout this film.  If you can stand that constant profane assault on your ears, it's still a very watchable movie. I found this to be one of those films that kept getting better with multiple viewings.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I was a bit of a late convert to Dexter - starting half-way through the first series and getting sucked in from there - so finally having the DVDs of the first season.<br /><br />It is a truly fascinating series that followes Dexter, a blood expert working for the police, who also happens to be a serial killer. I find his rules interesting as well as the background of what happened to him as a child - the flashbacks really help to move the story along. Deb - what can you say? She's the adopted sister that you both want to have and don't at the same time. Not for the faint-hearted - but for anyone who has a darker side - worth a watch just for laughs and edge of your seat storylines!<br /><br />I found the quality excellent and I had no issues that others have mentioned with the discs. A must buy!

B0006J28MI|4.0|This is definitely teen fare, but it's very entertaining which means adults would get a lot of laughs out of it.    There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch. I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show.     As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny. Along the way, you get  a few swear words that you wouldn't want your little ones to hear, but overall, I have little to criticize with this one.
B0000844I8|1.0|Amazon.com should make it more clear, that this is not the standard \\"Ultimate Edition\\" but the Ultimate Edition (version 2).  These are not the same sets.  Even though reviews and images posted are of the original... THIS IS NOT IT.    The V.2 does not come with the original theatrical version, and is just the \\"Extended Cut\\".  On top of that the transfer is so poor, you have a better chance of seeing a higher quality version taped off of a television broadcast from 15 years ago.  The picture is excessively grainy, blurry in most spots, and the colors are faded or washed out.      This belongs in a dollar DVD bin. I thought that for less than[..] on sale, I was getting a bargain... now I feel ripped off. While it may cost close to your standard video rental, it will be watched fewer times.  It's truly sad that such a magnificent movie can't ever be viewed again how it was originally intended to be seen.    My advice... Avoid all Artisan Entertainment products until they can figure out how a movie is meant to be watched.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|After watching this for first time, I thought to myself, \\"Wow, with some appropriate editing, this ought to be required viewing for high school students as it's probably one of the best \\"anti-drug\\" presentations one could ever see.    Young filmmaker Darren Aronofsky takes a depressing subject and makes \\"entertaining,\\" if that's possible. Aronofsky uses stop- action/fast forward techniques, sound effects, hallucination scenes, etc. all to make this a good movie for the senses. A warning, though - a couple of scenes are anything but fun to view. It can get rough.    Ellen Burstyn is outstanding in this film and many people who viewed this thought she should have won an Academy Award for her performance. Boy, if she doesn't scare you away from taking diet pills, nobody can. She's the only one in this film that is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly can be one easily ogled by us guys but she plays so many sleazy, unlikeble roles, it's tough to warm up to her.    Jared Leto, meanwhile, does his best to show us the horrors of what could happen when you hooked on junk which involves needles. In the last 30 minutes there are a few horrifying scenes with him. It is grim, very grim but maybe that's what all of us need to see once in awhile.

B000EOTAM6|2.0|Taken on its own, this is a so-so B science fiction movie with very nice effects and visuals.  But as an adaptation of the animated series, it is pretty terrible.<br /><br />Granted that the TV series's storylines were always byzantine, often bordering on the incomprehensible, but there was always a lot of thought and wit behind them, and the dialogue was consistently brilliant.  It was a show that expected a lot of its audience, and it's unfortunate that a lot of people (the makers of this movie in particular) can't see past the show's eye candy.  By comparison, this film's script just drips mediocrity.  The effects are wonderful and must have cost a fair penny, and they really do capture the distinctive look of the show, so I can't help but wish they'd taken the time to write a decent story that was somewhat faithful to its source material.<br /><br />They could have at least tried to get the basics of the premise right.  In the original show, Aeon is a super-competent freelance agent, working to undermine the rule of Trevor Goodchild, an eccentric megalomanic scientist who has seized political control of the city-state of Bregna (pronounced BREN-yeh) to use as a giant petri dish for his scientific and social engineering experiments.  Trevor is weirdly charismatic and seems to genuinely believe he is creating a utopia, despite the obvious dystopian aspects of the world he has made.  Across the heavily guarded border lies the rival nation of Monica.  We never see much of Monica, but it appears to be a much freer place than Bregna, and Aeon frequently helps people try to sneak across the border, as well as sabotaging all of Trevor's crackbrained pet projects as they occur to him.  Although she clearly sympathizes with Monica, she \\"takes no side\\" and is essentially an anarchist, rebelling against any controlling authority, and therefore despising Trevor's despotism.  Further complicating matters is the fact that Aeon and Trevor share a past, the details of which are never given, and are still deeply infatuated with one another, even though they are now enemies.<br /><br />So there you go!  The makings of a terrific movie script, right?<br /><br />I guess not.  In this movie, Aeon is not her own boss, but instead is a minion taking orders from a rebel organization called the Monicans.  Monica itself does not exist.  Trevor never staged a coup, but is instead the hereditary monarch of Bregna (pronounced BREG-na).  Most of humanity was wiped out by a disease generations ago, and Brega is all that's left.  People have been getting secretly killed by Trevor's government, so the Monicans want to kill Trevor.  Aeon begins experiencing flashbacks to a past with Trevor that she doesn't clearly remember.  Without spoiling the big revelation about why Trevor's government is assassinating people, I can say that Trevor's personality and motivations end up bearing no resemblence to the original, and that the original was a lot more interesting.  For her part, Aeon is far less confident than her animated counterpart, and spends most of the movie being led around by various different people and being unsure what to do.  When she finally does something proactive toward the end of the film... frankly, it seems like kind of a stupid action under the circumstances, but it works out.  The dialogue is a huge let-down, with none of the wonderful, multi-leveled verbal sparring betwen Aeon and Trevor that defined their relationship in the original show.  Aeon does get in a couple of very good lines right as she's about to make the above-mentioned big decision, however.<br /><br />The funky music is cool, and the film is fun to look at.  Charlize Theron does an admirable job with the material she's given; I'm impressed by how well she nailed the animated character's voice.  On it's own merits, it's not such a bad film, just nothing remarkable.

After graduating I felt that I really didn't need the book in the work environment. Now that I'm over 50 (I hate to admit it), my memory isn't sharp as it was when I was a young whipper snapper. Since our society is running at such a faster pace, I need to be able to memorize things quickly. Remembering how it helped me get through my college years, I'm ordering it again to get me through my pre-senior years.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|I love this movie! It was a stroke of genius to use the music of the Beatles combined with a multitude of touchstones both actual and symbolic to create an odyssey through the mid-60s and early 70s. While it is surely a flight of fantasy and often plays fast and loose with actual history I think the filmmakers and actors have exactly captured the journey that our culture and many of us who lived through those years experienced in a very personal way.    Starting with the fresh and exuberant rise of the Liverpool sound, personified by Jude, a dockworker, which soon found its way to America (as does Jude), the movie follows the rise of the counterculture focusing on the twin energies of the music and the antiwar movement. But it's not done in any even faintly objective way. Rather the movie expresses it through the individual and their experiences. Jude, from Liverpool; Max, the upper middle class college dropout who ends up in Vietnam and comes back physically and emotionally damaged; Lucy, Max's sister, who becomes caught up and radicalized by the protest movement; Sadie, a blues rocker who mirrors Janis Joplin; JoJo, the black guitarist reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix, seeking refuge from the riots and violence of an inner-city ghetto in his music; Prudence the Midwestern cheerleader and emerging lesbian. And the cast goes on, each portraying a different aspect (and often a specific personality) of the journey. All are changed by their immersion in that chaotic and often contradictory era and its events.    I especially liked the way the movie captures the spirit of those times, moving from innocent joyful expression to deepening social awareness to psychedelic rebellion to radicalism and social unrest and violence to disillusionment and finally coming to an integration of all that was experienced into a belief and an affirmation that \\"love is all you need\\".    And all along the way it is underscored and given texture and depth and expression by the music that surely was in a way the soundtrack of those times. The song choices are right on. The arrangements bring new life and energy to songs we've heard a thousand times. The music interweaves with the personalities and settings and events. And the actors are amazingly talented in both the expression and development of their characters but also in their singing ability and to make the songs flow naturally as a part of those characters.    I really liked the movie for all those reasons but I love the soundtrack too because even without the visual dimension of watching the film it conveys all I've mentioned. The music was, and for many still is, the heart and soul of the transformation we experienced, a living legacy of a change that continues to reverberate through our lives and our culture. This soundtrack brilliantly captures the deeply emotional and soul-changing experience we now refer to as the Sixties.
1592403913|3.0|Lynne Truss's EATS, SHOOTS & LEAVES is a very shallow guide to punctuation that goes on and on about nothing. The illustrations are \\"cute,\\" but for the meat of the matter one must spend too much time wading around the barnyard.<br />It has been a long time since I've noticed editors and grammarians being in agreement and this beginner's guide doesn't help the matter. All portent the know (and are never wrong), but the novice is at their mercy.<br />Nash Black, author whose books are now available in Kindle editions.[[ASIN:1432716255 Writing as a Small Business]][[ASIN:1432707248 Sins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel]][[ASIN:1432706799 Natchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil War]]
1416562605|4.0|It was either a book like White Tiger or a blustering  manifesto exhorting the poor to rise... I am glad Adiga opted to choose the  former. I am surprised by the desi criticism of Adiga as pandering to the western audience. The main character in the book Balram Halwai mentions our obsession with others opinion.  Desis have criticized Satyajit Ray for depicting abject poverty on the screen, V.S Naipaul for his stark observation of India ( yes Naipul does tend to be insufferable) but I found myself loving Arvind Adiga's sardonic wit. The depiction of \\"darkness\\" is not far from reality.... the concept of the chicken coop is not a great revelation to the Desi. Well if a non-indian forms an opinion of India from fiction... why does it touch our raw nerve. Arvind is free to dip his beak in the collective indian consciousness at will of course even the new India will keep generating material for him definitely for the rest of his  life.

0312427646|5.0|This charming and witty little book (just 121 small pages) imagines Queen Elizabeth II, some fifty years into her reign, coming upon a travelling library parked next to the royal kitchens.  Out of politeness, she borrows a book at random.  She has never had any time or inclination for reading anything other than state papers, though she has met many famous authors with whom she had exchanged small talk.  The first book, by Ivy Compton-Burnett, is hard going, but she has known since childhood that it is her duty to finish what she has started.  Then she borrows another book, and soon she is hooked on reading, initially quite undiscriminatingly, to the incomprehension of the Duke and the active hostility of the palace officials.  She feels she is doing her duty to find out \\"what people are like\\", and she is not shocked by anything she finds.  There is an innocence about her, but also a shrewd and down-to-earth intelligence in her appraisals of literature.  It appeals to her that books address the highly and the lowly placed alike, for \\"she was a genuine democrat, perhaps the only one in the country\\".  What had been seen as a duty becomes a pleasure, and then a passion.  It makes her impatient of  small talk and of the clich&eacute;s she has to utter in the speeches that are written for her.  Soon she has a sense of history which her prime minister sadly lacks - but by that time the prime minister has been in office long enough no longer to listen to what the Queen has to say at his weekly audience with her.<br /><br />Around this affectionate portrait of the Queen, Alan Bennett's imagination has woven a number of delicious incidents, gently satirical, and all in his crystalline prose and unmistakable voice.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I bought this to use with my PC in the garage. I needed it to move monitor from in front of PC to workbench area. All joints of arm can swivel so it has a good range of movement. Quality, value and style are first rate and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
1595141979|5.0|This series is my all-time favorite! I just can't get enough of it. I think its better than Twilight because you really get deep inside the characters and become more acquainted with them. Like you really know them. Amazing writing!
0307277453|5.0|What a wonderfully written, accessible book.  It covers many of the topics we discuss in Honors Biology, addressing several of the same experiments more thoroughly, in clear, easy to understand descriptions.  It discusses evolutionary relationships in a straightforward manner, explaining many of the eccentricities of the human body that just don't quite make sense except through evolution. The description of the process of discovering fossils is a nice hook leading into the main body of the book, showing the importance of fossil evidence and how much more we can explore with current technologies. I plan on requiring students to read this book during the spring semester.
