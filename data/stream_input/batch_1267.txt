B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I got this app for my son on his Kindle Fire, but so far, I've played with it more than he has!  It's lots of fun!  There are many options for creating, including colors, drawing tools, and varied backgrounds, as well as clip art pictures with their own options (like zooming size to larger or smaller,positioning,etc) to use for creative fun. To introduce my somewhat reluctant son to it, we played tic tac toe, varying the colors and application tools, and he totally enjoyed that.  There is an in app album to store the pictures and/or they can be stored in the photo gallery of the Kindle Fire. They can be shared via email and to facebook, and so the instructions say, to any app that accepts pictures. I even made a nice Christmas card with it, and we sent a greeting card we made to his friend via email.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for myself and I couldn't be happier. The lights and sounds are realistic and true to the Doctor's own Sonic Screwdriver. Another good thing is that it's a pen too, so you can tell people it has a purpose when really it's just for fun.
B00000I07P|4.0|This thing is a blast from the past for me. I absolutely wore it out on vinyl. Looking back on it, it's not as great as I thought at the time, but listening to it always take me back and it's actually not that bad. Some good songs on here and I'm sure you've heard them all 1,000,000 times. You don't need the album to do that, but it's fun to listen to it in its entirety, since there are a few here that you'll never hear elsewhere.
B006B3975Y|5.0|OMGoodness, instant classic! If you're a true hip hop fan, I suggest adding this to your collection. I normally download vs CD - the difference is usually subtle. BUT this album was so good to me, I bought the CD for a cleaner sound. Today's mainstream hip hop does not even belong on the same planet as this album.
0452273331|5.0|Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is a novel which draws the reader in with an intriguing plot while at the same time using the lives of the twisted and complex characters to cause the reader to reflect on their own life philosophies.  The Fountainhead tells the story of two young architects; Howard Roark, a struggling visionary who finds himself outcast from society for his unprecedented ideas on architecture and life, and Peter Keating, a success from a young age who struggles with insecurity among other inner demons despite his fame and fortune.  Throughout the novel, the major characters deal with themes such as love, logic, and the clashing of the two. The readers will experience every same stab of anger, jealousy, insecurity, and betrayal, and will find themselves rooting for characters one minute and hating them the next. Rand masterfully blends different elements of style including tone, diction, and imagery to weave her storyline and add layers of meaning and symbolism to events as they occur. Each character has a unique voice which articulates different beliefs, worldviews, and self-perceptions that many can relate to. At the same time, they each individually reflect Rand's beliefs and experiences. For instance, Roark, the main character, lives his life the way the author believes it should be, and the talentless critic Ellsworth Toohey is reminiscent of Stalin, a figure prevalent in Rand's culture and background. The Banner along with the motif of journalism demonstrates Rand's disdain for the dictation of popular taste and mass public opinion. Architecture and journalism are constantly juxtaposed; one as the most pristine and admirable art form, the other as a threat and detriment to society as a whole. The means through which the author's personal ideals are conveyed will cause the reader to question how they live their own lives as well as their own beliefs on the topics addressed throughout the novel. Though it may deal with heavy topics and material, The Fountainhead is an engaging read which keeps readers on their toes. It truly is a timeless story with a lasting message that can be appreciated by all.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|Boy, I'm really not sure about this one.  As a motion picture sound mixer of several decades, I've had no problems navigating around the controls of this home-use mini-console.  I am confused, though, about some of the inexplicable fluctuations in output signal I've experienced.  For seemingly no reason at all, the output will jump from not nearly enough to way too much, without my having done anything to influence it.  I suspect that the cause is some sort of intermittent connection inside the unit, which, in this day and age of relatively consistant component standards, would show a rather shabby level of quality control.  Frankly, even in this modest price range, you should at least be able to expect some stability in your signal flow.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not into sci-fi, however, this book is AMAZING. I couldn't put it down. In case you're wondering, it's about a boy named Ender who needs to try to save the human race. Meanwhile, the teachers, are pushing him further an further until he can't take it anymore. You need to read this book no matter what genre you like. You will laugh, cry, and smile. WARNING contain swear words and a few mature things. I'd say for ages 13+
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I never thought that I would be a fan of such a horrific display of gruesome flesh eating \\"zombies\\".  I have to say that I really enjoyed watching these episodes.  The quality of the shows combined are very clear.  I received my DVD yesterday by USPS and it was packaged in a bubble envelope, very secure.  It took approx about 4-5 days with standard shipping. I actually became a fan of this show in the middle of season 2, so being able to purchase season 1 and catch up on the older episodes at my leisure is great.
B000ZMVAXO|4.0|I bought this because I did not have an amp to practice with when I ordered a new guitar. I am staying with family for the holidays and they can't stand loud metal music, so I bought this.  For what it is, it's great. It's fairly quiet for a high gain unit. I can't comment on tone, as the guitar I have does not have a great tone for metal out-of-the-box. I need to upgrade the pickups on that one, and I'll upgrade this review once I've done that.  Adjusting the tone dial gets anywhere from very warm all the way up to very bright and tight tone. I don't feel I'm missing out on the treble, mid, or bass controls.  Make sure you use large headphones with this, small ear buds can start crackling fairly quickly and I can imagine it's easy to ruin some with this unit.  One strange thing: When I first plugged in my guitar, I was getting tone out of the guitar on the bridge, middle and neck positions as expected. Next day when I plugged it in, no more middle position tone. Then I got a small practice amp out of storage, and the guitar works fine through that amp. I don't know if the flaw is in the Vox, or if it's the guitar. I'm assuming it's the guitar switch, which is a box style 3 way toggle. When I upgrade to a gibson switch (pickups will be replaced at the same time), I'll update this review.  All in all, a very solid $40 spent.   Note, I haven't tried the aux-in jack.  Guitar used: Agile Al-3000 w/stock pickups
B004LWZVZC|3.0|The Conspirator should be re-titled as \\"the Trail of Mary Surrat\\"  Although it was an intriguing film about a dark period in United States History, the movie never really focused on the planning and personalities involved in the assassination.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I just recently bought a Kindle Fire and downloaded this app because I use it on my Android phone and I love it. I was very surprised to find that you can sync this with the Google Calendar on the Kindle like you can on the Android... For 9.99, i was expecting the great access like on the Android but was disappointed...hopefully they will add this feature to the Amazon version...
0545259088|4.0|If you've read any of the other books you know that this series is definitely for \\"older\\" teens so I'm not even going to talk about that. I actually really liked this book. The character development is fantastic and the story line is really strong. I could barely put the thing down which is always a sign of a good book, it is full of action, romance, adventure and tons of suspense (with all the boring bits left out like all good fiction does) ...but. I need more closure. I need to know after investing so much time and emotional energy on these characters what happened to them. Are they going to be ok?? I guess what I need is called an \\"ending\\". I think \\"Linger\\" had more of one than this does. It's very frustrating. The strongest ending was the first book \\"Shiver\\" and they just kept getting more vague after that. It's a great series, written by a very talented writer, and I would recommend it.. but I hate the not knowing.
B000K4WLXA|2.0|The corners of the item was very damaged. It was bent and colors were rubbed off.  As I bought this item in 'new' condition, it definitely seemed used with a packaging over it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|As a person who has very, very strong opinions on book adaptations, I was prepared to be disappointed by HBO's version of the first book in \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series by Georgw R.R. Martin. Less than five minutes into the first episode, I was blown away by how amazing this series was made.   For starters, the costumes, scenery and technical aspects were top notch. Almost everything was either true to the book's descriptions or fit so well that you didn't mind the inaccuracy. Additionally the looks of all the characters are near perfect matches to their literary counterparts (especially the Stark, Lannister, and Targaryen families).  And being a wolf lover, I appreciated the use of real \\"wolf\\" puppies for the Stark direwolves (as opposed the CGI I was expecting). The castles (especially the Red Keep) looked fantastic.   The acting is exceptional in this as well. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) truly exemplifies the character. The entire cast works so well together and really makes the characters come to life. I applaud their performances and hope for the same from the new cast members for Book 2.  I highly recommend this series as it is one of the few book adaptation to take the author's vision seriously. It does a wonderful job pulling the scenes and characters straight off the page and onto the screen. I will be buying the entire series for myself and encourage all my fantasy-inclined friends to watch it as well.
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|Don't know bc it never installed properly.  It froze on me too.  I also can't get it off my header screen.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is one of the most wonderful movies I have ever seen. It is right up there with Pride and Prejudice. If you like the old classics you will love this movie. I also like the fact that it includes history of the old time cotton manufacturers.
1608191664|1.0|I am by no means one of the \\"free-market economists\\" that Mr. Chang rails about, and I had hoped that this book would provide a creative and insightful (if slightly controversial)look at how our economy works. I was therefore sorely disappointed when I learned that \\"23 Things\\" is a basically a bunch of sloganeering supported by anecdotal evidence. It gives you 23 bumper sticker-type arguments, but never really teaches you how to think like an economist. The failure to heed basic concepts like Opportunity Cost and Purchasing Power Parity (see the chapter on taxi-drivers and immigration) testify to this. Mr. Chang's attacks on his straw men (the supposed arguments from \\"free-market economists\\" that he provides at the beginning of each chapter) are mildly amusing at best, simply wrongheaded and misleading at worst.<br /><br />But then again, Mr. Chang argues (in the first chapter) that people don't really need to know much economics at all to be an active citizen. This is, in my opinion, an irresponsible stance to take for someone who is purportedly an economics educator. To say that it might not be feasible for everyone to understand how concepts like aggregate demand and inflation works is acknowleding a tragedy. To say that they really don't *need to* is simply irresponsible. If this is the implicit philosophy underlying this book, it's no wonder that \\"23 Things\\" is so disappointing.<br /><br />Make no mistake, we need more books that puncture the misconceptions regarding free markets. This book, unfortunately, is too busy peddling its own clumsy misconceptions to puncture anything.

B005LJITS0|5.0|I am normally NOT a huge fan of anything done in CGI..and all those fake effects..Walt Disney probably wouldn't have liked it..but who cares with this movie..NOW, I have no clue what the comic books were like..so if \\"I step on any toes\\"..sorry..but I loved the story,Ryan was perfect for this role..I was trying to think who else could have played it as well..nothing about this movie I disliked..
B005IZLPMY|2.0|The action is for kids 10 and under!!!It got pretty boring half-way. It's just a waste of my money that could have spend in some more entertaining way.  But if you are a kid, you will love this movie!
B001E45XT4|4.0|These headsets are pretty good. I like how comfortable they are, you can wear them for long periods of time with no fatigue. It picks up your voice nicely and audio is really nice played through these headsets. It has a long cord and a sound dial to turn the volume up and down, also on the dial it has a switch to turn off and on the microphone. My only two complaints would be that the sound canceling isn't that great. It is supposed to cancel out background noise, but it doesn't do it very efficiently... It still does cancel out some noise but not all. Also the packaging is kind of hard to open. overall this is a very nice headset and it is amazing for it's price. I would highly recommend these.  Pros:  - Comfortable  - Good Audio  - Long Cord  - Good Price  Cons:  - Sound Canceling not as good  - Packaging
1451627289|5.0|I think, as Norman Mailer, that Lee Harvey Oswald was JFK's assassin and no one else.  11/22/63 shows Stephen King shares this conclusion.  I don't think this book could be made into a movie that captures the story so effectively as the book.  It demands to be a movie though and if nothing else I hope it stays true to form and captures the essence of the book.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Amazing movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the actors/actresses and thought they were chosen well. I really got into the movie and felt an array of emotion throughout. Sissy Spacek was funny and I loved her role! A must see movie!
B004X80QNG|5.0|this is good when there r more than one who share a calendar. lots of good options for everyone to be happy.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I was skeptical when I heard about this film, I mean, cowboys fighting space monsters?  It seemed like too much of a stretch, especially since only a few Europeans were even dreaming that such things were possible.  However, given the actors, I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a look-see while on a long airplane trip.  And from the first moment, when the hero wakes with amnesia and a strange metal bracelet, the characters drew me into a much better-than-average story.  It was even hard scifi without a whiff of fantasy, though what the aliens could do definitely would have seemed like magic or demons to the men of that time.<br /><br />The plot even has some good twists.  D Craig makes a wonderful tough guy who deep down is grieving even if he can't remember why.  He demonstrates his propensity to deadly violence right away, but there is something principled about it or seemingly so.  After a quick imbroglio, he wanders into a town that is riven by a spoiled gunslinger, whose father is apparently a brutally evil rancher.  Craig is also approached by a mysterious and beautiful woman, who seems to know a lot about him.  When they seem ready to kill eachother, the town is attacked, setting them on an adventure together as Craig discovers the metal object is a weapon.  Add Indians and a band of outlaws (who know Craig as a leader) into the mix and you begin to wonder if any of it is going to make sense.  That the rest of the movie succeeds so well, maintaining a sense of mystery and awe at least in me, is a testament to an unusually intelligent script.<br /><br />One of the best themes in the film is how the humans band together, each bringing skills from their cultures and experience, to fight the baddies.  It might sound silly, but it really works well.  For example, the Indians give a potion to Craig that liberates his memory.  I don't want to play the spoiler, so won't say anything more, but it is a raucous ride with great CGI.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  It won't be what you expect, if you like hard scifi to begin with, that is.won't be what you expect, if you like hard scifi to begin with, that is.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I got this grip for my 7D - loved it. it feels sturdy and well built. I recently bought a 70-200 and that big lens on my 7D would have been making me unbalanced. luckily, the battery grip offsets the grip to my hand. i feel more confident in holding my camera. it does add A LITTLE bit of weight, but thats what you expected with two batteries inside. I like the material, it doesn't feel like cheap plastic. Buttons are great, wheel is solid, i love this equipment. i bought a 3rd party grip first a few months back but immediately returned it. this grip is NOTHING like the 3rd party sellers. You cannot compare this to the real thing. yes they might LOOK alike, but just the feel of them makes me proud to own one.<br /><br />my one complaint is that the wheel that you spin to screw onto the camera stays a bit lose even after you fasten the grip to the camera. it tends to spin freely about 1/8 of the way. isn't a big compliant, something very minor, but its there nonetheless.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 will make you think twice of station wagons with muddy-covered windows and car doors that creak open. No spoilers but the ending was underwhelming and seemed a bit rushed. The best parts for me were King's incredible characterization skills (man, he's good!) and cleverly scattered horror humor. The story itself is almost a series of character sketches glued together with a loose sci-fi horror plot.<br /><br />Yes, King sure loves his cars :) I preferred his story \\"Trucks\\" from [[ASIN:0307743640 Night Shift]] over Mile 81 but this is a passable Stephen King tale that fellow Constant Readers will enjoy. Better than having your eyeballs burned by a magnifying glass ;)

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|As a long time fan of King, the JFK assassination and, to a lesser extent, time travel stories, this one had me piqued before it even started. The book takes almost half of the book's 800+ pages to start getting into Oswald (perhaps too long for some readers) dealing with a man who brutally murders his family in Maine and the main character, Jake Epping, trying to undo that past. Then it moves onto another long subplot in a town near Dallas called Jodie and we find Jake's love interest, a gal named Sadie.<br /><br />This book has many similarities to [[ASIN:0451155750 The Dead Zone (Signet)]]. We have a man (Jake Epping) who can see the future like Johnny Smith, not because he has special powers but because he was actually in the future. A man who is trying to prevent things from happening in the future and who chases a love that is both within and outside his grasp. It was Sarah back then, it's Sadie here. In the Afterword, King writes that he originally tried to write 11/22/63 in 1972 but gave up because he knew the research would be too overwhelming while he was a writer part-time. I contend he did write this book about seven years later and it's called The Dead Zone.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. Probably more than I should have being that it feels like--and probably is--repetition, but it's a master taking us on a trip back in time in his career as well as in the story. What I enjoyed most about this was how it reminded me of some great Stephen King fiction moments of yesteryear. King can make just about any scene fun and interesting. Remember the pie-eating scene in \\"The Body\\"? The dancing in 11/22/63 stirs that kind of magic. How we danced. Beautiful and brilliant.<br /><br />11/22/63 is my favorite book Stephen King has written in at least fifteen years. Honestly, it's the first \\"new\\" novel I've finished reading by him in the last ten years or so (I've had several misfires  along the way), despite reading over 30 of his 50+ books to date.<br /><br />Is 11/22/63 Stephen King's best book? No. Top five? Probably not. Those that like his scary stories might not rate this as high, but those who enjoy more heartfelt, non-horror tales will enjoy this book. I'm biased on this one because I love the subject matter (JFK and time travel). My eyes ate this one whole.p five? Probably not.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I haven't had the time to dig into this app a whole lot yet, but it does sync Google's calendar. Just select the gmail account from the synchronization settings for Google tasks and viola your gmail account shows up in the settings for which calendar you want to use. It's a little cumbersome in that way and the user interface could be a lot easier, but at least you know it can sync. I tested it, it works. Giving it four stars though for now because of how sloppy it is, but to counter those with one star because they weren't smart enough to go through the settings to find their gmail account. Will adjust as I play with it.

B002GJT4XM|4.0|Reading the reviews here - and it looks like Amazon is having a challenge with the UK vs. USA versions of this movie. Not to mention that UK/French Region 1 DVD set is sold in Canada.  I just ordered the \\"ultimate\\" version to get the Extended Cut (additional scenes are edited back in to the movie, same as the one that airs on ABC Family channel). I ordered \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition)\\" but received \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition).\\" The difference is the word \\"sorcerer\\" vs. \\"philosopher\\" in the title and script. Fans know that the books were printed the same way (different in UK vs. US). I am trying to figure out now if there are other differences in the movie or not besides this one word. What I received is a Region 1 DVD - so this has to be for Canada (packaging is in both English and French). Very interesting - but for those who definitely want one version or the other, Amazon needs to clearly label these (might sell even faster).  Sorry that the customer service representative did not seem to know that UK and US both speak English (she was having a problem with this concept when I called to ask why I was shipped this product by Amazon). I am going to keep it now that I have it, but would also like the US version, may have to purchase it in person at a store so I can get the correct version. In the mean time, buyer beware if you don't want this title - \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition).\\"  I also received the Canada version for \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition).\\"
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly really opened my eyes to what is going into our foods. I have shared the information with several of my co-workers and they were even surprised. This is a must read book if you are looking at different reasons there is so much wheat in our foods and how this effects the body.
B000FGGE68|2.0|I've tried to watch this several times and fallen asleep every time.  I don't know, I guess flashy, meaningless fight scenes are my lullaby or something.  There's a lot of those, and some are pretty neat looking, but this movie is all flash and glam with nothing else going on.  The plot is really basic, about people turned into vampires fighting for the right to survive, the twist at the end is silly, and the characters are all cardboard cutouts.  The only thing it's got going are the special effects and fights, but they get so repetitive that, as I said, they put me to sleep.  I'm not kidding about that.  Right to sleep.
1451629184|5.0|I read this book in just over one sitting. This book took a hold of me in a way I couldn't have imagined. It moved me and will resonate with me forever.<br /><br />I'm a strong-willed person, more like determined and stubborn, so at first I didn't get why she never escaped. But as I continued to read, I could get inside her head and understand why she didn't, how Phillip's psychological manipulation was so horrible -- and that's beside the appalling, and continual rape of Jaycee as a minor.<br /><br />I am so happy that Jaycee shared her story not because I want to see her in the news and exploited all over again but it gives people courage and builds inner strength.<br /><br />The quality of writing does feel more simple, maybe even lesser, compared to bestselling fiction books. However, at the same time, that's what makes her story read so well and draws the reader in. I've read so many reviews where people have read it in one sitting.<br /><br />I like her comment about wanting to write a best-seller because I bought the book in the hope I contribute to her dream. She deserves it. This book gave me hope! And I definitely feel guilty about feeling bad about myself now, because she carries on as such a hopeful person despite her experiences.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone because everyone at least has family or friends and this book shows how love can carry you through some of the toughest experiences.

B003TJR2HS|3.0|First, the good news. The connector that plugs into the Apple Device (iPhone/iPad/iPod) is the exact same size as the connector on a standard Apple cable, so if your standard Apple charging cable fits with your case, this will also fit.<br /><br />Also, if you have an older accessory or Apple Device, this will very likely work great for you. The problems are with newer accessories and the iPad in particular.<br /><br />If you have an iPad, beware! If you try to use it with some newer accessories (like newer audio recording accessories designed for the iPad or the Apple Camera Connection Kit for iPad), it's useless. With these accessories, the accessory will only work when the adapter is connected to a charger, but the iPad *STOPS CHARGING* when you connect the the accessory! With these accessories, it's nothing but an extension connector that must be plugged in, but doesn't actually charge the iPad! You're much better off buying a short extension cable if you just need an extender.<br /><br />If you have an iPhone 4 and these newer accessories, it will probably work great, and it will continue to charge the iPhone when the accessory is connected. However, you will likely need to *always* provide power through the micro-USB connector because the accessories won't work unless power is supplied. This means you're tethered to an AC outlet. For some of you, this may be exactly what you want (to charge your battery while recording, for example), and you don't care about the extender aspect. This will work great for you. If you need the extender and can't be tethered to an AC adapter, just get a short extension cable.<br /><br />Also, the micro-USB connector looks very similar to a mini-USB connector, but it's not the same thing. You will need to buy a micro-USB to standard USB cable and connect it to an Apple power adapter to provide power.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This set has the eight dvd's in one hard plastic case.  There are no extras, which for the price I wasn't expecting.  It's a very simple set.  You really can't go wrong buying eight movies at this price...unless you want all the extras, then it sounds like this is not for you.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Looks brand new, not a scratch on the DVD. One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $3!!!
B004X80QNG|5.0|This app is by far the most useful calender app available for the Kfire, and to get it for free is a bonus. It has exactly what I need, its simple to figure out. I must admit that I don't have anything set up through tootle and I don't care to import my outlook, and can understand why some are frustrated about that, but as a stand alone calender for someone who just needs a little orginization, this app is perfect.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just received my Marware MicroShell cover for my new Kindle Fire and my first impression is good.  I hadn't checked any of the early reviews on it, prior to ordering it (which is probably a good thing) but it was the item I chose from the list of others available at the time.  It came in the mail yesterday, a week after my Fire had arrived and I was looking forward to putting it to work, protecting my $200.00 investment.  I'm not the least bit disappointed, so far.  The negative reviews on its design and the material from which it is made don't fit with my first impression.  It's sleek, the rubberized cover is easy to grip and isn't \\"slippery\\" or \\"plasticky\\" which is something I do like.  The grey \\"graphite\\" color is pleasing to the eye, not gaudy and it does have a high-tech look and feel to it.  Polycarbonate is quite durable, in my estimation, and the sturdiness of it offers me a feeling of solid protection for my Kindle.  That's what I was looking for, in making my choice and I'm satisfied with my purchase.  At $29.95 it may actually be a little overpriced, but what isn't, these days?<br /><br />Should it prove otherwise after some use, I will post my thoughts later----but for now I think I made a good choice.  And, I have confidence in Amazon's policies that if I'm unhappy with it I can return it.
B005VR9328|5.0|this new album is off the charts!!! there is no reason to even have a song selector, you have to let it play through each time and I promise you will not be disappointed!!

B005VR9328|5.0|Once and awhile the hip-hop genre will take a break from it's occasional obsession with posturing and actually deliver on ideas that actually live up to it's cultural roots. And it's no secret that many of the genres greatest moments have been those instances where it looks inside itself. And this is one of those occasions. Hip-hop has tended with several major exceptions tended to be what they called a singles medium. Meaning that individual songs,or often one long song extended over an album length with variations,take presidents. Many from Public Enemy,Tribe Called Quest,Jay Z and OutKast have looked to change this. The Roots have been looking towards a concept like this for some time. And inspiration seems to have come way of Sufjan Stevens,by grafting a character of his onto a fictional and/or semi fictional character called Redford Stevens. The Redford character emerges here as something a \\"Tommy\\" for the contemporary hip-hop world. And the fact that this does come off very much as a \\"hip-hop opera\\" does tend to extend on that.<br /><br />  As with much of what The Roots tend to do,this album examines the Redford character both lyrically and tonally through his own generation cycle. So the music and words both are used to tell the story. Using the powerfully voiced singer Dice Raw and Bilal along with the rapping this album comes out with some wonderfully soulful funk on \\"Kool On\\",\\"Tip The Scale\\" and \\"Lighthouse\\". These are some of the most wonderfully constructed,soulful and heavy grooving songs I've ever heard come from The Roots. And the exciting part is they do a lot to extend the narrative too. You learn of Redford trying continually trying to justify his life of crime,to the point of a possible murder/suicide dealt with on the string filled orchestral suite that concludes the album. By the time you get the part called \\"Finality\\" the strings have gone from violent and discordant to sounding almost pastoral-somewhat like a soul music version of the conclusion of [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's]]-that big emotional crescendo and release. There is indeed some profanity here. But for a change it's 100% useful in illustrating the inner frustrations and thought process of the character.<br /><br />  One of the most illuminating hip-hop ALBUMS I've ever heard,this release blends creative ambition with the \\"keeping it real\\" attitude of the genre in such a wonderful way you might listen to this and wonder why hip-hop seems to have been musically and lyrically uneven for the past decade or so. Perhaps you might blame commerce,the need by so many to make money in sacrificing their soul. Same old story right? Well this is a concept The Roots have been expressing in all the music they've done so far.  Usually it's accomplished by celebrating the musicality of hip-hop itself with their instrumental ability. And it would be unwise to let anyone fool you into thinking hip-hop isn't musical. In this case it's a story that rather takes a concept expressed on \\"The Return Of Innocence Lost\\" from their [[ASIN:B00000I5JL Things Fall Apart]] album-the question of a gang banger type character pontificating on whether he's a victim of society or his own fragile ego. To these ears which often find more emotion out of soul,funk and different jazz fusion sub-genres this album might very well be representative of the moment when contemporary hip-hop finally blossoms into a coherent and singular art.[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|The resolution progresses as you watch one movie after the other (predictably) and the extras are pretty good, although I've seen some of them before in the DVD release. The digital downloads that come free, are meant for apple devices so not actually of exceptional quality for PCs. plus they expire after a year. So don't bother with the DRM protection that comes with the digital versions.

B0032UYFA6|4.0|The premise of Breaking Bad is very intriguing.  You have a guy, Walt, who was very bright and has a PhD in Chemistry reduced to teaching high school classes. Meanwhile, the people that he graduated with started a company, based on his PhD thesis, and are millionaires.  His brother-in-law is a DEA agent and so he witnesses just how much money is involved in the sale of drugs, such as crystal meth.  During a ride-along with his brother-in-law, he discovers that one of his former students, a high school dropout, is in fact a well known meth cooker called Capn Cook.  When Walt discovers he has cancer and that his insurance won't cover the cost of treatment, he teams up with Capn Cook to cook meth to pay for his cancer treatments and to provide for his family.  So here is this person who could be anyone of us, leading a double life, as a mild mannered high school teacher, father, and husband and also as a drug dealer.  The entire cast is superb and the acting is top notch.  In terms of character development, the writing is excellent.  Each character has his or her own quirks/flaws.  For example, Walt's sister-in-law, the wife of the DEA agent, is a kleptomaniac.  Walt's wife likes to smoke, even though she is pregnant and knows she shouldn't.  Walt's brother-in-law, the DEA agent, is outwardly tough, but is prone to anxiety attacks based on the horrific things that he has witnessed.  Many of the flaws are shown in a way that is funny yet tragic.  The writing maintains a very sly sense of humor, which serves to lighten the very serious topics of cancer and drugs.    My main problem with the writing is plot development.  I found many situations that characters were placed in to be highly contrived, and not in keeping with the character's personality.  For example, one of Capn Cook's cousins, called Badger, is recruited to sell meth.  He meets up with a potential client and despite being portrayed as a dullard, he correctly deduces that the potential client is an undercover police officer.  Despite this, he sells the meth to the police officer and immediately gets busted.  Unfortunately, the plot is full of situations like this, where the characters make stupid choices or choices that are out of character.  These situations are created to advance the plot by placing the characters in new situations, but considering how great the character development is, I found the plot development to lack any subtlety.  The characters could be placed into the same situations with more finesse and without resorting to having the characters make stupid choices or choices that are out of character.  After a while, I found myself losing interest in the series because of constantly seeing the characters make stupid choices, though the character had already been shown to be smarter than that.  My actual rank is 3.5 stars, which I have rounded up to four.  If you can overlook the glaring holes in the plot development, the rest of the show is quite engrossing.
B004X80QNG|4.0|Please note this is a great app. I use it on my Android phone (Epic 4G) and consider it a must have application. In it's current form it does not sync directly with your Google Calendar but must use the Google Database which is missing from the Kindle Fire. However the developer has already stated that they will be working on a direct sync, so you have the opportunity for a great app for free right now.

B004X80QNG|3.0|I used pocket informant on windows mobile for a year and then again om blackberry for two.  I was excited to see it came to Android but after reading reviews on the market and the WebIS forum,  I decided it was not worth picking up the Android version yet.  As it was free today u decided to test out myself to see if the reviews were correct and found they are accurate.  While this is not beta quality, its not far off and anyone who is expecting a complete app should wait to buy it till they finish.  It lacks many if the features the same app had in the WM and BB versions.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|first off, all the nerds who are unhappy would rather see this series in its original form and recorded on VHS tapes! They are unhappy that it even touched blu-ray. However, if your PS3 is hooked up to your mother's old TV from the 80's and the only way you can enjoy watching is in the basement while playing world of warcraft then you might be just like the rest of these losers who complain about colors being off and aweful sound<br /><br />.... for the rest of us, the graphics and sound is outstanding! There is absolutely nothing wrong with this set.

0385523912|5.0|While we spend the days hearing the troubles in Europe and reading about the struggles of citizens in the US, we tend to forget (or never even imagine) the ocean of difference between the have's and the have not's on a global scale. This book is not about politics but takes you into the individual lives of a few people living in Communist North Korea. Their everyday struggles to eat and sleep are brought vibrantly to life in this story. If nothing else, to me, it resonates as to how lucky we are to have our freedoms of action and of markets.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|Nickelback's new effort takes me back to the All the Right Reasons album. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed Dark Horse, this album is reminiscent of All the Right Reasons. When We Stand Together and Bottoms Up are some pretty solid tunes. The rest of the album is soild, too. I don't understand why so many people knock these guys. Many other groups sing about the same topics that Nickelback does and get better reviews. I wish people would just sit back and enjoy the music and have some fun!  I have had this album in my truck since it was released and keep listening to it over and over again. Nickelback, you guys rock!

I like the cover and love Amazon.

I liked how the author encourages the reader to tell a story to arouse the emotions of the listener.  Another key point, which is something that seems so obvious, is to be prepared and know the material that is being presented.  No matter what they subject, if the presenter is open and touchable by his audience, he or she becomes a more effective presenter and people will want to listen.

I don't praise much to this degree, but there is nothing about this experience that I cannot rave about. Perfect.
B0043URV5U|2.0|I was very happy when i heard bout this new hits pack, because in the previous GH and GH2 some important tracks are missing, finally I could have all the Seger hits in one collection. BUT in Ultimate Hits happens the same story. Where is Understanding from Teachers soundtrack? it was included in GH2 and omitted here. And what about important US Billboard Top 40s like Even Now, American Storm or Real Love? I could complain about some fan favorites like Fire Inside or Horizontal Bop, but pleaseeeee gimme all the hits this time!!! I'm not understanding (like the song hahaha), maybe Seger don't like these songs, BUT there are hits on the US Charts, like Ray Davies said \\"Give to the people what they want\\". In this hard times of piracy, you couldn't make mistakes, and Ultimate Hits is one of them. Two Stars just because I LOVE Segers music, but this compilation really deserved one.
B002BFIN6K|4.0|The team from ZENPH obtained the best recordings by Rachmaninoff from the early twentieth century and, through  proprietary computer processing, were able to remove surface noise and restore the dynamic range that was muted by the limited recording processes of that era.  By and large they have succeeded.    However, my impression after just one listening is that it lacks some of the immediacy and brilliance that I heard on another CD sourced from the Ampico piano rolls and a special Estonia 9 foot grand piano; that one was simply amazing.  Also, ZENPH has chosen to release this recording on regular CD (red label) instead of Super Audio CD (SACD), as they did The Glenn Gould 1955 performance of Bach's Goldberg Variations.  Whether or not the extra \\"massaging\\" required to bring the older Rachmaninoff recordings up to modern standards could be improved by SACD recording is difficult to say.  Although I rated it 4 stars, not 5, it is still a remarkable recording, and I am very happy to have it in my collection.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|To resuscitate someone who is being tortured in hell is not a simple thing, especially when this character does not even believe in God, though he believes in the devil, monsters and other demons. One could think that this resuscitation could lead him to a better understanding of what he calls the supernatural. But Dean is a very stubborn mind. He negotiated himself with some demon the deal that saved Sam's life and killed him within twelve months, and yet he does not want to believe in the existence of a good principle, good supernatural being somewhere in this vast cosmos.<br /><br />The authors then take the precaution to come up with a resurrection that is not too iffy that is to say unbelievable, even with a very wide fictional mind. Dean is thus gotten out of hell by an angel, Castiel, and this fourth season is the season of the angels, among other supernatural beings. The angels are new at the job here and also very difficult to understand since their logic is a logic of obedience. Don't think, just obey. God is the only one who can provide the world with anything like a logic. A resurrection that is also the beginning of the Apocalypse, as we learn that during his stay in Hell, Dean broke the first Seal and started the Apocalypse.<br /><br />Castiel is the angel who is attached to Dean but he sure is not well adapted to this professional unbeliever as for the divine. He is doubled with Uriel, the angel of death, who is black but who will reveal himself a traitor and Castiel will have to kill him. Then Zachariah will come as the boss of poor Castiel and this Zachariah being white cannot be a traitor, could he now, but he is a stubborn non-questioner. Obey first and don't ask question afterwards. This will lead to the disobedience of Castiel, which will not change one iota to the destiny of the world. Hence Castiel becomes himself a traitor, but not to his newly made friends, the Winchester brothers, but to his hierarchy and an absent God.<br /><br />There is also a fallen angel, Anna, who disobeyed and is thus rejected on earth to err and haunt but she manages to get close to the Winchesters and she manages in a fight between the Winchesters and Uriel to recapture her grace that Uriel was carrying in a glass tube around his neck and she is reinstated into her angel status. This shows, if it were necessary to show such a thing that the house of God is not particularly clean and orderly. There is quite some mess in that house, with traitors and disobedient angels and the boss, God, doing nothing about it as if he were impotent or just unaware, which is even worse than being impotent, since it is incompetence which is at stake here. But we learn that God is just not here, not willing to interfere with human affairs.<br /><br />But who is Castiel? That question is answered in this season, and that tells us what angels are. Angels were the first creatures created by God, whereas Demons are twisted human souls; but they do need a human body to be able to walk the Earth, without destroying everything. They are spirits that have to inhabit a human body to be able to intervene in the world's affairs and among humans. In other words they are not better than demons. Angels need the acceptance of the human they plan to inhabit before going inside him or her, whereas Demons just invade humans without asking questions. One day a simple man, Jimmy Novac from Pontiac, Illinois, is literally captured by the spirit of an angel and he becomes an angel and disappears from his family. To make sure we understand very well that fact, Castiel is removed from the body of Jimmy Novac who goes back to his life with his family. But he is the direct target of all kinds of demons and his family is at risk. So accepts a second time to go on an angel mission, driven away by Sam and Dean.<br /><br />But the conclusion of this angel is: \\"I serve heaven. I don't serve man. And I certainly don't serve you!\\" he says to Dean and Sam. He is supposed to lookafter Dean and yet he does not serve him. He only obeys orders from a God who \\"has left the house\\" as Zachariah so clearly says. And yet there is a double mission that Castiel must carry out. He must make sure that Sam is protected from Dean and Bobby who are trying to wean him from the demonic blood he has taken the habit of drinking. With his special nature and the fact that he was fed with demon blood when 6 months old (from the Yellow Eyed Demon, named Azazel, that was killed in Season 2), Sam gets stronger when he drinks demon blood, developing his psychic powers. Thinking that it is their mission to stop the Apocalypse, Sam and Castiel, and to a lesser extent Dean, are willing to do anything to destroy the Demon responsible for the breaking of the other 65 Seals (the breaking of 66 Seals should free Lucifer, the Fallen Angel, from his cage). Ruby seems to be on their side and tracks the demons for them, also giving demon blood to Sam. Yet demon blood will become an issue between the two brothers, Dean starting to feel that his brother is losing some of his humanity.<br /><br />On the other hand Castiel has to prepare Dean for the next mission that is revealed at the end of this season: he is the one who is going to defeat Lucifer after his liberation from his cage. What links the two missions is that Lilith is maybe a demon but she is the last seal that is to be broken before Lucifer can come out of his cage. Killing Lilith is breaking the sixty-sixth seal if that is the proper number. So Sam has to kill her, hence he has to get addicted to demon blood to be strong enough, and then when .Lucifer is out Dean is the one who is going to defeat Lucifer.<br /><br />That's what these angels call the wider picture, not the survival or salvation of a few people who are possessed by some demons, but the salvation of the whole humanity after it is cleaned up of all the unworthy people and after the universe is cleaned up of all its demonic forces. A beautiful program that is described in the Book of Revelation, the Apocalypse, the killing of such a proportion of humanity wavering between one third and two thirds if not all of the living and the resurrection of a small proportion of those who died through the centuries. But where is the general of that war? Where is the master mind of this world?<br /><br />God has left the house, don't forget.<br /><br />That's when the two brothers get into the wider picture. We all know about the love of these two men that I would like to call boys (with flashbacks to their infancy, childhood and teenage) and yet are, let's agree to disagree on that term, young men. We all know that this love became sour little by little because of the impossibility to actually share their feelings for many and varied reasons. Since Sam has in him some demonic blood, he is different, abnormal and that abnormality was identified as wanting to go to law school and be a lawyer. He is a monster and Dean cannot admit it up to this fourth season because that would mean fighting to kill him, a brother he loves deeply.<br /><br />On the other hand, and this season is quite clear about the lack of communication, both Sam cannot speak of his feelings as a partially demonic being nor Dean as a resurrected person has spent four months of human time in hell, maybe four for forty years of hellish time, and he cannot tell anything to his own brother about it. In the same way Sam cannot speak to Dean because Dean is not like him since he is partly demonic, hence on the side of those who tortured his brother and thus Dean would not understand, and Dean cannot speak of his sojourn in hell because he finally, but too late, admits that he enjoyed the suffering he gave to other, being one of Hell's torturers, because it more or less justified him in his own choices, which is to hunt and kill all monsters, including his own brother.<br /><br />Speaking of existential dilemmas we can hardly find a better illustration and realization that this one.<br /><br />And if it were that simple, there would be no real problem. But both of them are haunted by supernatural events and beings. Dean is haunted by his own guardian angel, Castiel, and the boss of this being, Uriel, a traitor, and Zachariah, a blind obedient subject. And then he is haunted by all kinds of demons who try to approach him, like Ruby, who he will kill at the very end of the season after Lucifer got out of his cage, freeing his own brother at the same time. Sam is haunted by his mother, his girlfriend Jessica and their burning death. He is haunted by the demonic blood he carries. He is haunted by Ruby who has to make sure he kills Lilith and is strong enough by then to do it. He is haunted by other demons who try to push him along.<br /><br />And both are haunted by the fact that they have destroyed many demons and saved many potential victims but they also have killed innocent people who were possessed by demons or who became the victims of some vengeful act from Lilly, like Victor Henricksen. Sam has been hesitant on that procedure of killing demons: he has preferred for a while to exorcize the demons out of their victims, even though many did not survive their experience. You obviously cannot satisfy yourself and your brother, yourself and your guardian angel, yourself and your patronizing demon, etc. Nothing is simple in this world, not even double but multifarious and variegated.<br /><br />All the more complicated because not one, not even the angels know what is going to happen, except maybe at the very last minute. No one knows? Wrong. One does. The writer who is writing the story of Sam and Dean about a couple of hours, a couple of days or a couple of weeks ahead of time. He is a prophet of the lord, and as such protected by archangels, and his books will become The Winchester Gospel. But apparently no one can change what he has written. Yet at the end Castiel and Dean decide to check what he wrote to know where Sam is in order to be able to stop him breaking the seal because Lilith is the last seal.<br /><br />But too bad again. Dean will arrive there. In Saint Mary's convent but too late. He will see Lilith dead, Lucifer coming out and he will kill Ruby, the demon and not only the borrowed body. Because the wider image of the situation is that Ruby has betrayed them both, making sure Sam will be strong enough to destroy the last Seal and free Lucifer from his cage. Sam is finished with his mission but he can be of use later, so let him get sorry and say so to Dean, and Dean is just starting his own mission by killing a lying manipulator and accepting Sam's apology and getting him back into the chuck wagon, or should I say the Chuck Shirley wagon? We will only know in the next season. But the team is on its two feet again. Let bygones be bygones and concentrate on the present future.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVEing of such a proportion of humanity wavering between one third and two thirds if not all of the living and the resurrection of a small proportion of those who died through the centuries. But where is the general of that war? Where is the master mind of this world?   God has left the house, don't forget.  That's when the two brothers get into the wider picture. We all know about the love of these two men that I would like to call boys (with flashbacks to their infancy, childhood and teenage) and yet are, let's agree to disagree on that term, young men. We all know that this love became sour little by little because of the impossibility to actually share their feelings for many and varied reasons. Since Sam has in him some demonic blood, he is different, abnormal and that abnormality was identified as wanting to go to law school and be a lawyer. He is a monster and Dean cannot admit it up to this fourth season because that would mean fighting to kill him, a brother he loves deeply.  On the other hand, and this season is quite clear about the lack of communication, both Sam cannot speak of his feelings as a partially demonic being nor Dean as a resurrected person has spent four months of human time in hell, maybe four for forty years of hellish time, and he cannot tell anything to his own brother about it. In the same way Sam cannot speak to Dean because Dean is not like him since he is partly demonic, hence on the side of those who tortured his brother and thus Dean would not understand, and Dean cannot speak of his sojourn in hell because he finally, but too late, admits that he enjoyed the suffering he gave to other, being one of Hell's torturers, because it more or less justified him in his own choices, which is to hunt and kill all monsters, including his own brother.  Speaking of existential dilemmas we can hardly find a better illustration and realization that this one.  And if it were that simple, there would be no real problem. But both of them are haunted bysupernatural events and beings. Dean is haunted by his own guardian angel, Castiel, and the boss of this being, Uriel, a traitor, and Zachariah, a blind obedient subject. And then he is haunted by all kinds of demons who try to approach him, like Ruby, who he will kill at the very end of the season after Lucifer got out of his cage, freeing his own brother at the same time. Sam is haunted by his mother, his girlfriend Jessica and their burning death. He is haunted by the demonic blood he carries. He is haunted by Ruby who has to make sure he kills Lilith and is strong enough by then to do it. He is haunted by other demons who try to push him along.  And both are haunted by the fact that they have destroyed many demons and saved many potential victims but they also have killed innocent people who were possessed by demons or who became the victims of some vengeful act from Lilly, like Victor Henricksen. Sam has been hesitant on that procedure of killing demons: he has preferred for a while to exorcize the demons out of their victims, even though many did not survive their experience. You obviously cannot satisfy yourself and your brother, yourself and your guardian angel, yourself and your patronizing demon, etc. Nothing is simple in this world, not even double but multifarious and variegated.   All the more complicated because not one, not even the angels know what is going to happen, except maybe at the very last minute. No one knows? Wrong. One does. The writer who is writing the story of Sam and Dean about a couple of hours, a couple of days or a couple of weeks ahead of time. He is a prophet of the lord, and as such protected by archangels, and his books will become The Winchester Gospel. But apparently no one can change what he has written. Yet at the end Castiel and Dean decide to check what he wrote to know where Sam is in order to be able to stop him breaking the seal because Lilith is the last seal.   But too bad again. Dean will arrive there. In Saint Mary's convent but too late. He will see Lilith dead, Lucifer coming out and he will kill Ruby, the demon and not only the borrowed body. Because the wider image of the situation is that Ruby has betrayed them both, making sure Sam will be strong enough to destroy the last Seal and free Lucifer from his cage. Sam is finished with his mission but he can be of use later, so let him get sorry and say so to Dean, and Dean is just starting his own mission by killing a lying manipulator and accepting Sam's apology and getting him back into the chuck wagon, or should I say the Chuck Shirley wagon? We will only know in the next season. But the team is on its two feet again. Let bygones be bygones and concentrate on the present future.  Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE
B002T44ZYW|4.0|I remember seeing this in stores years ago and never thought I'd be interested in it. I was wrong it's a good read especially if you like The Clique series or Gossip Girl. Although since this is the first book it was slow paced in the beginning but hopefully it will evolve in the next books.
B00004TXFX|5.0|Incredible live music. Layne Staley's vocals are astounding. Music and lyrics are excellent. In my opinion, this was THE band of the 90's.
B006FS22Y8|4.0|If you are just starting to get to know Amy, stick with Back to Black.  However, if you are a fan of Frank, her first album, you won't be disappointed.  Most of this material was recorded during her Frank era or in the transition period between her two releases.  As such, most of the songs are reminiscent of her jazz roots with a few twinges of the girl group sound that inspired her masterpiece.  She definitely was trying to find a way to incorporate the new influences with her older jazz image.  The unfortunate thing about this album is that she only wrote about 1/2 of the songs.  In fact, most of the songs she wrote have appeared in better compositions on Back to Black or other releases.  While they are expertly sung, I was hoping her posthumous releases would include fresh releases of her brilliant songwriting ability and less covers.  Or at the very least, better recordings of the unreleased demos available on YouTube.  If you are a huge fan of Amy, not much on this album is new.  I ultimately give this 4 stars because she's been my favorite artist for years and it is a treat to get some new releases.  But unless you like her early work, you will be disappointed by this album.

0393338827|4.0|Michael Lewis has done a fine job, translating this complicated and frightening event into everyday language - GFC for the common man.  His engaging style personalises the event through the eyes and lives of a bunch of dysfunctional nerds, who recognised this greatest of all frauds for what it was.  Despite 'best endeavours' to alert the world/regulators to the coming meltdown, they were ignored - and proceeded to do what any 'rational person' would do - profit from the chaos.  And Michael Lewis takes you along for the ride, from go to woe.<br /><br />A very sad (but not unexpected) indictment on the corruption and greed in our financial system. Particularly galling as most of the chief perpetrators have escaped unscathed, to enjoy the proceeds of their ill-gotten bonuses.  Disgusting - and many of our regulators and those from the ratings-houses should also be held to account.<br /><br />A modern morality tale - and sadly, I expect we will see it all again.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I always loved watching this movie growing up on VHS, so when I was trying to think of a wholesome movie for the entire family to watch, I just had to purchase this in DVD format.  My 2 year old adores it - she will bring it to me saying \\"Kitty Cat!\\" when she wants to watch it.  Compared to all of the new movies out there, this classic movie outshines them all.
6304696558|1.0|Goldie Hawn is hilarious but this is the most boring movie that I have seen her in. I disliked it like 15 minutes in but kept watching it, thinking it has to get better, it just didn't. I swear at parts that it was the ending but than it kept going...and going....and going and it wasn't nothing to keep going on about! This wasn't a comedy, but a tragedy!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Considering I love Westerns and Sci-Fi, Cowboys and Aliens was a real treat for me. You'd think seeing the title of the movie and the trailer that this is a B-movie, at best. However, with heavyweights like Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, Cowboys and Aliens delivers on all fronts.<br /><br />Based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys and Aliens tells the story of a stranger who has no memory of who he is that happens to show up in the town of Absolution. When townsfolks start coming up missing; he, a traveler, and a wealthy cattleman must band together to fight the aliens who are abducting them.<br /><br />What I loved most about the movie is that it is played as seriously as possible, despite the fact that the title might bring a chuckle. It's a serious Western that's gritty yet spectacular as well. If I had any reservations about the movie, it would be that the movie runs way too long. By the time you reach its' two-hour mark, you're ready to give up on the film. If they shortened the length and tightened up the dialogue abit and showed the aliens more, this movie would have recieved a rating of five stars(from me) and then some.

1423140591|4.0|1) Rating: 4 out of 5<br /><br />2) Genre: Young Adult<br /><br />3) Synopsis: Percy Jackson doesn't know who he is but he does know monsters want to kill him. All he needs to do is find out who he is, stop the monsters, and save the world from destruction.<br /><br />4) Feelings: I liked this book even though it has so many elements that I dislike. It has flash backs, dream sequences, main character with amnesia, and an obvious set up for the next book. Even with all of those annoying things, it got a four star review so it must be good.<br /><br />5) Final recommendation: If you are a Percy Jackson fan, it is definitely worth the read. The book does set it up for the next one so be ready to be left wanting more.<br /><br />Ryan James Burt<br />Husband, Father, and Writer<br />[...]
B004X80QNG|3.0|I downloaded Pocket Informant for free.  Thanks Amazon.<br />I uninstalled it as soon as I saw that I wouldn't be able to move it to my SD Card.<br />Too bad.  It looks good.<br /><br />HTC Evo 4G (with little internal memory available.)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I just got the movie today and I immediately watched, it's by far on of my favorite movies. While I was watching it I told my little sister to set up the ultraviolet copy on the iPad and to my Amazement, you can download the movie to your iPad or android phone for those who don't want to deal with buffering. I think the ultraviolet copy is perfect because I can download the movie to multiple devices.

But.....it contains a profane gesture, graphic disfigurement, and soft porn in the form of prostitutes showing a little of what they have to offer.  It is as good as the high reviews it gets but is definitely best for a mature audience.
B004X80QNG|4.0|Application performs at great speed. Great that I can now sync with Google Task. Google and Outlook Calendar sync is setup with your android device, not within app.
B005OK721G|5.0|I love this movie.  I went to see it in theaters twice.  And I am anxiously waiting for the DVD.  Zoe portrayed the emotions of the main character very well. Instead of acting it seemed like she was the character.  I was cheering for her to get her target because I felt for her so much.    And her action scenes were jaw dropping.  The action kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.    I love the beginning of the movie though it is heart breaking but there is a lot of action in it and quite entertaining.  And I am not a fan of action movies but this one really had a plot that I could follow.  And to a certain degree I can definitely relate to the feelings of the character.  And I was comfortable with the love scenes.  They were not about raunchy sex but about how she has a void within her that needs to be filled with love and being connected and belonging to someone.  I love the scene where the boyfriend wants to learn about her and how she feels.  And her reaction really screams the theme of the story.    And the cast they picked was awesome specifically for the Colombia scenes, it represented a group of Latins that are rarely shown to the world.  This was not a typical action movie.  It was certainly different.  I love seeing movies like this that come out once a blue moon.  I wish I can see more like them.  Love. Love. Love. Love it.  Beautiful talented lead.  Great entertaining action.  And a theme and plot (not just about killing to be killing).
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I really wish it could have been 12 new songs, its too bad she didnt get in the chance to record more songs. But, its Amy, the voice, the soul, the sweet sound. I LOVE IT.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|This movie is terribly awful.  In essence this movie says that  Dr. Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers, Rosa Parks, Nat Turner, Malcolm X and all other pioneers and catalyst for freedom of black and civil rights movement are liars and never did existed.  As always blacks are being portrayed as not being able to help themselves and require the assistance of whites to do for them.  This movie is the WHITE LIE and it is only popular and praised to the heavens because it makes whites look good and feel better about themselves.  It is completely unrealistic. This movie is an insult to the black race.    I give it one star because I have to.  There are many movies and documentaries about the true heroes of the fight for freedom for blacks and the civil rights movement and I have never seen them praised like this sorry movie.  And it is because the documentaries and movies that tell the truth are not liked by white mainstream.

B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is a great movie because it's really funny, Will Ferrell fits the part of Buddy, and it's appropriate for all ages.   Do you enjoy watching funny, Christmas movies with elves in them? If you do, I highly recommend this movie for you to watch. For one, it stars Will Ferrell. Two, it's about elves. And three, it's about Christmas! Who doesn't love all those awesome things combined in one movie?! Some movies are cliché, but definitely not this one! The way it all makes sense and falls together; makes the story completely understandable. The acting is one of the best things about the wonderful film. It's funny and it's... well just so funny! The plot is about a boy who slips into Santa's sack one Christmas Eve when he was little, and then he got taken and raised at the North Pole. He becomes an elf, an overgrown elf, who meets his real father after many years at the North Pole. Will/Buddy faces a few obstacles during his elf time, but then there are many heartwarming moments. In the end, Buddy ends up with his new/original family. I love this movie because of Will, the scenes, and the fact that Christmas can bring a father and son together.   One of the reasons why Elf is so funny is because of some of the scenes. In one scene, Buddy the elf was going inside a building and to enter, you had to go through a spinning door. That was the first time he had ever been in one so he went through the door about seven different times! Another is when he attacked the fake Santa at the mall. You see, Buddy used to live in the North Pole with the real Santa Claus. So when he saw the fake Santa, he ran over and ripped off his beard and said, \\"You're not Santa!\\"   Will Ferrell fits well playing the part of Buddy the elf because he has the perfect looks for an elf. His wild, curly hair helps with that. He has the comedic abilities of Buddy from his days (or should I say nights) on Saturday Night Live. His style is unique among modern movie funnymen. His humor is a character drivenwhich is perfect for the part of Buddy.   Elf is a movie that is PG. It has a good family storyline about how families can get along despite their differences. It also tells how people can change and become a better person. It is in all a very fun, holiday themed, movie that has a good moral to it. The movie itself has very little offensive language or scenes that may be questionable. This makes the movie appropriate for all ages.   I can't\ say enough good things about this movie! I've watched it several times and I laugh every time! I consider this to be the perfect movie for the whole family. So, you'd better watch out and you better not cry! And in keeping with the holiday spirit, I'm going to tell you why! Give yourself \\"the gift of Elf\\" for any family gathering and discover the simple pleasure of believing in the spirit of Christmas! Now, go buy the fantastic Elf and get to know Buddy and his story!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Excellent ending to a very good series of movies. I was brought up on LOTR, but still like Potter a great deal.<br />Nice production, NOT over-done with special effects ( although they are very nice, when done).
B005CAAU76|4.0|This album contains some of Queen's greatest tracks-the rollicking Fat Bottomed Girls , Bicycle Race and one of my favourite Queen songs-Don't Stop Me Now.<br />Also noteworthy are the fast paced Let Me Entertain You and Fun It , the melancholy Leaving Home Ain't Easy and Jealousy , the Middle Eastern style Mustapha and the waltzing 50's style Dreamer's Ball.<br />An excellent album featuring a very important stage in the bands development.

B004UUKD6W|5.0|This one reaches the majestic heights of Mozart,Tchaikovsky et al of previous centuries.It is tragic that only Killer Queen is well known to the general public of these songs.Because ther energetic Brighton Rock,the inditement of the corrupt materialism of modern time-Flick of the Wrist (with it's beautifully psychedelic overtures),the sheer poetry of Lily of the Valley (which any struggling genius can relate to),the opera rock masterpice Lap of the Gods and the fast paced rocker Misfire should have been hits of the century. the hard rock beaut Stone Cold Crazy was redone years later by metallica , a tribute to Queen's pioneering work in rock!<br />Very Very little from the 20 th century compares to them What a pity Queen became so commercialised later and churned out so much mediocre rubbish in the 1980's Carve the names of these songs in gold!
0765350386|4.0|Mistborn: The Final Empire is a very good fantasy. I have not read the author's first novel, but I look forward to doing so. The plot of this story is a common one in fantasy, but Sanderson twists it enough and adds some new ideas that make it interesting and definitely worth reading.   The basic plot revolves around the plan of a group of revolutionaries to overthrow the Lord Ruler, who has held complete power in the land for a thousand years. The Lord Ruler is, to all appearances, immortal and is called the \\"Sliver of Infinity.\\" A band of thieves, led by Kelsier, who has survived the Lord Ruler's most heinous slave mine, attempts to depose the ruler and free the downtrodden skaa.   The \\"magic\\" system in the book is intriguing. I use the quotes because it is unlike most magical systems. No spells, no chanting, no ritual practice. There are no wizards with energy-flashing staves and no witches weaving complex charms. The magic stems from swallowing bits of certain metals, and then \\"burning\\" them internally to tap into the metal's power. It is a bit more like tapping into superhero powers than a system of magic, but it works well and is a different take on what we usually see.   World building is also done well. The landscape we are introduced to is grey and ash covered. The ash falls like rain every day. At night, dense, fog-like mists rise and cover the land. The mists are feared by most people, although the Mistborn, with their metal-enhanced abilities, move about freely in the mists. The society is comprised of the Lord Ruler, who has absolute power, at the top. The Great Houses are the aristocracy of the world, and hold the wealth and power. The skaa, considered sub-human by the elite, are essentially slaves, used for manual labor and as servants to the wealthy class. In between, are the theiving guilds, who survive on wits and by conning the wealthy.   The main characters are Kelsier, a thief and revolutionary, who puts together the plot to overthrow the Lord Ruler, and Vin, a street-wise young woman who is a member of one of the thieving guilds. Both are Mistborn, able to \\"burn\\" and utilize all the metals. The rest of the team is composed of allomancers, who are able to work with only one metal each.   The plot moves along at a decent pace, with the battles between the Mistborn particularly well done. There are some rather long passages of dialogue that get a bit tedious at times, and Vin's attendance at the upper class balls for information gathering are a bit overdone. In general, though, those two flaws don't take away from the story's readability.   Kelsier and Vin are very detailed and complex as characters. The rest of the cast is less well drawn and one or two are almost cardboard cutouts without much definition. Again, these are minor problems and don't hurt the overall enjoyment of the story.   In all, this was a very good read, and I will go on to read the rest of the series.

B004LWZW4C|3.0|Hey people, i dint read the reviews here at Amazon and didn't know about the problems with this disc in some blu-ray players before making this purchase, so i received mine this week (thanks to Black Friday) and put it on my PS3 player, every movie and game i have works fine except this disc, the disc looks brand new so it seems that the problem is a compatibility issue.  Here is how you make it work (for PS3 of course):  1. Shut down your Internet connection.  2. Go to BD Data in the Video section of your PS3 menu and look for the folder that the X-MEN movie copied, and delete it!  3. Re-start your PS3 and then put the movie on.  Right now i am watching the movie with no problems but I still thinks that it is a compatibility issue and an update form Sony should correct that in the near future. I hope it works for all of you!  Still remember that you cant see this movie every time you insert the disc with your Internet connection active so if this issue isn't solved we should get a replacement in case Fox decide to correct this issue with new copies of the movie.  So 3 stars because this problem I will not change this to 5 stars until it isn't resolved.  Enjoy!
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Goto apps and download free version first if you have compatable device.  Please note, not compable with Kindle fire.  Only fair to give 5 stars even if I could not use. Waisted $4.99,need to be more careful and read info.
1591844096|2.0|I originally bought this book because it's touted by Dave Ramsey almost every show.  I figured if someone is going to promote a book that much, it must be worth a read.  After getting 3/4 of the way through, I've had to round file the book.  I don't agree with everything Ramsey believes and I certainly don't agree with a lot of what Godin believes.    The other reviews are spot on - Godin repeats himself constantly.  It's annoying in meetings, it's annoying in phone calls and it's annoying in a book.  I guess his form of artistry is trying to come up with new ways to say the same thing 300 times in the 175 pages I read.  The proverbial straw that broke this camel's back was the bashing of capitalists.  I thought I caught an essence or two at the beginning, but in the chapter on gifts, he's no longer shy about his feeling towards \\"hardheaded selfish capitalists\\".  Funny, he sure seems like a capitalist to me, but I doubt his descriptions include himself.  I won't say the book is a waste of time or money, as there were a few thoughts in the beginning that I liked.  However, this particular piece of literature will not be referred to again.  I don't have respect for hypocrisy.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|This is one of the dumbest movies I ever seen. Not for the visual effects or the overall entertainment but for the hard to believe performances, the typical American clichés (flags everywhere, all of them are heroes, the president flying a jet fighter like an ace, a drunk guy who, suddenly salutes like a GI Joe and also flights a jet with no training, his kids watching him die and not even reacting, and so on...).  As said, absolute crap.
1452101248|4.0|Interesting recipes in this book, love the pictures and the ingredients.   A lot of the dishes are for the winter seasons, although they are still appealing in summer.   I like the look of the book for displaying purposes as well, looks great on show. Not as many recipes in it as I thought, but still worth its $$
B0036TGT3E|5.0|What a difference this movie is in Blu-Ray.Beautiful just beautiful.I would recommend this disc to everyone.I watched it twice because I was so impressed.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I agree with the review titled Torn. I too thought it was pretty slow at the beginning.  I almost gave up in the first 50 pages.  Maybe my expectations were too high?!  But I continued on and finally the book became more engrossing at around 100 pages.  Just like Torn said, the end of the book is very good.  But I think the author should have balanced the beginning of the book with the end.  All in all, a good book -- not great.
B000059MEK|5.0|It took a little while longer than I thought it would to get it.  However, I was happy that there were no cracks in the cd case and the cd itself was in perfect condition.
1451627289|5.0|I bought the book thinking that the entire story would focus on 11/22/63,but most of the story is leading up to the day of the assassination. To my surprise, as it all ties together, it is one of the best written and most intriguing books I have read in a long time.  There are a lot of pieces that must fit together and the author does that so well.
0321704452|4.0|This book provides great insight on how to engage successfully with an audience. Emphasizing the need to be oneself when presenting before an audience is certainly good advice.  The approach of telling a story to arouse the emotions of your audience makes so much sense.  The author of this book gets it!  I certainly remember personal stories from speakers.  I also agree with the author that showing contrasts while telling a story is effective.  Another key point that the reader should grasp from the book is how to plan a presentation.  The systematic approach that was given in the book for planning a presentation was good sound advice.  Identifying the problem, then identifying the causes for the problem, and then going on to tell how to solve the problem is a good approach. This approach should definitely be applied whenever a presenter is trying to persuade the audience.  This book has good advice for anyone that has to deliver a presentation to win an audience over.

0321704452|4.0|The Naked Presenter by Garr Reynolds focuses on how being yourself and connecting with the audience set the tone for a great presentation. Thinking of a presentation as a conversation was a great observation made by Reynolds. In the past,I never created my speeches from that view. It was just that, a speech, which is one of the reasons I always feared giving them. Usually my focus would be on \\"sticking to the script,\\" not noticing the presentation was probably perceived from the audience as a script instead of my original intentions of getting my message across.  Also telling stories in place of bullets is a good asset. As I think about presentations I have set through, the best and most rememberable presentations were enhanced by stories related to the topics.  Overall this is a good book for perfecting \\"conversations.\\"

1612680011|5.0|This book was recommended by my college economics professor when I asked should I continue renting or own a home afer college. Kiyosaki explains how the rich teaches their children not to work, but to grow their money through making wise investments. The contents in this book was very informative as I develop my financial investments in life. I advise this book to all!
B005FMB8X6|5.0|I just received this in my mailbox tonight (kudos to Amazon, I ordered on a Sunday and it arrived on Tuesday!), so I'm still working my way through the extras.  But I am so pumped after my first listen to this 5.1 mix, I have to post a review immediately!    Having been a big fan of the surround sound mixes that gained some momentum and then faltered a few years ago, I was totally excited to see this amazing, classic album being newly released in this format.  I dare say that nobody has ever quite realized this format as fully as those who did this release (yes, i realize that my wording makes me appear a pretentious twit here, so be it).  I've found that some of the releases in this format have fallen short.  Rush's Moving Pictures, earlier this year, didn't particularly meet my admittedly high expectations.  At the time I listened to it, I figured that maybe the fact that most of us imagine music as being heard from the audience, listening to musicians on a stage, made the format a somewhat moot point for most \\"rock\\" albums. This mix made me completely re-vamp that preconceived notion.  Here's why:  Most of the surround sound discs I've heard tend to keep the drums relegated to the main right and left channels, with the \\"extraneous\\" tracks such as backing vocals or strings being given a bonus punch by appearing in the rear channels.  This is not necessarily wrong, it works great on my R.E.M. and Elton John 5.1 discs.  But now I see, by way of the genius(es) who mixed Discipline (the print is small and it's dark in my house, otherwise I'd be more specific!), that the mix should be ALL around the listener, as if (s)he were in the middle of the stage, the middle of the music.  Of course, this particular album is a great example of music that is easily accessible to NOT being heard in that tried and true \\"stage\\" formula, as the intricate, woven musical lines lend themselves to being experienced in a less conventional soundscape.  But the fact that the drums are all around you, instead of just in front of you, is nothing short of revelatory!  There's no reason that any album, rock or otherwise, can't benefit from a truly surround sound mix in the manner achieved here.  Now onto the actual material, 'cuz I know I'm getting a little long-winded here... The tracks ALL sound amazing.  The most striking ones for me were \\"Frame By Frame\\" and especially \\"Matte Kudesai\\", where the tracks are a little less manic and have room to breathe.  \\"Kudesai\\" in particular, brought Belew's beautiful vocal right into your face.  Of course he's known for his guitar and songwriting prowess, why wouldn't he be?  But going up to the center channel and hearing the perfection of his vocal right in your ear is breathtaking.  Adrian's name certainly deserves to be mentioned alongside great vocalists like Jeff Buckley or Freddie Mercury, something I probably wouldn't have thought before tonight.  \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\" and \\"Discipline\\" are also served particularly well by the 5.1 mix.  All in all, I'm hopeful that this format will continue to flourish, as the modern age of the compressed mp3 format (which also has it's place in the world of listening) could certainly use a counterpart for those of us who love our music in pure magnificent grandiosity!  Hopefully the KC machine will continue to release their classic albums in surround (I'd like to beg for Beat and Three of a Perfect Pair next, please!).  And as long as I'm shouting out my wishlist, How about Radiohead's OK Computer, Jeff Buckley's Grace and The Verve's Urban Hymns soon, folks?  Those are foregone conclusions for the surround sound treatment, am I right?  I should be receiving my copy of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here tomorrow, which will tide me over for a bit, but I'm not asking too much, am I?  Get on it, people!  And fans, buy this stuff up so they hear the demand!
0439023513|5.0|Absolutely amazing conclusion to the story.  If you enjoyed the first two installments of this series then you can't get by without reading this book.<br /><br />a word of warning however....don't plan on getting any sleep once it's all over

B004O7EVLY|5.0|This album takes you back 30 years, I would imagine. (I'm only 25y)<br />Hisingen Blues is the album of the year(2011).<br /><br />All the songs in the album are fantastic. The versatility of styles should inspire other artists because this is brilliant.<br /><br />Buy the album because this will be a classic. Graveyard is much like Titanic was in the 1970s (great album from them, 'Eagle Rock').<br /><br />If you've never heard of Graveyard, I would suggest you to listen \\"No Good, Mr. Holden\\" and \\"The Siren\\" which are my favorite songs from this album.<br /><br />Graveyard is not stoner. It's pure Blues rock/Rock and Roll.<br /><br />Other recommendations are:<br />Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats - Blood Lust (2011, UK. One of my favorite albums)<br />Russian Circles - Enter (Instrumental only, but super good. 2006 USA)<br />Bombus - Bombus (2010, Sweden)<br />Blues Pills - Devil Man (2012, Sweden)<br />Brutus - Brutus (2011, Sweden)<br />Greenleaf - Agents of Ahriman (2007)<br />Soen - Cognitive (2012, this album has a similar sound to Tool. But a bit harder)<br />Rocket From The Tombs ‎- The Day The Earth Met The (2002, USA)<br />The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble - Here Be Dragons (2009, just a bloody brilliant album. One of the best albums ever.)<br />Zodiac - A Bit Of Devil (2012, Germany. Just a very good album. Vocal similar to the artist 'Everlast'.. weirdly. But sounds great.)

B0060AY6FO|1.0|Prosy and flat-footed, grotesquely anachronistic in diction, amateurish in its handling of dialogue and point of view--this witless pastiche would never have been published without the asserted authorship of Baroness James, which i frankly question. It is unbelievable that this book opens with more than 20 pages of straight summary--compare with the opening of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, which gives us two paragraphs before the dialogue between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet start the dramatic action of the story.  Jane Austen knew what she was about.  James seems lost.  James's dialogue is astoundingly poor, of this variety: \\"I am Stoughton, the butler, a loyal sturdy churl who has been devoted to Mr. Darcy since the death of his late father, whom I revered.  Shall I show you into the smoking room, which was built in the time of the Tudors?\\" \\"No, thank you, my good man, please tell my friend Mr. Darcy that his old schoolmate, whom he has not seen for seven years, eight months and a week, has at length arrived bringing important information that will move the plot of this creaky imposture, though hardly at an indecorous speed.\\" \\"Very good, sir. Notice, though, Neptune Taming a Seahorse . . . .\\"  James has also played hob with the characters and transformed the Darcy-Bennet marriage, one of the most interesting in English fiction, into rankest cliche.  The endless discussions of the woes of the minor characters are, to quote Mark Twain in another context, chloroform in print.  Least forgiveable is the complete absence of any trace of the gentle irony, verbal agility, and ladlylike high spirits that make PRIDE AND PREJUDICE commercially valuable enough to be a subject of this shameless exploitation. James was never a warm or lively writer, but her mystery books were technically superb.  How did she produce such a monstrosity--or did she? The overall effect is of a tinned-beef label based upon THE LAST SUPPER, but depicting poker-playing dogs in place of the Apostles, with the authorialattribution \\"School of Leonardo.\\"
B005PR2FD8|4.0|This DVD didn't get any press release so when I saw it at Walmart I was very curious to know whether it's good or not.  I can tell you that the CG graphic and sound are awesome!  The central theme of the story is vengeance begets vengeance which is still a relevant point to our current global conflict.  I also like the fact that the DVD has two separate English and Japanese soundtracks.  The extra menu only have 2 trailers of the movie.  I wish they had included the making of the movie in the extras.  Overall I recommend this DVD.
0439023521|5.0|When this book was forced on me by a friend I was nervous it was going to be some dreadful twitard rubbish so I ignored it for as long as I could before I finally succumbed to her incessant wheedling and read it. From the first page I didn't come up for air until I finished it. The Hunger games were a bit reminiscent of Battle Royale, Mad Max, The Road and even Vampire Hunter D. Yet very much it's own unique story. If you're a fan of semi-post apocalyptic sci-fi you'll have a hard time putting this book down. If you weren't previously a fan of the genre this book might just be the one to change your mind. Extremely easy to read, moves at a smooth exciting pace. Suzanne Collins creates a vivid and terrifying future that it is easy to imagine awaits us all. Yikes!
0316098329|2.0|I picked up 'Room' because this past summer I saw it everywhere, it was on the bestseller's list for a long time and my curiosity took over. When I started this book the beginning kept me intrigued. I was wondering why are these people in a room, what is going on and I thought it was genius the way the author told the story from a 5 year olds' point of view. Writing a whole novel like that as an adult is amazing. Emma really did capture the innocent youth a 5 year old is going through. There were a couple of subjects that made me tear up in this book but the majority of it was a little lackluster to me. I eventually found myself somewhat skimming through the pages because there was the promise of suspense without any real climax. After a while this book became a chore to finish instead of an enjoyment so when you see the reviews of people reading it in one day it's more then likely they wanted to be done and through with it asap. Though the narrative was neat of being through the view of a 5 year old it got old quick and when you would reach conclusions early on, you had to force yourself to read until 'Jack' found out what you already knew 50 pages ago. This is the only book I've read from this author, but I honestly don't know if I would try another one. In summary this book promised suspense and intrigue but delivered monotony and redundance.
B004X80QNG|5.0|once again, negative reviews come from users not understanding. this app syncs with  google calendar beautifully, by writing to the OS calendar information, as well as providing a non-synchronized calendar for other use cases. The developers did this correctly. if kindle doesn't have this, it's not the developers fault.. blame Amazon.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|App runs well on my Toshiba Thrive tablet. This app has lots of fun drawing tools and colors, as well as stampers and stickers. It has options to save your work as well. I knocked off a star because true, bright, primary colors only seem available in the marker and brush tools, the other tools' colors are much more muted (just a personal preference) and because the stickers are missing a kitty cat. There is a dog, a rabbit, birds, fish, and other exotic animals along with just about everything under the sun, but no kitty. Somehow subbing a lion for a house cat looks a bit odd in my child's family drawing.
0446310786|5.0|This story is only for those who are passionate, pensive, and have genuine interest in human rights. Harper Lee takes us on a journey of a young Alabama girl, Scout, who lives in the lazy town of Maycomb. In Maycomb, everyone has a certain social standing and they play by the rules of this society. This all changes when the town is rocked by court case that skews the dynamics of Maycomb: the formally polite Southern folk become vicious and unforgiving. Scout tells her story of being exposed to the cruelty that hatred can bring out in good people. The reader experiences a moral crises through the eyes of the innocent, which is deeply thought provoking. To Kill A Mockingbird will bring you to question not only the society of the 1940s, but also of today.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I would love to use something like this (and since Iambic never came through the field has narrowed) but without a widget its not for me.

1594203059|3.0|The West's collapse was utterly predictable. Had the following things been left undone the West would still be prosperous, powerful and head and shoulders above the rest. Leave prayer in the schools, leave the immigration laws as they were in the western nations in the early 1960s, do not have a sexual revolution where people insist on the \\"right\\" to boff whomever they please whenever they please, no explosion in illegal drug use, do not tolerate homosexuals, do not legalize abortion, do not legalize pornography, keep two-parent nuclear families intact where the father works and the mother stays home taking care of the household and children, keep putting on Christmas pageants in school, be realistic about blacks and natives and their qualities (look at the evidence), do not bring in concepts such as common law marriage and \\"palimony\\", do not be brainwashed by the idea that you must fight for every inch because you are an animal and only the strong survive (but rather fear Jesus and follow his Commandments and teachings), know that western Europe still has the lowest homicide and corruption levels in the world and that western Europeans (and Jews) invented virtually all of modern math and science because they were the ones who were innately able to do it, encourage the tiny few most wholesome and attractive people to have as many children as possible and the opposite to have as few as possible, beware of the political views of the bland and homely and those with ethnic looking features, know that bad-seeds feel strongly about defending their \\"right\\" to do every manner of evil and have laws in place to deal with them harshly.
B004X0JH7A|5.0|I normally don't read this genre of novel, however I am glad that I took the time as this was very well presented and easy to read. It is written in a way where you feel as if you are there watching the events unfold, it's nothing like I thought it would be (one of those dry historical novels with facts only). It's a well paced story and I'm now on the hunt to read some other books by the same author.   While I don't agree with what Henry VIII did, this book puts into perspective why he took a particular path at the time. As a female, I must say that there were plenty of opportunities to paint women in a very negative light. Weir takes the time to look at events in a very even handed manner.   I intend to read this again in the next year, that's how much I enjoyed it.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|This is a good remake of the 82 movie but fails to renew the excitement the first one raised. Oh you should watch it definitely. Its just that 30 years later I was expecting more. Nice ending though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Runs very well. Used this app with a blackberry and android. Worked well with both. Works to read the Bible, as well as read our church bulletin/notes. Excellent idea, thank you to whoever put this together!
0062060554|4.0|I read this book not knowing what it is about and so the end was very surprising.  If you know it's a thriller great, but if you think it's a serious novel the end comes as a disappointment.
0385535139|2.0|This book is either for dedicated Grisham fans or for first-timers. True fans will be comforted by the standard formula while those new to Grisham should be pleased with the pace and easy going style. For myself, who has read the majority of his work, I found this to be a retread not only in style but also in plot which was extremely reminiscent of The Rainmaker and King of Torts. His books have become too procedural and repetitive. Still, the comfort he provides through formula can pass the time and one does not have to concentrate very hard in the process.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I bought the movie prepaid. Saw it at theaters and know<br />beforehand that I have to own it along with my other<br />Harry Potter movies. I think its worth it due to the fact that<br />it came with a digital copy. Retail stores would've sold<br />it at a higher price with it. Finally completed my<br />collection of the Harry Potter movies! It's awesome!!<br />Shipping was great. It notified me that it was on its way<br />and before I knew it, it's already sitting in my mailbox.
B004SDEP38|3.0|I checked out some features and it seems ok for a mobile editing app, but I am real confused on the sync'ing.  When I press Sync on the desktop version, it wants me to connect to a USB device.  Huh?  no wi-fi?  I did that initially to populate some folders, but after setup, I expect it to sync via wi-fi, whether manually on-demand or automatically.  On the device (Kindle Fire), I see no menu items for sync there either.  The user documentation is pathetic and offers no clues.  If I have to sync by USB, I doubt I will use it much.
B000CNE092|5.0|well, what can i say? its the animated film. i really loved it but i didn't buy it on amazon. i did buy it at walmart last christmas for $10.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Why launch an Android calendar app that cannot sync with Google Calendar?  This seems like a major miss by the makers. hopefully this will be fixed soon but for now, I will be deleting this app. Glad I got it free as paying $10 for it would have been a major disappointment.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Needed a tripod for a class. It broke the first time I used it! Do I send it back or not? I think the quality is not there because most people won't bother returning it.
0865478570|5.0|As a practising translator, it is a delight to read about our much-maligned craft in a text that is so incisive, unpacking, as they say, a lot of silliness that gets said about translation. I only wish I had stuck to my guns 40 years ago when I wanted to study translation. My freshman advisor thought it was a joke. Bellos has an enviable job and is master of an enjoyable pen.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you add up all the reviews (as of 12-7-2011) and average them, you get a score of 2.55.<br />If you remove all the 1 star reviews and re-average them, you get a score of 4.46.<br /><br />I've never been that into Star Wars. I believe the first time I saw a FULL Star Wars movie was when I was in my middle school's pottery class. Yep.  That was about 16 years ago. I thought they were good, and I can see why people are so fanatic about it, but I was ok with just seeing it once and maybe catching a few clips here and there on TV.<br /><br />As most people were, I was dissapointed with the hype of the new prequels, and never really saw all of Episode III. I have seen the rest though, and plan to watch them all again someday.<br /><br />Having them all on Blu-ray in one spot is pretty cool, and I hope to watch them all in chronological order someday with my son when he's a bit older. I have the luxury of not being a fanboy and I dont have to worry about the changes made and the lack of the original's being included.<br /><br />I recommend you don't taint the folks new to Star Wars with all the negativity of what Lucas has done, and let them just enjoy the films as they currently exist. They can become fanboys later and complain.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|i saw this movie and found it boring and it seemed to drag on too long for me. i must say that this is the only movie that i've ever watched all the way through that i actually jumped and cheered when it was over.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I just downloaded this app on my kindle fire and it is perfect for my weather needs. I typed in my zip code and it brought up my city and state and it even has a radar map. You can check up yo 15 days of forecasts and tells you if there are any weather alerts. I definitely recommend this.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Downloaded as the free app. crashes on startup. worthless, maybe that's why its free?  maybe if they fix it and run an update if will work better.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Much more accessible than previous records, which might lead people to write it off as \\"selling-out.\\" However, if you are going to sell-out, you might as well do it well. Very well, indeed!
B002JH3TW8|4.0|I bought this after reading a few other reviewers who mentioned they used this for their old Firewire ipods. It works great for this purpose, both syncing if need be, but also charging straight from the much newer, Firewire-800-only imac. (USB connector drains the batter of the ipod, I've found).   I also have a backup LaCie firewire hard drive I intend to use with this. I don't expect there will be a problem with that. Finally, the quality of the connector itself seems very good. A tech person at a Mac store had advised against simply getting one of the rigid adapters, as he said they are prone to breaking the connection on laptops, etc.  I only give it four stars because I've not had it very long, but this seems great and well-designed for its purpose.
B00000GAMD|5.0|This is for me the best CD of the band. The songs are very beautiful and in full measure. The remastered version has added to this work. The bonuses make this a complete quality version. Very Good!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I loved this movie. Seems to me a lot of people missed the boat on what this film is really about. Seems pretty clear to me--the film begins with a passage from Job--the guy who thinks he gets a raw deal from God. (The early death of a child is certainly a raw deal.) But, as the Creation sequence says eloquently (and, you do need a big screen and a really good sound system to get the full effect), \\"Lord, why?\\"(us) \\"Where were you? (God, I think)--meaning, \\"Where were you when I created all this?\\" The rain falls on the just and the unjust. Malick's depiction of life in the '50s also rings true to a \\"been there, done that\\" oldster.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I really enjoyed the final Harry Potter movie and was glad to see the ending with Harry, Hermione and Ron ending up happily married.
0743246616|4.0|Good condition for the book.  I wished the book had more pictures and were colored.  I also wished the pages were the heavy paper.  The service was great, very fast but am disappointed in the book.
0756404738|5.0|Absolutely amazing book. Such a joy to revisit these characters and this world. I found it completely engrossing. I love the amount of detail and the care taken over each little bit of this story. I loved the length of it and can hardly wait for the next one.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|First the bad-it is not a lifetime longlasting screen and having a lifetime warrantee is a little silly and difficult to process/redeem.  Now, the good-who cares if it is not a lifetime screen protector?!?  Everyone I have had lasted at least 6 months + and needed replacement mainly because I am a heavy user/abuser.  For under 20 dollars, (now the kit has front and back available) can one really complain?  NOTE: be sure to read directions and follow completely!!  Others who gave bad reviews probably did not read and follow the properly.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|Here's the deal. It's a fantastic record but it's not as good as Back To Black (well, that's kind of impossible anyway). If you're new to Amy Winehouse, please buy Back To Black first. However, if you've listened to her music before, this is A MUST (even if you haven't, actually). It's a truly fantastic recording. Same INSANE voice, a variety of styles ranging from R&B to Jazz and Brazilian Broken Beats. Her talent will live forever and this record will be the perfect tool to make sure nobody forgets that.<br /><br />Songs ranging from 2002 up until 2011 that will make you understand why she truly will be an eternal Lioness... Monumental talents like this don't come around often. Consider yourself lucky you had the chance to listen to something like this in your lifetime.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|The new Amy Winehouse album is a series of outtakes and alternate versions of previously released songs. Here is a break down of the songs and my opinions on them:  Best Friends, Right? is a song that was already released under the title Best Friends. The version here is safe, unassuming and a sample of what caught the attention of the rec execs. It isn't a bad version but if you want to hear a better version go to youtube and catch 'Amy Winehouse before she became well known'---a video posted from someone in England who recorded Amy singing this one with her guitar at a Virgin records outlet. An even better version is available from Summer Sundae Festival I believe from 2004 which is a live version.   I am hoping that the rec execs will release her live material especially the earlier days when her voice and band too were spectacular. Despite Remi's admonition that this it for Winehouse, I believe there will be some more gems sitting around in studios and people's homes (not many but some) and that includes what her father recently said were recordings of her when she was 17 where she sounds amazingly exactly like Billie Holiday. For us Winehouse fans, let us not forget such unreleased gems as her haunting version(s) of Donny Hathaway's More Than You'll Ever Know (also available on youtube)...  As much as I am an Amy Winehouse fan, I am perplexed by the supposed fact that she had emphysema, and believe that her voice was shot (for good) because of crack cocaine, strain and who knows what else was going on with her body (either because it is known and will never be released, or doctors just didn't see it). The brain is very complex and I believe that certain medications, or lack of them, or certain drugs and subsequent withdrawals from them have a major impact on the brain. In my opinion, her voice was destroyed in the end, and she ended up sounding like Ethel Merman. Body and Soul is a good example of this. Her voice is saved by the great strings and Tony Bennett'scontributions. However when she hits the mid-range and lower notes...she disappoints..very nasal in her approach, as seen in the very tortured and sad version of Song for You. Again this problem that popped up in 2010 is heard in the latter song: her strong entries and mid to upper notes are fantastic but she slurs the mid-to-lower range notes and skips over lyrics. I read somewhere that she actually cried during the recording of the song and that she was using heroin at the time. I read elsewhere she had played guitar on that track (where is it?---I was expecting a version akin to Joplin's Me and Bobby McGhee when I read about this).  The really bad recordings on this album include:   Between the Cheats (very lame attempt at `50s doo-wop and predictable (should've never been released));   Tears Dry (thank God she changed the arrangement on this one for B2B);   Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow (forget this string-backing vocals-overkill version; get the jazzy version from the Bridget Jones soundtrack---way way better, same vocal and an example of no matter how good the vocals are, if the music is bad....it'll kill the whole thing)  The real gems on this album are:   The Girl From Ipanema, where Winehouse scats so well she doesn't make it cheesy;   Half Time, a song Winehouse wrote herself, and is a brilliantly well executed jazz tune;  Like Smoke (ignore the lyrics...just listen to the voice, although I agree with another review here that Nas' rap doesn't really go with her lyrics);  Our Day Will Come (wish she would've recorded more songs like this);  Valerie (there is a video on youtube where she is recording this version, makes an error, and apologizes; the guitar effect is very good and the saxes mix quite well with her vocal)  and my personal favorite WAKE UP ALONE, where the version was pre-released of course, on youtube...the echo effect is fantastic at the end and is another example of Winehouse's pure hypnotic voice--that \\"black woman trapped in a white Jewish English girl's body\\" je ne sais quoi.....she could take a song and sing it 300 different ways in one night and make each sound amazing...  The debates will continue, whether the will is stronger than the brain....whether there is a distinction between mind and brain or whether everything in human life is controlled by genetics...no one can say for sure if Winehouse was weak willed, had major character flaws, suffered mental illness or was a person with addictions many call disease or a combination of some or all of these....but one thing is for sure...she was talented, brought many joy through her voice, and left us all far too far soon.

B005URRCUY|5.0|I think this is a great album - these guys write good songs and the sounds Aeurbach makes with the guitar are awesome.   I'm a huge fan of Junior Kimborough, RL Burnside, and a lot of the blues musicians that inspired the Black Keys earlier stuff. I really like those albums (especially ThickFreakness) but I always thought it paled in comparison to Kimborough and others who played that style. Now the BK have expanded their sound, and in some ways I think it's better. In any case, this album rocks and is a lot of fun to listen to.
B006FS22Y8|4.0|Anyone expecting LIONESS HIDDEN TREASURES to be of the same caliber as 2006's classic BACK TO BLACK needs to remind himself that this is a posthumous release.  This means all decisions were ultimately left to the producers.  While this is likely not the followup that Amy Winehouse envisioned, it contains some great songs.<br /><br />Unlike her last studio album, half the songs here are covers. While I grew up on the originals, Winehouse delivers some of her finest vocals on \\"Our Day Will Come\\" and \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\\" Even the arrangement of \\"The Girl From Impanema\\" is a playful interpreation (but the snare is mixed way too loud).<br /><br />Of the handful of originals, \\"Half Time\\" is the standout track. However, the rap interludes on \\"Like Smoke\\" are a distraction.<br /><br />The sultry delivery on \\"A Song For You\\" is perhaps the best song of the album. There's also Winehouse's final recording, \\"Body and Soul,\\" with Tony Bennett. It's hard not to listen to the lyrics and not reflect on the events leading up to her untimely death.<br /><br />  \\"Are you pretending, it looks like the ending<br />  Unless, I could have one more chance to prove, dear\\"<br /><br />A reminder of what we have lost with the passing of this gifted artist. RECOMMENDED
B005H0IW6W|1.0|I love the music on this CD but it has a skip in it.  Brand new out of the package.  I was disappointed.  Not worth all the money to return.  No more order CDs for me!  I'm sticking to ITunes!
B0061JPYX2|4.0|It should be pointed out that Amy Winehouse's posthumous album \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\" is not her 3rd album.   While Producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi had good intentions, I think they'd have done more of a service to Amy's legacy if they had issued these recordings without the instrumental overdubs. Amy Winehouse issued 3 of these performances in her lifetime, the acoustic version of \\"Valerie\\" was issued on the deluxe set of Back To Black, \\"Best Friends\\" was an acoustic B side, and \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" was issued on the Bridgit Jones soundtrack. Check out the original recordings and decide for yourself which is better. The Lioness version of \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" was given a Phil Spector orchestral treatment, which addss nothing to Winehouse's soulful and perfect vocal. I simply hate what was done to Best Friends. The demos of Tears Dry On Their Own and Wake Up Alone are brilliant performances and deserving of release. I love her vocals on The Girl From Ipanema and A Song For You, but again, I'd have preferrred to hear the original versions without overdubs. It's nice to have her final recording of Body And Soul with Tony Bennett on an Winehouse release, and I have not absorbed \\"Between The Cheats,\\" \\"Half Time\\" and \\"Like Smoke\\" enough to comment on them.   Amy Winehouse was a singing genius, and an improviser of the highest order, who never sang anything the same way twice. There are countless live concert performances that were recorded and many television performances where she sang much material that she didn't record in the studio. Aside from a handful of disastorous concerts, anything she left behind is worth listening to, but there remains many real hidden treasures that the public should hear.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|\\"The Help\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: At the dawn of the civil rights movement, three Mississippi women are about to take one extraordinary step. Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss and her mother won't be happy till she finds a husband. Aibileen, a wise African-American maid and caretaker suffers after the loss of her own child. And Minny, Aibileen's sassy best friend, struggles to find and hold a job. Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk.  The cast led by Emma Stone (as Skeeter), Viola Davis (as Aibileen) & Octavia Spencer (as Minny) is excellent. The screenplay (based on Kathryn Stockett's novel) & directing by Tate Taylor (who also executive produced) is excellent.  The music by Thomas Newman is excellent. The cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt is excellent. The film editing by Hughes Winborne is excellent. The casting by Kerry Barden & Paul Schnee is excellent. The production design by Mark Ricker is excellent. The art direction by Curt Beech is excellent. The set decoration by Rena DeAngelo is excellent. The costume design by Sharen Davis is excellent.  This is an excellent film that is well-made and well-shot. This is a heartwarming and beautifully gut-wrenching film that hits your heart and mind to its very core. The performances by Emma Stone, Viola Davis & Octavia Spencer are terrific and Oscar-worthy. Another performances by Jessica Chastain (as Celia Foote) & Bryce Dallas Howard (as Hilly Holbrook) are great, as well. This is one of the best films of the year and was also one of the best films of last summer.
B006470HZ6|1.0|The pilot of this series was a good piece of work for television. Season one was short, but the quality mostly held up. This isn't great drama here. Its the traditionalist survivalist storyline thats been done so many times before. I don't usually like this kind of thing much, but the first season held my attention first for the quality and second for a certain degree of originality.<br /><br />But the second season is a waste of time. The budget of the series has been cut to nothing. Cheap props, cheap effects and every old trick-in-the-book is employed to cut the budget down to almost nothing. They hardly have sets and props. They pull out the old gimmick of the-search-for-the-lost-character and the injured-character-who-must-stay-in-bed to reduce the effective cost of the cast. We even get the very old \\"single-character-lost-in-the-woods\\" episode.<br /><br />And you can tell that the network or the producer must have been screaming at them about female viewer demographics because they pull out everything in that bag too: (1) endless relationship melodrama, (2) the lost/missing child, (3) pregenancy melodrama. (4) child in the hospital (5) constant bitching combined with threats of suicide and on and on. The story and the writing are just plain bad now.<br /><br />The entire season consists of mostly having the cast stand around at a farm. Even among cheap shows, this show sets a new standard for cheap. AMC had a huge ratings winner with this thing. But it looks like they the cut the heart out of it and put every cent they had into their deadwood-derivative \\"hell on wheels\\".<br /><br />The first few episodes in the first season were done at film quality. If the series doesn't turn around soon, any audience it has will start walking away.

1609611543|5.0|Compelling information! Since we all know all our food has changed over the centuries  and can believe that mankind has further changed the nature of food, it makes sense! I had been eating less carbs for dieting's sake, and had wondered at the \\"phenomenon\\" of craving more wheat items, (including sweets) after eating wheat which I'd noticed over the years. I've believed in food addictions for a while. When I don't eat wheat, it is easier to eat properly and \\"controlledly\\"! I don't have celiac symptoms, but wanted to read the data and the \\"addictive\\" nature of wheat hits home!

B005V1WZ10|4.0|First off, let me say I've been a huge Korn fan since the beginning.  They have always been a band that isnt afraid to take risks and expand on their signature sound without totally compromising it.  Sometimes their risks dont pay off (see: Untitled) but The Path of Totality is an exciting and interesting listen from top to bottom.  There are no bad songs on the album.  Standouts are the two singles (Narcissistic Cannibal, Get Up!) as well as Bleeding Out and Let's Go (the most Korn-sounding song on the album).  The bonus track, Tension, is also insane but I'd call it a total dubstep song with Jon's vocals since there are no guitars on it.  I think Korn did a fantastic job of balancing their signature sound with dubstep and not letting either side outweigh the other.  Some remarkable stuff.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 only because I feel a little bad for Ray.  All the drums are synth.  I guess they told this guy to stay home during the recordings.  I would've liked more inclusion of real drums, especially since Ray is a great drummer.   I'm sure this album will divide many people.  Metal purists will probably shake their heads and dubstep purists may not like the guitars.  But i just ask people to open their minds and respect a band who, 20 years in, is still taking chances and still staying relevant.  There are only 2 types of music: Good Music and Bad Music.  And this is Good Music.
1451648537|5.0|This book really reveals the life of Steve Jobs. I actually have not finished it all yet but from what i read till now it really does him no good. I actually think he chose the wrong person to write it cause the author dug up the facts and presented them as they are, raw and aweful. The Author did a great job i feel, its a fantastic biography, unfortunately if you are a Jobs fan dont think you are going to like what you read. I always felt Jobs was a bit of an assy,  but when i learned of his health condition i felt sorry for him and my attitude changed a bit. Now after starting to read this book I feel the same way as before again, even worse, this guy did drugs, disrespected everyone including his parents, experimented with his health, cheated, tricked, exploited anything he got his hands on and on and on. Why did he agree to have this book written i will never understand, it surely does him no good.... or maybe its just me... one thing is for sure, the author presents a great piece of writing, its entertaining and amusing.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Love this movie. One of the few I could watch over and over. Kind of like re-reading favorite parts of  \\"The Princess Bride\\" by William Goldman, and still smiling and finding it humorous. When you love something, you want to experience it again and again. Perhaps I love it because I've lost so many loved ones in the past seven years, and this movie is all about love and loss and dealing with life when you just don't think you can get out of bed. It's a story of a flawed woman who despite her flaws, is truly loved. About a man who reaches beyond the grave and helps her to deal with life again.  There's realism to this movie--not just a smooth, easily flowing, wrap it all up by the end type of movie, although there is a bit of that too. This one is somewhat messy and disjointed along the way. Again, just like real life. Ups, downs, laughter, crying, some weirdness thrown in. Unexpected in places, awkward in others. If you've lost someone you love, this movie carries you along, and leaves you in a better place mentally and emotionally than where you started. How many movies do that?

0307477479|3.0|This book seems to have won every award possible known to man. It's a series of vignettes - stories which could easily stand alone, but are strung together by differing characters.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I purchased this case after exchanging the other Marware leather case which was quite bulky and nearly doubled the Fire's weight.  I chose both the white and black colors and founf the white to be a little jarring:  like a Star Wars Storm Trooper costume writ large.  The black one, however, is the same color as the cover and blends well with the Fire.  The case easily functions as a stand with the lid tucked into the back notch.  I find it stands up well despite slight movement; however the position is quite vertical.  A NICE TRICK:  if you sort of rest the lid against the strap to make a shallower pitch and flip the device in the opposite sense as when using the stand properly, the Fire is in a great position for typing and lies at about a 45 degree angle.    The case is light and sleek and seems to offer fine proterction, but it does look futuristic likea big bug carapace or such.  If you want the feel of a leather book (such as the kindle 3 coever) look elsewhere.  But if you want a small, light, inexpensive case that protects the Kindle and acts as a stand, this is good value.  Folks, it is what it is, and what it is is a strong rubbery plastic cover for an elecronic video gadget.   I recommend it highly if you don't mind the Future Shock looks.  And I will likely be buying another as a present soon...

B0061JPYX2|5.0|MP3s are often cheap and CDs often skimp on liner notes, photos and artwork. Thankfully, not this time.<br /><br />Amy Winehouse: Lioness on CD (and I assume Vinyl) reminds me of why holding the album in your hands can be such a compelling experience while discovering the music. It includes a rich booklet where the four people closest to her (her producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi; her parents Mitch and Janice) get a nice forum to briefly address the fans as well as Amy. Mark is the most eloquent, Salaam's musings are a bit of a rambling mess. After that, Salaam and Mark walk you through each track - a candid glimpse behind the scenes of works in progress. The photography is exquisite - why settle for fading tattered magazine articles when you can have these showstopping photos preserved and protected by the jewel case forever. Only one photo, Amy likely in the Caribbean, is very unpleasant to look at - she is strung out, frail and dazed - not too far from the end of her days. And finally, when you remove the CD, one final surprise: a glimpse at a page from Amy's notebook.<br /><br />As for the music, I was afraid the CD would have little to offer the Amy Winehouse completist who already has all the singles, b-sides, remixes and circulated compilations such as Procrastination and The Other Side. While those are nice (and essential recordings), you just can't beat the stellar, sweeping sound of this compilation.  \\"Tears Dry\\" is so radically different from the original it qualifies as an original song. Valerie also takes a rougher, more urgent direction.<br /><br />With the finishing touches exquisitely added to the mix (strings here, backing vocals, guest raps), the album feels less like the retro-modern third album that never was to be - and more like Amy's tribute album to her favorite musical eras. If she were alive when this dropped, we would have considered it a stop-gap, to tide fans over between albums. But alas, it is a sad coda. One can only hope the label eventually lets Mark and Salaam loose on her rumored 12 final recordings (Procrastination, Alcoholic Logic, etc.) to work their similar magic and put the legendary Amy Winehouse to rest in her rightful place in music history.Salaam loose on her rumored 12 final recordings (Procrastination, Alcoholic Logic, etc.) to work their similar magic and put the legendary Amy Winehouse to rest in her rightful place in music history.

B000TGJ80S|2.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula, 1992 film     Around 1462 the Turks invaded Southeast Europe. Vlad, Voivod (Warlord) of Wallachia and Transylvania (a vassal of the King of Hungary) was the only European ruler to defeat the armies of Mehmet II, the Sultan of Turkey. Vlad built the fortress city of Bucharest for defense against invaders. Most people only know of Vlad as a fictional character from Bram Stoker's novel. The English law clerk Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to finalize financial transactions. Count Dracula is buying houses around London (Carfax Abbey). His predecessor Reinfeld has gone insane and is in an asylum. Harker keeps a diary of his travels. A masked coachman takes him to his destination. Wolves accompany the coach. Count Dracula bids him welcome, and serves him dinner. [What, no servants?] Dracula signs the deed and now owns Carfax Abbey. Why ten houses around London?  Back in England Mina learns the typewriter (the high-tech product of the day). She stays with Lucy's wealthy family. Lucy meets Quincy, a Texan who wears a Bowie knife. Lucy is very pretty and rich, men flock around her. We see Renfield in the asylum, he loves bugs and other animals. [This scene is scary and revolting.] Back in Transylvania Dracula breaks a mirror. [Seven years bad luck?] He tells Harker to avoid the other rooms in his castle. Harker sees Dracula climbing down the wall like a bat! Back in England Mina and Lucy talk carries the story forward. We see a sailing ship, the `Demeter' (goddess of grain), leaving for England with fifty boxes of earth. A storm accompanies the ship; men go missing. Cold water and clubs subdue the inmates in the insane asylum. Mina is surprised to see a humanoid animal in the garden. A man with dark glasses walks the streets of London. [Nobody comments on his long hair!] Prince Vlad introduces himself to Mina. Lucy has a medical problem, she has horrible nightmares. Mina has an unpleasant encounter in a movie theater, and escapes. [Unescorted?] [The word `strigoy' is the Romanian word for vampire.] Whose white dog is that? Jonathan Harker is kept prisoner in the castle, attended by Dracula's wives.  At night Prince Vlad visits Lucy again. Professor Van Helsing arrives to diagnose Lucy's condition. There is no time to lose, Lucy needs a blood transfusion. [No tests for matching types?] What caused this problem? Prince Vlad meets Mina again. Harker escapes from the castle and finds a refuge. Van Helsing tests Lucy again. Mina leaves to join Harker, and Prince Vlad weeps! Van Helsing realizes Lucy is lost. Quincy appears with his Winchester and revolvers to guard Lucy. Mina and Jack are married under Orthodox rites. Lucy meets a wolf in her bedroom. The next day is her funeral. Mina and Jonathan return to London. Van Helsing and the others find an empty coffin! Lucy returns with a child in her arms. Van Helsing knows how to treat her condition. He questions Harker about his experiences abroad.  Dracula is not free, he must rest in his earth at Carfax Abbey. The men enter to search for his coffin. They destroy the boxes and sterilize the earth. Prince Vlad visits Mina at night to talk about love and life. Will Mina taste his blood? No, he develops a conscience. But Mina has passion! The men return in time to se a strange creature and drive it away. Can they save Mina? They travel by train to the port of Varna to intercept the ship carrying Dracula. But it is not a simple task. [There are some weird scenes.] Van Helsing cures the three wives of Dracula. Mina speaks in a strange tongue. There is a fight in the courtyard, and a surprising ending. Mina loves Dracula! Mother of God, is this the end of Dracula? Yes.  This film seems to have spent a lot of money on its scenery. Maybe they should have used a better and simpler story. The classic 1931 film (from a stage play) is the standard, even if it is now unintentionally funny in parts. Dracula represents a foreign ruler out to invade England to exploit the fresh blood of their people. [One cause of anemia is intestinal parasites.] The 1931 film does not try to cover so many details so it is faster moving. Note how the character of Quincy the Texan was not in earlier movies.

B000KIPT30|5.0|Perfecto for My Needs!!! I was looking for an affordable way to use my Audiotechnica headphones on my computer when not using them on my personal music production gear. I just wanted to listen to tunes off my computer using my favorite H-phones.  Unfortunately, as you all know, many laptops lack the \\"umpf\\" to power a pair of H-phones such as the above mentioned. I looked through the various makes and models considering price and feedback and decided on the HA400. With a price of under $20 and 4 input channels to plug in other things such as my computer speakers, I figured, \\"Why Not?\\"  I tested it out as soon as I received it and was not disappointed. There was not just a noticeable difference,.. There was a \\"Mega-Difference\\" in volume output! The volume was so high that I was on the verge of blowing out my external pod speakers. I set both the H-phone and speaker levels at my preferred max on each channel and am now using the computer's volume switch as the main volume adjustment...the rest is history.        THINGS I RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSIDER PRIOR TO BUYING THE HA400!!!     1.  Though the thing is compact (will post pics showing the dimensions), it is not portable in the sense that you can listen to it on a road trip or on a bus headed to work.  It runs soley on a DC 12 volt adapter and not on batteries.       2.  There is no power switch... Be prepared to hook it up to a power strip or buy a cheap foot switch if you want to turn it off using a switch rather than having to unplug it.     3.  You will need to buy proper adapters if you are using anything other than 1/4\\" male plugs. If you want to use 1/8\\" (3.5mm)- standard plug for a portable device such as laptop, then you will need a 1/4\\" (6.3mm) Male to 1/8\\" (3.5mm) Female adapter.      4. You will need an Output / Input cord with one end 1/4\\" (6.3mm) Male to plug between your device and the HA400.  It does not come with one.     5. If you are a hardcore anal-retent about your audio quality, (ie. an audiophile), remember that this is not an EQ.  All it does is split one output into 4 and amplifies the sound and it does it well.      6.  Other posters have experienced some degree of background noise, depending what you pug into it, you may also... As for me, I have yet to experience any discernible background noise.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm happy with the pure sound being amplified.      7.  Remember that this thing was made for headphones and anything else such as hooking up speakers to it is basically \\"Jimmy-rigging\\".  I hooked up speakers and had no problems dispite others having some.     8.  Again, I rate this item with 5 full stars because it was perfect for my needs.  I can see how others may give it a lower rating on the basis that it was not what they expected to fulfill their own needs. As for me, if I could dedicate a song to this unit it would be, THE CARS, \\"You're Just What I Needed\\"...LOL.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I really like the interface. but with no google calendar sync, useless for me...  hopefully future updates will fix this critical feature on kf
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a big solitaire fan. so when this was offered as a free app I decided to give it a try. great game. very responsive and no apparent quirks.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I would never have watched this movie had it not been for the good reviews. I would have thought it to be just another cheap,comuter generated special effects movie. It is a very good movie with a well written script. It has two stories within one. I cannot believe I rented it totally due to reviews. Glad I did. Highly recommend.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Florence and the Machine's \\"Ceremonials\\" is beautifully crafted, emotive and powerful. Basically all the songs in this album are amazing, however if you're looking to download a few of them some of my favorites are:<br />- \\"Only If for a Night\\"<br />- \\"No Light, No Light\\"<br />- \\"Heartlines\\"<br />- \\"Spectrum\\"<br />- \\"Leave my Body\\" &lt;--- (and truly out of this world)<br />- \\"Strangeness and Charm\\"<br /><br />Even my kids (who are 8 and 6) love the album and know the lyrics of a few of the songs and sing them all the time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album and her previous one, \\"Lungs.\\"
0545265355|5.0|I could easily teach sociology with the first book alone.  It is a post-apocolyptic world in which the order of nations has been replaced by one centralized system of governance which has learned, through decades of experience, that the population needs a periodic reminder that rebellion is folly.  It is a world that has grown to embrace the fundamental anthropology of infanticide and has institutionalized it into an annual spectacle of celebration that galvanizes power and control.  It is a world in which the vicarious thrill experienced by soccer moms and dads gets the ultimate adrenaline boost because these kids are playing for keeps.  It's not about what we might become, it is about what we have been all along.  It is also a world into which the most unlikely of children, a girl that easily and skillfully kills for a living is eventually drawn and compelled to decide for whom she willing to  fight and die.
B005VR9328|5.0|Gotta get this out of the way first. The hip-hop purists of the world can't complain about a lack of joints now with The Roots & Common both dropping in December. Don't get me wrong though, this one's not just for the purists... anybody can feel this album. To the music.     Compared to their last album, How I Got Over, this album is slightly darker in feel. It opens up how you would expect a Roots album, a light, calming instrumental, about a minute long. Then the boys just get to work rattling off 9 straight joints, every one of them on point. Just typical Roots, flawless lyricism and production. Features from Big KRIT, Phonte, and plenty of Dice Raw... they all deliver. Track #4, \\"One Time\\", is the standout to me. Questlove & co. created a major head nod type beat for the trio of Phonte, Black Thought, & Dice Raw. Dice raps \\"ni**as learn math just to understand the crack price/then dive in, head first like a jacknife...\\" definitely that raw hip hop, inner-city life concepts.   My one gripe- that had me bitter for a few minutes before I got over it. The album ends with 4 straight symphonic instrumentals, all intertwined, each being about a minute long. Not that they aren't dope- they are. I just didn't expect them to leave Black Thought on the bench down the stretch like that. That makes 5 out of 14 tracks vocal-less, it's all good though. Undun is a smooth and easy listen, it will tie you in and keep you entertained. It will bring you to happiness, and even depress you at points, it all depends on how much you are able to get into the story. Buy the album people; 5/5.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|DVD got here quick..... Couldn't be happier with my purchase and the quality of the product was great! Thank you so much!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I saw that it had bad reviews before I read it.  And I thought to myself it can't be that Bad.  Well, It isn't a bad book.  BUT, it is a very BAD WAY to END a TRILOGY.  It felt rushed and as if there was no story left to tell.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Absolutely wonderful first season of one of the best shows on tv right now. All 22 episodes are quick, subtle, and brilliant. the show's pacing is excellent, inserting bits of drama as needed but never over doing it or withholding the comedy. The set comes with a hilarious 'Kickpuncher' mini comic 'written' by Troy Barnes, and the extra stuff on each disc is great. The outtakes are hilarious, and the cast evaluation bit on the first disc is great as well. There's also commentary on every episode, and based on said commentary, the actors and the entire crew have a real passion for bringing us this great show. Support this show by picking up this set as well as Season 2, and by watching it when it airs. #sixseasonsandamovie
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Super cute!  She definitely has longevity celebrating 35 years, as now this grandmother is buying it for her granddaughter and everything has to be \\"Hello Kitty\\" for her these days.  My goal is to teach her that some toys are special, you play with them on occasion, then put them back on the shelf.  Not everything is suitable for the floor where the dogs could chew it.  Maybe just sleep with her (she is white - too much floor time means lots of laundry time) so we're hoping to teach this principle with this doll for her.  At least you can't rip her clothes off and cut her hair (like her Barbie dolls) so we're hoping to change some habits with this one, but whether she learns or not, she's going to love it for sure.
0553381695|5.0|I pulled the first book, a game of thrones on a whim, when i was heading to the beach and found it enthralling.  These books in general are slow to start, but have much intensity and keep you wanting more.  Great read.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|My ipod touch didn't work very well w/ my ipod dock.  It kept losing wifi signal.  So I wanted to use my Android phone with dock.  Luckily there's this product to solve my problem.  At least for me, the music sounds better and has more power coming out of my phone than i did with my Ipod. Highly recommend.
0312430000|5.0|The Checklist Manifesto was an interesting book. When I first began reading this book, I was thinking \\"what is the big deal about a checklist?\\" Gawande points out that no matter how expert you may be in a subject, well designed checklists can improve any outcome. He used real world examples throughout the book. I appreciated these examples because he highlighted how something as simple as a checklist can improve your success at any task attempted. I started relating simple checklists to my everyday life and it has helped me tremendously.

B005V1WZ10|4.0|a little history lesson agree or not but for early punk listeners clash's first album straight up to the punk point blank  combat rock totally a different sound yet its the clash and nobody disputes it, same goes for korn 17 years ago i saw them at coney island high nyc in front of 11 people and fell in love with there sound, 17 years later can't expect them to do do fagot forever muscians and artist must evolve  i'll admit the last effort was a little dry in sound trying to recapture the early day's to please the narrow minded masses this new album is sooooo sonically awesome it blows you away AND YES IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE KORN i'd recomend it it has more balls than anything they put out since untouchables for kornheadz its refreshing that this band still keeps it hard and dark GOD BLESH KORN. MOFO'S
0321704452|5.0|I give this book two thumbs up. The Naked Presenter actually changed my life. Presenting information to a group of individuals was once really a scary task for me. After I finished this book, I no longer have any problems giving a presentation. This book was straight to the point on what you should do in order to deliver an amazing presentation. It is an easy read. You will not be disappointed.
159562015X|5.0|Bought this book because I was looking for leadership development books. This book really helped me to find my strengths although I do not completely agree with this book. It suggests that instead of working and developing in your weaknesses, to ignore them and focus on your strengths. I don't think this is very applicable to real world use as you will not always be in the position to be able to use your strengths.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I dont care that there are covers on this album.  It's one more collection of Amy's voice that I can enjoy for years.  For those purists who are negatively commenting, so be it.  I choose to collect and enjoy anything Amy.    Merry Christmas to all.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I found that this part of the Deathly Hallows pretty good. Of course there are spots in the movie that I thought that didn't quit coincide with the book. One of the things I found to be lacking is that Harry didn't talk to Dumbledore in that special place as much or at all thru out the movie as he did in the book. After I watched the movie I was thinking that may have been smart on the movies side of this. I don't know, it is just there where parts of the book that would or could be a part of the movie. One thing I thought that I had remembered was that Harry had keep the wand the Snape had taken from Dumbledore, but in the movie Harry destroyed the wand. I would have like to have seen Harry keep the wand as in the book. I am glad that the 19 year after segment was put in. I was afraid the it would not be included. One thing I really liked in the movie was the quick departure of the Malfoy's and if I remember right, the Malfoy's where not in the 19 years later part. It was like the Malfoy's where all \\"We the Malfoy's are certified Witch's and wizards\\". The Malfoy's where shoving it up everybody's behind that they where better than anybody and everybody in Hogwarts. Then they departed with they tails between their legs after Voldemort was Dispatched. A bunch of whimpering fools.

B002WCLG48|2.0|Pretty much what the title says. This movie just couldn't keep me interested. It kind of reminds me of \\"Animatrix\\" even though the stories and animation were wayyyyy better in that movie. But it's sort of the same in comparison that Halo Legends is a series of short stories each of which are animated by someone different. These stories though however are boring and are very cheaply animated. I don't have the disk on me at this moment so I can't get the name to the one story, but it looks like it's terribly done 3d animation, and it's as if they knew it was terrible because they cover the whole sequence with this cloudy effect as if they're trying to mask the poor animation. The end result makes the Playstation 1 graphics look like the movie Avatar. The stories are terrible as well. The origin story of the Halo is so unbelievably far fetched I just couldn't take the rest of the film serious.  I'm rating this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because I picked it up for $3.50 and at that price I guess you can't expect much.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is the best cancelled television show I have ever watched. It may even be the best television show ever!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I retract my previous low review. The problem was with my phone and not the application. Once my phone was reset the application worked as described. My apologies to the developer.  Previous review: It locks up my Galaxy S II. I pressed install and my screen goes black. I tried several times without success.
1451627289|5.0|Great book, wish it would have been longer.  Could make a sequel of what if.  Great story, fast moving.  Typical Stephen King book - leaves you wanting more, more, more.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|The five star rating is for the series, and if you're browsing this page having never seen the show before I highly encourage you to check it out. But if I were to rate the product by itself, I'd drop it down just a tiny bit for a small, but fairly huge, packaging flaw.   This box set does, fortunately, include all the movies associated to the show, which are the original Mini-Series (otherwise known as the 2-part, 3-hour Pilot film, and it's labeled as Season 1, Disc 1), \\"Razor\\", which was released before the premiere of Season 4, and it appears in the Season 4 box as Season 4.0, Disc 1, and finally, \\"The Plan.\\" However, the inclusion of this is very flimsily done and feels like an afterthought. Even though \\"Razor\\" gets its own DVD case, \\"The Plan\\" is lazily shoved in the same DVD case as Season 4.0, Disc 4 (in other words, placed right in the middle of the entirety of Season 4). This isn't a huge problem if you've already watched the show, but this could be an issue for new viewers.  NEW VIEWERS, DO NOT WATCH \\"THE PLAN\\" UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE END OF THE SERIES. Even though \\"The Plan\\" does take place, chronologically, mostly in the earlier parts of the series and is designed to fill in story gaps from the first two seasons, I'm pretty sure there are a couple spoilers mentioned in it that might ruin the end of the series. So if you're confused on the placement of this disc in this set, it's probably best to avoid it until you finish the rest of Season 4.  Despite this design flaw, the set is still perfect. The silver box looks very nice and the individual DVD sets are all great. Word of advice, though: make sure, when you pull out a season box from the set, that you pinch the sides. You'll see what I mean.
0061205699|5.0|I had heard about this book for years.  I saw the movie decades ago and decided to 'give it a try'.  What great characters and insight into life as it was in 1935 in Alabama.  A small portion of the book is about \\"the trial\\".  The rest of it is character-rich, emotional everyday life situations that make it impossible to put the book down.  I highly recommend this book!
1451648537|5.0|I've long been curious about Steve Jobs, wondering how he became such a pioneer in the world of computers and cell phones.  I was surprised to learn that his only contribution was artistic style and presentation.  He didn't know enough about programming or engineering to do any of the actual development/work himself.  Instead, he treated everyone like an a**hole to get what he wanted.  This was a very well written book, very informative.  However, I'll never again think of Steve as anything but an a**hole.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This review is from \\"Sing Along Sound of Music\\" at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. The title song is the source of the infamous \\"like a lark that is learning to pray\\" lyric. Now here is our plot.   Maria, our heroine, is a postulate at a convent in Salzburg, Austria in the late 1930s. Her faith is genuine, but she's really too much of a free spirit to fit into the quiet, orderly ways of the nuns. The Mother Superior sends Maria and her guitar to serve as governess to the seven children of widower Captain Georg von Trapp, late of the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Navy. Maria is appalled at the Captain's cold, militaristic interactions with his children. The Captain wants no singing, laughter or fun in his house as they remind him of his late wife. His children wear uniforms (except when they're dressed formally for their butler-served dinners), march, and respond to coded whistles. The Captain goes to Vienna to see his girlfriend, the elegant Baroness Schrader. While he's away, Maria, quite the hand with her needle stretching her available yardage to fit 7 kids,  makes the children play clothes out of her old curtains. Wearing their green and white, vaguely floral pinafores and lederhosen, they skip through the scenic beauty of Salzburg, picnic, climb trees, row a boat in the lake, and sing, sing, sing. The Captain returns, Baroness in tow, sooner than expected. He is first appalled but slowly delighted at the change Maria has wrought in his family, and is even persuaded to sing \\"Edelweiss\\" accompanying himself on the guitar. By the way \\"Edelweiss\\" is NOT a traditional patriotic song of Austria, but another of the Rodgers & Hammerstein songs composed for the musical. After some shenanigans with the Baroness who is not really fond of children, and a subplot about a telegraph boy named Rolf who is enamored with eldest Von Trapp daughter Leisl but even more enamored of the Nazis, the Captain realizes he is in love with Maria and sends the Baroness packing. Meanwhile, the Captain's friend, Max Detweiler, is plotting to get the Captain to allow his talented family to sing in the Salzburg Folk Festival, and the Nazis annex Austria to Germany and \\"invite\\" the Captain to accept a commission in the German navy. The Captain and Maria marry. Of course the Austrian patriot Captain von Trapp cannot accept the German naval commission. With Max's assistance, the family uses their exit from the stage at the folk festival to escape the Nazis by \\"driving into the mountains\\" and walking over the Alps to neutral Switzerland singing \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain.\\"   The movie takes some rather large liberties with the facts. In real life, Maria went to be a tutor to one of the Captain's children, not governess to all seven. The Captain was a perfectly pleasant fellow. There was no \\"Baroness\\" rival for the Captain's affections. No junior Nazi was romancing Leisl. Maria and the Captain were married for several years before they left Austria. The Trapp Family emigrated not by walking over the mountains to Switzerland with seven children plus luggage (the Swiss border is hundreds of miles from Salzburg), but by catching a train to Italy.   For someone who's been cloistered in a convent, Maria has an awful lot of wisdom about children and family life. The Captain's conversion from bitter widower to loving papa takes place implausibly quickly. The children are all too sweet for words, and most of the songs are so sweet they make your teeth ache. So why five stars?   Appalling sentimentality, I suppose. There's something irresistibly innocent and charming about the proceedings. Sitting in the dark theatre, singing along with hundreds of strangers from age 1 to 99, straight, gay and everything in between, knowing every familiar melody by heart, thinking of my long-dead grandfather who loved this movie after spending his life on the flat midwestern prairies and the dry Arizona desert . . . happy tears poured down my face during every song. How can I NOT give 5 stars?
B005OLF6BI|1.0|She's terrible live, album isn't worth the money. Plus she's not country, so it's annoying how she's classified as country. She's about as country as Kelly Clarkson only WAY less talented. Kelly can at least sing.

1451627289|5.0|I've been a King fan for 30 years and I can honestly say this is one of his all time best.  As usual, I couldn't put it down but not just because I was curious how it ended.  I actually felt what the characters were feeling and I was scared for them too. Takes a lot for me to get that connected to a story, but Stephen did it again.  Just started reading his son's works too.  Joe Hill has some great stuff our there.  Apple/Tree...

0142001104|5.0|Everything is possible.  Everything is invented.  Two phrases that resonate from \\"The Art of Possibility\\".  The authors, Ros and Ben Zander have put together a \\"must read\\" book for all those wishing to see a better world for themselves and others.<br /><br />The book is full of stories from Ben's experience as a world renowned orchestra (e.g. The Boston Philharmonic) conductor and Ros' case histories from psychotherapy.<br /><br />It is indeed an inspiring book.  The authors take us on a journey of possibility, in fact an invitation to join them in a \\"Universe of Possibility\\".  I was particularly impressed with their discussion about assumptions - how we can work with them, and the concept of \\"Giving an A\\" - awarding an \\"&Auml;\\" to people in advance, not as an expectation to live up to, but a possibility to live into.<br /><br />The Zanders take us through a range of other strategies to ignite possibilities, such as \\"Being a contribution\\" (rather than a contributor), \\"Leading from any chair\\" (akin to Hardy's \\"Distributed Leadership\\"), \\"Rule Number 6\\" (You'll need to read the book for this one!) and many more.  All are worthy contributions to the field of leadership development.<br /><br />This is my second reading of \\"The Art of Possibility\\".  The first time I got about half-way through and put it down.  Although the book has been well written and well edited, I found it a little hard-going, particularly in the descriptive sections where paragraphs are sometimes long.  On my second reading, I was transfixed - the messages and stories got to me and I could not put the book down until it was finished.<br /><br />If I had one small criticism it would be with the \\"The Practice\\" sections.  These are where the authors summarise the idea or concept in a way that one can put them into practise.  These sections were evident in early chapters, but seemed to disappear in later ones.<br /><br />This is a book I will recommend to anyone wishing to develop their leadership skills or in fact just became a better person.

B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Music: 5 stars; Packaging: 3.5 stars; Economic Value: 5 stars.<br /><br />I've been a life-long fan of the Smiths (Morrissey is one year older than me, just to give perspective), but for whatever reason I hadd never bought the 4 proper albums. I did have the early-90s \\"Best of I and II\\" compilations and also the \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" collection. But when I saw this collection annnounced, and at what a very competitive price you can buy it here on Amazon, I just knew I had to have it (call it my Christmas present to myself--similar to buying the Beatles set in 2009).<br /><br />\\"Complete\\" brings a LOT of Smiths music but not quite everything that's out there--and that's ok to be honest, I am not that fanatic that I feel let down by it. What amazes me most about listening to these albums is the incredible improvement in the remastered sound quality. It's almost like listening to it for the very first time again, I swear. New for me as well is listening to the songs in the proper album sequences, which also brings a new perspective that I didn't have before. I had \\"Rank\\" on cassette back in the day. Lost the cassette years ago and to relisten to \\"Rank\\" for the first time in probably 15+ years was quite the treat.<br /><br />Even though this release was prepped by the usual-stellar Rhino folks (Rhino UK, to be exact), there are a couple of things that disappointed me in the packaging and presentation of the albums: first, no liner notes to speak of (a flimsy 2 pages). Second, no track-by-track credits as to what song was recorded when and where (which would've been really valuable in particularly on the Louder Than Bombs, Hatful of Hollow, and The World Won't Listen compilations). Third, the albums are reissued in their original vinyl-style format, of course shrunk to CD size. That means that it is literally impossible to read any of the lyrics printed on the album sleeves! Howy cow, didn't anyone think that it might've been a good idea to reprint the lyrics in a separate booklet that would actually be, you know, legible? Packaging aside, the music is stellar, and the economic value likewise.e, you know, legible? Packaging aside, the music is stellar, and the economic value likewise.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Wonderful performance by Adele.  If you are an Adele fan, you will love this combination BluRay disc/ CD.  One word of caution though, she does use the f-word quite a bit on the BluRay disc (it is not used on the CD, althought she does not use it in a nasty way, like many performers do.  In any case, because of this issue,it may not be appropriate for households that have young children.  I will watch the BluRay disc quite a few more times (it is that good) and will listen to the CD in the car.

B005ETA5K2|5.0|This extender has 2 watts power which is the top end for these extenders and gives a very long range.  I picked up WIFI connections from around my neighborhood when previously I could only see my own in my house and my neighbors across the street.  I plan on using it during overseas travels over the next month and it should help me out a lot. Keep up the good work Alpha.
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|Aside from a perfect choice in a lead character Captain America falls very short of what are usually entertaining and enjoyable movies.  This movie takes itself far to seriously and doesn't bother to provide any introduction to the characters and what role they play in the film. Hugo Weaving is exceptional as Red Skull but again he is underutilized.  The movie spends far too much time to get going and when it does the action is disjointed and the characters are poorly developed and less than interesting.  While I am sure the casting of Captain America was a good choice everything about the movie itself was weak.  This is not must see TV.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is the best app that I have downloaded for my Kindle Fire so far. It's fun and very addictive. I highly recommend it. Great job!
B004X80QNG|5.0|I hate seeing an app flamed due to reviewers inability. Someone was mislead by the product description? Learn to read. Says nothing about google tasks. Doesn't work on kindle fire? That doesn't make the app suck. It means your kindle fire sucks.   Runs just fine on my EVO 4G. No problems there. Rate the app, not your own intelligence.

B006G2124E|5.0|I read the book and loved it so much, I didn't want it to end.  Of course the movie can't tell every story from the book or develop every character the way the book does.  The movie would be 4 hours long at least if they did that.<br /><br />However, this is one of the FEW movie adaptations of books that I thoroughly enjoyed.  The actors were perfect and so was the director!  Fabulous movie!!
B003Y5H5AQ|2.0|The Smurfs is a live action / CG movie which squanders its initial promise. We are introduced to the Smurfs as they perform a song number in their village, see Gargamel crash the party and destroy their village... and then inexplicably it takes a left turn as Smurfs escape through a worm hole to modern Manhattan with Gargamel in pursuit. The remainder of the movie becomes a tedious alternating snore of chase scenes and \\"bonding\\" scenes as the Neil Patrick Harris character tries to deal with his uninteresting middle class issues. Which design should he use for an ad campaign? Who cares! Is he 100% comfortable with the baby his wife is due to have? Who cares! This story is so mechanical, so tedious that you could almost have replace the Smurfs for the Hop bunny or Alvin and the Chipmunks or Yogi Bear and it would have made as much sense. It's bland, lazy, a criminal waste of a good franchise and just a waste of time. Perhaps really young kids won't care and the CG is pretty good but it could have been so much better. Rent or avoid.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|I liked Scotty very much on Idol last year but when his CD came out, wasn't sure if I would like an entire CD by him of this genre, though I do like country music.  So I did an Amazon \\"preview\\" of his songs and decided to go ahead and take a chance and ordered it.  Boy, am I glad I did.  It is terrific!!!  I can't wait for his 2nd CD to come out and only hope it is as good as, if not better than, his first CD.  If so, he's got a terrific future ahead of him in the music industry.  GO SCOTTY!!!!!
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|When I read this, I eventually found myself turning pages quickly, and with anticipation.  The story's about a rogue, his past, his surroundings, and his adventures.  He's a grey character, a morally-mixed a tragic hero, and an interesting one to get to know.  He's very far from perfect, which makes him more believable as a hero, and eventually you understand why there's a book about him.  What makes the book stand out creatively, in my opinion, are how the author weaved the complex schemes our rogue would engage in, which are far more than petty pickpocketing.  They're genuinely clever, well thought-out schemes on the part of the rogue and his party.  Additionally, the book jumps backwards and forwards in time, chapter by chapter, in an organized way, ever more tightly weaving Locke's past with his present;  this keeps things moving with anticipation as you learn about him.   This, however, brings me to my first criticism of the book, which is that the introduction to the fantasy world Locke inhabits seems to go on and on, in a static fashion, with weak context.  Proper names of builds, towns, rivers, regions, people, and the list goes on, are  introduced in a suffocating way, sometimes in rapid-fire.  I understand what the author was doing -- he was creating a Lord of the Rings or Dune-like world that opens up to the reader, pumping energy into the fabric of a world which made possible what eventually becomes a story.  Well, it was a noble effort, but he overdid it.  I started sighing myself at the throwaway mini-stories of parts of the town, or the region or what-have-you, the massive name-dropping of capitalized names not quite in English;  at one point I remember looking down at how far I was in the book, on the Kindle I was around 12% in and he was still rapid-firing introducing throwaway proper names of people, events and places.  Things as simple as a single bridge, or some silly festival;  also, little things are unnecessary, like calling doctors 'physikers', an example of a distraction the author accidentally creates as he's showing you his world.  When the story started, and we never bothered re-visiting the vast majority of the proper names he created, things started picking up.  Plot-wise, the book was well done.  My second piece of advice to the writer, and warning perhaps to the reader, is that more could have been done to create separate voices for the different characters.  When you read a true world-class fantasy or sci-fi novel, you can often see a difference in the way the characters talk, not just their accents or choice of ways to express themselves, but also in what they say based on their emotions and personalities.   Unfortunately, I found the characters here very two-dimension in how they spoke.  I got the impression that Locke and many of his compatriots, young and old, would talk in almost exactly the same way.  A lot of creative, if lewd, metaphors, sometimes amusing;  but you can't have half of the characters in the novel talk like medieval George Carlins.  Then there are the aristocrats, which also all have the same two-dimensional voice.  There a couple of interesting evil characters in the book, but overall, the characters don't stand out from one another all that much.  In short:  strong on plot and creativity, weak on character development and balance.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|After hearing \\"Heavy in your Arms\\" from the \\"Eclipse\\" soundtrack, I loved it & wanted more. Being a fellow Brit but living in the US I was surprised I had never heard of Florence before. Then I ordered Lungs expecting more earthy, rip your heart out, dramatic songs, & I was disappointed. But I wasn't willing to give up, then I saw \\"Ceremonials\\" & read the reviews on Amazon. Based on what I read I figured this sounded more like it & I wasn't disappointed. It's certainly not a cd I'm going to get bored with because it's complex & there's a lot going on. She has a beautiful voice & she rocks. I called my review Songs for the soul because the album moves me like \\"Heavy in your arms\\".
B005WZZRD8|5.0|This Lady Gaga collection is perfect, You get the \\"Born this Way\\" 22 track deluxe edition CD, this CD is the edited version just like the solo CD you would buy so there's no difference between the two. You also get the Remixes CD which is awesome and the HBO special of the Monster Ball at Madison Square Garden all put into one packaged collection. I think this is the best value by far. The collection is made of cardboard some people like it some don't, it works for me because I wanted to buy a compilation of Gaga all into one and this is \\"IT\\" I give this product a strong 5 stars because this collection is exactly what I was looking for and the price point is great too. Enjoy!

B004EPZ06Q|5.0|I know this movie has gotten plenty of bad reviews, most for being exactly like the first one. I actually do agree that they pretty much just moved the movie from Vegas to Thailand . But I feel what we did get was one of those \\"stupid\\" movies we just can't help but laugh at.     Also, I've seen some people complain about ultra violet digital copy so I was a bit nervous about mine. When I set it up it worked just fine  and it only took me about 2 minutes set up,     I guess I can see why people wouldn't really like this movie but I disagree, I love it and I will watch my new blu ray over and over just like I did with part 1.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I bought this case long before my Fire even arrived.  It is light, but robust.  The stand works as advertised.  My only complaint is  the felt that covers the inside flap of the screen protector.  While I know that this is best for the screen, when flipped open, it is very unpleasant to touch for very long.  My hand gets clammy.  For protection, this case is perfect, but I often find myself taking the case off to use my Fire for long periods of time.

B00136NYR6|2.0|or BoB should be more expensive, perhaps.  Look, Blonde on Blonde is a double album with all the mythos that implies.  Highway 61 is a single album.  They are both beyond perfect... there are about five Dylan albums which can't be compared with the work of mortals (we all agree about this--the question is which five) and for me, this is one of them.  Nevertheless, you get a lot less TIME with this one.  This album ought to be $6.99 if Blonde on Blonde is $9.99.  Otherwise, I feel like I am being ripped off.<br /><br />I had all the vinyl, all of them, through Knocked out Loaded; I sold all the vinyl and now, if I am going to buy them all again... Basement Tapes for $9.99, of COURSE, but this one for 40 minutes of music... I can live without it.  I even have to live without John Wesley Harding.  Hard Rain for $6.99 was a good deal.

There was nothing I could do to be able to play any Kinect game better than I did before.<br /><br />I have a small living room and the only way I can play is to turn my TV sideways on its stand and then I barely have enough room to play.<br />I figured this would solve that issue. It did not.<br /><br />Kinect works much better without it.<br /><br />Instead I bought felt and cut it to fit the base of my TV and now I can slide it with ease and not scratch my TV stand.<br /><br />Little bit of a Rant, but I was really disappointed with this product.

Layer that combination across the remarkable instrumentation - I'm just awestruck. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

1451627289|5.0|I never have been a Stephen King fan. Horror just isn't my cup of tea, but through the years I watched movies that I loved and to my dismay would discover that it was made from a Stephen King novel. Recently while looking in the Kindle store, I saw \\"11/22/63\\". I was intrigued by the title and read about the novel and as only I can do, I accidentally purchased the book! I laughed at myself, started reading the book and I was hooked! When Kennedy was assassinated I was 9 years old, and I am Texan, so I was interested in how he portrayed Texas and Dallas and I felt his description was truthful and insightful.This was my first read of Stephen King and I could not put my Kindle down! I loved this book! I loved the development and richness of the characters. I loved all the details as he wove the story. I loved it all.  In the end, I judge books on how involved I get in the book and how I feel when I have finished reading. All I can say is, I was captured by Mr. King's storytelling, I could not put the book down, and I felt satisfied when the last page was read. Am I a Stephen King fan? I am not sure, but I can say I was a fan of this book and I view Stephen King in a different light now.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|I got this CD because I had heard Viva La Vida on the radio and enjoyed it. I had thought it was an indicator of the quality of the album. I couldn't have been more wrong. Viva La Vida is the only song on this album that sounds different and sounds fully realized. Everyhting else on the album sounds exactly the same, boring, monotinous, and droning; it almost puts me to sleep. So, don't waste your money on the whole album, download Viva La Vida and be done. You won't miss anything.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Best keyboard I've ever used by far? But it still suffers from certain issues, and the dictionary is very hit or miss. I had better luck with the original version of SwiftKey, but this keyboard is still the best available. Swype could compete if they added a similar word prediction feature. Lastly, SwiftKey seems to get worse over time instead of better. I wish it would learn my way of speaking for more accurate predictions like it is supposed to. It has however made entering my address far easier.

1451648537|3.0|Congratulations to Mr. Isaacson on writing a book of this magnitude. That being said, being an entrepreneur and a professor of entrepreneurship & innovation I feel we missed out on a great opportunity to learn from one of the greatest innovators of all time.   What was missing from the book was getting inside Mr. Jobs head while the whole creative and innovative process was occurring. I felt cheated that there was not more substance and after reading several other reviews so did they.   I think the book is worth the purchase to learn about Jobs and especially his thoughts about IBM, Microsoft, Bill Gates, and business in general. For all of his faults, you have to respect Jobs for doing something that will have a significant impact on mankind rather than the money. His thoughts on the decline of big companies like Microsoft are very insightful and worth the money for the book. By the way this is the last chapter in his own words. The best chapter was saved for last.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pulse is a phenomenal experience of the penultimate Pink Floyd concert.  The first disk visits different musical excursions of their past beginning with a tribute to Syd Barrett (RIP), one of their founders and the creative genius at their start.  Shine On You Crazy Diamond begins with Richard Wright's (RIP) keyboard intro that blends seamlessly into David Gilmour's guitar intro.  Then come four notes of transcendence from David and away we go.<br /><br />Disk two is the first time the Floydians have played Dark Side of The Moon in totality live.  If there has been a greater album, that touches the depth of us all, I have not heard it.  This version is simply one that you must have if you consider yourself a Pink Floyd fan.  Forget all the rivalries, all the mixed up stories and listen to Dark Side as it is meant to be heard.  If your speakers can take it, I'd suggest turning it to 11.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the Charles Dicken's classic written in 1843.  I've seen multiple movie versions, but I haven't actually read the book until this year.  Reading it opened my eyes to a few things that I haven't noticed before and/or don't remember from the movies.<br /><br />While I don't think any spirits will come and visit me in the middle of the night, Dickens' spirits spoke to me in a sense in that it made me stop and think about my attitude this time of year, and what I'm doing to help others.  I knew what to expect as the story unfolded, but it was still a joy to follow Scrooge on his familiar path and to see his literal overnight change!<br /><br />Merry Christmas, and as Tiny Tim would say, \\"God bless us, every one!\\"

Good story.  Also how people can survive if they have to and just use their god given brain.  Also the resources around them.  It tells how a person can be innocent yet look so guilty with everything against them.  It tells how people will use you if you are not careful.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|Gem Spinner 2 is a match three type game with a few interesting twists.  The game allows you to rotate as well as drag and drop entire blocks of gems to find matches.  It also grays out boxes in each cell until such time you move it around enough where you have made a match across every combination in that block, which makes it disappear.<br /><br />From a progression standpoint, the game features a map with sections that you unlock by completing levels in each area.  Each level has an interesting theme (e.g., all blocks in the shape of the Letter \\"L\\", etc.).  Each area also has a final puzzle where you have a limited number of moves to complete it.  Fortunately, that is like a bonus level and you don't have to figure it out to complete that area and move on.<br /><br />I rated it down one star because it doesn't seem like the game offers much replay value once you complete all the sections on the map, although you are welcome to go back into each level and shoot for a perfect score where you remove all the blocks.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I have been the consummate Jethro Tull/Ian Anderson fan since 1971 and I have every cd he or his band has done.  I have this cd several times but had to have the latest cleaned up, 40th anniversary version with the extra cd. This extra cd was worth the price for the added version of My God alone! This  9:40  song is amazing!!!  I was very happy to have all the extra other cuts as well.  The interview with Ian in the liner notes was especially welcome as he is such a private person and  one seldom gets a chance to hear his own words when he isn't singing them.  If you are a Tull fan then this cd is THE ONE to rebuy.  I'm very glad I did.

B005K01VZS|5.0|I'm a long time Mitch Albom fan and this story was no different. This one is based on a true story and covers the time when the author was asked by his rabbi to be the person who delivered his eulogy. Over the time span of about 8 years, the story tells of his interactions with he rabbi as well as a Christian minister, who has been called to set up a church in the inner city.<br /><br />I found his struggles with his own personal faith to be so down to earth and so similar to what many go through today. I really love that it's a human story which shows that not everything in Christianity is \\"easy.\\" It is, however, about believing in something greater than yourself.<br /><br />I plan to share this book with others because I believe the message is one we all need to hear.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The world watched as the Jaycee Dugard story unfolded. I can't imagine there wasn't a person who saw this story who wasn't filled with horror that something like this could actually happen to someone. When the book came out, I wasn't sure I could read it all the way through, but I wanted to understand more of her story.<br /><br />The story is a heart-wrenching account of what happened with this young girl and the time she spent before she was found and returned to her family. In that process, she also has a child, becomes totally dependent on her captor, and yet emerges having found her life again.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, the author shares this:<br /><br />\\"In the summer of 1991 I was a normal kid. I did normal things. I had friends and a mother who loved me. I was just like you. Until the day my life was stolen.<br /><br />For eighteen years I was a prisoner. I was an object for someone to use and abuse.<br /><br />For eighteen years I was not allowed to speak my own name. I became a mother and was forced to be a sister. For eighteen years I survived an impossible situation.<br /><br />On August 26, 2009, I took my name back. My name is Jaycee Lee Dugard. I don't think of myself as a victim. I survived.<br /><br />A Stolen Life is my story--in my own words, in my own way, exactly as I remember it.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, it is told in her own words, through her writing and through sharing of pages out of the journal she kept while she was captive. Some of it is graphic and tough to read through.<br /><br />What emerges, however, is the story of just what she says, a survivor. Someone who survived something terrible in her life and came out of it ready to rebuild a new life. I cannot imagine the things she went through. I'm glad I chose to read this one and am glad she chose to tell her story. She is a courageous woman indeed.
B005URRCUY|2.0|I was really looking forward to a new album.  Brothers was ok, missing some of the harsh tones that make the Black Keys a refreshingly simple, unrefined band in the current music era.  This album was flat disappointing.  It's brief (only 40 minutes), has melodic backup vocals (what the?) and just doesn't drip with blues.  I'm glad to see the band is successful, but this is going to turn off those who still prefer the \\"my soul has been repeatedly crushed\\" sound that comes out of Thickfreakness, The Big Come Up and Magic Potion. It's radio friendly, so be prepared to hear songs being overplayed on the radio (great).

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|i always thought batman returns was alot darker with devito's portrayal of the penguin, but once i saw this movie, i was just non stop thinking to myself what a flawless movie this was. simply put, the best comic movie ever made. heath as the joker.....wooww. i always thought jack's joker from thim burtons version was great for that era in the 80's. but heaths version fits just right withn todays world dealing with terrorists and madness in a grand scale. two-face was brilliantly done. if only chri noland would direct all the comic movies, because this director really knows how to capture the comic well.
B005N95JA4|5.0|From the minute you play \\"Some Girls\\" deluxe edition, experienced listeners should be able to tell a huge difference in the new version compared to the original \\"mud\\" mix.  Crank it!....anyone with an ear for rock will realize that the guitars and drums are mixed to where they should have been on the original recording. The interplay between Keith and Ron are right there.  Guitars to the face!!!! Which is where they should have been to begin with.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|So my 18 year old daughter massaged me that I could pre-order Michael Bubles new Christmas CD so I automatically went right to Amazon to do so, and boy I am not disappointed!! I especially like that he brings in a few other singers to harmonize with him. Dreamy is how I would describe this. No doubt to be a classic.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I downloaded this to just give it a try, and I am pleasantly surprised by its complete customizability. There are options for everything! I'm still figuring out how out works.  I don't have a huge task list,  but for those that do this app will truly help you stay organized efficiently.
078324228X|4.0|The film Hurricane will show how certain people can fall prey to the legal system in the United States no matter how famous they are. Hurricane explores how innocent people can find themselves in American prisons, or even executed, because of hateful law enforcement and complacent district attorney offices. Hurricane also exposes one of the most important lessons for African men in America. That lesson is that when we (black men) find ourselves in unjust situations only other ethnic groups are allowed by the system to free us. Everyone should watch Hurricane because it will remind them of the other America where people do not dream, but have plenty of might mares brought on by life at the bottom of the society.

1433523930|5.0|This Bible will make a perfect gift for seniors. The cover is of soft smooth leather that exudes high quality construction. It is not overly large and can easily be transported in a brief case. The paper is of high quality bond and the font of the main text is large enough to be read without glasses for someone with mild visual impairment. The paper is so thin that the bible appear more compact than one would expect from a study Bible and yet there is no bleed through to opposite pages as is often the case with thin paper prints. Binding is sewed in for extra durability.  The pages are setup in such a way that the main text is in a single column with concordance on either right or left margin while the study notes are set in double column beneath the main text. This is really a thoughtful layout as every pertinent study aid is immediately available without any need to flip back and forth to find information. There are numerous colorful maps and diagrams to illustrate key landmarks. Included page marker is nice.  Even though this is not a red letter edition (words of Jesus are in black) it is nevertheless a masterfully crafted piece of religious literature that deserves to be in the library of every devout Christian.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works perfect on my Kindle Fire. Also have it installed on my other tablets too. Always accurate and its forecasts are right on the money.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Doesn't sync with Google calendar or Outlook. In fact, it ONLY syncs tasks, making it pretty much useless unless the device you install it on is your only scheduling and tasking device (which isn't most people). That said, the iPad/iPhone version of PI works quite well, with full sync to Outlook and Google.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is the first of four series and is rich with detail and vivid characterizations. The drama of Henry VIII's wooing of Anne Boleyn is fraught with sexual tension, and vividly shows Henry's spite for Catherine of Aragon.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|free app of the day - amazing features. worth even to pay for. gotta try it on my tablet sometime.
0307454541|4.0|The book has a slow start, but quickly becomes a page-turner. Salander and Blomkvist, while superficially very different from each other, are surprisingly compatible, both as a mystery solving team and as friends. The ending was unsettling in some ways, but satisfying in others. I immediately reached for the sequel upon finishing the last chapter. The original Swedish movie version of Dragon Tattoo is great and stays true to the novel. But as with most films adapted from books, the movie must leave out details and story-lines, so read the novel.
0307891402|5.0|This thing is awesome! i got this the day it came out and still have baerly skimmed the surface of the game. Its super handy for the info and stats. For example if you need to go mine iron ore then you just find the page about mining and it will give you the top 5 places where its commonly found. Super easy to use and great beastiary as well. Must get for anyone wanting to really play the game and have as a reference if needed.

0062012339|5.0|Was really happy to receive my copy of the anniversary edition yesterday from Amazon.  This is one of my all-time favorite books and I highly recommend it.  I'm looking forward to reading through this book again.  I won't repeat any of the summaries or reviews from below, I just wanted to give my opinion of the anniversary edition.  It looks awesome, and comes in a great case that is perfect for display on a bookshelf.  The book is hardcover, and looks awesome.  The content, as always is spot on.  Neil Strauss is one of the most gifted writers of our generation.  You almost feel as if you are there with the band through every step of the story.  Highly recommend picking this up, the anniversary edition was well worth the money I spent!
B004X80QNG|4.0|I've looked at this several times and today it was the free app.  What a wonderful, simple to use and powerful app this is!  You can customize which I have yet to do since I just downloaded this morning. But after several minutes of tinkering I see a very powerful tool and it syncs with Google Tasks AS part of the program...now that makes it a MUST HAVE.  My rating of 4 stars will most certainly become a 5 star as soon as we have a Widget!!  Great job to the developers of this app! Keep up the good work!!
0307276902|5.0|While I realize this book may not exactly be completely non-fiction but the story it tells is amazing.  There were points where I was squirming in my chair.  Clenching as if I was really there.  The author imagery really paints a picture and allows you to feel that you were really there.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone.
0321704452|5.0|This book really opened my eyes on how I need to present to an audience. One of the main points was connecting with your audience. Basically, going natural or naked (not literllay)in your presentation by being yourself and not coming across as this stiff, cold and sometimes unprepared presentator. When presentating, you need to interact with your audience by removing any barriers, such as shortening the distance between yourself and the audience and lecterns.   In general, less is more and never go over your time when presenting.
0061998494|4.0|I love Craig Ferguson and decided to buy this book after watching him multiple times on YouTube at the White House Correspondents Dinner....and many clips from the Late Late Show.  The book is hysterical.  I'm NOT entirely sure that I understand the point, but I thorougly enjoyed it.  I couldn't help but read it with Craig's Scottish accent...it made it even funnier or possibly made me slow down to catch some of the humor.  It seems like there is a lot also unsaid! I appreciate his honestly about his alcoholism and his use of drugs.  It's sometimes almost too cavalier, but that's probably the point.

1451648537|5.0|This Book is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G . I have no other words to describe it. I'm a serious and dedicated apple fan and I'm grateful there is such a book like this one. I wanted to meet Jobs and this is as close as I will ever get to knowing him. Some of the stories in here are surprising but they provide great insight into Steve Jobs the Man.   Its very well written and as I read it I don't want to stop. He's done a good job of balancing Jobs views and other peoples views and contrasting those opinions. Overall its a great book if you want to know about jobs from start to finish. Definitely worth the read and I fully recommend it.
B004X80QNG|4.0|downloaded to my tablet and phone.both android.enjoying it so far and hoping for a few tweaks to get it to perfection.so far so good.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|The product is good, the film itself is magnificent.  There are 2 big cons:  1. There is always a piracy warning at the beginning you cannot skip, which tell you you will sent 2 federal prison if you copy bla bla bla...  2.I paid the seller high shipping cost and he just use the most cheap USPS and dispose it in front of our building ladder, I was lucky there was no one trample it.

B0044RUSZM|3.0|PROS:  - Great height.  - Nice minimal design.  - Good grip so far.  CONS:  - Not a very sturdy stand, but not too bad. The two aluminum pieces just slide into the plastic base, without any locking mechanism.   - The clear plastic part on the bottom can be annoying at times do to it reflecting.  - The end clips are plastic and not part of the aluminum, which makes me feel like my laptop isn't as secure on the stand.
1451648537|4.0|The content of this book was as I expected after reading reviews numerous reviews but what was unexpected was my reaction to Steve Jobs , the character.  I shifted from admiration to disgust throughout the book, but never lost interest or fascination.  A thoroughly engaging read I could not put down until finished.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|I picked this up for 9.99 on sale. That's less than 50 cents and episode. Compare that to the streaming and digital media prices and it is definitely a great value. Plus, you can actually watch the DVDs on your television!
1451648537|5.0|I found this book to be totally engaging.  Jobs' quirky personality drew me in and kept me coming back until the tale was completely told.  Walter Isaacson enjoyed ridiculous access (for Jobs) and that is highly obvious as you work your way through five decades of his extraordinary life.<br /><br />But it is not an easy story.  As a business guy, I understand the toughness required for success.  Relationships fray and lives change and people who you trust turn out to be, well, untrustworthy.  Those all go with the territory and Steve Jobs enjoyed enough business success to see them all.<br /><br />What I didn't expect and found terribly distressing was his meanness.  There's no real effort to hide it from anyone.  Our man Jobs, folk legend, business hero, creative genius, had an ugly dark streak, and it is openly acknowledged here by colleagues, employees, family members, and - ultimately - even Jobs himself.  \\"It's just the way I am,\\" he's quoted as saying.<br /><br />It's incomprehensible to me that anyone behaves this badly on purpose.  Artists often struggle with demons, of course, but that doesn't seem the case with Jobs.  Truthfully, he didn't seem to struggle with it at all; he simply chose to bully and scream and treat people badly.  He denied paternity for a daughter that was clearly his, and generally misbehaved towards nearly everyone in his life. And he seemed to do so without much remorse.  That's tough for me to understand!<br /><br />The book carefully records these episodes and, later, people's reflection that he drove them further than they ever imagined.  Okay, I get that.  But I get it in the same way that a talented athlete acknowledges an abusive coach; was that really the only way to motivate a gifted player?  What might they have accomplished with genuine encouragement and support?<br /><br />That's just part of the story, though. Jobs had laser focus and an extreme talent for product design. The book documents his near-total devotion to perfection and his impeccable taste.  His expert eye guided development of massively successful consumer electronics, and guided Apple on and off for thirty years. By all accounts, he was a remarkable talent and this book offers a revealing glimpse at his genius.  There is much to be admired and it is clear that millions worldwide shared that admiration.<br /><br />His family surely loved him and you come away with tremendous respect for his wife and children. Even in the best of times, and there were plenty of those, Jobs was a complex personality.  His weird eating habits and disorders played a dominant role in both his family and social life.  He could take weeks or months to choose simple furniture or appliances.  He refused to put license plates on his car and routinely parked in handicapped places.  What an unusual guy for a spouse or parent!<br /><br />Jobs could be charming and charismatic when it suited his purposes. But that just accelerates my angst.  Steve Jobs now strikes me as a supreme narcissist, gifted in the black arts of manipulation. He accomplished some wonderful things, but his story left me feeling sad.  As much as I admire him, I don't think I could have ever liked him.ided development of massively successful consumer electronics, and guided Apple on and off for thirty years.

B004GE81CK|5.0|The Brothers Gibb first international album is a masterpiece of songwriting, singing and production. Squeezed in the time zone of British Pop Groups ala the Beatles, they had small chance of doing well, considering they had the same vocal harmonies that the Beatles had (although they started them earlier than the Beatles in Manchester, England). Other than that, this set contains classic, everlasting songs that continue to be covered by other artists. Nearly EVERY song has been sung by another artist and \\"To Love Somebody\\" has been covered more than 250 times, according to Rolling Stone. Not a small achievement, by any mean, by three teenagers! Hats off to the three teen brothers who took the current technology of the time and survived, despite the georgeous Beatles, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" of 1967. What a start!<br /><br />Footnote: 1980's Bee Gees technical engineer, Scott Glasel mentioned to me that whenever he feels a need for inspiration, he puts on Bee Gees First.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|Heh. Least you can see 'em coming at Rolling Stone.  And you can immediately dismiss anybody who characterizes III as \\"confusingly named\\" - thems what don't get the joke likely won't get the album. Not to discount anyone who digs the party atmosphere or the slightly more varied nature of the hard rockers on the first album, but by any measure of cohesion and commitment among the musicians, this album simply blows the first out of the water - and for my money, a whole lotta 2nd-gen Van Halen, too.  Here's the thing that struck me: I started rattling my usual lyrical litany with Hagar in spite of myself - about how he immediately squandered a great payoff line in \\"Different Devil\\" and capped it off with a too-facile \\"lovers under covers\\" rhyme, and then here's this same old \\"up-in-the-morning-late-in-the-evening\\" off-the-cuff-scat on \\"Bigfoot\\", alrightalrightalrightalrightalrightalright, \\"last-temptation-b---h\\" (really?), and...  and...  Holy crap, that's just about it! Whoever said the lyrics don't get in the way this time was SPOT-ON. And before anyone lamely attempts to seize this premise and shove it down some high-friction slope of \\"listening for the lyrics\\", just go pound it sideways, alright? All I'm asking for are verses that aren't so frackin' inept they derail my headbanging.  Hagar's as blunt a verbal instrument as ever, but damned if that don't actually WORK most of the time for III. The whole notion of \\"cheese\\" is pretty elastic from one listener to the next; as I define it, it has to do with the eye-rolling excess that often comes as a singer aims all trite and hackneyed for some high concept, reaching sadly beyond his lyrical grasp - and if it all happens in a lush and sappy bed of keyboards, so much the worse.  Which is why I'm flying to a pretty emphatic defense of \\"Come Closer\\". Ain' no Hallmark-card mush or alien-talk on this one. It's a very simple and naked display of soul, vulnerability, and longing, right in line with Motown soul classics, rightin Ol' Red's verbal wheelhouse, and SO MUCH MORE charismatic as a result. Now that we see Hagar did the lyrics first and Satriani composed such a clean and spare piece around it, it comes a little clearer why Hagar's solo work is often a little less fragrant with the fromage - I have to wonder if that wasn't the key development here. Far as yr. obt. svt. is concerned, Hagar and Present Company have finally HIT the aesthetic target he's been aiming for all these years, in a way he never could manage with all Van Halen's \\"Why Can't This Be When It's Love Comes Walking In\\" pap. My hat's off on this one.  And yeah, \\"3½ Letters\\" works for me too. It's a tricky concept and were it done exactly the way Hagar conceived it, there might have been trouble - but Satriani came up with just the bluesy sinew needed to hold that piece together. From there, my friend, I guess it depends on how you personally are feeling the zeitgeist. I got people close to me who are affected and NEED A DAMN JOB, so I'm fine with the concept, fine with Smith's studio-shattering cannonade, and especially fine with the rage Hagar bites down on his last word.  While we're all zeitgeisty, \\"No Change\\" is a nice little slice of atmospheric angst with a tasty little doomsday melody. Speaking of those more straight-ahead rockers, yeah, I'd say there's a little less variation among 'em because CF invested the experimentation where it really counted this time. Don't mean you don't find funk and drop-kick beats and spooky-fingertip-interaction and background vocals beaming like you've never heard `em before. \\"Last Temptation\\" has progressions right as rain, \\"Dubai Blues\\" grooves like Freud's worst nightmare and a riot to boot, and here's a word to the wise about \\"Lighten Up\\": a bad day at the office, 400 or more horsepower underfoot, and this tune are an instant recipe for a second mortgage to your insurance carrier.  And then there's \\"Something Going Wrong\\", which might just be the best of everything rolledinto one. The net effect of Satriani's atmosphere, Hagar's vocal and lyrical pensiveness, Smith's minimalism and Anthony's top vocal support in forever render this track just exactly as Satch and Ol' Red characterize it: spooky. If this one catches you in just the right space, the hairs of your nape will stand straight up - you can take that to the bank.  That's what we have here that wasn't quite cooked on the first album: a clean balance between riffs visible from the surface of Mars and honest emotional impact, often in the same beat.   Ze top four pour moi, ascending: \\"No Change\\", \\"Come Closer\\", \\"Lighten Up\\", and \\"Something's Going Wrong\\".  And as we continue waiting for Van Godot, I'll still gladly take the rest, thanks.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|This summer in late June, me and my girl Waiting for a Girl Like You moved to Bainbridge Island near Seattle, Washington, our 2nd favorite place. On the way to Ocean Shores, Washington, we stopped at a gas station that had an espresso place right next to it called Pony Expresso near the better Napa Valley in Washington State, north of Portland, Oregon right after Waiting for a Girl Like You got a new Washington car, a 2002 Chevrolet Corvette red color that would be like her great Joe Satriani Strange Beautiful Music car in Washington as it made me think in Abnerdeen that it was the Jack in the Box cuz they did a terrible mistake for changing their fries in 2004. It is my Expresso Love, Waiting for a Girl Like You got the sun in the daytime never perfume in the dusk, and she came out in the nighttime with a little favorite song of me, Waiting for a Girl Like You. She did not smell like a rose and I kissed at her like a Georgia peach, she got me walking where the ocean goes I did anything lovely and sweet to reach her. She was made in heaven, heaven's not in my world. It's just Expresso Love. She's my lover, she's a best friend of mine.

The bands signature sound coming from such a variety of cultures, combined with Carlos Santana's miraculous guitar playing, they achieve near Rock perfection in this, and their next few albums.  This is a classic five-star album.<br /><br />There are three ways to but the album on CD (as of 2011):<br /><br />First, there is the traditional album on CD with it 9 great songs.<br /><br />Second, there is the single CD with three bonus tracks (all of which are from the Woodstock Festival of 1969).<br /><br />Third, there is the double CD set called \\"Santana: The Woodstock Experience\\" which has the complete debut \\"Santana\\" album included plus another CD of Santana's complete performance at the Woodstock Festival of 1969.<br /><br />In whichever way you chose to buy this album, you will be getting a Great one.

B000002IAS|5.0|Delaney & Bonnie On Tour With Eric Clapton [Live]: This is a great album but a very short album.  This single CD is the Famine.  Rhino Records has a limited 4 CD Box set with four complete concerts (which includes everything on the traditional single album) but has many repeated songs (not repeated performances).  That Box set in the Feast.  I hope that there will someday be a proper expanded single (or double) CD that will give us a proper diet of this great live tour, but, until then, I would definitely go for the Feast.  If you choose to look into the 4 CD box, go directly to Rhino Records as it is less expensive that way - while this limited box set still exists.  As of December of 2011 there are still some 350 sets left.  If you are reading this well after that date, the new box sets may already be gone and it will probably be far too expensive to buy it used and rare (sorry).  If you have to settle for the original single CD version of this album, you won't be disappointed...you'll just be craving a longer version (bugging Atco/Atlantic directly for a longer version couldn't hurt).
B000002GYR|5.0|A very good friend of mine, who is much older than I am, turned me on to Tom Waits, and even though we have parted ways, Waits still resonates inside my heart always. I have 15 of his 22(23?) albums and I can't get enough of his scratchy old voice. His first album (Closing Time) I like the most because his voice was still young...if you listen in chronological order from Closing Time all the way down to Bad As Me, you can hear his voice age and get more feeling to it. Tom Waits has the greatest blues sound for a boy who grew up in SoCal as any other white boy I have ever heard (:)) and I plan on listening to him for years to come.
B003EYVXT6|1.0|The sex scene with the freak pretty much ruined it for me.  Nevermind that it's a crap movie to begin with.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works, it's fun, you can select winning deal where you have a good chance of winning. And no ads!!!  What else can I say.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Stereotype! get it? HA... anyways, ive had a few pairs of sony's before and they're had great sound quality but always a horrible connection. I don't understand why this is always the case, because you feel like they'd want to keep a good rep, but nope. It makes me kind of cautious about getting more expensive sony headphones because if the connection is bad then its basically an automatic no because it is quite an important part of the headphone. Anyways, if you cant afford skullcandys or dont want the philips behind the neck ones, go for these, they're fine, and i will use them (extremely light and small).  Buy at your own risk
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|I rented this for a dollar and paid too much.   The first five minutes was obnoxiously bad, so much so that I didn't watch anything else. It is characteristically stupid, cliche, and silly.   1. The film begins with an unnecessarily long explanation of the fact that this is a strange land with strange creatures that never existed. I mean, it really gets into some pretty useless exposition. All about great warlocks and demon masks, and ultimate black magic powers, etc. etc. Yeah, we got it. It's a Conan movie. We knew that when we saw the ad. Jeezis. The original wisely skipped all this, and instead gave us the abridged version, and then went straight into title and credits with a sword being hammered. That sequence tells you all you need to know. The rest can work itself out. What's the function of five full minutes of fake history? Is there going to be a test on the BS that never happened? It might still be tolerable, but is so poorly handled and poorly told. It just bores.   2. We finally open on an action scene, some big battle with barbarians. A pregnant warrior woman is stabbed in the gut. Let me repeat that: A PREGNANT WARRIOR WOMAN IS STABBED IN THE GUT. WTF? And, a full nine months pregnant, too. This is absurd. It's insultingly absurd. Then, not only is a 9-months-pregnant woman FIGHTING IN A WAR, but once she is stabbed, her husband runs to her side and they are given all the time in the world to share last loving words while the husband delivers the baby. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE. Apparently the enemy took a time out so they could have family time. Then, once the baby is born and the woman names her son, Conan of course, as her last dying act, the father holds the baby high into the air and gives his warrior battle cry. That was the final suck.   This was shockingly bad.   Bad.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game and the challenge it gives me.  I just wish that after you get a hint you had the ability to redo the game again right away.
B004X80QNG|3.0|Really,  a calendar app requires a widget. Seems to work/sync fine on my mytouch4g.  But I won't be using it until a widget is released. Three Stars because it works as described.
0321704452|5.0|This book will show you how to give presentations that are stellar!! You will learn how to capture your audience and keep them while you give your presentation.
0451147367|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend. I had been looking for this in bookstores and found out it was no longer published as a single book but as four separate books. He loves it and started reading it as soon as I gave it to him although he had 3 other books at home he was waiting to read!   The condition of the book was as described. It was sent within a few days and I would definitelybuy from this seller again!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Given the price point of this wireless headset, I feel these are a really good deal.  I like the quality of sound and user features available with them.  There can be some occasional static popping which may be from RF interference from other wireless devices that I use such as the router and dsl modem.  I minimized that problem by moving the various devices about 2 feet apart.
B00457WZEI|4.0|Interesting book. About a horses experiences during World War I.   A horse named Joey who finds himself in the midst of the Great War.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Not sure why others having sync issues...I installed and immediately saw my calendars All 5 of them.  Works great although only spent about 15 minutes so far but really really like the various layouts with a calendar view with list of events below it.  Keep up the good work
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|you cant use this with ordinary headsets because they wont fit but i bought the plantronics voyager at radio shack cuase is was on clearence to make way for the voyager pro plus, so i love the fact that i can just wear this case on my belt with my phone and listen to my music with easy access to the phone if i need to make a call or have a call coming in.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I ordered The big bang theory for my mom's christmas since she loves the show so much, I ordered it and it seemed like as soon as I hit the order button it was on my door step. Fast shipping + wonderful show = Fabulious christmas thanks!
B004NIUUNC|5.0|life changing principles. it is even better if you buy the cd and listen to it every other week or so. you wont regret. one thing is for sure if you are not serious about changing your way of thinking and ultimately your life please save yourself some money and dont buy it, keep on watching nbc news/the biggest looser/donald trump.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I thought The Wire was probably the best set of television entertainment this side of the cable divide, but this series just may top it. Exquisite.
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|why should I have to enter a cc # if this app is free (for the time)? Seems fishy. I would love to try it without giving away my credit card.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I was expecting a good movie after reading a few of these reviews.  Not so.  This was sour from the beginning.  Poorly written, mediocre acting, confused direction, and wildly edited.  Nothing seems to have worked except some special effects (CGI).  It looks more like a patchwork than a main stream production.  Many big guns does not a good movie make.  Those big guns lost control and ended up with a \\"B\\" movie at best.  Rather disappointing.  This crew might benefit from someone like Joss Whedon (Firefly - Serenity).  He knows how to make a Western/SciFi.
B00689J512|5.0|this cd is  amazing. i was skeptical about buying rihannas music like rockstar album too out  this cd sounds so real and personal hint hint chris brown.   my absolate favorite would have to be *do ya thang**you the one**farewell *** cockiness** birthday cake**we all**roc me out**   heck all the songs are good its very hard to choose just one as a favorite. rihanna has grown a lot from compared to when she first became famous. i like her new look and i think she loks pretty still in the album cover even though her her mouth is open she still looks pretty like she always is  im so glad i bought this album it has to be one of her best. if you dont listen to this whole album but u give it a 1 star that is stupid. listen first to the WHOLE ALBUM before you judge  rihanna has diff ranges in her voice from low to high to medium etc this girl is so beautiful and talented and a real great artist mad props
0307279189|4.0|This is an interesting story with a colorful cast of runners and race organizers.  If you are a runner you will find this book a good read and a motovator for your training.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is like a high end wheather ticker.  it has all the basic stuff in a very friendly ui.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I enjoy this movie; it's great to watch in high definition (I watched the Blu-ray, not the DVD) because of the wonderful special effects. The Blu-ray video transfer is beautiful and the audio is breathtakingly theater-like.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I expected other Lanterns to get more involved, but that's okay. There is a little more \\"the ring chose me for a reason\\" than I feel comfortable with, but that's okay too. It's typical comic fare, and I enjoyed just about every minute of it. I'm willing to watch it again soon.
0061537969|5.0|I purchased this book for my son and daughter-in-law who just lost their dog of 17 years.  The book was recommended by numerous friends,
B006H063MG|5.0|Now that we have a show that is not oozing unrequited love every instant, i am back to enjoying BONES.  The humor is still intact and we still open every episode with an over the top corpse which no longer has integral flesh (filling the requirement for BONES). This time the Bones are found in the PO's dead letter office. The team has to take it from there. Brennan is still pregnant with Booth's baby and they still have issues, just not the same ones. I also am enjoying Hodgens and Sweets pretty much this season.  Sweets as the FBI shrink has really come into his own this season. He adds something to every investigation. And Hodgens just loves the muck of this job, which is pretty hilarious.  He is either falling in love with some snake and making a home for it or trying out the newest gadget to extract a bone the best. For the future, I think the way to go is to increase Sweets' role even more as the most engaging and freshest character the show has for the future.
B001G60FTI|5.0|I loved this book.  It opens your thinking on why we make certain determinations and how.  It explains to some degree our feelings of intuition.  It was a great read.  Once I started I could not put it down.  Like all well writen books it has a dark side.  The interested reader has to choose between good and evil in its application.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble sings the classics with heart and soul and the spirit of the Holidays!!    Is he channeling the greats of old, or is he himself one of those RARE gems born in the wrong era?    True, some of the songs can be quite mellow, but his great voice surely makes up for it!    FIVE STARS!  Excellent!!
B004X80QNG|1.0|Disappointing that this does not sync with Google Calendar. As a Fire and Android user, I've been looking for a good free calendar for the Fire, and had hoped this would be it. Unfortunately, it's not.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I really wanted and needed a calander / to do / reminder type program for my Fire.  Works great.  Thanks for the gift Amazon.
0439023483|3.0|Collins paints a nice picture of a desolate world, but there's about there things ended for me.  I was not a fan of the whole premise of the book. I really don't want to say much without stating spoilers.  People have told me you must read the other books to understand. Why? Why do I need to read the next books in the series to understand the first?  That doesn't make sense.<br /><br />There were some good highlights in the book, I mean some parts where I could not put it down at night to see where it was going.  I guess I was just looking for more.  Some parts of the book felt very amateurish, which was a turn off.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This Harry Potter movie set is perfect for the casual fan that just wants to watch the movies and nothing more. It does have some deleted scenes and perfect as a gift. I bought mine as soon as I heard of it. Me being a heavy Potter fan but not interested in watching the extras, just for watching the movies that made my childhood it was perfect. *Sorting Hat Voice* 5 STARS
087033039X|5.0|I was wanting to learn how to do leather braiding over wooden handles and such, so I started looking around for leather braiding books ..I kept hearing good things about this book, and it seemed to have a high star rating, so I purchased it.  It is a very good book to learn leather braiding from.  Many different kinds of braids are explained and the instructions are pretty good.  I also really liked the section that shows how to do various Turkshead knots.  I was able to learn many of the round braids that I was interested in learning, so I'd say that buying this book was a good decision!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael is back.  This music was long awaited and it was worth it.  This CD is so good I bought a second one for a friend.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|Even though most of MJ's music is great, this cd is pretty good. There are other hits that should have been included. \\"Essentials\\" is a much better representation of his greatest.
B004X80QNG|5.0|This is by far the best all-in-one calendar/task manager on have tried.  And I've tried them all. So many settings you can set it up to &quot;think&quot; the way you do. LOVE IT!!!
B002ZG97LK|3.0|i hate remakes.they always destroy the original.it is like hollywood has became so lame,they cant make up anymore good movies so they got to remake a good movie.from the previews,it looked like it was going to stay close to the original.and sadly,they did.too close.  i went in with a open mind that it is not 1984 anymore.but they left 1984 stuff in there.for starters,the volkswagon beetle.hello,it is 2011.you mean you could not throw a 1993 mustang in there a 1987 camero?  i was surprised they kept the quiet riot classic \\"bang your head\\" in the movie.but not the part you remember.wren gets pulled over after fixing the car up and taking it for a test drive.  music was not that great.mostly country.they killed the original soundtrack.they got \\"holding out for a hero\\" as a ballad.wtf?and it was not in the chicken race scene either.that was replaced by kids(wren racing chuck and his friends) with school buses.  one of my favorite scenes was the warehouse scene in the original.once again,another mess up.wren pulls into the warehouse and when he is having the flashbacks,he is arguing with himself.he is saying what he would say if he was face to face with them.plus that was the most dumbest dancing i have ever seen in my life.like he was just goofing off.  ariel boyfriend chuck was not as good as the original.honestly,you forget about him till he pops in.i think you seen him 3 times  i dont want to ruin the rest of the movie.but the thing that bothered me the most was they took parts and replaced them.wren's uncle is on wren's side of things.you notice parts are here instead of there.overall,the same lines.just not where you expect them.and the fight scene at the end was really lame.and the actors always had a happy face on thru the whole movie.kinda like \\"look at me.i am on camera\\" look.like they didnt take the movie serious enough.  here is my thing.if you dont want to stick close to the original,then fine.update it.new car,new lines,new music.but if all your going to dois cover songs,keep the same lines,same cars,and rearrange a few things,then just leave it alone  overall,a okay movie.i will say it had its moments and did a good job in sticking with the original.but if your like me,seen this movie millions of times(my dad wore the original out) and get bugged my misplaced things,then dont waste your time.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|On learning that the series 1.5 was only 6 episodes was disappointing, this prequal is exciting and explosive and also ties up a few details that were of interest from series 1 and explains quite a lot.  Cleverly done (not just as a stop gap) a definite to see if you were in to Spartacus Blood and Sand. It's just a shame we have to wait for series #2!!!!
B0002O06NA|5.0|This sounds unreal on Vinyl... Black Keys was meant to be heard this way. I suggest anyone who owns a record player to do themselves the favor and purchase a Black Keys album on LP.  Great!!
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I've been in love with Chad Kroeger's sexy growly voice since The State and it just gets better with each album.  Here and Now is more of the same Nickelback formula but the songs are even better than on previous albums with a nice even mix:  -3 naughty girl songs for the boys. (Midnight Queen, Gotta Get Me Some, Everything I Wanna Do)  -3 love songs/ballads for the ladies. (Trying Not To Love You, Holding on to Heaven, Don't Ever Let It End)  -1 frat boy drinking song (Bottoms Up)  -2 introspective songs (When We Stand Together, Lullaby)  -2 songs without sex, love or alcohol. (This Means War, Kiss it Goodbye)  I'm sure most if not all will get radio play. Not a bad song in the bunch. Good solid rock and roll. Best so far-5 stars!
0142429112|3.0|The world of creatures created in this book was quite intricate. I loved the detail in history and development that each of the three paranormals species had: vampire, witch and demon. These details really helped make the characters pop from the page.  The intricateness of the story did have a downside: slowness. I found this an incredibly slow read. I started off listening to the audiobook version, but switched to book version halfway through. I loved the narration of the audiobook. The accents were incredible, and the reading was rich and inviting. But the story moved so slowly, that I didn't feel like it moved at all until I switched to reading.  Can I just address the ending for a moment? For a book that was so long, the story never ended, just stopped. Ugh. I hate non-endings. This was especially horrible since if felt like the story was just beginning to pick up speed.
0385534639|5.0|I enjoyed the fairy tale magic in this novel. It was hard to put down at night which shocked me as this is not my usual read.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|Disregarding the plot (which can be debated all day), this movie speeds away from any thread of reality or scientific fact like a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (top speed 267MPH).<br />The writers seemed to have one theme; make any encounter with anything as close as possible to the point of being unbelievable.....and then repeat it about 50 times! Add millions in digital effects and there's your movie!<br />Both airplanes would have \\"conked out\\" as soon as any of the volcanic ash reached it. And the vehicles, give me a break. Both the father and daughter would have broken their backs when landing in a flimsy motor home, but it didn't even blow a tire!<br />This movie is simply a venue to show off special digital effects. That's it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|It came new and way before it was expected. I definitely would recommend you guys to other buyers. Totally an A+ or a Siamese Dream come true. :)
B003KRJNBW|1.0|The whole film has this dark tinted lens effect that really doesn't make any sense and is pretty annoying.  The hero has inexplicable super martial arts skills, and the villain somehow has a ton of followers even though he has no skill.

B000SEKO4K|3.0|I found another Oxford edition for half the price in Kindle books.  Only difference is it shows line numbers.  For those who find these numbers at odd places on their screen, just adjust front size until they appear at the end of lines.  Also for those who are disrturbed about words that had hyphenated endings but now don't, you will have to either accept it or pass on this edition.  Finally, an accurate edition of these plays reflects much toil and editing with numerous versions.
B006C5FWH8|5.0|this will eventually become a great game but at the.moment on almost all options you click there is no back button making it almost completely unplayable... Is what i posted about a week ago and the developers responded to my comment and published an update with a soft and hard back key.  Absolutely amazing that the devs listened and took the time to make the change
B0055S348W|4.0|This app worked with no problems.  Can print google docs and pictures.  I would rate this a 5 but it is way too $$$.  Seriously, why do I have to pay so much just to have print capability?  I would scream the merits of this app from the rooftops if it was under $5.

086571701X|2.0|When I first received this book I did a quick thumb through, and quickly found a fundamental mistake in the info presented. In the section on lights for indoor systems it states in two places that high pressure sodium lights are for vegetative growth and metal halide lights are for flowering/fruiting. This is exactly opposite of what it should be. I don't see any way that someone who's \\"personal and professional lives have been centered on hydroponics\\" for \\"the past eight years\\" could possibly make a mistake this basic. I bought the book to learn about moving from hydroponics to aquaponics, but I now feel I need to verify any info I find here.

1582701709|5.0|product came on time in great condition.  Purchased as a gift. The book is easy reading and very true to life's experiences.
0756405890|5.0|Such a dense book to be told from only one perspective, Kvothe's.  There are never any breaks from the main plot of the story. I loved it.  No shifts in perspective to minor characters the reader doesn't care as much about.  You will care about Kvothe.  Deeply.  If you read one fantasy book this year, make it this one.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down!  Once you start, you have to keep reading it.  I live with a five year old grandson and my career was in psychiatry so that made the book that much more compelling.  The book was well researched and the perspective of the narration easily carries the message.  This is a novel about today but it will become a classic.
B004X80QNG|3.0|No widget, rather just standard. Disappointed as it was much better on windows mobile 6. There are better apps out there.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best yet. The only negative part of this book will be finishing. I may put the book aside for a month or two and then re-read. King takes anyone born in that era back in time to where Ford convertibles, Chevy's with bodacious fins, and such were all part of a simpler life. What a great story and the imagination given to time travel - reset at every re-entry, 2 minute absences and the 'obdurate' past. King has a way of taking you with his protagonist George (Jake Epping); forgetting that you are reading a book (or eBook format on a Motorola Xoom for me). I would put this book on par with Steinbeck's 'Cannery Row' and/or Tim O'Brian's 'The Things They Carried.' Great book!
1439102813|5.0|Well written, a must read for all of us over 40 who are anticipating care giver role for parents, friends or relatives or just want to understand some of the science of dementia. But even without that need a well developed story and easy quick read. Not light hearted. Felt like a true story.

B005URRCUY|5.0|There isn't much else to say, really. I could go into a deep analysis about what makes each song great, but why waste your time reading that when you could be just listening to the songs!   The same Black Keys you know and love but with some new and creative twists, like I've come to expect from every album. They might not be redefining a genre with every new album, but they are doing something amazing to say the least.
0446573019|5.0|ONCE AGAIN, DAVID BALDACCI HAS HIT A HOME RUN.  AS USUAL, HIS ACTION BOOKS  ARE VERY EXCITING AND CONCISE.  HE IS ONE OF, IF NOT THE BEST OF ALL FICTION WRITERS OF THIS GENERATION.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My kids (7and 5) love this. The best part is being able to save the drawing in an album and to send pics to others. The layout is nice and the choice of tools is quite extensive and easy to access with the pull out drawer. A real bargain.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great DVD, my whole family loves it! My Mom saw it and even wants a copy for her Christmas present. My daughter is 3 and loves the \\"minions\\" and my 1 year old claps and thinks its so funny. I defiantly recommend this movie for all ages.

0525950079|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this sequel to PILLARS OF THE EARTH and I have to say it was even BETTER!  And that is saying a lot.  Both books are marvelous reads.  This is a very long book, but I never wanted it to end.  It was like stepping back in time and the characters and descriptions and details were amazing!  I would recommend this book highly!

I can't wait to play with it on my tablet!

1423140591|5.0|My son is 12 and he thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is also on the school's AR program. His classmates enjoyed reading it also. I received it very quickly which was great.
1892005034|1.0|The book was required reading for a class I am taking. Ouch--practically unreadable, and even less useful. I have studied communication for more than a decade. Nothing here makes sense to me--suspend judgement, how do humans do that? It's instinctual for humans to draw ethical lines in the sand, and according to this author, we shouldn't. I kept reading in hopes I'd discover something new or practical to use with my clients. I never did.
B005QBKXOQ|3.0|I'm a pretty hardcore Daughtry fan, and so far, I'm disappointed with this album. There are a few songs that may grow on me in time, but overall, I'm not really feeling it the way I did with the past two. There's no real stand out on this album. I agree with some of the critics that they're becoming formulaic and need to really shake things up next time so they don't start writing canned tunes. It's not a terrible album, and like I said, some of it may grow on me, but it's not up to their usual standards.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Idea is great - people DO NOT value their time. But at the same time, the drama of running out of time is not emphasized. First third or so is nicely done and builds up the whole idea around limited time, later on idea wears off, and then with the introduction of a higher class movie becomes too Robin Hoody and becomes just an action flick. Soundtrack is great, acting is good. Environments and setups are good (some action scenes are done visibly cheaply). It's def worth watching once. Surprisingly movie is not packed with crazy visual effects, maybe that's why the ones that are here are not umm... done very well.   --  V.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have a vm optimus which has very little internal space and the old version was 7 megs so it was not too bad but now the app doubled in space. is there anyway to get my old kindle app back this one is not low end friendly....
B001UDPAB0|5.0|I've had it.  I've had it with people talking about the best trilogies of all time and leaving out this one.  Don't worry, I've heard all of the criticism already, you don't even need to waste your time.  I've heard that Ocean's Twelve is a mish-mash of witticisms and European landscapes and that Ocean's Thirteen, while on one hand is a triumphant return to Vegas, lacks the overall magic of the first film.  Well, let me just say this: you're dead wrong.  This is, without a doubt, the best and most entertaining trilogy you'll ever have the joy of laying your peasant eyes on.  Ocean's Eleven is arguably a perfect film.  I dare you to come up with a legitimate complaint with this film (don't worry, it can't be done).  Ocean's Twelve is a delightful romp through Soderbergh's cinematographic dreams, coupled with excellent performances, despite the under utilization of Bernie Mac.  Ocean's Thirteen rebuffs the obviously weaker Twelve with a stronger use of Bernie Mac and a smoother ensemble feel to the movie.  These movies, altogether, are truly masterpieces.  Don't waste your time on 15 hours of Lord of the Rings, or the Ewok song.  This is where it's at, buddy.  You're not doing much better than this.
031617615X|2.0|The only reason I picked up this book was because I had seen the film, Breaking Dawn, Part 1. Prior to that, I had not read any of the other previous books in this series. Out sheer curiosity, I went to see the film. Surprisingly, I found the plot progressed faster than the other films in the series. I thought for a quick moment, which since this film was entertaining...maybe the book would be as well.   I was quickly disappointed once I opened to the second half of the novel.   All I can say is the pacing was slower than a turtle trying to cross the street.    I'm happy for Ms. Meyer's success with this series. However, the book could've been cut down to at least 300 pages. There was no need for it to be 800 pages. I don't need to read ten pages about how nice a tree looks through a vampire's eyes. I found myself skipping through many scenes until I landed on something interesting. Inconsistency is also an issue in this book. I was confused when Bella mentioned how she forgot to be human once she turned into a vampire, yet a few chapters before...she was hiding the fact that she was able to retain her human memories and didn't want tell anyone her little \\"secret\\". It also appeared her transformation was effortless which differed from her other vampire counterparts who had difficult transitions.

0545265355|5.0|Our book club had THE HUNGER GAMES as a monthly selection.  I do not really care for fantasy plus the fact it was a young adult book.  To my surprise,I could not put it down! Not in my wildest dreams did I think I would enjoy this book as much as I did.  I have also read the other two books in the trilogy, which one really needs to do to wrap it all up.  I recently purchased THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY BOXED SET for my grandson as one of his Christmas gifts from Amazon.com.  Knowing him, and what he reads, he will love it also.  I will be with him and his family during the holidays, and will get to see first-hand his opinion of this amazing series.  We can enjoy discussing the books together. We both love to read and sometimes spend a couple of hours just sitting quietly and reading together.  Amazon.com is my favorite place to go for so many items, such as books, CDs, and gifts. Thanks Amazon!  M. Bierbaum
B00004U8P9|5.0|I remember going into NYc to watch it in the theatures. I got it for a great price on Amazon
0374275637|5.0|Personally I think this is a great book because it opens a new perspective. Many human behaviors can be explained well in the \\"System 1 vs. System 2\\" framework.<br /><br />However, I think System 1 has more depth. Simply labeling System 1 as \\"intuitive\\" and even \\"irrational\\" is not sufficient. We may want to find out why System 1 acts that way, and also its strength and weakness.<br /><br />One important characteristic of System 1 is it often uses relative measure instead of absolute measure.<br /><br />Long before the computer era and even long before human civilization, humans had started gathering information from their environment, storing it and processing the stored information to help them make decisions. At that time, the amount of information, information storage space and information processing speed were all very limited. On the contrary, the decision making process needed to be fast, probably faster than today's average, considering the harsh environment at that time.<br /><br />Therefore the human brain developed some outstandingly smart strategies to cope with that situation by retaining the most important information and using it in the most efficient way. One of the strategies is use relative measure instead of absolute measure. Relative measure is easy to obtain, taking less space to store and easier to use for decision making when options are limited.<br /><br />Very often relative measure does not mean comparing two things on the table, but comparing a measure to a reference value. The reference value is often the prior expectation. One would assess the value with newly acquired information and compare it with the prior assessment: That is exactly the idea of Bayesian inference. For example, when a primitive man encountered with an unfamiliar animal, he would constantly watch the of the animal's behavior and judge if that behavior makes the animal more or less likely to be dangerous and act accordingly.  Assessing the absolute dangerousness wouldbe a less urgent task.<br /><br />In the famous \\"Linda problem\\", many people think that \\"Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\\" is more probable than \\"Linda is a bank teller\\". It is an obvious logical fallacy.  However, it could be explained by the tendency of using relative probability measures. Considering Linda's personal traits altogether, she looks more probable to be a \\"bank teller and feminist\\" than an average person; but less probable to be a bank teller than an average person. So both probabilities here were normalized by the prior expectation:<br /><br />Relative probability that Linda is A<br />= P (Someone is A  given someone has Linda's traits) /P (Someone is A)<br /><br />In our daily analytical process, the priority is usually making the best use of newly available information rather than finding the things with higher probability. No one would state: \\"the sun will rise tomorrow\\"; but many people would pay attention if some one says \\"I sense that something might be wrong\\", even the probability that something is wrong may be less than 0.5.<br /><br />Even we use relative measure very often; we are not always fully aware of it and not very conscious of what reference point we are using. In many cases, the reference point is the most recent observation (Chapter 17 \\"Regression to The Mean\\"). Since human psychology tends to put a lot of weight on the improvement (or measure relative to most recent data). For example, we tends to be happy when we are becoming wealthier, the sign of change is often more important than the absolute value of wealth to our happiness. It is understandable because in early human history, our most important learning experience is trial and error, whether there is an improvement was the most important criteria.<br /><br />But the improvement is not the best measure in some cases. For example, you may want to know if a good score helps next performance by giving confidence or hinders it by adding pressure. Aseries of scores read (I made it up):<br /><br />10, 8.6, 5.9, 4.7, 3.7, 5.5, 1.2, 3.2, 3.7, 6.2, 6.6, 7.3, 5.5<br /><br />The average score is 5.55. So there are 6 \\"good\\" (above average) and 7 \\"bad\\" (below average) scores. There are 8 out of 12 cases that good score followed by deterioration or bad score followed by improvement, which is compatible with mean regression explanation pointed out by the author. However, does this mean that good score is more likely to hinder your next performance? No. Actually the data indicates the opposite.<br /><br />The correct measure of performance should have a fixed reference point (average score in this case). And here we see that good performance tends to be followed by good performance or bad performance tends to be followed by bad performance (9 out of 12 in this data set). So it actually means good score tends to boost next performance (autocorrelation is 0.59).<br /><br />In summary, using relative measure was an optimized strategy in human's early age. It is still the best strategy today most of the time today. Using relative measure, together with many other functions of System 1, have been the primary choice of our analytical process. They are hard wired and we call and run those functions fast and with little effort (that is why we are often not fully conscious about the process). This characteristic of our brain should have played an important role in the survival and development of our specie.<br /><br />However, the primary choice is not always the best choice. Now being able to access to more information, larger storage space and stronger computing power, we might want to be a little more conscious when making choices.
B000NQRE0K|1.0|I ordered this to get the DVD. I also received a free download which I downloaded to my Kindle Fire. The audio track on the downloaded file is inaudible on a Kindle Fire. The problem is not with the Kindle Fire which performs beautifully on mp3's downloaded from the Amazon Cloud.  I anticipate no such difficulties with the DVD itself.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|I saw this while searching for something else, but I thought it was so cute, I ordered it anyway!  I'm glad I did.  My sons like to play with their little Star Wars figures and vehicles, as well as their LEGO Duplo sets all together.  This makes for a lot of clutter.  This bin unzips and makes a cute play mat, but is also easy for them to zip up each side to make the \\"box\\", and they can put their Star Wars figures and some LEGO blocks in there also.   It would not be good to store anything really heavy, but seems to be good quality and is a great place to keep little figures or blocks to avoid the clutter.  The boys seem to not mind tossing all their figures in there when it is time to clean up.  Happy with this purchase!
B0053FP1PQ|5.0|I frankly thought I had heard most every new and great band out there, but frequently I discover a new brilliant group. In this case it was somewhat by accident when The Kooks opened for Young the Giant here in Portland this week. YTG was and is amazing, but The Kooks blew me and that crowd away. They had clear existing fans that night, but many others I can assume discovered them right then in our sleepy little town at 8:45 local time. So I am very glad I had that chance.  So that having been said this first CD of theirs that I have now listened to is a 5 star effort without doubt, but folks and here me, you have to experience Luke and Peter and company live PERIOD They are and will be an amazing live band for a long period of time I hope. I know I will be there waiting for them to come on stage next time they appear in our area. Thanks guys, you have a new huge fan.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Zooey is just the person you want singing the soundtrack to your busy December days preparing for Christmas. Her soothing voice and childlike spirit will fill your heart. She is also known for heroically saving the spirit of Christmas in the movie Elf, where she sings one of my personal faves,  Baby its cold outside, which is included on this album. Easy listening, not overdone, so you can listen all month long... and maybe a little longer.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Very great app, but they dumbed it down to make it cheaper.  Not cool. All other markets get the Outlook sync features, except Amazon. Might be OK for tablet users, but really sucks for phone users. Will change to 5 stars if we get the missing feature.

0743297334|5.0|I've seen some bad reviews of this book, and that just blows me away, because I find Hemingway's first big novel to be a brilliant ride that perfectly evokes the vibe and angst of the Lost Generation. It literally takes you for as trip along with a group of American and English expats as they journey from 1902s Paris to the gritty and brutal bullfights in Spain. The romantic side of the story features the flamboyant Lady Brett Ashley, who Jake Barnes is hopelessly besotted with. As a reader you can easily become immersed in Hemingway's distinctly vivid descriptions of both the romantic locales and violent bullfights, and with the characters' disillusionment, moral bankruptcy and unrequited love. It's got tragedy, romance and locations to die for--and language that lingers in your mind.  Hemingway's pacing allows for you to really soak everything in, and forces you to pay attention to his beautiful prose. If a reader is used to speed reading and doesn't have a true appreciation for the language, they will find the book too slow. For those who really appreciate classic literature, you will find the prose stylish, detailed and beautiful. The characters are vibrant, charismatic and quirky, and it's amazing to see how they lived life to the fullest and indulged in debauchery so far back in the day.   This book will inspire you to travel, specifically to Spain!
B00000K2UX|5.0|Tom Cruz is not one of my all time favorites, but this is a spellbinding movie.  and the sound track is full of good ole memory music.  The flying sequences are great, story lines are an odd combination, but it's still a good sound track.
1439153663|5.0|What a great slave drama meets Pride and Prejudice. Nothing has sucked me in like this in a long time! I loved reading about the different social groups of the people in the \\"big house\\", the house slaves, field slaves, and those who didnt fit in any categories like the half black half white daughter of the plantation owner and the young irish girl who was orphaned on a ship to American and ended up living in the kitchen house. Their stories intertwine in a wonderful and tragic way. Great read. Feels like old time literature, but by a modern author.
B00005JCCE|5.0|This movie shows not only his comic genius, but also his ability to empathize with the human condition and portray a man stuck between two worlds.  Hopefully he wont slip into the same lunacy that hurt Jonathan Winters so much, and will keep us laughing with his antics.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I have to be honest, this wasn't my favorite part of the books, so I knew this wouldn't be my favorite movie. You have to see it if you are an avid Harry fan because it is part of the whole series that makes these books so wonderful. It does remind me why I don't like the Lord of the Rings especially the first movie because they are doing a lot of running to something but they aren't sure what it is or how they are going to get there.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Her personal life is not my cup of tea, but she has a miraculous voice.  bought this album for one song, but the rest of the album is more than pleasant, in fact I'd highly recommend this album for those times when you just want to close your eyes, turn down the lights and relax with a small cordial or glass of wine.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|So I will be honest with you, I'm such a HP lover I didn't read the last 150 pages of the last book, yes I waited 3 years to see it on screen because I didn't want the movie to be ruined I wanted to see it for the first time not already know what happened. I did see this in the theater and cried the whole movie because it is just that awesome of an ending. Not to mention bring everything from book 1 full circle so even if you are only a movie fan of HP and haven't read the books, you will still understand everything going on. The 19 years later part was poorly done on the makeup/technology side. But at least you get the idea of what happens to everyone.<br /><br />After you see this movie you will want to go to Universal, like I did and experience the whole Harry Potter!

B005IGVYUG|4.0|I love Tom Waits' music and this is as good as it gets.  Amazingly varied- the sentimental and the wild/crazy.  My only complaint is that the second CD is just a few tunes and not a full length CD.  I wanted more.  otherwise - 5 stars.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I was quite skeptical about this movie. What were they thinking about mixing two completely unlike genres, cowboys, Apaches and aliens together? Well, my mistake. The end result is both a good western and a very credible sci-fi movie. So, out of an apparent weird mix came out an original movie under a plausible story line (Sorry, no spoiler, I will not go into the details of the plot).<br /><br />I really liked the performance of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. All three main actors have in common to be associated with their roles in previous serial movies or TV series, where they played the lead or a key role. In this movie they managed to deliver a performance quite different from the character we are used to, particularly Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. I think this is her first key role other than \\"House\\" in which you can appreciate the quality of her acting. I hope she gets more opportunities like this to show us her talent.<br /><br />As for the special effects, they are quite realistic, and it is notable that the insect-like aliens are not hidden with low lighting like in so many alien movies. The amazing thing is that the SFX are not based completely on computer animations (GCI). The film was shot using good old puppets and animatronics for the close-ups, combined with CGI for the battle scenes. Even some of the alien ships were scale models. My only quibble is that one of the alien features resembles a lot the character Kuato in [[ASIN:B000IHL52W Total Recall]] (no spoiler again). My respects to director Jon Favreau, a great combination of old and new technology.<br /><br />As for the product, the package includes the BD, DVD and the codes to download a digital version, all for $19.99 (actually I pre-order with a higher price, but Amazon credited the savings to me). Regarding the digital version a nice feature is that the website allows you choose between downloading to your favorite player (such as iTunes) or just keep the movie available for streaming in any of your portable devices.r streaming in any of your portable devices.

1932735410|5.0|As a project management instructor at a state university and someone who has reviewed countless project management books, I highly recommend this book. In fact, this was the prep book I chose to use during my most recent PMP(R) training course at corporate client.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- This book, when accompanied with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), is what you need at a minimum. Although I know people who passed the PMP only using this book, I don't recommend it. There are topics that are on the exam that are covered in the PMBOK that are not here and vice versa. Unless you are a good guesser, buy both.<br /><br />- The chapters are aligned with the PMBOK, based on knowledge area. You'll find that all PMP prep books are organized either by knowledge area (e.g. scope, time, cost) or by process group (e.g. initiating, planning, executing). I prefer the former since I believe it's easier to compartmentalize knowledge areas, say learn about cost at once. The latter would cover cost in three different areas of the book since that would follow the life of a project.<br /><br />- Rita's writing style works well. Even though she passed away after the 6th edition, this edition is virtually the same. Her candor and scare tactics keep things interesting. Some hate it; I love it. Furthermore, words pop out of the pages as if she's talking directly to you.<br /><br />- This book is very concise. It reads more like a workbook than a text book and the fonts are big and not intimidating. The book still packs a punch by addressing areas the PMBOK does not cover (e.g. HR theories, finance terms) or does not provide nearly enough depth (e.g. earned value, activity sequencing).<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- Not enough time spent on Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs (ITTOs). This is the number one reason why you need the PMBOK. You don't need to memorize them but you'll need to understand them really well and Rita's book is not sufficient in this area.<br /><br />- The practice exams at the end of each chapter are too easy. Sure, you'll feel great since you'll get many of the answers right but they are not indicative of the real exam. The questions here have less lard (fewer words) and are easier to get right. The current exam passing score is 61% but you should aim for 85% from this book.<br /><br />- The CD is only provides a handful of sample questions. You'll need to purchase the full FASTrack CD costs $299! The cost of retaking the real exam is $275. I recommend taking the real exam because: A. if you pass, you're done and B. if you fail, you took the best practice exam you could possibly take (and at a lower price than the Rita CD).<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />- For people who like to study independently, this is an excellent resource for any project management certification exam. Make sure you buy the PMBOK to accompany this.<br /><br />- If you opt to take a training course, the Rita book can be a nice supplement to your course materials.ll feel great since you'll get many of the answers right but they are not indicative of the real exam.

B0025KW29U|1.0|This was made during the writers strike from a few years back.  It's not very original, the songs arn't great, but I don't care for musicals anyway, so your mileage may vary.  Over all, it was kind of boring and difficult to sit through the whole thing.
B006C452HO|1.0|Very disappointing considering the cast and director.  Mr. Ford's grumpiness changed too abruptly to make much sense.  The wide ranging groups remind me of that terrible McKenna's Gold.  If I could return this movie I would.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I must admit, this collection delivers far more fun than I expected. Amy sounds in great voice, and all the arrangements are sincere save one; the hideously cacophonic rendition of \\"Girl From Ipanema\\", which was recorded without the subtlety that song needs. In fact, the mix sounds like someone was banging on a trash can lid throughout, and this gaffe mars an otherwise wonderful listening experience.

The very essence of Android is that it's integrated with Google services, the way Windows phones are integrated with Microsoft services, making it perfect for those of us using Google Apps instead of MS Office for calendar, email, contacts, etc.<br /><br />Only gripe so far is that it doesn't appear on the \\"share to\\" list, which is how I create most tasks using the otherwise less capable Google task apps. Will give this five stars when that's brought up to snuff.
0312430000|5.0|There really isn't much to say that hasn't been said in the 200+ reviews before mine. Gawande uses interesting stories and examples to present some worthwhile ideas regarding the use of checklists as a way to ensure accuracy and accountability. The book is an easy and quick read for anyone and well worth the effort if you're willing to apply his suggestions.
B00005JKNC|4.0|This film is directed in the Frank Capra style. It is too long and probably would've rated 5 stars with some editing, but Frank Capra wouldn't have cut it short either. It's beautifully filmed and has an uplifting story about a young film maker who gets amnesia after a car accident and becomes a war hero to a small town. The back story is about McCarthy-ism. I guess it's corny but it's also very good.Jim Carrey gives an outstanding dramatic performance in this film. He is very talented.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I didnt think it was bad at all, actually I thought it was somewhat better this time.  Im surprised how many negative commets there are for this movie, if you havent seen the first one, you might want to before you see this one, because this one is more shocking and graphic.  Im 26 years old and would recommend this movie to all my friends.
B000P5FH3K|3.0|The book was a lot better, even though the story is typical. But the supporting cast here is excellent and makes the movie entertaining. Jon Voight is great as usual, he plays the high powered lawyer, and Mickey Rourke, another great actor, plays a rogue lawyer, a small role in the film but he is superb. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
B000O76VBG|5.0|Great value and toy for my son who enjoyed this as an infant and still at 18 months likes to push the buttons and hear the music. He never used it much as a teether but has always loved the 3 musical buttons!Durable too.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Judging from this concert, I am not sure if Adele is missing any ingredient that makes a great pop star.  I had 3 generations present to watch this concert and everyone enjoyed it (ages:15-85).  We kept wondering:  Really she is only 21 and so poised and gifted?  1.  She is very likeable and talks to audience as they are long lost friends that she has reconnected with.  Very cute and bubbly which was a shock considering the serious relationship topics she sings about.  2.  A voice that is powerful and warm and exudes emotion.  3.  Songs that are easily relate-able.  Great live version of 3 remakes from different genre of music.  Folk-pop (Bob Dylan:  To Make You Feel My love); Alternative (The Cure:  Lovesong done beautifully with acoustic guitar); Blues/Pop (Bonnie Raitt:  I Can't Make you love Me).   She sings pop, Rock, Jazz and blues without missing a beat and if you don't have to hold back from tearing from the heartbreak in her \\"Someone Like You\\" performance, you should check to see if you have a heart.  And if you do not want to jump and rock to her \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" you should check and see if you have a pulse.I hope that her recent surgery for inflamed vocal chords does not impact her range and tone.   You cannot ask for anything more from a concert!

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have to admit that I had already seen this film at the cinema before I bought it.  Matter of fact,that's why I bought it.  The combination of Willis, Mirren and Malkovich was brilliant casting - especially Mirren.  She makes a lovely assassin.  The movie is about a group of 'retired' spies who are drawn back into a job, and they carry it off with humor, expertise and aplomb.  If you enjoy danger and humor and a sort-of love story  - this is the movie for you.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|I could NOT sleep last night (12/5/11) because I was anticipating the release of this album (12/6/11). So I left for school early, went to Target and bought the FIRST ONE! The guy was JUST beginning to shelf it. When I got home I automatically put it on my computer! I love Amy.  Top 5:  1. Our Day Will Come- this reminds me A LOT of Frank. Its something relaxing to listen to. I'll surely put this on repeat, when I work on a paper  2. Best Friends, Right?- I have no idea why I really like this one! Me and my old best friend have a similar relationship to \\"Stephanie and Paulette\\"-- that's why? Its still a wonderful tune.   3. Half Time- this WHOLE album was formed around this particular song-- I can see why! This shows a true Amy. Forget what you've heard-- Amy is a deep person. It shows her love for music and life.  4. Like Smoke (feat. Nas) The beat is very good--don't care much for Nas-- Amy's vocals are a bit slurry in this one. But still makes the list for me.  5. The Girl From Ipanema- upbeat and fun. Like the majority of the songs its smooth.   OVERALL, this is a great album! Buy it and donate to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. Amy will live on forever, through this album, her fans, and family. RIP Queen Winehouse!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Just stumbled apon this book last night and already finished it.  Took me 8 straight hours and i'm a fast reader,  this book was long.  I loved every minute of this book. Wow talk about the ultimate jeolous \\"bad boy\\".  This writer is just awesome.  She has me totally engaged right from the start.  I so look forward to more books by her.<br /><br />**Caution** this book was under young adult.  I am 32 years old and would not let my young daughter read this.  I would say 16 and older.<br /><br />Contains: swearing, sex (tasteful tho),lots of drinking, talk of pregnancy, gambling, and fist fighting alot.<br /><br />Should you read this book? if you like bad boys, great story and author? YES, YES, YES! I luved it (smile) Buy, buy it, you know you want to.  Enjoy!!!!
1878424319|5.0|I just have to add my voice to the hundreds of positive reviews for this book. If you have enjoyed the Carlos Castaneda books, but were a little put off by some of the dangerous plant allies used, then this is the book for you. Don Miguel has laid bare the essential teachings of the Toltec, making them fully accessible without the use of entheogenic plants. This book is full of revelations about how we live our lives and how we perceive the world. And it offers very workable advice on how to master your own perception of reality and how to live immaculately.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rio is so much fun with out adds.<br />love it! can't wait for more levels.<br />great for kids to. add free is the way to go.
030788743X|5.0|All I can say is WOW, that was a great book. Finished it in 2 days while I was stuck in Jury Duty. This nerd-gasm filled book will surly quench your thirst for a comedic cyberpunk novel that hasn't been seen since Snow Crash. Too bad this will never be made into a movie because the amount royalties for pop-culture references would make up half the movie budget. Can't wait until the next novel by Cline.   If you like this novel, check out these Genre defining Authors' works: Neal Stephenson, Orson Scott Card, Dan Simmons, Frank Herbert, & George R.R. Martin.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This story is as it is titled, a beautiful disaster. Isn't life a beautiful disaster at times? I find that it is and I could relate to the characters in this book.<br /><br />First, this book is mostly about two people that are undeniably attracted to each other, but they each have their own issues. Their pasts are tainted and have therefore jaded them when it comes to love. They are scared and insecure about the feelings that they develop which leads to fighting, possessiveness and an emotional roller coaster. Some may think that their relationship is unhealthy and disturbing, but life is not filled with rainbows and puppy dogs. You cannot take two jaded, messed up people and expect their romance to be filled with fluffy hearts and chocolate candies. The author made it realistic by showing the growth of each character as they slowly succumbed to their feelings. Yes, Travis is possessive, a man-whore and has anger issues along with relationship issues(since he's never really been in one). Yes, there is drinking, sex and fighting in this book. Is there not drinking, sex and fighting in college? In high school? I believe that this book sends the message to fight(figuratively speaking) for what you want and that life is NEVER easy. Relationships have ups and downs, Travis and Abby's relationship just has different ups and downs then most.<br /><br />Lastly, I encourage you to read this book. A lot have loved it, a few have hated it, but it is up to you to make your own opinion.
0321704452|5.0|The naked presenter will help you do exactly what the title states. \\"Present Naked\\", no notes, no slides, no reading.... I was always terrified of public speaking, but reading this book really helped me to overcome some of that fear. This book is full of useful information on how to win over your audience no matter the subject. The author teaches you how to break bad habits and also gives you tips and new methods to use while presenting...
0307891372|5.0|In my personal opinion this is one of the best guides I have ever seen or purchased.  What caught my attention was the stunning absurdity of the 3-star and below reviews!  Honestly has everyone become so jaded that when a game as immersive, beautiful, and rich as Skyrim emerges onto the scene people feel the immediate need to point out the flaws???  Not only have many bashed the guide, but the game itself has come under heavy criticism about \\"What I would like to see is...\\".  If you're so unhappy with the guide or the game itself then put in the 2,000 hours of gameplay and the painstaking months of research into writing a \\"better\\" guide yourself.  Those of you who want a Skyrim Guide for Dummies need to really appreciate the time and effort put into it instead of believing that YOU could somehow add your self-proclaimed \\"infinite amount of wisdom\\" to the guide.  Personally I believe this is one of the biggest, best, illustrious, creative, and amazing guides I have ever seen and the attention to detail, I believe, is as good as any person could do with the short amount of time to produce such a guide.  If you didn't make the game or the guide yourself, you shouldn't be complaining.  I would like to see any of you do a better job then Bethesda and Prima Games.  Thank you.
B0062HCKRG|5.0|Hilarious episode delving into the boy and girl roommate problem areas. Of course it would not be as good without Jess and Schmidt. Watch it, you won't regret it.
1594744769|4.0|I picked this book up after reading all the great reviews it received and I was definitely not disappointed! The pictures were just a little strange but they tied so well into the story and I felt like by having the pictures I could put a face to the characters in the story. A great cast of characters that I enjoyed getting to know.  I was really entranced while reading this book and I look forward to reading the next one (if there is one)! The author certainly left off at the end leaving the possibility.
B0064YKDNA|5.0|Great episode discussing the area of what to do/how to handle when you think your roommate might have a thing for you. Loved the part where Jess jumps out of the car and runs off. Best part is Schmidt and the roof cat. LMAO. Watch it, you wont regret it.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Pocket Informant is an excellent calendar app that keeps getting better all the time. I've tried most calendar apps and it's one of only two I consider usable.
B006G7QZGO|5.0|Cute episode discovering more the character of Winston. The best parts are all the things that go on between the other 2 guy roommates. Not the best episode in the series, but still a good one.
0307593312|5.0|1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is a fic­tional novel which takes place between two worlds. The book was orig­i­nally writ­ten in Japan­ese and became a best seller almost immediatiy..<br /><br />Aomame, a young assas­sin on her way to prac­tice her pro­fes­sion, steps out of a taxi cap and started notic­ing small but sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences in the world around her. Aomame real­izes that she entered a par­al­lel uni­verse which she calls 1Q84.<br /><br />At the same time Tengo, an aspir­ing author, takes on a ghost­writ­ing project and becomes so wrapped up with the work and its author when he starts notic­ing that his world has become unraveled.<br /><br />1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is not a com­plex novel, but it is long. The book asks an impor­tant ques­tion \\"what is reality\\"?<br /><br />I've worked with many mar­ket­ing peo­ple over the years, the one impor­tant les­son they have taught me is the \\"per­cep­tion is every­thing, real­ity is noth­ing\\". At first, my struc­tured mind that sees the world in 0s and 1s couldn't com­pre­hend what they were say­ing. How­ever, with a lit­tle bit of con­tem­pla­tion I came to real­ize that they were right.<br /><br />After all, we live in a fake world. The news we watch are fake, the food we eat is fake (that's why many immi­grants have their own food stores), the promises made to us by our lead­ers and cap­tains of indus­try are hol­low and bro­ken almost with­out delay.<br /><br />Mr. Murakami starts off the novel with lines from  song \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\" writ­ten by E. Y. Har­burg and Billy Rose, an appro­pri­ate selec­tion which sets up the novel and is even more mean­ing­ful at the end:<br />\\"It's a Bar­num and Bai­ley world<br />Just as phony as it can be<br />But it wouldn't be make-believe<br />If you believed in me.\\"<br /><br />Murakami points out that one's per­spec­tive often deter­mines what real­ity is for them, whether or not it is real­ity for oth­ers - I think he's right. The author points out that the year 1984 no longer exists, it is not a par­al­lel uni­verse or or another world:<br /><br />\\"For you and for me, the only time that exists any­more is this year of 1Q84\\"<br /><br />The novel inter­twines two nar­ra­tives, Aomame who is a full-time trainer/ part-time assas­sin and Tengo, a math teacher and nov­el­ist. Aomame and Tengo, whose sto­ries even­tu­ally join, see the world in a par­al­lel uni­verse, each one with its own minor dif­fer­ences (police uni­forms for exam­ple) but they con­tinue to live with those who are in their own world.<br /><br />The small dis­tinc­tions make all the dif­fer­ence to Aomame and Tengo in pur­su­ing their mean­ing & their per­sonal quests.<br /><br />How­ever, the real strength of the book is the epic struc­ture in which it is writ­ten in and the ref­er­ences to lit­er­a­ture, world­wide and Japan­ese, and his­tor­i­cal events which I found amus­ing. I only wish the trans­la­tors (Jay Rubin & Philip Gabriel, who did an excel­lent job by the way) would have been kind enough to put in some foot­notes about the cul­tural aspects of the book to put it in per­spec­tive to those who are not up to date on cul­tural details as Mr. Murakami is.<br />But that is my com­plaint on most trans­lated books.<br /><br />The won­der­ful thing about 1Q84 is that it is clear that Murakami is hav­ing fun with his com­ments on clas­si­cal authors and narrative:<br /><br />\\"Accord­ing to Chekhov ... once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired.\\"<br /><br />And refutes him­self a few hun­dred pages down the storyline.<br /><br />\\"That's fine.... Noth­ing could be bet­ter than not fir­ing it.\\"<br /><br />At its heart, 1Q84 is actu­ally quite a tra­di­tional tale, a boy meets girl story in which love tri­umphs over all. The book is a tad too long, the plot is a bit too con­ve­nient at times and not as tight as it could be but that's not a sin and worst things could hap­pen to you than read­ing a few extra pages writ­ten by Murakami. How­ever 1Q84 has man­aged to reframe the world - and isn't that what lit­er­a­ture is all about?sn't that what lit­er­a­ture is all about?
B005SNMSAY|5.0|Great episode with tons of fun mixed in. \\"Slut butler\\" and \\"chicken dance\\" segments were by far my favorites. Love this new series. Watch it, you won't regret it. And next time you do the chicken dance go for a more realistic appeal. Happy watching.
1594744769|3.0|While the kids-with-special-powers territory has been mined in the X-Men series and the divided-by-our-differences teen romance angle is a stereotype by now (Twilight anyone?), the writing in Ms. Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is quality and the collected photos that accompany the story are worth the money to me (of course, I collect odd antique photos).<br /><br />I wished that the book had been published solely as a photo collection. The Tim Burton style story with completely expected plot twists was a bummer. But, to be fair to the author, I purchased the book without realizing it was intended as YA lit. Maybe a younger audience would be more impressed.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|Wow that writing was atrocious. The editing as well. Conan felt like a made for TV movie it was so poorly done. It's hard to give specifics without giving anything away but dang....I can't think of a worse action movie I've seen in a long time. Not even worth renting IMO.  Watch the original, Conan the Destroyer, if you want a Conan movie. It might not be the greatest movie ever but at least it's got some tension building and some memorable lines.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I hated having to buy this album for only one song, but it wasn't offered as a single sale.  Sia does a great job on \\"My Love\\" and I wanted it badly enough to get this album.    Most of the songs on the whole series of \\"Twilight\\" albums are not my cup of tea.  Maybe each album had one song I liked.  I sometimes wish I was allowed to help with song choices.  In my head I heard \\"Sleepthief\\" as an accompanyment to almost every scene in each movie.  There are too many dark, or hard, songs on these albums for my taste.  Anyway, you'll like Sia here and maybe a few of the others, too.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|The new Rush Sector remastered series is not only definitive for the band, the sound on these babies is one of the best remasters I've ever heard. This is definitely worth the upgrade if only for the improved sound. There is better instrument separation, better EQ across the board and a better mix overall on all of them. The albums with the worst original sound have the most noticeable improvement. The biggest improvement in sound for Sector 1 to me was CARESS OF STEEL. If you listen on headphones you can hear the detail of the pick hitting Alex's guitar strings like never before in the parts of songs where the guitar plays alone, as in Bastille Day. None of the original feel of the albums is lost. 2112 sounds even clearer than it did originally. It sounds better than it did listening to it on headphones back in 1981 when I first heard it. A FAREWELL TO KINGS sounds fresh and uncluttered, with the guitar much clearer in the mix. RUSH I sounds about the same with a clearer, cleaner sound.   FLY BY NIGHT has several sound defects where the sound fades or \\"clicks\\". The Rush official site has reported that cd replacements for these and other issues will be announced when the issues are corrected. Otherwise, FBN shows an amazing difference in sound as well. Now, I haven't heard the 5.1 mixes and cannot comment on the defects that other reviewers reported there, but the packaging for all of the Sector series has one major flaw. The album jacket replicas are perfect, except that during the packaging process some of them are not folded with TLC and they end up with the edges not being even when the gatefold is closed. That just reeks. Otherwise the packaging is not only faithful to the originals, it has pictures and art that didn't appear on the original albums. (Unless I'm familiar with different versions.) The problem with the DVD's will be corrected, per the RUSH official website. What a damned shame that there wasn't better quality control for an otherwise great editionof remasters. I've been listening to this band for 30 years and I feel like I'm rediscovering their music. These are albums that I've heard at least 20 times each, but I've never heard this music this clear. The price is also right. Now I just hope that a Sector 4 is released with the remainder of their older catalog.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This is the craziest, freakiest town ever.  The series is just too crazy not to watch.  Loved the \\"out of this world\\" stories and the primary actors, too.  Hope this series stays around a while, as I'd get all the series for as long as it lasts.
B0062KJ1Q6|3.0|This is another in a long line of comedies featuring the more juvenile brand of humor. If you dont appreciate the simplicity of old high school style burns and such, this may not be for you. I thought it was pretty funny, but it wasnt the greatest film by any stretch. Danny McBride is one of the featured actors, and this movie has his fingerprints all over it. So...crass sexual jokes, silly one upsmanship, and a whole lot of idiocy mark this as his standard stock in trade.<br />The basic premise is that McBrides dad (Fred Ward) is a millionaire due to a lucky lotto ticket. McBride and his buddy (Nick Swardson) are basically doing nothing with their lives except blowing up stuff and talking about their great plans for life. His dad wont share the wealth of course, so McBride ends up deciding to hire a hitman to kill his father. Only problem...he needs $100,000 to do so.<br />So...he concocts a genius plan to trick or coerce somebody into getting the money for him. That somebody is a pizza delivery guy (Eisenberg). Eisenberg is actually the main star of the film along with his friend (Ansari), and the movie follows them as they try to get the money and then deliver it before....<br /><br />Anyway, none of the above are spoilers having been part of their advertising for the movie. I wont tell you any more about the story to avoid revealing anything else. I will say that it is an hour and a half well spent. Just know that it isnt the really heady type comedy...but if you enjoy simple, sophomoric humor, you will appreciate this. You may not want your kids to watch though (FYI).<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004EPYZSU|1.0|Great cast but horrible film, the plot was ridiculous. I can't believe Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig agreed to be in this POS.

0307341577|5.0|I enjoy reading horror/murder mystery/dark tales.  The books I read are typically pretty good and entertaining to read, but nothing that sticks in my head.  Well I picked up Dark Places based on the positive critic reviews, and I was very impressed by the quality of writing.  The plot is interesting, but the level of smooth writing is what made me enjoy the book so much.  I even found myself smiling after reading certain passages (in the way you would smile while watching a terrific movie scene or eating a fantastic meal).  I look forward to future work by Gillian Flynn.

B006BXTOFC|5.0|Something magical always happens every time they team up with Dangermouse. This guy knows how to produce. I've been a fan of Black Keys ever since \\"Attack And Release\\" in 2008. That album is amazing. The song \\"I Got Mine\\" was a constant addition to many of my playlists. Then, \\"Brothers\\" came out in 2010. Holy crap! Every song was excellent. This time, the only song produced by Dangermouse was \\"Tighten Up.\\" With that track they had finally gotten what they seriously deserved and had broken into mainstream consciousness. I thought to myself, the next album is gonna sound super-polished and commercial. Not so! I don't know how but, they manage to top themselves every time. \\"El Camino\\" is every bit as good as the last album and this time around, it's produced entirely again by Dangermouse. \\"Lonely Boy\\"...killer track. The guitar reminds me of ZZ Top. \\"Dead And Gone\\" sounds like a long lost Motown song. My favorite song has to be \\"Gold On The Ceiling.\\" The guitar solo after each chorus sounds like the pedal effect that Stephen Stills (if you're familiar) used on a lot of the Crosby, Stills & Nash records. \\"Run Right Back\\" also sounds great and uses the same guitar effect. If you loved the last album, this is more of the same quality and possibly even better. If you're not familiar with them, I'd say definitely buy this and pick up a copy of \\"Brothers\\" and then decide from there if you wanna seek them out further. 5 stars!!!
0307593312|3.0|I have started reading this book and found out that my copy is missing pages 757 through 788 (thirty pages in chapters 15 to 18). Not to happy and will need t oreturn book to Amazon - wonder if more people have noticed the same.

B002UNMW7O|1.0|I loved the first movie, so when this came out on dvd I bought it no quesiotns asked. This was a big mistake. This movie does not even come close to touching the original movie. With this you could tell that they were trying to hard to make a sequel.
B003LXSY60|5.0|No need to explain these songs.  If you're familiar with the band you're aware they put out quality blues rock.  This album is excellent from start to finish.  I don't agree with the naysayers.  I believe they changed their musical direction on this record (and the last one) for the better.  They couldn't keep on doing the same thing forever.  Buy this immediately if it's not already in your collection.
B005VR9328|5.0|First off I am not a huge hip hop / rap fan. I came across the album while buying the new Black Keys and figured I would give it a try being that I enjoy them on Fallon. This is not an album of recycled beats, it is a musically deep record with great hooks and verses. Worth the listen.
B005IKZSYA|2.0|I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this film.  Nanni Moretti is a very engaging actor and director and I started off 'on his side'; but I have to say that the film is disappointing.  It is not even very funny.  'Mildly amusing' is nearer the mark; but the main problem is that it starts with an interesting idea and doesn't take it anywhere.  The plot turns on the idea that traditionally the Pope (like the British monarch) does not resign; and therefore, a Pope who feels that he does not have a calling, has a real problem; but there is no real resolution of the problem.  Various possibilities are suggested, but to suggest possibilities is not the same as constructing a plot; and the main character - the psychiatrist, played by Nanni Moretti - puts his energies into a rather silly subplot involving the Cardinals, rather than in developing the story.  In fact, there have been Popes who have resigned, most famously Pope Celestine, who resigned in 1294 and whose 'Grand Refusal' was referred to by Dante in his 'Divine Comedy'.  Celestine's resignation was hardly a great success: he was kidnapped by his successor and died in imprisonment.  Dante placed him in Hell.  I hoped that the ending of the film, at least, would be dramatic and possibly uplifing; but instead it is simply sad.  Sorry, Nanni  Stephen Cooper
B000QXDED6|3.0|Movie arrived loose in package, shaken loose by shipping?   Movie was CGI bloodfest, blood and spears all over. Story line and fight scenes were done well. The Spartan men's airbrushed abs were funny. Gerald Butler was quite fit, but most of the men were airbrushed, looked fake.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|The songs are great. Her jazzy and soulfull voice shines through in each one of the songs. I had been looking for this version of Valerie for a long time, and now I have it! The original versions of Tears Dry on their Own and Wake up Alone are also really fantastic. It is so sad that she had to pass away for these songs to come out. I would like to imagine that if she were still alive, she would be making music, soulful, sweet music.
0792163710|5.0|I love the story and characters in this movie. Sure lots of western genres play on the common theme of rancher and farmer feuds but this movie has a very visceral and heartfelt sincerity to it. Brandon De Wilde who debuts in this movie as the youngster, is mesmerized of the gun slinger who decides to help his father. Stellar performance by everyone and I rank this a best western story!
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I was reading the novel and I bought this to help me along. It mixes up the order of things, but it also helps you understand the plot and the main points a lot more! Absolutely fantastic. If it hadn't cut out some important parts, then I would have given it 5 stars.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This seems to be a decent sharpener except the angle is fixed at 45 degrees.  This is ridiculously blunt.  A typical pocket knife is sharpened at about 30 degrees (Buck recommends 13-16 degrees per side).    I managed to get an old junk knife to begrudgingly cut paper with it, so it isn't terrible, but on some of the other knives I've tried I can't get similar results.  It all depends on the steel, and many knifes just won't perform at such large angles. If it was a 30 degree sharpener, I think it would get a 5 stars.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I first found this style music on little steven's underground garage and always thought it was well worth the effort to search these albums out, This CD is reminiscent of tracks like Gants-smoke rings, Gonn-blackout of greteley, or the Sonics. In fact, I swear I hear some farfisa in little black submarines. It's almost as if someone went back in time and stole a garage band from the 60's and then brought them back to modern times, then let them absorb all of the hard edge sounds in modern music and then play the 60's style with modern sensibilities. Good thing too because if the 60's were actually this cool we'd all be dead. Only gripe i have is with the album art, WTF is with a dodge caravan trying to pass itself off as an El Camino anyways.....unless it's an inside joke and that's just what they called that turd, which I hope is the case because a band this cool mistaking a minivan for an el camino is inexcusable.  EDIT-I did a little more homework after my initial take, and yes, there is a story with the cover art and it does make sense, see comments below.
B00004XMTJ|4.0|I have loved this musical since I was in fifth grade, and now it's just gotten better with the DVD!! The picture is wonderful and the sound is richer!!! Plus, the extra bonus footage is fantastic! You get an inside look not only at the making of the video, but also at how the original musical began! My favorite actors, like Ken Page and Michael Gruber, are interviewed about their cat characters, their performances in the musical, and what it was like working with this cast. There an in-depth look at the costuming and make-up processes for the cats and how it changes for film.   This play is captured as it should be in its best form in this video adaptation. I recommend it to anyone!
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn has an easy to use interface and has many podcasts I either can't find or have to pay for on iTunes.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ok. Maybe some fans will consider me a sellout. But I don't understand why. I have loved these movies since I was a kid. I am 37 now. Just saw this blu ray edition complete. Haven't watched special features yet. But holy crap! The sound and picture on the original 3 are freaking amazing! I have seen them a hundred times and in my theater room it is like watching them for the first time! They are amazing. Picture and sound like you have NEVER seen before. All of the changes help the films on the high def big screen! Truly. First of all the packaging for the boxed set is amazing. The artwork and the layout of it is great. You can't buy the 2 trilogies separately and it look the same. I am extremely happy to own this set and am more than extremely happy that I did not listen to the naysayers. I was for awhile, then decided to take a leap of faith because I wanted to see them on blu ray. I was NOT in the least disappointed. This is my prized possession besides Lord of the Rings Extended Edition on Blu ray.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is fun and creative! It has tons of options and.everything you need not make awesome art! Me and my husband love it and my kids love it even more! And its real easy to use.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Bought the product because we have limited space but it doesn't work. Looks to be easy to install, it clicks correct on the position but on the screen you see yourself and the moves but no recognition. Was worth to try but at the end my daughter is sad with the product. Still need to move the sofa before playing.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Drawing Pad is a wonderful paint app, rivaled only by SketchBook Mobile. While comparing a casual app to a professional app may seem unfair, DP still holds up to scrutiny and passes with flying colors. From unique brushes to layer handling, it will surpass your expectations and deliver results. Its also a great tool to teach kids the language of professional graphic design.   There's nothing more positive I can say about you Drawing Pad.. will you please let my family go?   ..two times as Amazon's App of the Day, I finally see your clout. Let there be no more bloodshed.. I'm begging you. Please...
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Great ending to the Transformers trilogy, making up for the subpar Revenge of the Fallen.  It looks and sounds great on my home theater, and is the perfect movie to have in Blu Ray!
0385534639|5.0|This is my favorite book of the year.  I read books hoping to come across something as magical and meaningful as this book.  So many layers.  This would make a great book for a book club.  I so hated to see it end and hope there is a sequel.  Great writing, meaningful characters, spectacular setting.  It lived up to all my expectations. I remember the same satisfied feeling after reading the World According to Garp for the first time.  If you like John Irving or Pat Conroy, you'll love this book.
B004X80QNG|4.0|On the Palm device I owned before moving to Android, I was able to search my device for any search term.  I used my Palm as a searchable organizer with detailed notes in the calendar appointments, and I imported them into my Google calendar.  I still have entries going back 5 years or more that I need to search on occasion.  The stock Android calendar app does not have any search capability; I did find another app (Business Calendar) that allows me to search the previous 12 month period, but no further back.  Pocket Informant searches old calendar entries, and finds ALL of the entries with the search term.  As a test, I made a calendar update on the stock Android calendar app, and Pocket Informant picked up the change immediately.  I gave this app 4 stars because I have not fully explored all of the options, but the calendar search capability is enough to make this one a keeper.
031603441X|5.0|It's no secret that Keith Richards has led a wild life, perhaps personifying the mantra - sex, drugs and rock 'n roll.  His frequent drug-related misadventures have been well-chronicled over the years, along with his volatile relationship with Mick Jagger; however, much of his public persona is the result of accounts provided by the media, and much of it appears to be negatively biased against him.<br /><br />Certainly, Keith Richards has led a dangerously flawed life; yet, reading his own account of what went down - from his unsettling childhood in war-torn England, to the early days of Rolling Stones travail, to being a part of the most successful rock 'n roll band in the world - Richards comes across as an engaging and honest bloke, just trying to get along with the crazy cast of characters that inevitably became a part of his life.<br /><br />He makes no excuses; offers no apologies; his anecdotes are amusing at times, poignant at times, but above all else, very enlightening and quite entertaining.  His life has been filled with chaos, a certain degree of failure, but in the end, unimaginable success.  It's certainly a life worth reading about.
0385340575|5.0|This is another execellent thriller by Lee Child. I could not put it down. You can never guess what will happen in the next chapter, much less the ending.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this app is sweet. there is a huge selection of colors and textures. crisp and clean, very responsive to boot.
1892005034|5.0|Rosenberg has written many great books, all potential game-changers, whether for family therapy or conflict resolution between warring factions.<br /><br />My minor reservation, maybe not so minor, is that it is mostly only about how to express when something is wrong, albeit without telling the other person they're wrong.<br />However, it tries to teach how to do this in the most compassionate and effective way possible, so both parties go away feeling their needs are met, which would be terrific.<br /><br />In this book, no one is ever wrong; everyone is doing his/her best. Much like family therapist Carl Alosko in his book, Beyond Blame.<br />[Cross-referencing NVC with Meditation is another story. In brief, we do need Mindfulness to practice NVC(please see below)]:<br /><br />One very big difference with Rosenberg's NVC is that Alosko says never to go to a family member or spouse and say, \\"Why did you or didn't you do XYZ?\\"<br />Simply because the tone in saying that usually involves an implication of wrongness in the other. Those are toxic words, says Carl.<br /><br />In Non-Violent Communication or NVC, we are allowed to check things out and say e.g., \\"I noticed that you left the lights on last night. When you do that I feel confused and begin to wonder if we are on the same page. I need for us to have a little bit of consistency. Would you be willing to talk about what we want to do re: lighting?'<br />Here I must be careful of my tone(no eye-rolling:) and body language. It is not enough to talk the talk without walking the walk of compassionate communication.<br /><br />So, \\"Observation, Feeling, Need, Request\\" is how it goes. Or as my husband said half-jokingly but much more conversationally,<br />\\"I noticed you walked into my office. I feel anxious because i'm needing space. Would you be willing to leave?\\"<br /><br />The trick really is to make it more conversational and my husband is much more the natural diplomat than I. However NVC isn't about strict diplomacy.<br />We are not tricking anyone. More to the point, we are putting all our cards on the table.<br /><br />Most of us have been trained that if we show weakness by expressing a feeling nor a need then we will be laughed at or attacked, so in any society<br />awareness of even our own feelings and needs can be very difficult. We are trained to suck it up and go out and get 'em. Or get it.<br /><br />So identifying feelings and needs means psychological insight into our own feelings. I believe most of us do not do it automatically. It can take time even<br />for experienced practitioners, who will sometimes need cooling off periods to empathize with themselves first before communicating, just as much as lay-people do.<br /><br />It's helpful to say, \\"I'm too angry to talk now; can we discuss it later?\\" Rather than stonewalling with \\"the silent treatment\\", which can be experienced as hurtful, too.<br />[In [[ASIN:0684835398 I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression]] I learned that \\"alexithymia\\" means not recognizing one's own feelings.]<br />So yes a lot of work here; and the easy read is not half so easily executed in daily life. But I think NVC is a great manual.<br /><br />Here's my caveat. Rosenberg waits until Chapter Ten to talk about Appreciation. Marshall Rosenberg is a great man and I believe his one blind spot<br />is that in his admittedly very great life-work of MEDIATING NEEDS for people, it all focuses on what's wrong. If we only work with what's wrong,<br />we will be in danger of making the other person think that we are all about what's wrong with them and not enough about what's right with them.<br />Not that anyone is right or wrong, here; NVC is ALL beyond good and evil, or rightness and wrongness.<br />When someone is \\"evil\\" we call that \\"using a hurtful strategy\\" but no one is intrinsically evil.<br /><br />Negotiation can begin, once both parties' needs are articulated to both parties' satisfaction.With practice, NVC gets us to that point.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie is getting all the bad reviews.  It is a fun movie.  Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are both great!
B004K4IZ54|4.0|After seeing this revision of a cult Disney Sci-Fi classic last Christmas, I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.  In a time of never ending rumors circulating online about blockbuster film remakes because of a lack of great storytelling coming out of Hollywood, the time is just right for Walt Disney's TRON to finally journey into the 21st Century.  The 1982 Sci-Fi classic has been long overdue for a major upgrade and thanks to a visionary director, talented screenwriters, genius special effects artists and the wonders of 21st Century computer technology along with the many refined talents of an all star cast, comes a one of a kind digital spectacle more then twenty years in the making.     The film takes place twenty years after the sudden disappearance of computer genius and Encom executive, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) and with his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) struggling with a deep sense of personal loss and belonging in the present high tech digital age of technology, reluctantly takes it upon himself to reconnect with a long lost relic of his father's genius, an old arcade where he finds in his Dad's office an old computer that launches him into the unpredictable and unbelievable world of TRON.  Here, Sam has to match wits with highly skilled disc throwers, cunning opportunists and a notoriously dangerous replicate of a computer program of Kevin Flynn's design that runs amuck and starts a crusade against father and son as they fight to bring order and balance to the chaotic universe that has become the new world of TRON.  Fortunately, they are not only in their quest.  With the help of Quorra, the daring and charming heroine (Olivia Wilde) takes the lead as Sam's partner and protector throughout the adventure and along the way, the pair finds things out about themselves and their two different worlds that they could only discover together.  From there, the action and peril only builds as the film takes viewers on a ride where misadventures and surprises await the trio at every turn.      The film's computer generated visual effects only serve to heighten the grandeur of the characters' environment.  With unique set designs, space age costumes and eerily mysterious weather patterns, all blend in seamlessly well with the film.  Visionary director, Joseph Kosinski, brings an original architectural approach to the futurist revamp of the TRON franchise, which is very appropriate for its time when you're introducing a long and forgotten cult classic to a new generation of movie goers who for the most part, thought \\"Avatar\\" was the coolest thing they had ever seen.  For me personally, I liked TRON: Legacy way better because of the storyline and the special bonds that develop between the main characters.  Jeff Bridges does a superb job serving as the anchor and guide to the new film and newcomers Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde have excellent chemistry together on screen.  Garrett Hedlund plays the tender role of Sam perfectly and Olivia Wilde shows that Quorra can be loving, athletic and sexy all at the same time.     I bought the DVD Blu-Ray pack for the sake of the added behind the scenes special features.  It would have been easier if they had released a two disc version of the new TRON movie on DVD like they did with the original 25th anniversary edition but that's beyond me.  Viewing the special features on Blu-Ray came with a few disappointments with occasional glitches here and there but other then that, the deleted scene of what happened after Sam's adventure and the behind the scenes featurettes about the mythology of the TRON universe were all very impressive.  It will be interesting to see what else Disney has in store for the TRON movie franchise, I guess we'll have to wait and see.  This is an excellent example of what can happen when you combine imagination with the wonders of innovative technology to create something spectacular!    For those of you who haven't seen it, the film has a great message about creationand how struggling to find perfection can often leave one blind to exploring other infinite possibilities.  This film is definitely worth a look and with the advent of today's computer technology, well worth its weight in gold.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Hilarious, emotional, relatable and right on. 'Part memoir, part rant', this book was everything I was expecting and more. It made me THINK about what it really is to be a woman these days (something I don't get to do a lot of, what with all the child-rearing and other womanly stuff that consumes my life).<br /><br />Reading this book is like chatting with your funniest, coolest friend. I'll be reading it again ... and again.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Any movie with small, spazmatic, little creatures which are loyal to the hilt and silly as the day is long, you have my vote.<br /><br />Pros: Lots of good messages here and chances for Gru (the main character) to remediate his ways and become the good person he really is (but never loving his clever side).<br /><br />Cons: A little too much dialogue at times, but the action was mostly great.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Sub tasks are not indented.  No widget.  The calendar views are pretty enough, but even for free it's a waste if space.    I use \\"Google Task Organizer\\" and \\"Calendar Pad\\".  They have free versions, but even if you buy both, that's $6 instead of $10, and they are useful.  I was HIGHLY disappointed.  I got it free, and still installed it.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Every time this movie is re-released, it gets better. The 'Human Again' song was great, and added a little bit to our desire to know a little more about the stories of many of the supporting characters. The music was crisp and the picture was clearer than I remember it.<br /><br />Cons: Would like to have a digital copy included on all blu-ray/dvd combo packs.
B000002O3I|5.0|This is a compilation of two 1950s Howlin' Wolf albums on the Chess label. It contains a number of tracks that have become blues and rock standards since they were discovered and disseminated to a wider audience by British bands and musicians like the Rolling Stones, Cream, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and others. These tracks include Red Rooster, Smokestack Lightnin', Spoonful, Wang Dang Doodle, Shake For Me and Back Door Man.<br /><br />To give younger listeners an idea of how influential these recordings were, and still are,  recall the Led Zeppelin lyric from Whole Lotta Love on Led Zeppelin II, \\"Shake for me girl, I want to be your Back Door Man\\". That comes straight from this material recorded by Howlin' Wolf and others at Chess Records in Chicago. Note that the songs \\"Shake For Me\\" and \\"Back Door Man\\" both appear in this compilation.<br /><br />If you're interested in the blues, Howlin' Wolf is an artist you should know about. He's one of the giants of American blues and this album is a great introduction to his work. If you like bands like Led Zeppelin, you should listen to this earlier blues material to get an idea of its influence on Led Zeppelin and other blues based bands and musicians.
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter loves princess movies, and has totally fell head over heels for them. She especially took to rapunzel with her blonde hair and playful manner. This movie incorporates enough 'grown-up' humor to make the film a must-watch for every family member.
0399226907|5.0|this book is nice for the little ones it teaches them to count. it has bright colors,and the pages are durable. I bought mine for a penny.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|The story finally starts to make sense when we get more of the supporting characters to these main characters, and begin to know who they were and why they were so popular! It's always been nice to see a shout out to some of the most favored toys of my childhood.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas albums of all time.  Cold December Night is a beautiful song.  Get it and love it.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This is one of those movies where I knew that the story line provided for such a relate-able story and experience in life. Not to mention, that the set ups for the sequels were just plain awesome! Adding new toys along the way, etc. All great! Not to mention the time and effort that Disney and Pixar put into getting the characters right.<br /><br />Pros: See above.<br /><br />Cons: Nothing with the story or the animation. Would love to see these movies be able to be streamed for free after you buy them, not if you buy a specific pack. Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />Recommendations: A digital copy of the music included in every blu-ray/dvd pack.
B003L77G8I|1.0|The DVD appeared to be new but had numerous glitches while viewing, as if it had been scratched or used before. Very strange and frustrating.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great replacement calendar app for the EVO 3D, i was having problems with the sense one loading up but this one is great. Loads all my appointments on the widget really fast and syncs perfectly with all my google calendars
B004EPYZPS|4.0|I liked super 8 but a few things jumped out at me..for one..in 79 we NEVER called each other 'dude' as these kids did..AND we didn't wear 'backpacks' EVER unless going camping..and then they were big bulky and or boy scout canvass type..AND the bikes were new style bmx variety..sorry..we only had 'banana bikes\\" and or cruisers or 10 speeds. The BMX style may have been around but were not NOT common.I know Im picky,,i did like the alien tho! These kind of screwups irritate me for some reason. I mean if your spending wads of cash go to the correct prop room and get the right stuff for the era your trying to imitate.
0395389496|5.0|A timeless classic for all ages. Hear the magic of the sleigh bells and believe. Make reading this book a wonderful Christmas tradition.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Okay, so I saw this when it initially aired on Showtime.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you are a fan of the show whatsoever, this prequel will NOT disappoint!  In fact, the show gives some much appreciated background to the main characters in the original series.  I found myself rooting for the same characters in this series, as I despised in Blood and Sand.  My ONLY complaint or criticism about this has to do with it's length.  Gods of the Arena is only 6 episodes long, which is great b/c you aren't left hanging constantly, and it moves more quickly.  TOO quickly, IMHO.  It almost seems like they try to tell too much in 6 episodes.  If they added another 2 episodes, they could have easily drawn it out and still made quality episodes, but as it is, parts almost seem glossed over or rushed in order to tell everything they wanted to in the limited timeframe.    I was skeptical about the Amazon Instant Video having never used it before, but it works great!  That's why I chose something like this for my first purchase.  I am deployed and this makes it easy to get digital copies without having to worry about DVDs.  Perfect for fans like me!
B004X80QNG|3.0|Decent app and does perform as advertised.  However,  there are a number of similar apps available for android that are free and have the same or more functionality.  This app is fine for a free app but not worth paying the full price.

B004X80QNG|5.0|First calendar app that's actually useful and functional. Can view calendar by day, week or month. I simply love it. Works great on Sprint Nexus S 4G.
B005URRCUY|1.0|At this point you could split their career into two periods. There's the original blues heavy, raunchy riffs for days period where you were impressed at how great just drums and guitar could sound, and their over produced, gradually less bluesy, broader appealing sound, with Attack and Release being the dividing line. I'm not going to go down the \\"sell out\\" path because maybe they are still making the music for themselves and this is just where they've wound up, but I do have to say that what I originally found exciting about their music is officially gone, in my opinion. If you were a big fan of The Big Come Up, Thickfreakness, Rubber Factory, Magic Potion, or Chulahoma then just go ahead and pass this one up, those days appear to be over. If you like Brothers and Attack and Release then maybe this one is for you. I recommend giving this one a thorough sampling before you actually purchase it and maybe just buy the tracks that you care for instead of the entire album. At $9.99, I feel like I paid $9.99 too much.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This is an amazing SB video with some extremely talented pilots and riders! Best I have seen in a year or two!
B002G1K82Q|5.0|[[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]] Not only is the movie fantastic, moving, and sung beautifully but the special effects make the movie even better as the director explains what went into the characters,music,dance,etc...........Watch the special effects first to give the movie more meaning, if that's possible.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Having been a fan of Drake from his days as Jimmy on Degrassi, I have loved everything he's put out, but this album shows his growth and maturity. He beautiful combines hip hop and R&B, uses of different vibes, rhythms, instruments...it's great.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is an example of what can be acomplished when blending the creativety of a visonary wrighter/dirrector with the acting skills of accomplished thespians who love the charicters they portray.  The special effects put you into the movie as you sit on the edge of your seat rooting for the crew of serenity who you're sure to fall in love with.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book told the final chapter of the games.How Katniss fought for Peeta to stay alive.It tells about gale, and how him and katniss mend their friendship and how he supports katniss in everything that she is crazy enough to do. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE! This book serires is the best i've ever read props to the author!
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I needed shoes quickly for my impromptu wedding on a deck by the lake. These were informal enough that they matched our wedding style but weren't too cold for a November wedding on the lake in Michigan. They were very comfortable and kept me warm. However, they already had some frays on the sides from one hour of use. This is my first pair of Tom's, so I'm not sure if that's normal or not.<br /><br />Amazon had the cheapest price and they were on my doorstep in two days as always. The color is very beige-y, so if you order these for a wedding make sure the color will match whatever you're wearing - they are very dark for an ivory dress.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is a fun application to use, but don't try to compare it with Sketchbook Mobile. It is very fun if you just want to spend some time creating some basic pieces. You have the option of using markers, brushes, crayons, and even stickers and stamps. Then you have the ability to save the picture or share it. It works great both in Kindle Fire and my Droid X.<br /><br />The two major issues I find are 1) Not being able to change the size of the marker/brush. There are only two sizes for brush, so no fine detail is allowed... 2) No import of pictures!<br /><br />A minor annoyance is that there are not many different yellows!
B0068FZ0YM|5.0|I want to mention two things about this movie. First, how brilliant it is. And second, how beautiful the blu ray transfer looks.<br /><br />1. It's been six years since Brokeback Mountain hit theaters, and although I've watched the film countless times since, if I had only seen it once, I can promise you I would never forget it. It is a storyline that you dream about, relate to, cry over, reflect upon, write about, and become haunted by. I watch a lot of movies and enjoy plenty of them, but never has a film inspired me to analyze its story so deeply and to read books on it by film critics and touched fans. The fourth time I watched it at the theater, I took a notebook and filled pages with notes on the beauty of the poetic transitions and the development of characters. But even during my 20th viewing (or however many times it has been now) I discovered new richness and depth in the story.<br /><br />Without going on and on, I suppose I should just say that I love this movie. But before I talk about the blu ray, I just want to point out that this is not strictly a \\"gay\\" movie any more than Titanic or Romeo and Juliet are straight movies. Love is a force of nature, as the tag-line says, and it is not bound to one sexuality or another. The movie is, simply put, a human movie about human life, desire, hate, mistakes, and many other universal emotions that make up us all. I recommend you see it and after it's over, I recommend you see it again. Like Shakespeare, the story is endlessly multidimensional and deserves multiple viewings to truly grasp it all. Obviously Annie Proulx's original short story is also required reading (I would suggest reading it before watching, but either way is fine) as it contains endless brilliance as well. The overall talent involved with this project is stunning.<br /><br />But let's move on and talk about the blu ray.<br /><br />2. The first thing I should mention is that this \\"100th Anniversary\\" new packaging from Universal Studios doesn't mean that there are any new features or remastered transfers that are different from the already available [[ASIN:B001QWEE4E Brokeback Mountain  [Blu-ray]]]. It does come in combo-pack format, however, which includes a DVD and Digital Copy of the film if that interests you.<br /><br />As far as the picture quality goes, I feel pretty confident when I say that I was blown away by it. I saw the movie in theaters, on DVD, on TV, and just about anywhere else I could find it. On Blu Ray, it was a whole new experience. You can read labels on soup cans, feel the richness of the grass, and see foam in the spring waters. Without question, this is a scenic movie. It DESERVES to be seen in 1080p. If you have the DVD, great, it's pretty good too, but this is so worth the upgrade. The picture is so beautiful, sometimes I just pop it in the player on mute and let it run as a \\"screensaver.\\"<br /><br />The audio is also a joy. Gustavo Santaolalla's score is a masterpiece in itself and all the more beautiful in lossless DTS 5.1. Not to mention Heath Ledger's character is a bit of the shy type who mumbles as much as he speaks. I never had a problem understanding him, but the speech is noticeably clearer now for anybody who found that to be an issue.<br /><br />As far as the special features go, they are just repeats from the DVD release and admittedly not very exciting. Worth watching, sure, but not especially noteworthy. In some ways I think that's a good thing, though. As much as I would love Ang Lee to do a director's commentary, this type of movie will effect people in different ways and consequently I don't know that I would feel comfortable if the artists behind it revealed too much. That can easily frame the story in a certain way and ruin it for those who are touched by it in other ways. As I said, this is a universally human story, and it's a great movie for fans and scholars to discuss and compare experiences, but when the film-makers themselves start talking it...it can potentially ruin things.<br /><br />OVERALL: A+++ movie that will, without question, go into the Love Story Hall of Fame where it will stand next to other classics like Pride and Prejudice, Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights, and so many other touching classics, gay and striaght alike. As far as the Blu Ray, it also deserves an \\"A\\" rating for its beautiful HD transfer that is everything a fan could ask for and more. I highly recommend purchasing it.<br /><br />And, if you are like the many who can't stop thinking about the movie and want to dive deeper into the literary genius of the story, here are some books that inspired me: [[ASIN:0743294165 Brokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay]], [[ASIN:0786430443 Reading Brokeback Mountain: Essays on the Story and the Film]], [[ASIN:0739121650 On Brokeback Mountain: Meditations about Masculinity, Fear, and Love in the Story and the Film]], [[ASIN:0803226640 The Brokeback Book: From Story to Cultural Phenomenon]], and [[ASIN:1595941223 Beyond Brokeback: The Impact of a Film]].tentially ruin things.<br /><br />OVERALL: A+++ movie that will, without question, go into the Love Story Hall of Fame where it will stand next to other classics like Pride and Prejudice, Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights, and so many other touching classics, gay and striaght alike.

B004X80QNG|1.0|Once again another big failure for nice calendars. It does not sync with Google in the Kindle Fire. I thought that was the whole point of spending money in a calendar, it's a good thing I got it for free.  I have to say, though, that the interface is nice and works fine in my Droid X. It has not crashed and I have not experienced the issues other users have had.
1466401885|2.0|Okay, I liked the book pretty well.  I understand, it gets girls all hot and bothered and fantasizing about a guy that will feel that strongly for THEM.  But girls, let me say that I have had a boyfriend like Travis, down to the man-slutty, tough guy, never-lost-a-fight ways.  ALL the girls wanted him, ALL the guys were afraid of him/wanted to be his friend, he was totally possessive of me.  I was \\"the one\\" who changed his ways, he \\"loved\\" me more than anything else.  And you know what? It became the most abusive, frightening relationship of my life.  This book should be called \\"Red Flags: What to Watch Out for in a Relationship\\".  Travis is the abusive boyfriend in the early stages, ladies, don't be fooled by that possessive crap.  Other than that, I mean, I had to read it for what it was--just a book.  So they lived happily ever after? Okay.  But just know, this is not realistic and girls if a guy acts anything like Travis you need to RUN from him, not sleep with him.
B005V1WZ10|3.0|Haven't decided if I expected too much from this album since I love Get Up and Narcississtic Cannibal or it just takes more than one listen. Either way, I wasn't too impressed with my first sit down listening to The Path of Totality. The songs aren't that catchy (with the exception of the two mentioned). I just finished listening to the album, and I couldn't repeat how the songs went if you asked me. If anything, they are kind of repetitive. What hurts the most is that all of the aggression has been taken out of the band in this album since it is all dub-step. The good thing is that the songs seem short. I never thought I'd write a review like this for The Path of Totality. I was really looking forward to this release, and that is probably why I am so disappointed. Dub-step fans may love the hell out of it, but not me
B001UV4XIS|5.0|First off, the UV watch was fast, beautiful, seamless, pleasant from start to finish.  The MOVIE was superb.  I applaud J.K.Rowling for her complete Harry Potter masterpiece and to all involved in the making of the film.  Having read the book(s) many times over, I appreciate the aspects true to the printed story and those aspects unique to the film, which were appropriate to the storyline so that it was like getting a glimpse at a believable, alternate, just as enjoyable Harry Potter world.
B00316DDWW|5.0|Thank god for gorgeous material that we accidentally come across indiscriminantly meandering and browsing the world wide web.  This has turned into a life changing experience and a much needed breath of fresh air.  Karnivool is the Eastern Hemisphere's Tool, and the world's top up and coming act!  Get it if you like good music!
B004X80QNG|3.0|This app needs a widget, pointless without widget. Otherwise calendar option is pretty nice, layout is efficient life to be about to see the entire week
031617615X|3.0|I bought this book after seeing Breaking Dawn Part I in theaters. I have enjoyed the movies, and did not want to wait for the next film to find out the fate of Bella and her baby. Now having read the book, I cannot imagine how they will turn the rest of this into a good film. Overall, the movies have been better than the books (which is rare - it's usually the other way around). If they leave out a lot and change the ending, they may have a chance at a decent final film.  Still, if you are a fan of the movies and have read the previous books in the series, then I do recommend you finish what you've started and read Breaking Dawn. Of course it's not great literature. It's more like fast food for the mind: quick, easy, and enjoyable going down, with some regret and nausea after you're finished.

B004X80QNG|2.0|I loved Pocket Informant during my Windows Mobile days. Back then it was my \\"go to\\" app even though it cost as much as desktop software. I wanted to get it before the FAOTD, but considering how expensive it is and seeing all the negative reviews, I decided to go a cheaper route.  I'm glad I did.  PI is stuck in the past. It has a very nice, clean interface, but no widgets?  Seriously, for the price they're asking that's a mortal sin.  There are much cheaper (as in \\"Free\\") organizer apps out there that are more useful because you can place a quick access widget on your homescreen.
0470449764|4.0|Pro's of this book:  - All the questions in this book are OFFICIAL GMAT questions, written by the GMAC company.  This is the greatest advantage of this book: It allows you to get used to GMAC's specific style and topics covered.  Note that books such as Princeton Review, Kaplan, Manhattan, etc, are definitely helpful, but do not always perfectly replicate GMAC's style.        - Lots of practice questions: More than 300 problems, about half of which are problem-solving and half of which are data sufficiency. Great for quant practice.  - Explanations are decent.  Maybe not sufficiently simplified and detailed if you are just starting out and have forgotten how to, say, multiply fractions and do basic algebra.  But after having reviewed math basics (using MGMAT, Veritas, or other), the explanations are generally sufficient to understand where you went wrong.  - The questions are relatively easy, so its great for the first 1-2 months of studying for the GMAT and building a strong quantitative foundation.  - The paper is good (Unlike Princeton Review!)  - The layout is perfect.  You can choose whether to work in the section without explanations (for ex: if you are timing yourself on a batch of questions at a time), or to work in the \\"explanation\\" section, so you immediately have the explanations in front of you.  Note that the \\"explanation\\" section also lists the original problems, so no need to keep flipping back and forth between problem and explanation!  - Its not expensive  Con's of this book:  - The \\"math review\\" at the beginning is NO WHERE NEAR SUFFICIENT to cover all the tested topics.  Thus you will NEED to supplement with additional quantitative strategy guides from other companies if you are aiming for a high score and/or have a weak quantitative skill level.  I would recommend the 5 MGMAT quant series.  - The book lacks challenge questions.  Its great for practice in the first 1-2 months of studying and building a strong quant foundation.  HOWEVER, if you areaiming for a high score (+Q40), this book alone will not get you there.   Overall, A MUST HAVE for (1) weak quant scorers (2) building a strong quant foundation in the first 1-2 months of study and (3) getting used to GMAC's style.  However, before using this book, you should review math basics using strategy guides such as MGMAT, in order to feel more comfortable with the explanations.  Also, to get a high score, you will need to find another source for more challenging problems.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|*Tested on a LG Thrive*<br /><br />I've been using Sketchbook Mobile for a few months, and I absolutely love it, but when I saw Drawing Pad as Amazon's free app of the day I figured I'd give it a shot, and compare it against Sketchbook Mobile. I have to say that I love the interface for Drawing Pad, it is intuitive and user-friendly and I have no complaints. I would feel comfortable letting a child use this app as it is so easy and fun to play with. There are some great tools for the more hardcore of users, but all in all this is just an app to sketch a doodle every now and then.<br /><br />This is a great app for FREE, so take advantage of the next few hours! It's well worth the usual asking price, so don't shy away if you are looking for a fun drawing/doodle app for the kiddos!<br /><br />Some things that I really love:<br /><br />*Price - Even after the daily freebie passes the price is still better than most drawing apps!<br /><br />*Crayons! I love the addition of Crayons! It's something Sketchbook is sorely missing! This amps up the fun for kids and adults alike!<br /><br />*Stickers! Stickers are a fun way to dress up even the most drab of sketches.<br /><br />*Eraser - The eraser is a MUST and it is VERY easy to use. Some early apps had no eraser option and simply made you erase the entire screen. Drawing Pad offers a very simple eraser that bypasses a screenwipe!<br /><br />*Save Your Work with the tap of your finger!<br /><br />Things that COULD be better!<br /><br />- The size of the app! For a lot of us 20mbs is too much for a single app! I know they wanted to pack in loads of features, but if I didn't have an SD card I would probably have a hard time keeping this on my device.<br /><br />- Loads faily slow on my Thrive, but it's an entry level Android phone so this is probably just an issue some of us will experience!

0307943194|5.0|[[ASIN:0307943194 The Litigators]]  The storyline is typical Grisham.  If you like Grisham, as I do, you'll enjoy this tale of a team of  lackluster ambulance chasing lawyers finally getting their hooks into a \\"big case.\\"  I ordered the unabridged CD version and was not disappointed by Dennis Boutsikaris who did an excellent job reading.  I'm old enough to remember the wonderful radio dramas of the 1940s and 50s.  This reader took me back to those days.  He was able to do the narration and all the voices.  The only thng missing was the \\"sound effects man.\\"
B004A8ZX28|2.0|Sometimes while watching a moronic piece of sophistry like UNKNOWN you just feel like throwing your hands into the air and asking the heavens why you wasted upteen moments of your life that you will never, ever, get back.  And when said question is answered by a scene between Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella that borders somewhere between mind-numbing incredulity and unabashed vaudeville it becomes apparent that even the metaphysical realm recognizes the utter futility of your interrogative.  Which handsomely summarizes UNKNOWN, an alleged mystery/thriller that tries to be clever but can never get out of its own half-baked way.<br /><br />Liam Neeson looks as confused and bewildered as the viewer playing humble scientist Dr. Martin Harris (or, is he really Martin Harris, pray tell?).  Involved in an auto accident causing a head injury further causing amnesia, Martin only has fleeting recollections of his past, and--gasp!--his own wife doesn't recognize him, and what's more--triple gasp!--someone else is pretending to be him!  Accordingly Martin goes about tearing up Germany as he attempts to get to the bottom of this diabolical dilemma, accompanied by an unwilling cab driver (Diane Kruger).  So we have contrived, melodramatic, and zany moments, culminating in Martin fully recovering his memory when it's time to kick some serious arse.  UNKNOWN had a brief window to be extraordinarily clever and original, but missed it by a country kilometer.  At least I got a little exercise throwing my hands in the air.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B005HGZVEM|4.0|It is a great joy to listen to an artist that you have been following for almost 30 years and hear him having a lot of fun doing his personal favorits.  Chris Isaak is neither Elvis or Jerry Lee, but the fondness he has for this early rock and roll music shines all over this albumn.  I enjoyed this cd so much that I ordered the 2 disc version also.

Normally I would have to break through my own lazyness to motivate for a run and typicaly do my knee in once my distance increases and I realy start to feel fit.  Those days are behind me.  The book gives inspiration to all runners - though I dont plan on running 100 miles - just yet - i look at running not as a chore but as part of my existence.

B006BXTOFC|5.0|Upon my first listen I didn't know what to think because it is not their typical sound.  I came to love their old stuff that was just nasty bluesy rock.  I have listened to Magic Potion about a million times.  I knew this had some good grooves but I still wasn't sure.  I went for a second listen in my head phones and I have been dancing to it ever since.  This is going to be playing in my car for a long time and making my commute groovy.
B001HN697M|4.0|Having seen one of these blue and white violence fests, I had to see the prequel, which is actually better than one of the later films in this series. It's a Romeo and Juliet tale, set amid werewolves and vampires, apparently today's trendiest movie creatures. There's a lot of pseudo-pompous dialogue delivered in cut-rate British diction. The violence is extreme, but really not that bloody, given that dozens of heads are rolling at any given time. The main virtue here is brevity. It clocks in at around 90 mins, i.e., just right.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this app over several devices since discovering it a couple of years ago on my palm pre.  By far, the best one I've come across.

B003RNZDKY|5.0|I began listening to the Roots 17 years ago in 1994.  My first album was DO YOU WANT MORE.  For about a year I listened to it over and over and over and over.  Chomping on it like a piece of gum that could just never go stale.  I own, every single album, studio, live, and a few \\"bootlegs\\" or audience recordings.  In fact when UNDUN dropped I bought it at midnight.  I wanted to write a review of this one, because, I believe, unequivocally, it is one of the best works of art I have listened to.  It is masterful.  All of their albums, in my mind are exceptional, and it would be hard to rate them or rank order them.  That being said, if you are NEW to The Roots, I may suggest starting with this one, and possibly moving back to DO YOU WANT MORE, and if you still don't \\"get it\\" try \\"THINGS FALL APART\\".  The Roots are not just a hip hop group, they are artists, with tremendous talent, skill, and depth.  Their lyrically dexterity is evident on everything they stamp their name on to, but the substance and depth is amazing.

B004K4AVAG|5.0|I love Gaga.  She is amazing, unique and really relatable to me and I absolutely love this album.  I wasn't sure about Judas or Born this Way at first but Judas has grown to be one of my all time favorite songs.  Government Hooker is amazing hands down.  She is so creative and crazy that her music just takes me to another world.  I have honestly been listening to this album everyday in my car since the day it has come out.  Bloody Mary is insane I am in love with it.  Heavy Metal Lover, amazing.  Americano is so catchy and unlike anything out there today.  Not a huge fan of Hair because it is a little depressing but also relatable to many.  You and I is the only song I can't stand.  I have deleted it off my itunes and change it every time it comes on the radio.  It is really the only Gaga song I can say that I hate.  It just isn't like her and I just can never get into it.  Electric Chapel is amazing.  Marry the Night is the perfect way to start off the album.  It gives her whole life story in the video and I can really feel the emotion and depth in the song when I listen to it.  Absolutely love it.  One of my favorite albums of all time.  Gaga is amazing and one of the best entertainers of all times.  Can't wait to see what she comes up with yet.  I feel that she is the voice of so many people and that she really stands up for those who are misunderstood.  Love her so much!  Gotta love anyone who dares to  be different.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It works great for my Samsung galaxy s2 except for a slow load time. However, it is missing the survival endless mode. So once you finish adventure mode, it doesn't have too much replay value. If the mode gets added, it would be a solid 5 stars
B004LFO0FG|5.0|I truely believe Britney has come a long way from where she started.  I will always be a die hard fan and I've never heard a song I truly didn't like.  Honestly this album really grew on me.  At first I wasn't sure how I felt but I really grew to love it.  Drop Dead Beautiful has one of my favorite beats on the record and I can't stop listening to Inside Out.  Hold it Against Me really was what turned me onto to this CD in the first place.  I Wanna Go is just average in my opinion but Trouble For Me is one of my favorites because it really relates to an instance in my life.  Trip to Your Heart is a feel good song and I really don't have anything bad to say about any of the songs on this album.  Overall, can't stop listening to it over and over again.  Love Brit:)
0307887898|5.0|I wish I had this book 16 years ago when I started several companies.  It would have made all the difference with the speed  of development.

B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I saw the movie in theaters and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! It was so much fun. Antonio Banderas is so great as Puss in Boots that you think, well, Puss in Boots just sounds like Antonio Banderas. (Yeah, that made total sense.) I was amazed that it turned out that the trailers didn't just show the funny parts (as seems to happen all the time these days with movies) and that the whole movie was really good. Not a boring moment in the film.   I can't wait to get the DVD when it's released. (HELLO, Dreamworks! This would be a perfect Christmas (Hanukkah, Kwanza, insert your holiday of choice here) gift. Release it already!  :-)
B005TTEFRG|2.0|This reprise of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film of the `80's doesn't improve any except for some updated computer graphics, which are actually pretty good.  Unfortunately, not much else is.  Conan (Jason Momoa) is born on the battlefield, cut out of his mother's womb by dad as she lay dying.  As a teen he is forced to watch the execution of his father (Ron Perlman), so of course he is out for revenge.  That's pretty much it.  The head bad guy and wannabe god is played with gusto by Stephen Lang (\\"Avatar\\", TV's \\"Terre Nova\\").  Lang's more recent tough guy characters are a long way from his role as a milk-toast tabloid reporter in \\"Manhunter.\\"  Of course there is a hottie who Khalar (Lang) is after.  Something about being a pure blood that completes the magical spell to raise his wife from the dead.  Tamara  is played woodenly by Rachel Nichols.  Yes, of course she also is spunky and spars with Conan before they get real friendly.  Still, there is no chemistry between them so we don't really care much.  The best thing about the film other than the \\"Topless Wenches\\" (so credited at the end) may be an eyebrowless Marique (Rose McGowan), the witchy daughter of Khalar.  She gives even old dad pause.  The picture quality is excellent allowing for good viewing of distant wenches.  The audio in DTS-HD is at its bombastic best with plenty of action all around.
B004X80QNG|4.0|So imagine my surprise today when I saw this as the free ap of the day when I bought it only a few days ago for $9.99. First, let me say I do not regret paying full price for this. PI is already helping me in ways I could not imagine, and in my home office I have two computers, a land line and a smart phone humming away all day.  This little app has helped me centralize & organize my appointments, tasks and forgotten-to-schedule stuff, and everything else you can imagine - all on my Droid X. It syncs with my Google work and personal calendars as well as with several Google task lists. It allows me to prioritize, categorize, set alarms and reminders and more. I can see my week at a glance or look at everything I need to do today and should have finished yesterday. I read GTD years ago, and this app is pushing me back to that method.<br />Cons:  The help is pretty much non-existent. A \\"quick start\\" guide would be helpful. If one comes with the app, I could not find it, and I am not a computer novice. It took a bit of searching to find the manual for the Android version on line. If there is a link in this app to the manual, I could not find it. But after watching a couple of Youtube videos, I got a decent start and am using it to help me GTD.<br /><br />The \\"not great\\" is really on the shoulders of Amazon. I also put this on my Kindle Fire so I could manage my life on a 7\\" screen. Sadly, the Kindle Fire version does not sync with Google Calendar, and I have not found a way to sync what is on my Droid X PI with my Kindle Fire PI.  I was told this is because of the Kindle Fire, not the software. So if you use Google calendars, this is pretty useless on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />So even as a novice PI user, I love this.  I do not mind that I paid for it and now it is free; Just watch some Youtube videos and go to the developer's website to download the newest manual for the Android version.
B005J7K964|5.0|Like many others, I discovered Moroder's restored version of \\"Metropolis\\" before seeing any of the numerous other iterations.  I borrowed a copy of a laserdisc version as I had made the switch to that technology in the mid 1990's.  Since I had to return it, I made a copy on VHS which I subsequently copied onto DVD.  It has always been a favorite, primarily due to the rock soundtrack Moroder added in order to attract a wider audience.  I certainly think he succeeded.  The biggest improvement with this Blu ray treatment isn't the video quality which hasn't really been upgraded much but the great sound brought out by the DTS-HD Master audio.  The soundtrack will give your system a workout.  In one segment of the film, the workers under the spell of \\"bad\\" Maria shut down the machines.  As a result, the homes of the working class begin to flood, threatening the lives of their children.  Both my subwoofers \\"woofed\\" for about a minute without pause.  Moroder's soundtrack is available on CD and download by the way.<br /><br />Make no mistake however; this version is no substitute for the real deal, which currently is \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" which clocks in at more than an hour longer.  Comparing one of my favorite scenes where the robot Hel becomes seductive \\"bad\\" Maria at the \\"house of sin\\" you can see where the picture quality is dramatically better and that several \\"found\\" short sections (scratchy though they may be) were added back in.  We get to see much more of \\"bad\\" Maria dancing and teasing in the \\"Complete\\" version probably because the scene was likely censured by the Nazis.  The \\"Complete\\" restoration is simply magnificent and the recreation of Gottfried Huppertz's original score is beautifully done.  Moroder's other distinctions include the use of subtitles instead of title cards.  There are pros and cons of either but the title cards are more authentic.  Moroder also used tinting or colorization in much of the film.  This ranged from modest use of sepia tones to blues and reds.  This actually wasn't unusual for the silent films of the day, but there is no suggestion that director Fritz Lang used the technique for this masterpiece.  The bottom line is that I love both versions.nd reds.

B005DZ35RC|5.0|First off, this is not a remake. This is another adaptation of a book by Rauld Dahl. The first adaptation, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, lost many themes and ideas from the book. It was meant for simpler viewers. Baisicaly calling all fat people greedy and all people who watch tv dumb. This movie better explains that, showing that the fat character was eliminated for being greedy, not fat, which I'm sure you should know is always parent's fault and causes major self-esteem isues today. The tv-adicted character was eliminated for not having any imagination, not for just watching too much tv. Watching a lot of tv is only bad if the person just does it out of boredom and does not expect to learn (let's not forget that if you're watching this, you're watching it on tv.) In the 70's movie, characters are being eliminated just for the simplest of traits that most good kids have. And Gene Wilder does not resemble the character of Willy Wonka at all as he was in the book, Johnny Depp does. Same goes for the actors who played Charlie, Violet, Violet's Mother, Mike, and Veruca's Father. In the \\"original\\" movie (which almost killed the book) Charlie was just as horrible as the other kids because he fell into the trap and drank the fizzy lifting drinks, only to be saved by luck. In this movie, Charlie is seen for what he is, a good kid with morals.

B004X80QNG|3.0|I don't like the stock HTC app for Google Calendar so I've been using Business Calendar and thinking it's a great improvement. This app is not as good as Business Calendar.  I don't see that much functionality with this app, but an easier way to switch between the Calendar \\"views\\". It also has a task tool, but I'm not sure if it syncs with Google Tasks. I don't use Google Tasks anyway (just make events in Calendar).

0446573019|5.0|Baldacci continues to deliver. In his latest, Zero Day, he creates a totally new character, completely unique, but in the same larger than life mold like Oliver Stone or Shawn King. John Puller is a former Army grunt and now a military criminal investigator, with additional baggage of a famous, buy aging military father and a brother sentenced to life imprisonment for treason. He's also a combination of Bruce Lee, John Wayne, and Sherlock Holmes.  Puller is assigned to assist a WV murder investigation of an Army colonel. The story grabs you right from the beginning and Puller slowly peels back the onion of what on the surface appears as a backwater mining town in the middle of nowhere with no future. The plot becomes more and more complex with Puller barely staying one step ahead of his adversaries as well as staying alive. The plot twists come fast and furious and the ending is suspenseful and well executed.  It's obvious that Baldacci was touched by his prior work, Divine Justice, and wanted to return to an ignored region of the USA. Rather than reprise Oliver Stone in a Boondocks 2, Puller is the perfect loner who should have plenty of miles in him for future stories.  Well done, David!
B001ASVXSE|5.0|Some of the recordings were done over half a century ago, but the remastering has been done rather skillfully.  My favorite, the Sibelius violin concerto, still can make me weep.  Oistrakh's talent and skill are phenomenal, and I'm enjoying the recordings daily.  It's money well spent, to fill an old Victorian two-story with such lovely sound; it even relaxes the animals.

0865478570|5.0|This author presents many fascinating ideas in this small volume dense with insights into language and communication.  And best of all, he delivers this information with humor, verve, and style.  Bellos tells us that although there are perhaps as many as 7,000 languages spoken in the world today, most are spoken by very small groups.  To engage with the outside world, \\"vehicular languages\\" are needed; that is, languages learned by nonnative speakers for the purpose of communicating with native speakers of a third tongue.  Some eighty languages are considered vehicular, but knowing just nine of them would permit effective conversation with around 90 percent of the world's population.  The language with the largest number of nonnative users is English, but English is not the language with the largest number of native speakers, which currently is Mandarin Chinese.  Perhaps I have thus far given the impression that this book is just  a compendium of fun language facts.  It is, but that's not the point of the book at all.  Rather, the author sets out to define translation, and then determine what makes a good translation, and finally to consider why we need translation at all?  Why don't we all just learn to speak a common language?    In characterizing translation, Bellos explains that \\"meaning\\" is not the only component of an utterance; there is also tone of voice, context, layout, intention, culture, form (such as poem, play, legal document), the identities of the communicants together with the relationship between them, etc.  In fact, as Bellos observes, what matters the most is not a word-to-word congruence.  On the contrary, it is more important for the translator to preserve the force of the utterance in another language.  Thus the translator must take into account such factors as levels of formality in conversation, as well as customs and rules about how men and women and people of different social classes may relate to each other.  Importantly, he adds, \\"No sentence contains all the information you need to translate it.\\"  One of my favorite examples in the book is this anecdote:  \\"In many parts of Africa... casting branches in the path of a chief expresses contempt, whereas in the Gospels it is done to mark Jesus's return to Jerusalem as a triumph...  Revision of the Gospel's account of Palm Sunday is both absolutely necessary to avoid giving the wrong message to African readers and at the same time impossible without profoundly altering the story being told.\\"  Another great example given by Bellows concerns a statement released by the office of Otto von Bismarck, the German chancellor, in 1870.  The statement referred to a communication made to the French by \\"the adjutant of the day.\\"  In German, this is a high-ranking courtier, but in French, this is a mere warrant officer.  The French took the meaning of this word-for-word translation as a sign of grievous disrespect, and an international incident ensued, culminating in a declaration of war by the French six days later.  Translating humor is a particular challenge; meaning must almost always be changed to get the particular point across the original is trying to make.    Moreover, translators try to get across the style of an author or what makes him or her distinct:  \\"The question is: At what level is the Dickensianity of any text by Dickens located?  In the words, the sentences, the paragraphs, the digressions, the anecdotes, the construction of character, or the plot?\\"  All of these considerations (and many more delineated by Bellos) mean that just knowing the words of another language is insufficient to be a good translator.  At the end of the book, Bellos asks if one day we might just be able to have the equivalent of a translation fish in our ears, as was the device used in \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe,\\" and then we would all be able to understand one another totally.  He suggests this is unlikely, since linguistic diversity serves other functions besides the conveyance of meaning in different formats:  it also serves to establish lines of in-groups and out-groups, and helps form part of the identity of an individual as a member of a specific community.  \\"Every language,\\" he notes, \\"tells your listener who you are, where you come from, where you belong.\\"  It is not poetry that is lost in translation, he avers, it is community.  But translation can accomplish almost everything else to enable human beings to communicate thought.  He concludes \\"We should do more of it.\\"  Evaluation:  This is a highly entertaining and thought-provoking treatise on what comprises communication and the surprisingly small but important role that language plays in the process.  I loved this book.

The actors are perfect, there are many quotable lines, and...it's a Harry Potter movie. Seriously. That's all that needs to be said, really.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will start this review by raving how Awesome Amazon.com is with Customer Service! I had bought this item in pre-order, and when they mailed to me, the courier lost it, so Amazon sent me another copy completely free of charge! They are, without a doubt, the most amazing webstore in the World!<br /><br />Now that I have said that, I'll take the time to tell you why this edition is an insult to Star Wars Fans everywhere. Unfortunately, the fact that we keep rewarding Lucas by buying the raped editions of our childhood memories means that he will continue degrading the brand until Star Wars is just another movie, instead of the legend it once was.<br /><br />About the prequel trilogy, plenty has been said about why it sucks (see here: [...]). But this edition has 9 blu-rays: 3 of the prequel trilogy, 3 of a raped edition of the original trilogy, and 3 of extra content. I bought this Complete Saga edition mostly for the extra content, and because, despite its shortcomings, the blu-ray gave the prequels its shine in aesthetics. No doubt, they are some of the most beautiful scenes ever shot, despite they not making any sense at all or having absolutely no storylines, much less credible ones.<br /><br />About the original trilogy, though, there is a lot to say that hasn't been said. First of all, while it is true that works of art are never finished, but merely abandoned, change does not automatically translates into improvements. However, there are some improvements in the trilogy. Not everything is bad. And remember, this isn't the first time Lucas makes changes to the original Trilogy. He changed them when he released the 20th annyversary edition in the 1990s, and then changed them again in the DVDs. There are changes I like and changes I dislike. Most of the changes I dislike, I consider them bad because they either reduce the impact of the narrative or reduce the emotional force of the story. I find it surprising that, for a space opera loosely based on a Kurosawa classic, Lucas can't understand that the old eastern adage that \\"less is more\\" is particularly relevant to emotions in narratives.<br /><br />Of course, I'm upset that Han still doesn't shoots first (a fact that added character and depth to him), and of course I despise that Darth Vader now screams like a little girl \\"NOOO\\" when saving Luke in \\"Return of the Jedi\\", instead of the original silence that added tension and allowed us to see and feel the conflict within Vader and, more importantly, feel the relief of Vader suprising us with his decision of saving his son and returning to good. But those are easy to see. I am more upset by the countless small stuff that add up and reduce the overall quality of the film simply by being there. An example of this is how \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is completely ruined in the last few seconds. In the original film, Luke, Leia, C3PO and R2D2O watch from a window how the Millenium Falcon, piloted by Lando and Chewbacca, start the gigantic quest of searching for Han Solo, and the impossibility of their challenge is made clear on us by the smallness of their ship and the enormous size of the Galaxy the get lost in before fade out. In the new blu-ray version, immediately after the Falcon penetrates the Galaxy, we see a reverse shot of Luke and Leia from outside the window that pans out and shows us the might of the Rebel Fleet. As you can see, in the original version, we were left wanting to see how would our gang make it against impossible odds! It was an emotionally charged, perfect ending to a dark movie. Instead, in the new version, we see the aesthetically pleasing,, but otherwise pointless might of the Rebel Fleet, which tells us that we don't need to worry about Lando and Chewie because the Rebellion is mighty. Since we don't need to worry about them, why do I even want to watch the sequel? These are the little things that completely ruin the Saga for me.<br /><br />So, yeah, this edition is great on visuals, but drastically poorer than all other versions that preceded it. I recommend you save your money and buy older versions instead. Don't do what I did and reward Lucas for ruining the best films ever. Don't make this insult to Star Wars fans a success.ed it.

B006IO045S|5.0|After Killshot, you would think the Castle writers would take it down a notch. Instead they give us a solid episode starting with Castle and Beckett waking up handcuffed on a mattress in a dark and dirty basement. As the couple tries to recreate their memories so they can escape from their captivity, the B line story has Ryan and Esposito discussing the pre-wedding hoops (tests) Ryan is about to endure. The A story with Castle and Beckett mirrors the relationship give and take that Ryan and Esposito discuss. This episode kept me guessing until the end as to why the murder victim ended up face down in a dirty motel room. The criminals gave me chills. And Captain Gates gets high marks for getting the info she needed to get her people back.

B000ZN8036|5.0|Into the Wild captured the adventure I longed for, the rebelousness I struggled with as a young woman, and the angst I experienced as the mother of an adventurous and rebelious son. It is a summary of the challenge I wanted to toss to the world, and the fear, today, that I try to repress as a mom. The journey of every young man and young woman is tauntingly inviting, yet the pain of a mother not knowing the final outcome for so long .... it haunts me. After watching the movie, I encourage every mom to call her son, and every son to call his mom. If that's too hard, write a note. And remember, never pass on an opportunity to say \\"I love you.\\"

My only remark as to any downfalls is the ability to blend colors together before or after they are drawn.  But beyond that, it works great and can't be beat for the free app of the day.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|This movie was very excellent.  We were very empressed.  The ending was just wonderful.  We give it a thumbs up for sure.
B005URRCUY|4.0|OK... so I didn't just LOVE \\"Brothers\\" (the last Black Keys album) though I did appreciate it for what it was... a dirty south blues/soul rock album. That said... I think these guys have grown by leaps and bounds over the last year of success! The songwriting in El Camino is more mature and harks of a band that knows themselves well. I also think that Danger Mouse's involvement definitly added something to the production quality here.  Over all... GREAT album!  My favorite songs are:  Little Black Submarines  Lonely Boy  My least favorite song:  Run Right Back
B005J29HCQ|4.0|If you love or loved the Beach Boys, get this.  I wouldn't rank it \\"superior to\\" the 2004 version with Brian and his new band, but (and that's a BIG BUT) it IS \\"the BOYS\\" singing when they were all 25 or thereabouts.  I love this CD.  I listen to it almost endlessly and often.<br /><br />IF you love the 2004 version, you'll LOVE this.  Same or similar harmonies as 2004, the instrumentation is more subtle, however.  I just love the \\"boys\\" in their prime.  I can take or leave the \\"practice sessions\\" (disk 2), but Disk 1 is \\"as much as Brian got done back in the day.  It is truly phenomenal.  And yet, never released??  What a shame!!  And how different would the pop music history be, if it HAD been released?  Oh well.<br /><br />I wish some of the songs from 2004 had been done \\"back then.\\"  I miss Blue Hawaii, and one or two others.  I GOT to say, though, until you've heard THIS version of \\"Surf's Up,\\" you've just not heard the song.  This version knocks any other, and i mean ANY other version right out of the water.  I thought Vince Gill did well with it, and he did.  But, this version is better than that.  If for no other reason than that song, buy this CD.  You won't regret it.
0307341577|3.0|I think I ended up feeling a little disappointed with this book. It set off like a rocket, and was wonderfully dark with a great anti-heroine - but somewhere towards the end it fizzled out for me. Maybe it's because I read so much horror, I always expect something other than human frailty to be the cause of the darkness. A good read, but not really my thing.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This was a very good movie and fitting end to a great series.  This is one of the darkest movies I have ever seen.  I mean literally dark....I had to adjust my tv's brightness to some the details.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the ultraviolet issues have caused all the negative reviews which have nothing to with the actual movie.  I watched the movie on Instant Watch through my Roku.  When I saw that the movie had 2.5 stars, I thought I was in for a sucky movie.  But not true.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day has possessed one of the most beautiful and distinctive singing voices ever recorded. This is clearly evident in such classic film musicals as \\"Love Me Or Leave Me,\\" \\"The Pajamaa Game,\\" \\"Calamity Jane\\" and \\"Billy Rose's Jumbo.\\"   Doris recorded many top-notch albums for Columbia Records in the 1950s-1960s that offered a strong cross-section of the Great American Songbook. Her voice became even richer and smokier as she matured, making it such a shame that she abandoned recording in the 1970s while focusing on her television work and burgeoning animal rights efforts. Happily, she returned to the studio in the mid-1980s to sing several lovely songs which are released for the first time on this great album. The nostalgic \\"Disney Girls\\" is a favorite but the uptempo \\"Heaven Tonight\\" is a highlight too,  as well as the title ballad \\"My Heart.\\"  There's also a trio of vintage Day tunes that display her versatility well -- the autobiographical \\"Ohio,\\" the jazzy \\"My One & Only Love\\" (from her sessions with Andre Previn) and the highly-emotional \\"My Buddy,\\" dedicated to her late son, music producer/writer Terry Melcher.  This album is more than just a \\"sentimental journey\\" for Doris Day fans. It's a collection for all lovers of pop music and a voice for the ages.

She loved it so much that she immediately bought a copy and not only that, but the guests who she hosted loved her dinner so much that they bought it too.  Everything I've made from it so far has been a winner; the dishes are simple, but the flavors are so complex.

140053271X|1.0|My 11 year-old daughter saved her money for a long time to purchase an eBook reader.  She finally selected a NOOK Touch and purchased the eBook (only) without the extended warranty. She selected the NOOK because of the plethora of free books offered for this platform and because of the touch screen display.<br /><br />The touch screen shattered after a week of light use. Unfortunately, this breakage is not covered under the normal NOOK warranty. She was devastated.<br /><br />I gave her the now-ancient Kindle 1 that we acquired in 2007.  This Kindle has traveled extensively and seems absolutely bullet-proof.<br /><br />Neither my daughter nor I will purchase another NOOK.  The NOOK Touch is a piece of junk.

0385343175|1.0|Another bomb from Ms. Steel.  What a waste of time.  I am so sick of her constant repetition.    I don't know why I read her books, except to speculate that I have OCD and it is a \\"have to\\" for me.  I have suffered through her last books and hope I can break away after this one.  This was horrible.  I would like to read a simple story with her characters living in small town America.  I know, I know, you write what you know.  But I am not impressed with her fancy European locales.    I wonder how she would handle a woman taking a vacation with her family and roughing it, or doing her shopping at Walmart, or Safeway.  Maybe she could even wear Jaclyn Smith from K-mart.  Then we could really find out how talented she is.  Ugh!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|The keyboard click is wayyy too loud even on the lowest volume. :( other than that, I absolutely love it.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I was terribly offended by this movie.  The frontal nudity and sexuality were not necessary.  If I were a transgender human being, I would be deeply insulted by the portrayal and as a Thailand citizen, I would be very angry.  I think the movie strove to shock us as much as possible and to insult. It was a harsh and mean spirited movie and lacked substance.  If you are a parent I would definitely not allow your children to see it.  I think even zero stars would be too much.

B005RYF5JA|4.0|Very Diappointed. I did not like having only three singers. It left a lot missing I have some other DVD's which are excellant and have watched Celtic Woman a lot but I was really disappointed in tonights program on pbs. The whole show left a lot to be desired.Of xcourse I cannot blame the girls as they are always excellant. I just wish we had the other two back.I checked onAmazon for a price. I am not sure if I will order or not. Oh well I probably will.
B002UDFNNO|5.0|I've always loved orwell for animal farm & 1984 but had never read any of his earlier work; that said this book took me to the streets in the '30's. His writing was reporting on what he'd seen and done and become in those 2 capital cities as a down and out man. It's brilliant, nothing sentimental just the facts / the characters are alive, vivid / his writing always excellent / his journey as a tramp ended and he went back 2 work but the book finishes<br /><br />'...at present I do not feel that I have seen more than the fringe of poverty. Still I can point to one or 2 things I have definitely learned by being hard up. I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny...'<br /><br />This is a powerful read that put a face on homelessness in a short little book / highly recommend
B004X80QNG|5.0|I have been wanting an app like this for a long time. Exactly what I was looking for, maybe now I can get organized. Thank you!
B003E88TKS|4.0|There are some genuinely funny and endearing moments in \\"Up in the Air,\\" and the cast of characters is likable.  The plot is hackneyed and obvious, and the use of real people who have been fired is a bit too much -- but I suppose that was the point.  The main strength of the film is the on-screen chemistry between the protagonist and his love interest -- great casting.
1452896283|5.0|Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out.  I know, crazy right.  No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life.  I don't know how i missed it.  Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story.  Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.<br /><br />Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe.  I felt completely surrounded by it.  You can almost feel the warmth of the garden,  hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil.  The writing is an immersive experince.  And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic.  At the least there's definately a bromance going on.  And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him.  Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.<br /><br />As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay.  Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.<br /><br />This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read.  I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />STATS:<br />Nook Pages: 240<br />Genere: Classic<br />Re-readability: Very High0   Genere: Classic  Re-readability: Very High
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|I can't believe all the people giving this movie 4 or 5 stars.but then it shouldn't surprise me since so many people give 5 stars to crappy movies that come out today like twilight or transformers.anyways this movie tries to make winstead the sigourney weaver of aliens.she is the only one supposedly smart enough to figure out that nobody can leave the base because this thing imitates people.she is the only one who is smart enough to figure out this thing can't immitate inorganic material like earings.halfway through the movie she is the only one using the flamethrower.like no other man can use it just her.but thats not really wwhats wrong with this movie.the worst part is it all is it's rushed.in the 82 version it was a slow pace so you could suspect people.in this version there is no time to suspect anybody because the thing pops out and makes himself known not caring to hide like it does in the 82 version.by the end of the movie you are wondering why so many parts are missing that don't add up leading to the 82 version.then during the credits they show these small parts like an afterthought so it fits in with the 82 version.this movie seemed like a rushed job.hopefully when this movie is released on dvd it gets an extended version so it has more story.

1416596585|5.0|With its global reach, driverless automobiles, plethora of digital platforms, dizzying arrays of real-time algorithms, and density of computational expertise and server farms -- not to mention its great and growing wealth -- Google is a coevolving innovation ecosystem par excellence.  Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin do more than just listen to the technology; they've turned their company into a most fluent translator of its every hiccup, whisper, and utterance. Even bats must envy their flair for echolocation. They'll hire the world's best specialists, deploy microphones anywhere and everywhere, and do whatever it takes to ensure maximum technological intelligibility. But the genius of Page and Brin lies not in their own acuity, but with their ability to evoke it in others. They hunger for techno talent that listens even better than they do.<br /><br />In the Plex flawlessly describes Google's unique culture, which is dedicated to getting the world's greatest technologists to innovate beyond disciplinary boundaries. Although Steven Levy does not quite offer -- or create -- fully rounded views of the many Googlers mentioned in his pages, his descriptions of their design sensibilities and innovation ethos are without peer. This is the best book about Google yet written, because Levy gets the \\"push the envelope until it rips\\" intellectual extremism that defines Google's most effective intrapreneurs. Sure, they're very smart. But their drive and ambition have to get Page and Brin hot and bothered, or they will not have much impact.<br /><br />\\"Page once said that anyone hired at Google should be capable of engaging him in a fascinating discussion should he be stuck at an airport with the employee on a business trip,\\" Levy writes. \\"The implication was that every Googler should converse at the level of Jared Diamond or the ghost of Alan Turing. The idea was to create a charged intellectual atmosphere that makes people want to come to work. It was something that Joe Kraus [a top-tier Google hire] realized six months after he arrived, when he took a mental survey and couldn't name a single dumb person he'd met at Google. `There were no bozos,' he says. `In a company this size? That was awesome.'\\"<br /><br />Serious readers will come away from In the Plex knowing in their heart of hearts that their own organizations aren't as passionately committed to technology, technologists, and their creative coevolution as Google. Recruiting the very best quants and software jocks was simply the most obvious element in the coevolutionary equation. What really made the difference was the founders' relentless emphasis on creating the fastest possible and best user experience. Milliseconds mattered. The fastest search had to be the best; the best search had to be the fastest. That is an innovation imperative requiring exquisite skills in listening to technology.<br /><br />But Google's founders -- intuitively, analytically, or alchemically -- thoroughly grasped that they had launched not a company but a global innovation ecosystem that technologically transformed value creation. The company's culture evolved around the interaction of brilliant people with brilliant technology. It wasn't just that smart Googlers made innovative technology; innovative technology made Googlers smarter. Google was as much a hive mind as an innovation ecosystem.<br /><br />In the words of publisher and digital entrepreneur Tim O'Reilly, Google was the first real Web 2.0 enterprise: \\"The real heart of Web 2.0 is harnessing collective intelligence.\\" This was Google's transcendental essence. Google understood and exploited the innovation ecosystem of network effects faster, better, and cheaper than anyone else. Virtually every successful investment the company made was based on the belief that the economics of network effects ensured that great innovation would be great business.<br /><br />This proved true. From Page's PageRank (pun intended) algorithm that made links the center of search to Google's expropriation of rival GoTo's auction business model for keyword search, Levy observes, everything was engineered around exponential expectations.<br /><br />To succeed, Google would ultimately have to manage billions of queries and petabytes of data. To sustain success and growth, Google would inherently need to think not just big but huge. The firm would need to listen for and exploit network effects wherever it could find or create them. As Levy documents with relish, from Android mobile phones to Gmail to YouTube videos, Google literally and figuratively enjoyed an embarrassment of digitized riches.<br /><br />What a fantastic innovation environment. Network effects meant that the innovation paradigm could shift away from linear research and development to more iterative experimentation and scale. Business experimentation soon converged and coevolved with technical and computational experimentation. Google's ecosystem became an economy. So the company hired innovative Berkeley professor Hal Varian as its chief economist; Varian has proved adept at designing market mechanisms for monetization and using Google searches as forecasting tools for the global economy.<br /><br />Levy holistically captures Google as a global business; a data-driven, experimentation-oriented innovation culture; a cutting-edge technologist; a pop culture icon; and the living extension of its founders' vision. He strikes these balances remarkably well, although he is, perhaps, a little too generous to a company that clearly offered terrific access.<br /><br />That said, Levy doesn't flinch in describing Google's difficult moments, such as the souring of relations with Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs, who felt betrayed by the top management at Google when that company introduced the Android phone. Indeed, Levy's earlier books on Apple -- The Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture, and Coolness (Simon & Schuster, 2006) and Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything (Viking, 1994) -- give him great insight into and context for writing about idiosyncratic technical geniuses worth billions of dollars.<br /><br />Levy also points to the struggle of retaining exceptionally talented people who invariably chafe at the technical and business conflicts that emerge in every fast-growing global enterprise. As dominant and influential as Google may be now (wasn't that true of Microsoft barely a decade ago?), Schumpeterian reality suggests that today's Googlers may be the firm's most serious rivals tomorrow. To its credit, Google recognizes this. It knows that some of its best people may listen to the technology in a different way -- and choose to do their translating elsewhere.val GoTo's auction business model for keyword search, Levy observes, everything was engineered around exponential expectations.

B0057R5XRG|1.0|To be honest.. I have movies older than Jurassic Park and I am fully satisfied with their picture quality. I must admit that this one is the worst blu ray disc I ever purchased. It's very grainy, pictures are not sharp in 90% of the frames. Believe me the bad picture quality has got nothing to do with my TV. Other movies are crisp on my TV. It's hard to believe that they did a blu ray conversion for this collection. Looks like they copied a VCD or VHS into blu ray. Will not recommend to own as a collection. Rent a DVD from some place if you have not seen this before. Or wait for some good HD version to be released in future to add it to your collection.

B000UJ48O0|3.0|This was very cheap and delivered exactly what I wanted.... I wanted to watch all the seasons of the O.C. and I was able to :) The book was pretty neat too! The only thing I would say about it is that the way the discs are placed into the book is they fall out and can easily scratch. You have to be extra careful so that you don't scratch them but I am so this set was perfect for me
B003VANOFY|3.0|Sound 3/5: Don't expect a $140 headset with wireless, buttons, a mic, software, drivers, etc. to sound as good as a $140 pair of headphones where all the money goes to sound.  That said, the sound is pretty good except for the lows - they tend to break up some during big explosions - sounds distorted if played at upper mid to high volumes.  Maybe it is a blown sub?<br /><br />Microphone 5/5: Sounds good.  No complaints.<br /><br />Wireless 2/5: When it works, it works well with no static, compression or lag.  About once an hour or so however on average (sometimes a lot more, sometimes a bit less) I hear a digital scrambled \\"gwoonk\\" noise and the audio goes away completely for about 5-10 seconds and then comes back.  Like any house this would be used in, I have plenty of wireless equipment around (Wifi, phones, bluetooth, etc), but I've never been able to correlate the drop outs with any increase or decrease in wireless usage that I can see and they happen with equal frequency when using them at friends houses.<br /><br />Quality: 2/5: I had to return my first set due to the surround on/off switch not working.  The second has the audio drop out noted above.  Build quality in terms of materials and durability seems good to me.<br /><br />Comfort 4/5: The cups can feel tight after extended wear but still the weight of it can make it want to slide off my head if I tilt it back quite a bit.  Overall though, I think they did a good job balancing comfort with cost and wireless capability.<br /><br />Surround effect 4/5: The main reason I chose these instead of other wireless sets was due to the support for surround audio.  I think it is an important feature in games these days, and I think this headset does it reasonable well.  It isn't as good as my 5.1 or 7.1 speaker setups, but it is as good as I've heard through headphones.  I use it mostly for games but also for some movies and TV (go Amazon prime!)  I have other headphones and speakers that I use for music, so I don't use them at all for that.<br /><br />Software and Other 4/5: Sometimes the volume wheel won't work, and I'm not sure why, but I suspect it is software related.  The configuration software that comes with it is pretty good - no complaints there for me.  I like the USB cable / dongle mechanism, though I would prefer a shorter dongle for when I want to plug it in to a PC.  I like that I can charge and listen.  I like that when you flip the mic up it mutes.  After using it several months, battery life is about 3 hours, which is fine for me since it can easily plug and charge while listening.<br /><br />Overall 3/5: Despite the frustrations with a returned unit, poor bass, and audio drops, I gave the overall score a 3/5 because of the convenience of the product and because I don't know of any better options that include surround sound.  I'm not sure I'd buy it again, but then again, if I had my money back, I'm not sure what else I'd get that offers wireless, surround sound, and a good microphone...5: Sometimes the volume wheel won't work, and I'm not sure why, but I suspect it is software related.

B004X80QNG|3.0|Not syncing with Outlook Tasks is a bummer, but nothing new, since the stock calendar (Android or HTC) doesn't sync those tasks, either. If there's any way to make that happen, that would be awesome, but it may be a difficulty with Exchange. (If anyone knows of an app that does sync Outlook tasks through Exchange, please share). That said, the default views (day/week/month) are great, and the event/task creation process is excellent, as well.  Also, I had no issues syncing with Outlook calendar (through Exchange) and Google calendar.  The biggest downside here is that there's no widget, which is practically inexcusable for a calendar app, IMO. I read in another review that it is planned, so I will update my review accordingly when that happens. I just don't get why you'd release this sort of app into the wild without that option. Widgets are often useless for me, but my calendar is one of the only widgets I use constantly. If this had one, I'd be saying \\"bye-bye\\" to the HTC Sense calendar widget (my favorite up to this point, but not perfect) in a heartbeat.  For now, I'm DLing it while it's free for the day, in the hopes that this becomes the killer calendar app it looks like it could be in a future release.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|i have always found something to love in everything korn has produced. although they have had a few missteps in their 10-album career (not a huge fan of most of \\"take a look in the mirror\\"), i have always admired their tendency to flirt with other styles of music and/or sounds, and i think jonathon davis was right in that this time they nailed it. as soon as i heard dubstep music and the possibility of a korn collaboration, i instantly had a feeling that the two styles would compliment each other nicely. after listening to \\"the path of totality\\" at least ten times through at this point, i can say my early predictions were indeed the case. this album is atmospheric, heavy, and has many textures. i highly suggest listening to it in headphones, so you can hear all the subtleties in the album. jonathon's vocals are extremely catchy throughout the entire album, just don't look to his lyrics for any higher-learning (not that we ever really did). davis has always been his best a. in the beginning when his tortured emotions were probably more warranted and b. when his lyrics are vague enough that they can really be applicable to many of life's predicaments. it is when he tries to get political (i.e. illuminati) that he fails. korn has never really been a thinking man's metal band to me, so i think they should stay that way (as odd as that may sound). overall this is the best performance JD has given us in a long, long, long time. don't let the other reviewer's distaste for the \\"lack of growls\\" fool you. this is the definitive JD singing experience, and there are definitely some fun growls, scat, and bagpipe to be heard (like any korn album should have). the music itself sounds great. it gives me a david fincher/fight club/NIN kind of vibe, only the guitars, bass, and vox twist the vibe to make it also undoubtedly korn. it works out perfectly, and sounds like it comes off effortlessly. songs like \\"my wall\\", \\"chaos is in everything\\", \\"kill my mercy\\", and (my personal favorite) \\"let's go\\" are some of the best and catchiest korn songs they have EVER written. this is like turning a new leaf over for these guys. i highly suggest you purchase this album. every song is good (including the special edition ones) in its own right, and the album seems to only get better with repeated listens.   1. chaos lives in everything: 5/5 supposedly about how there is drama everywhere and how you can lose yourself in it if you're not careful. excellent opener that showcases the new metal/electro-hybrid sound. the chorus is really catchy, but the heavy interlude is what kills in this song...no growls? pfft...  2. kill my mercy: 5/5 songs starts with a killer riff before going to a familiar sounding korn verse. the prechorus in this song has one of the best vocal melodies of the entire album (the part where he says something about a fake charade).  3. my wall: 5/5 score alone is for the catchy vocals in both the verse and chorus. that's not even include the drive of the song when it first kicks in.  4. narcisstic cannibal: 5/5 the second single(?) off that album that also has an extremely catchy prechorus/chorus before a choppy breakdown.   5. illuminati: 4/5 this is one of the more mundane songs on the album. the interlude is pretty cool, but the verse can sound redundant and the vocal melody awkward at times. this song is obviously about the illuminati and davis recently watching the movie zeitgeist. i've always found that korn is their best when they try not to get involved in things that i honestly feel are over their head. i guess that is just a personal preference, but i guess if i wanted this fix...i'd listen to something a little more informative.  6. burn the obedient: 4/5 this is the second part of the \\"two song slump\\" in the album that seems bogged down by repetition through the song. luckily there is enough variety in the sounds during the song to keep you interested. neither this song or the preceding one are \\"bad\\" by any means, just not as goodas the other ones on the album.  7. sanctuary: 5/5 i heard this song earlier through the hot topic website (as lame as that sounds), and at first was worried at the awkward sounding verse. this song has actually grown to be one of my favorites on the album. the vocals are awesome throughout the song. davis said this song was about being introverted.  8. let's go: 5/5 my favorite song on the album. it's about the love/hate nature of relationships. this is one of the most fulfilling korn experiences i've had in awhile by now...  9. get up!: 5/5 this is the first song that was recorded for the album (as everyone already probably knows). it goes without saying that this song is killer. it is the reason i was drawn to the entire album in the first place. it was my first verification that the dubstep/korn mesh had succeeded.  10. way too far: 5/5 this song starts off with a lunging beat, before kicking off into a manson-sounding verse. the contrast between the growling in the prechorus and the eerie (beautiful) melody of JD's vocals in the chorus is amazing.   11. bleeding out: 5/5 this album encompasses everything that is this \\"new\\" korn. heavily-texture electronic beats, downtuned chugging riffs, and some dark and cool off-key sounding melodies from JD. the chorus reminds me of songs from \\"see you on the other side\\" (i actually liked a lot of that album). the interlude features a bagpipe solo from JD. apparently davis has a rat problem and shot one with his gun....WTF? he watched the rat bleed out, and it inspired the title of the track.   12. fuels the comedy: 4/5 the eccentric nature of the vocals in the verse will naturally polarize fans, but luckily there are enough elements of the music to make it a worthy listen either way (especially the interlude). the lyrics during the verse(s) can be pretty hokey, and the chorus is lacking compared to the ones prior to this song.  13. tension: 5/5 this is a really slow and atmospheric song. it reminds me of manson/nin at timesand korn from \\"see you on the other side\\", but there is an awesome SCAT breakdown in this song that makes the entire special edition purchase worth it. seriously.  All of this and it comes with the entire encounter dvd (korn playing in crop-circles in bakersfield, CA), which sounds great (although it would be nice to have an option to get this in blu-ray for us snobs). it's nice to see them playing old songs like \\"need to\\" and \\"clown\\" with luzier on the kit. that man is a beast.  i highly recommend this to all of humanity, because i heard that every time someone buys this album a nickelback fan dies.

1591840562|4.0|From beginning to end, Guy Kawasaki breaks down how to start a business and what stops most people from starting one.  The moral of the story is to get out of your own way.  Get over your fear.  This book was exactly what I needed to read.  Guy also goes into explaining how to fund, market and grow (or rain make) your business.  In the art of the start, Guy Kawasaki does a good job of taking complex business ideas and simplifying in a way that would make you wonder why you are not already running a business.

0525421580|5.0|I've been a Fan of John Green for a while. As a Nerd Fighter of course. I've never really sat down and read his books, though. And let me tell you, the only thing I regret is not getting my hands on them sooner. Will Grayson Will Grayson has sparked my interest back into writing, and I got it at a really bad time in my life. It's SUCH a good book. The characters are relate-able and hilarious (for the most part). Of course it's not all fun and games in the story. The ending actually brought me to tears. But I'm a bit confused by that since I don't think it was meant to be a sad story.

0451232577|1.0|The characters are thrown together without any depth. There is not one character whom I admired, and many I just felt like I wish he would just quite talking about them.  Author has an overdependence on sexual matters to make his story, and his discriptors are way over the top.  This is definitely an R rated movie that would show everything--so much you think, stop talking about this.  Moreover, he defines this important era in human history by telling the story of what I term a \\"bunch of losers\\".  What about the inventors and industrialists who created new jobs. The author disrepects free enterprise and achievement, and the Big Idea in this book is about the working class fight and socialism as the key for a new age.    Some books go on the book shelf to be reread--this book was tossed in the recycling bin.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I really loved this. Yes lots of fan service, but if you can get past it. You will find this to be amazing and has very good animation in it. If you have Netflix you can stream it or look to stream online. But don't forget to buy!

0446547654|3.0|Nicholas Sparks has done his magic in character development; however, this much too predictable story line leaves little to the imagination.  By 3/4 of the way, I knew exactly how the end would unfold.  Had he left out the very last line of the chapter where Dawson was leaving the bar with Alan Bonner, a little more suspense could have been created.

B0026NWBY2|5.0|I have for years been patientally waiting for a really good greatest hits album of George Harrison to come along. One that dealt only with his hits from his solo career. The waiting is over with Let It Roll:The Best Of George Harrison. This is an outstanding collection of his post Beatles career. There isn't a weak or out of place song in the bunch. Like some I do think there is an omission or two of songs in this album still this is the one to get if you are in the market for a George Harrison Greatest Hits collection. If there is a change I would have made it would be to include either the live or a studio version of Bangla Desh from his Concert for Bangladesh album. Still that is a minor complaint and its omission does nothing to diminish this superb album.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|An inconsistent film that ends up being more enjoyable that it deserves to be owing to an enjoyable cast who bring their considerable skill to bear on a movie that doesn't deserve them. The \\"heist\\" is poorly constructed, seemingly skipping over anything that hasn't been worked out to pick up later without explaining what took place between the segments shared with us. A good heist movie, though, relies on those details. The audience buy-in is purchased with step-by-step detail by a storyteller who doesn't look away or wave his hands about to distract from the gaps. There are a lot of gaps and hand waving in this story. The cast members do their jobs, though, and regain our interest after each gap. Unfortunately, they don't get the opportunity to win us back after the movie limps to it's conclusion.  Still, I had fun much of the time.
0783225857|5.0|My all time favorite movie. A true classic. Great cast lead by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch who won the oscar for best actor. I have lost count how mant times I have seen this movie but it is for sure the one movie I have seen the most. I was about 10 maybe when I first saw it. As a kid I was fasinated by thr three kids in the movie (Jem,Scout and Dill) who in turn was always fascinated in trying to get a look at Boo Radley, the towns notorious crazy man. As I grew older and became more aware of the civil rights movement and racial prejudice the part of the movie involving Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and raping a white girl, became of main interest to me. Atticus does a wonderful job of showing Tom could not have committed what he is accused of. He does this all the while knowing that the jury will find his client guilty because of the color of his clients skin. My favorite scene in the movie is when Gregory Peck gives the closing argument to the jury. A great speech which I feel shows Gregory Peck at his absolute best as an actor. There are many other outstanding scenes in the movie. Too many to mention. You just got to take the time to watch this if the chance ever arrives. It is a movie with no car chases or gun play or bloody fights or big budget special effects. To Kill A Mockingbird just relies on human emotion and the power of the spoken word. Give it a chance however and I think you will get caught up in this movie.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson does a wonderful job chronicling the life of a difficult person. The bio on Jobs is a great read in of itself, but my greatest takeaway is Job's prescription for business success. Although this is certainly not billed as a book on business strategy, readers should have more confidence to choose quality over expediency in their day to day business lives.
0553805371|1.0|Considering the statements in the book like \\"philosophy is dead\\", the deprecating references to religion, and the assertions that there is no god, this book is full of the authors' personal philosophy and atheistic religious beliefs.   Condescendingly simplistic descriptions, such as an explanation of an ellipse, as if none of us ever took high school geometry, are placed alongside very general, often slanted, descriptions of highly complex theories. This seems an attempt to dazzle the audience with the grandness the authors' intellect instead of offering insightful explanation for those who may not have a PhD in physics. The result is more baffling readers with BS.   It seems Hawking and Mlodinow want to indoctrinate the naive into the church of modern physics. They lump pure speculation in with theories and hypotheses with varying levels of supporting evidence and expect the reader to believe it all because a noted physicist's name is attached.   I don't have a PhD in physics (I do have a Bachelors degree in physics) but I do know enough to recognize poorly formed arguments and ridiculous leaps on logic. This book is full of, as another critic said, \\"hand waving\\". Don't let it fool you.   If you want to learn about physics without all the math there are plenty of great books out there. The most recent one I've read is \\"The Disappearing Spoon\\"  (Okay, it is mainly chemistry but the two are closely intertwined.) If you want an atheist philosophy book I'm sure you can do better.  Dawkins is an atheist zealot with plenty of logic problems but at least he offers some intriguing arguments.

B005OOSPZO|5.0|I never saw this movie prior to watching it in this version, but I have to say that this was an amazing movie! I loved the fact that the movie looked at both the  American and Japanese versions of the war. Of other movies that I have seen about the war this was definitely one of the most intriguing, eye-opening film that made me truly consider both sides of the war. As a lover of history this movie was amazing. If you love history and considering different points of view, this is an amazing movie that you do not want to miss. I also loved some of the special features on the blu-ray, especially the 10 extra minutes you can get on this film... it was amazing!
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Ok, so I try to buy this movie and it says that its only available until May 4, 2012 on instant video and then you have to download it?   what kind of crap is this?

0545259088|5.0|The Wolves of Mercy Falls books are some that just get better and better. The first one was good, the second one left me dying for more, and this final installment is an incredibly satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Forever contained everything you would hope for to conclude this wonderful trilogy. The romance that readers have come to love is back full force, and it's wonderful to see Sam and Grace transcend even more boundaries that threaten to keep them apart. The individual character building of Cole and Isabel is once again prioritized with them as narrators, and it was fulfilling to see how their lives unfold and intertwine with each others.<br /><br />Basically, this book has everything. Romance, teen angst (and I mean that in the best way possible; not the Twilight-y kind of angst), hopeless situations that have to be overcome somehow, and a whole lot of action. The writing was also incredible. Maggie Stiefvater has such a poetic way of writing, and I feel like it has grown and developed a lot since Shiver, and so this book was truly a pleasure to read and I definitely look forward to reading more from her.<br /><br />You definitely will not want to miss this finale to the Shiver trilogy. You will not be disappointed.

Maybe not completely as easily, since it is a tablet, and the input devices needed for most PC work are virtual - but well enough.  This software installed easily, and functioned immediately.  Only problem so far has been getting sound, but will explore company website to troubleshoot.  Highly recommend for the Fire.

Actually, the movie was so great that I can hardly wait for my daughter to be old enough to see it.
1591840562|4.0|I picked up this book with lots of expectations as I have heard of the author before and as a new entrepeneur was excited about getting some insight from Mr. Kawasaki. First of all, the book in my opinion is more gear toward technology startups...if you are looking to learn how to open other business outside of the tech business, you may look for others. However, my business is not in the tech business and I learn quite a few concepts and things to improve in when starting, growing and operating a brand new business. I did enjoy more the first part of the book where it talks about causation, articulation and activation. The last two section of proliferation and obligation were not as interested to me. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to start a business and learn some great concepts, ideas and hurdles to look out for.

B005V1WZ10|3.0|If you can accept that a groundbreaking band such as Korn deserves the right to stretch out in new, bold directions as they choose, consider the following:<br /><br />ELECTRONICS:<br />There are many warp/vortex like electronic sounds here that sound similar on each track, with beats that break up the song with moments of nearly complete silence one half second, to heavy electronics the next coupled with plenty of loud drums with a nice groove if you like this style on occasion.<br /><br />VOCALS:<br />Combine that with Jonathan Davis, a bit more laid back here. Other than GET UP, you won't hear much of his awesome screaming vocals on this album sadly. Instead, he chooses to sing most of the lyrics and does a good job of it. But I miss the aggression of his voice. He lets the music be the aggressor here most of the time as he sings the verses and choruses.<br /><br />MELODIES/RIFFS: There are some seriously CRUSHING riffs that take no prisoners on this album, but to be a bit critical, they eventually begin to blend into each other from track to track. Separately, they can be impressive, but not enough original sound synths were used, so you'll tend to hear a lot of familiar sounds throughout each track, as though they were substituting these synths for guitars. But the synths aren't as expressive or adaptive it seems. This is my biggest criticism nex to the overall lack of Davis' trademark screams.<br /><br />With time, this album may grow on me, but after two listens, the lack of Davis' aggressive screams and the repetitive sounding synths hurt what could've been a very varied album with plenty of original tracks. Instead, it mostly melts together.<br /><br />There are some very cool sounding tracks here to discover, and on their own separate from the rest of the album, they'd be stronger. The Deluxe version track 12. Fuels the Comedy is actually one of my favorite tracks on this album. Why do they do that? It should've been packed into the basic album, as it breaks up some of the monotony and sounds great IMO.<br /><br />If you like electronica or breakbeat with your metal, I suggest you check this out. Otherwise, pure metal fans may be disappointed.<br /><br />Suggestions to Korn for a more refined album:<br />-More melody needed (synths need more melody)<br />-More roaring vocals by Davis needed<br />-More synth variety needed<br />-Mix up the breakbeat with more electronica steady beats.<br />-Throw in more guitars for a more \\"industrial\\" sound and instantly give the songs more life and variety.<br />-layer the sounds a bit more on some songs.<br /><br />All opinions of course. Listener discretion advised here. It's good, but could've been much better with more variety and aggression. I really wanted to give it a 4 for the originality and boldness.like electronica or breakbeat with your metal, I suggest you check this out. Otherwise, pure metal fans may be disappointed.

B004X80QNG|5.0|Just upgraded my dying iPaq PDA to an eee Pad and was trying to transcribe all my recurring tasks and events to Android. Tested multiple calendar apps and tasks apps, like beOrganized, Touch Calendar, Jorte, CalenGoo, etc. I was almost convinced I'll have to settle for the Business Calendar, and then accidentally I found THIS.  Try to set-up a recurring *task* for the first WORKDAY of every 3rd month in any other app - impossible! This app does it! I have a ton of tasks set up for first or last workday in a month, like computer back-up reminders, credit card payments, replacing air filters, etc. No other app could do this.  Plus - it looks beautifully on a tablet - interface is just gorgeous.   Integrates seamlessly with internal/on-line Google calendar and tasks. I don't really care about syncing with Outlook as I never use this virus/trojan gateway on my PC - that's a rule. Syncing with Thunderbird's calendar works through Google and I'm as happy as I could be.  So, I downloaded a trial of this app a few days back. I was going to buy it today and I see on Amazon that it's the app of the day! Yay! Thank you, thank you, thank you Amazon!  What's great in this app:   - Recurrent tasks by first, last, weekday, weekend-day, or anything you could wish for. Finally!   - All my appointments and tasks in one place   - GTD task management   - Sync with Google calendar and tasks   - Highly customizable   - Beautiful interface on a tablet   - Got it for free!

0393312836|4.0|As a general lover of books, it was some time ago that I added \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" to my list of books to read someday, and I was very excited when I finally got a chance to sit down with it. I read a little bit each day, until I reached the point of Alex's transformation. That night, I sat right there on the floor and read the rest of the book in one go. It's that engaging.  Now, I've read a lot of books, and while this may not be the single greatest work of literature that I've ever read, it is certainly one of the most haunting. The main question that Burgess asks is a very difficult one to answer--it's easy to reject something like the Ludovico method when your victim is innocent, but what if he happens to be a killer, a rapist, and generally just a bad guy? Do we take the road of pragmatism or moral integrity? This book feeds on a fear you may not have known you had. It's not the fear that someone like Alex will waltz through your front door and kill your wife while singing a merry tune. It's the fear of not knowing the lengths to which a government will go to maintain order. It's the fear that you could be building a future where the concept of rehabilitation has been lost completely.  Of course, if you're reading this review, you're probably familiar with Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation. It is an outstanding piece of art, and stands on its own very well. However, readers of the novel will discover several differences, some subtle, and some not so subtle. This is inevitable with any book-to-film adaptation. Out of respect for Burgess's work, I would recommend reading the novel first (in its original 21-chapter format), as the two works take vastly different opinions on the question posed above. Both are well worth your time.  As to the final chapter. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't read the novel yet, but I can understand its lack of popularity. Alex is such an extreme character throughout the rest of the novel, it does seem very unlikely that such a change could come about, and so suddenly. I ask only that you read Burgess's introduction to this edition before you pass judgement. Besides being a very interesting read, and unexpectedly eloquent for an introduction, it contains valuable insight regarding his intent with that last chapter.  To summarize: a fascinating read, deeply haunting, and well worth the effort it takes to get the hang of the slang. But by the end, it'll be like a second language to you.
0811875040|4.0|i heart miette with all of my heart.  everything that comes out of that bakery is a fluffy dream...  when we moved away i thought i would shrivel up and die without them until this lovely ditty was released!  first of all the pictures are gorgeous, if you collect cookbooks it's a must have just for that.  here's the caveat to all of this gushing, if you are not an experienced baker, you will struggle with these recipes plain and simple.  this is not easy stuff we are talking about here and i find it annoying that so many of you are so quick to blame the author and owner.  she's not going to hold your hand and teach you baking 101 within the pages of a cookbook, you have to have more than some idea of what you are doing.  not every single thing can be explained, you have to have serious baking experience. if you do, you will be just fine.  otherwise, stick to mail order or frequenting one of their two locations.  i just love that i will never have to be without their gingerbread cupcakes again.  for that i am eternally grateful.  bisous!!
0062060554|4.0|I accidentally got this from the library thinking it was by S.J Rozan and when I sat down to read it, realized my mistake. It's not the kind of book I usually would choose, but it was good enough that I ignored my dishes so that I could finish it. It kept me guessing as to what was a lie and what wasn't. Christine got on my nerves a little near the end, her self-centeredness got a little tiring, but then I put myself in her shoes and thought I would be the same way if I woke up every single morning in an older persons body, not knowing where I was and how I got here - and this book was mainly her journal anyway.   One thing I love to do is read the opinions of whoever gave it one or two stars. There was a lot of kvetching about repetition and the writing, but I felt it flowed pretty well and guys, she lost her memory every night while she slept. Expect some repetition.

B003Y5H57E|2.0|This is an odd duck of a movie.  It's not really a comedy; Steve Carell's character is more pathetic and maudlin then funny; Juliane Moore's character is well played but she is just not very likable; it's difficult to believe that she and Steve are a match made for life.<br /><br />There are a few gems here: Ryan Gosling is perfect as a cool narcissist with a thin veneer covering a vulnerable human being and there is a genuinely touching scene with his new found love when he begins to open that shell.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is just over the top one-step-away-from-Fatal-Attraction-but-funny.  Liza Lapira is fantastic but under-utilized as the candid and raunchy-mouthed friend of Hannah, the soon-to-be attorney.<br /><br />The side plots are kind of Malcolm in the Middle uncomfortable, Cal's son having a meant-to-be-funny but kind of disturbing obsession with his babysitter, the babysitter having an equally disturbing obsession with Cal. And did I mention that an affable KEVIN BACON is in the movie for no particular reason I think except that it's another way to tie Kevin Bacon to everything in the universe.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a movie that is meant to be funny, but doesn't ring true for the main plot (true love between Cal and his wife) and with a number of itchy subplots that are just shy of having the police and a SWAT team of psychologists being called in to take the characters away.  That being said, there are Great, and I mean Really Great performances by Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei and Liza Lapira.  See it, but it's a mixture of laughs and \\"eeuuws\\"
0140277447|5.0|It's shocking and sad that very few people know about one of the worst massacre(involving massive rapes) in the history. Although flooding amount of evidences and witness, Japanese government never admits it as a massacre, in fact, they call it \\"incident\\" and mention with about 1 sentence in their history book. The fact that US and Japan became the strongest allies after WW2 and US need them to suppress the power of China didn't allow the worst war crimes done by Japan to be revealed. Taft-Katsura Agreement also played a large roll on discouraging the dirty secret to be revealed to the world. It also has a lot to do with lack of criticism of Japanese media that's traditionally known as \\"story tellers\\" rather than public watchers.

1576875776|5.0|I ordered this through the Kickstarter project and I couldn't be happier with the book. I think the quality is excellent and I really liked the processing of the photos. They did a great job of selecting photos for the book that are interesting and stunning. Vivian Maier was such an interesting soul and this comes out in these photos. I'm buying more through Amazon to give to friends.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|This movie is what a movie should be, totally entertaining. For a couple of hours, I was able to get away from the real world, and be entertained. I really enjoyed this movie. Thank you to the folks who put this together!
B003EYVXUU|5.0|As some reviewers mentioned this is a slow movie but one of the best vampire movies I've seen so far.  Story is told/seen between two innocent and naïve children who build friendship throughout the movie.  I haven't read the book this movie was based on but it follows all the rules of the vampire; sunlight kills, have to be invited in someone's house, must drink blood, etc.  What makes this movie is the outstanding acting performed by the two young actors.  They are both very genuine and extremely believable.  The vampire is played by the same girl that played Hit Girl from Kick Ass movie and the boy is played by the young actor that played in the movie The Road.  If you watch this movie for vampire action like Blade then you will not enjoy this film.  If you watch this movie with an open mind and let the young two actors guide you into their world you will enjoy this film far more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the hunger games is very violent but good if you lije action romance and violence this is a good book for you
0316098329|5.0|There were portions of this book that my teeth were physically chattering because I was in such suspense of what was going to happen.  This book is ART from Emma.  What a writer to tell a story through this perspective.  I suggested this book to all of my family and friends and they were equally impressed by the story, characters and writing style.  Highly recommended.
B005URRCUY|5.0|This is a great album, period. There are a handful of people who will complain that this isn't Rubber Factory Part II, but people have been saying that about every album since RF. The fact is that this is a very good rock and roll album. It doesn't sound a lot like any of their previous offerings, yet it still sounds like the Black Keys. Another great addition to their ever growing catalogue.
B004T5K3OK|3.0|Overall not bad. Would be better if files could be saved directly to sd card. Back up to sdcard option doesn't actually back up to sdcard thanks to phone partition.
B006C45MRE|4.0|I know this title is misleading I mean lets face it, \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\"....REALLY?!?! I thought i was going to waste another $1.99 renting this movie, but as it turns out you shouldn't judge a MOVIE by it's TITLE. I loved the story the whole way through, the pace was steady throughout the entire movie and the cast was outstanding. My only point against this movie was how animalistic and hostile the Aliens were considering they are supposed to be intelligent enough to travel through space to get here. Hostile is fine but they acted more like cave men or apes, not intelligent creatures. Other than that it was a blast and i totally recommend watching this. It's hard to compare this movie to another, but let's just say that it was ALOT better than Battle: Los Angeles and I thought that Battle: Los Angeles was actually going to be good before i saw it........ OH WELL! I gave this movie 4 stars, if given a more accurate rating i would give it a 3.5 or 3.75 stars....It was good but not even close to being a 5 star...Not even close....Great movie though.

B0052WKZZ6|2.0|The first three Oldfield re-releases in genuine 5.1 are all a delight, and well worth the cost, but the \\"Deluxe\\" edition of \\"Incantations\\" is an ill-considered ripoff, in that the title piece is, in fact, not presented in 5.1 sound at all.  It is merely another remaster, to which has been appended a few bonus tracks that were re-done in 5.1.  Universal owes everyone who naively purchased this edition not only an apology, but a factual 5.1 DVD remix of the complete piece \\"Incantations.\\"  This is simply a shameless, deliberate con on art music fans who should no longer take these artists and companies at their printed word.
B003E6K1VK|3.0|With the bass boost off these are smooth sounding if you like smooth you will like the E7, but it muffle just a little bit if you can A-B them against a CMOY portable amp, the bass boost is not desirable or needed for normal listening. If however you have a car that makes mine buzz at the stop light, turn on the bass boost and this amp is for you! For the rest of you search on Ebay for CMOY amp there is a guy from Latvia or a place like that. He is called Zigit audio lab, you will find him just look. Buy the CMOY amp he makes in a black plastic case with a gold front panel and a blue LED on/off light, its about $48 plus $10 shipping. this is a great portable amp. The bad thing about the CMOY is it runs on 9v batteries, they last a good long time but it's nice to recharge the E7. So the E7 is a really neat package, just maybe (subjective) not the best sound you can get.

1584282584|5.0|One of the few on-camera flash books in the market. Neil's writing and practical application makes this book a MUST HAVE.  Tons of other books on flash covers off-camera flash usage, which honestly isn't that practical for many single-person event shooter. Neil's book is heavily based on his successful blog and the book laid it out so that it's a great read and practical book to reference to when you're stuck on a certain situation with your on-camera flash.  This book will dispel TONS of myth spread by other photographers like \\"never use a flash on cam\\" and you'll see how short-sighted those advises are when you see Neil's output.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The movie business has changed since I was an actor in the 1980s. Now it caters to the junior ticket buyers and consists mainly of car crashes a la Mel Gibson, kung fu a la Jet Li, and juvenile (or what passes for) humor a la Adam Sandler. Well hold on to your hats ladies and gents for what do we have here? Oh no! A movie that deals with adult themes and manages to do so with intelligence, sensitivity, and wit.<br /><br />Director Alexander Payne (Sideways) really comes through with a winner this time out. His protagonist, confidently played by George Clooney, is a flawed man desperately striving to set his life straight in the face of a dying wife, her infidelity, two neglected daughters, and the self-serving materialism of his family. Clooney is clearly the heart of this film. It is a pleasure to watch as he develops into the finest film actor of his generation. The defining scene of Clooney's performance takes place at the end of The Descendants as he says farewell to his comatose wife. Clooney conveys the emotional depth that we expect from this scene without slobbering or overacting. What he gives us throughout this film is the definition of fine screen acting. The camera finds a diversified reality in the nuances of Clooney's face, often unfairly criticized for being too handsome, as it morphs from near perfection to vulnerability. We believe everything he does and we like him precisely because he is not above making a fool of himself when the script calls for it. Clooney is ably supported by Shailene Woodley as his wayward older daughter, a radiant performance with great variation and insight. Other actors of note are Beau Bridges as a delightfully slimy cousin, Judy Greer as a charming cuckolded wife, and Robert Forster as the grumpy father-in-law.<br /><br />The Descendants deals with some pretty serious themes. How does one cope with the death of a spouse or the incessant demands of young children? Where does money fall in the hierarchy of values? How difficult is it to take an honest look at yourself? Payne tackles each of these issues with tremendous intelligence, allowing for depth of emotion without falling into the trap of becoming corny or trite. He occasionally plays it very close to absurdity but manages to stay on this side of the line. An example is Woodley's idiot boyfriend (Nick Krause in a jolly, nutty performance) who provides much needed comic relief but in the end turns out to be as real as any of the other characters in this excellent screenplay by Payne, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash. There were many memorable lines of dialogue, e.g., \\"Give your kids enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this film immensely and was transported by the emotional thrust of the screenplay. Clooney will certainly be nominated and I hope Woodley and the film will too.an honest look at yourself?

B0042AEOG0|5.0|I feel so lucky to have Mariah Carey apart of my time. All her music is positve, healing, inspirational, and most of all lovely and beautiful to the ears. This album is made with quality and love from a positve genuine energy that she gives in all her music.
B005CWRB44|5.0|This light is really a good buy considering what you get.  I am ignoring the $5 \\"key chain lights\\" which have laughable brigthness and construction quality.  The light has a compelling design with the TIR lens as opposed to a traditional reflector.  This makes the light smaller overall.  There are lights with a few more lumens that are orders-of-magnitude more expensive for minimal brightness gains. . most of which the naked-eye is unable to detect.  The light is a \\"battery crusher\\" with no spring.  I thought it was a little hard to operate one-handed but if you take out the bottom contacts with a pair of tweezers, give them a slight bend upwards, and lubricate the threads with super-lube it will be smooth and easy one-handed operation.  I am biased towards multi-mode lights that start out on medium power (such as this light).  In my opinion this is the most useful configuration since high-power drains more of the battery (and is crazy bright with this light), and low is too low for most situations.  Medium I feel is the best all-around most useful mode. . and selecting low or high for the special-case situation is as easy as another twist!
B0024Y7H10|1.0|Now I remember why I never watched past the pilot.  This series lacks convincing actors among other things, not worth the time or money.  What's to dislike:  Cheesy  Poorly written  Poor acting  lacks action  Recommended for the younger audience (<16 y/o)

0439813786|5.0|Brian Selznick created a groundbreaking book that takes lovely soft pencil sketches and combines them in a story which pays homage to early cinema and actually gives you the impression of those early grainy movies. He even has a wonderful chase scene which I am sure you've never seen before in book format.  Martin Scorsese has taken Selznick's book and notched it up a few degrees in his movie 'Hugo' with modern cinematic technique including wonderful 3D to create a new masterpiece.  Enjoy the wonderful book and then see the new movie.  It will make you happy to be living at this time!

1451627289|3.0|A decent read up until the end where upon the whole thing falls apart with a quick, and cheap, ending.  Once again King's hero is a bit of an idiot as, after all, if you were going back 50+ years in the past wouldn't you want to see something more interesting than rural Texas? You've got four years to do what you came for and you don't visit New York or Paris? You can know who is going to win every major sporting event and the only bets you place are with a couple of shady bookies in Florida and Texas? How about going somewhere where betting is legal and winning your money there? Vegas? London bookmakers? How about putting a very large amount of Swiss Francs into a Geneva safe deposit box so that you can come back for it in 2011? But no, our \\"hero\\" decides to teach high school in some nowhere town outside of Dallas... Jeez.  Back to King's prose. Lot's of detail, many good characters with a \\"meh\\" intertwining of details about Lee Harvey Oswald's home life that, and you can see this a mile away, all comes down to the seconds before the Kennedy assassination. Okay up to this point but then there's a short and very unsatisfying resolution that makes the reader wonder why the heck they've bothered to spend so much time bothering to read this book.  Very disappointing.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I harm a frequent buyer of dvd's that include Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copies.  Having bought all sucks the Harry Potter with the digital copies for my 4 children to watch on their various electronic devices, I was thoroughly disappointed and at the end of the day disgusted with the Ultra-Violet digital copy included with the last Harry Potter movie -- so much that I just returned every planned Christmas gift that included the Ultra-violet copy (for example Smurfs and Cowboys vs Aliens).  I will never spend another dime on any movie that contains the useless garbage marketed as ultra-violet digital.  What a shame and what a scam!
0385534639|5.0|It didn't take me long to fall in love with this novel. The writing is beautiful and immediately caught my attention. There was something about The Night Circus that I couldn't dislike it. Once I finished it, I wanted to turn back to the first page and start again.

Haven't tried the 3-D disc as we don't have the player, but figured that someday we might.  For those that haven't see it yet, it is a darker story then the original and for my 4 year old twins a bit too complicated storyline to follow. Of course this doesn't stop the desire to see it......I just have to explain many aspects of the movie to them. :-) My 7 year old LOVES it!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I purchased this app for my Kindle Fire in order to read Company manuals while holding together the format. It includes a word search capability to that is why the App is great for reading PDF files on the Kindle whereas the built in application is just a reader and does not support word search.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Allows you to transfer files between our Kindle Fire and your computer. It also functions as a file manager.  Works even better than I had anticipated - more features and very fast.  I haven't used a transfer cable since I bought this.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I got this free app on my Kindle Fire. I also have the app on my iPad 2. Only caveat is that to use many of the features you must have a connection to the internet. Our church is one of the live events listed so I'm able to follow along with the service on my iPad but since the Kindle Fire is only Wi-Fi I'm only able to view the bible. Unless your church has both a live event and free Wi-Fi service you won't be able to use all features.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|In short, if you use a calendar, this is a must have.  Especially if you use Google Calendar on your home/office computer. With Kindle Fire you can add appointments and tasks when you are off line and it will sync when you have WI-FI access again.  It also has a lot of customizable option.  Best Kindle Fire app I have seen yet.
B005LLSLPE|1.0|I absolutely LOVE S.O.A. But I must say I really want to call Amazon and request a REFUND for the 1.99$ I spent to watch the SOA Season Fanile. Every SOA Fanile was frikken AWESOME Till this one. That was a BAD Move but I guess then they don;t care because they do not need to worry for ratings as most shows only last 4-6 seasons.<br /><br />But you can not build up the pressure and expectations by having an awesome season fanile and then end your 4th season with a total Bogus fanile. First of all the fact that we have to wait nearly a YEAR for the conclusion means I want an exciting season fanile. Im sure FX's excuse is that the fanile was broke into 2 parts so Clay being shot by Ope was great. And it was but they should have saved it for the last show or given us a much awaited blast of excitement!!!<br /><br />As a serious fan who has NEVER Missed a show I have to say season 4 fanile was a total BUST!!! I damn near fell asleep!! BOO 1 star review from me for the entire season. I will judge the entire season on that one show!!! THUMBS DOWN!!! That is from a dye Hard Fan!!
B004LUS390|3.0|I used this on the iPad and it's amazing! You have access to a lot of different brushes and colors to be able to draw almost anything. SketchBook gives you a lot of control over what you draw and allows you to undo/redo strokes.  However, on the Kindle Fire, it breaks as soon as you scroll or zoom on the canvas. The only way to be able to continue drawing, is to start all over on a new drawing. I would not recommend this for the Kindle Fire as of this version, but if you're on the iPad or Xoom, it's great.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I can hardly improve on the comments of previous reviewers except to add this. Gosford Park is the only film I have ever owned that was accompanied by two interesting and worthwhile commentaries. Most commentaries are self-serving meanderings by someone from the film who needed to squeeze out a few more pence. Not so with these. They are both absolutely fascinating. How did Altman, Balaban and Fellowes get it so \\"right?\\"  Painstaking research and incredible attention to detail. I love the way the water dribbles out of the tap in the basement. Even when trying, anachronisms are hard to find.<br /><br />One suggestion if you're going to watch this for the first time (lucky you!): If you are a speaker of American English, or if you have any hearing impairment, use headphones. Altman's verite style has many conversations going on at the same time, many of which are being murmured in  well-bred, low-pitched voices. Even on a third or fourth watching, you will catch snippets that you have not heard.<br /><br />This is one of my all-time favorite films.
B005URRCUY|3.0|Just to preface, I've been a big supporter of The Black Keys for nearly 10 years.  I religiously buy all their albums and have seen them play on every tour since 'Thickfreakness'.  My favorites are their older albums but, with that said, I know every artist has to grow and evolve their sound somewhat lest it become stale.  I have no problem with that.  In fact, I really liked the direction that their last disc, 'Brothers', appeared to be headed in: in addition to their stalwart blues, they were incorporating soul and R&B.  I was very excited to get this album and have given it several listens and a few days to really sink in.  In lieu of the soul and gritty blues, they've replaced it with pop and overproduction.  It just seems very repetitive and would probably be good as background music at a party.  It's not bad and acts as a good, safe offering to people who aren't familiar with The Black Keys, but it sounds like they're playing it safe here.  In light of the garbage that the music industry is trying to pawn off on us, this disc has most everything else beat nowadays.  But compared with the rest of their catalog, I think this is the Keys weakest offering and will likely get the least airplay on my stereo.

B004X80QNG|5.0|This app syncs fine with Google calendar and my MS exchange account calendar that I have sync'ed with the exchange email app.  It syncs tasks with Google as well but I don't know about the MS exchange since I have no tasks there.  Works better than folks are saying.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I became a fan of this series upon viewing the very first season. The 3rd season is right up there in quality and enjoyment in my opinion.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this case! Its very pretty and protects my kindle fire well. When you put your kindle in it for the first time it is a little snug.... BUT ITS SUPPOSE TO BE! Never had a problem with my kindle falling out. It seems that alot of people are saying that it doesnt close all the way... Give it a couple days and let the leather conform to your kindle. Love, love, love this case!!
B001FB4W0M|5.0|The Winchester brothers have been members of my family from the first ep of season one and this season has just ramped up my love with my favorite Angel Castiel.   I have all 6 seasons of the show and am now going back and buying on Blu-ray as my DVDs are usually loaned out when I want to watch.  Each time I rewatch I find something I missed, there are so many Biblical references it is amazing.    If you are just starting with this series, season one was not a learning step for Jared & Jensen(J2), it was like they had been doing their characters for years.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|What are we to expect from a movie called Conan the Barbarian? As it turns out, we get exactly what you expect.  Horrible script, atrocious acting, excessive nudity and over-the-top bloodbath.  Seriously, no one thought this was going to be a huge blockbuster right? This is the origin story of a boy who witnesses his clan be decimated by another clan led by a man who wants to resurrect his sorceress wife. And when Ron Pearlman is your dad, you know you've reached that level of barbarianism. Conan learns, years later, that this man is still alive, and sets off on a revenge journey.  Could there be any salvation by having Stephen Lang foil mighty Conan? Not so much. While he's almost unrecognizable, he's regulated to being the prototypical goofy villain who spouts out meaningless garbage.   And how many different ways can they possibly film Conan looking at the camera with that tilted glare?  There is absolutely nothing of value to this movie. I suppose it attempts to stay close to the heart of the Conan books but the transition fell short.  I began laughing out loud at the number of blood bags busting open during the sword fights. (The sword taps a man's back and suddenly there's blood splashing everywhere) The dialog matches the dregs of an episode of Barney & Friends (\\"Barbarian, I don't like you anymore\\")  It felt like I was watching The Scorpion King meets The Temple of Doom.  Leave this movie on the shelf.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Why are we so fixated on thinking animated shows are primarily for children? This is clearly a show for adult viewers who can appreciate nostalgia, the loss of our own childhoods, the fleetingness of time, and our precious poignant memory of magic days gone by. I'm glad my kids can appreciate this show with me, but if you consider the original introduction by the author, Raymond Briggs, this is more of an adult art film than a kids cartoon. I prefer the Briggs over the Bowie introduction for this reason.
B000BTJDG2|5.0|Wow!!... That was awesome!!.... Definitely the best exorcism movie we had since THE EXORCIST!!<br />If you liked the exorcist then you should get this one too!!... for sure!!!...<br /><br />Directed and Written by Scott Derrickson, this little flick should keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end!!!... It is a true story about the exorcism of  Anneliese Michel, a simple girl who manage to be possessed by the mosts feared and crual demons known  in the Christian Mythology, CAIN, NERO, LEGION, BELIAL and even LUCIFER himself and JUDAS ISCARIOT!!!!....<br /><br />The movie mostly focus on lawyer Erin Bruner who's trying to defend father Richard Moore who is accused of killing the young Anneliese (Emily Rose) after performing an exorcism to try to save her. The movie is in most part about the trial itself and what happened to Emily before and after being possessed.<br /><br />The trial itself i think was the only negative comment i had about the movie before seeing it. People were saying that it was mostly good but that there was too much trial and court scenes.<br /><br />Personally, it didn't bother me at all...In fact, those \\"trial\\" scenes are probably the ONLY break that you will have before it goes back to Emily and her demons again!!!...Trust me!!.....After the first \\"possession\\" scenes you will wish the movie goes back to the trial and court part so that you can relax a little bit......<br /><br />It is when they play the actual \\"tape\\" (audio recording) of the final exorcism that the movie reaches its peak!!!...the movie goes back to Emily and you can see and live that lasts moments that the people in court can only hear on the audio tape.....<br /><br />Besides all the horror and demons and possession scenes in  here, the movie also delivers a strong message of hope and faith for people of all kinds.<br /><br />For people that might be interested, Amazon actually have a DVD of the REAL TAPES!!!!!, Its call : ANNALIESE : THE EXORCISTS TAPES....give it a try if you dare!!!!!  5 stars well earned for a real scary movie!!!!!!..so buckle your seat belts and don't forget your oxygen masks folks!!!!!.. Hahaha...lol....<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!!..so buckle your seat belts and don't forget your oxygen masks folks!!!!!.. Hahaha...lol....  ENJOY!!!!!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I almost did not buy this cover since many reviewers claim that it does not fit the Kindle Fire correctly.  This cover is wonderful!  It easily attaches to the Kindle Fire at each corner with 4 sturdy elastic bands.  It has a classy \\"old world\\" look to it (mine is red) and completely closes with no problem.  I never leave reviews, but in this case I was impelled to right a wrong.  I am very happy with this purchase and you will be too.
0545403359|5.0|If I could, I would rate War Horse 10 stars.  It is an absolutely wonderful story.  Three cheers for the author!!!  War Horse is one of the BEST books I have read this year.  My Grandfather was a WWI Veteran, and this book helps me, the reader, understand just how inhumane this war was for civilians, Veterans and their horses during that period of time.  This book also points out the loyalty between man and beast.  We had many heroes in WWI, and they were not all human. Horses are so intelligent; most as loving as \\"man's best Friend\\"; the Dog.  I love any books or movies about all kinds of animals, and this book was certainly a winner as books go, but I didn't want the book to end, because I was so attached to the characters in the book.  I do agree with the Reviewer who said this book might be too much for the very young, especially, since there are some pretty graphic descriptions which might upset children under the age of 12. I would reccommend Parental Guidance for this book.  AWESOME, AWESOME BOOK - I would highly reccommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005FVA3LK|5.0|A masterpiece every fan must have. U2, thank you for your music. I love you  The product quality is excellent.

B000EQ5HSK|4.0|Attaches and detaches smoothly forward and backward.  Worth the slight premium over off-brand hoods because of the flocking inside the hood (not easily seen in pictures) that further absorbs stray reflections.  If you're shooting with a hood at all you might as well spend a few extra dollars to get the most out of your shots.  But for the $1,000 lens this goes on it would be nice if they included it.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Sounded great from tha description &amp; reviews. Thought I'd give it a try (especially since it's free today). Tha only calendar on my DROID X is Google's. This FAOTD won't sync with my calendar. Not much use ta me if I can't sync with Google's.  I already have several 'task manager' apps, so I don't need another. Even if it does have a ton of bells &amp; whistle's. Uninstalling.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I like this better than the regular Google Calendar because you can actually set different colors to the events.  I love the view options from Day, Week, Month, Agenda, and Tasks.  Very good app and easy to use, and it even syncs with Google.  I only wish it had a widget to go on my home screen.
B004X80QNG|1.0|not any more useful then standard app. I installed it thinking it would, but it only provides bureau don't care for. If you can't stand the standard app, maybe you need this. Definitely not at 10$
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The cover fits very securely and doesn't add bulk. The felt on the inside of the front cover makes me feel like I'm taking care of the screen. The rubberized exterior makes the Kindle feel more secure in my hand when carrying it closed. The way the front cover folds back into a stand is clever, but you can't really secure it in that position, so it can easily be knocked down. Still, if you're at a table or desk and aren't too forceful with it, it works great.

B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I love good movies, be they old or new.  I was a little unsure of this one when I first started watching it.  However, the story was interesting enough to keep me watching.  As the movie reveal more of what is going on the plot makes more and more sense and the movie gets funnier and funnier. And it's not just one-time funny slapstick.  It's funny on the surface and profound upon reflection. The humor is a bit dated in places.  But the main content of this speaks to the human condition and really gives you something to ponder and come back to while entertaining you all the while.  This is exactly what a classic should be, and there are precious few movies that do it better than this one.
0553801473|2.0|Well, my review title is just a little bit of a non-spoiler which may make sense if you decide to read this book.<br /><br />What can I tell you that hasn't been said? Not much.<br /><br />There are moments when you can feel the old GRRM at work in this novel, but not many. It is indeed in need of a grand editing. And my sense is that both of the last two books penned by Martin would have made one 1200 masterpiece...had anyone bothered to edit them down.<br /><br />It is true that most nothing happens in Dance of Dragons. A little does. But not much that you will care about. Still, I didn't want it to end because as Martin would have it...it starts to get interesting at the END!!! lol<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what happened here. Really, I'm not. I felt bad when I read all the abuse that Martin receives from fans for not writing fast enough. Well now you can abuse him for not writing well enough.<br /><br />The criticisms espoused by the multitude of fans on Amazon are sadly correct. It is not the worst book ever written, but its just not very good. It's missing all of the \\"blood and fire\\" of the first 3, with glimmers in the 4th. What it's really missing are...HEROES...or at least our character behaving as such. And gone is the intrigue, mystery and action that we come to expect from GRRM. Sure, there is a little here or there if midgets riding pigs is your thing.<br /><br />This should have been the winner to take back the crown for Martin but despite the moronically positive critical reviews - the fans know that this book cannot touch the first 3.<br /><br />Luckily, since nothing bloody well happens except for people shuffling about, there is still room for Martin to save this series with the next 2 (I guess 3) books.<br /><br />I predict that he will do this but will not manage to capture the spirit of the first 3.<br /><br />If any of you are James Clavell fans, you might remember his atrocious novel - Whirlwind. Well, this is Martin's Whirlwind and sad to say, it will be at least 3-5 years before you get another one and most likely a lot longer.<br /><br />Is it better than nothing...answer - NO. Next time, I'll take nothing.say, it will be at least 3-5 years before you get another one and most likely a lot longer.<br /><br />Is it better than nothing...answer - NO. Next time, I'll take nothing.
B005H2IAM6|4.0|As a fan of the 70s anime, experienced in the mid eighties, I was most excited to find a live action film was made summarizing the series.  The CGI wonderfully captures my impression of the ship, and the depictions of space are absolutely beautiful.  Keep in mind this is a Japanese film, which introduces cultural differences in plot development and cinematography from American films.  This also limits the overall production budget and prevents as many of those beautiful star/galaxy and battle scenes that I would have liked to have seen produced.  This definitely is the case with this film, as they at times trade scene descriptions for actual depictions of scenes in CGI.  You still get to see the Yamato in action several times, but it just leaves you wanting to see more of the weapons in action.  And if they had only lingered on the Yamato traveling through space as much as they lingered on the characters staring at each other!  Still worth the effort for some Star Blazer nostalgia, or for that matter any Battleship fan!
B004X80QNG|4.0|It has many view modes that make organizing your schedule easy and quick. The only thing I wish it had was a calendar widget. Other lesser apps have widgets, but this powerful one doesn't, which it should.
B003Y5H574|1.0|White collar, middle class and dissatisfied with life and marriage with teens intermingling with singles players all of whom are seeking sex to make all of life seem worthwhile/complete.  If it's not written and filmed in NY then the only other spawning ground, in all the filming locations of the world, for a bar-hopping, rom-com, chick flick would be LA. So, if a viewer finds the script and storyline humorous then they're in the marketable demographic that's stuck (and studios are honed into) in the same fantasy rut as our actors. Average rate of this, often repeated storyline, out of either of those locations is one per year - just enough for audience memory to fade enough so that the same scripted plot can be reproduced. Who would think that a film built upon a crazy, stupid love of materialistic self-gratification would generate $30 million in profit. Who woulda thought it.   Realizing that we've had nothing but 90 minutes of slapstick sex, drinking and self-image promotion then the last scene promoting love is the film makers's gratuitous guilty confession that rights all their profiteering sins.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|When I first saw this game, about six months ago, it was fascinating.  I believe there are now far more intoxicating games.  Night of the Living Dead Defense was so addictive, I had to delete it permanently.  Angry Birds is still here, but not played.

B005ISQ7JM|5.0|I picked up this book because I wanted to stay current on the new technology even though I don't directly work on the web development. This book totally satisfied my goal.<br /><br />The author, Brett McLaughlin, is an acknowledged expert om XML and Java. He has a gift of sharing his knowledge in a way that is understandable by a non-expert. This book is written in an easy to read conversational style. It talks about rather complex concepts and structures but in the accessible terminology, which can be understood by a technical person who is not a super experienced web developer. I got a lot out of this discussion in terms of general concepts and what HTML5 is good for, and how it is different from the previous HTML versions.<br /><br />This book is not a programming tutorial, however it makes HTML5 sounds so interesting when you end this book you might want to start looking for a tutorial to dive deeper.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

B0061S073A|4.0|The application does a good job locking down specific apps for kids, but unfortunately if the device is turned off and on it is bypassed, you have to actually load the Kid's Place app for it to be active and restrict the Android device to specific apps.  This is great if you own an Android device like a Kindle Fire and pass it to your young kid to play with for an hour without worry, but if you bought your kids a Kindle Fire it is too easy to just turn device off and on and bypass the app altogether.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Great addition to any Christmas music collection. Mellow enough to fit into a classic Christmas music playlist and modern enough to fit into a contemporary one. I strongly recommend it!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I had been searching for a moderately priced mixer capable of at least 4 channels and allowed the input of both low and high-impedance devices (microphones, keyboards, etc). After researching several brands and mixer types I chose the Xenyx 802 and have been very pleased with it. Very clean control layout and it performs quite well. Some people think Behringer hardware is on the cheap side... Not me. I have several Behringer devices and all were nicely priced and gave great performance.

0307595579|5.0|My wife had wanted this book set after seeing the movie previews.  I thought this would be a great gift.  She only likes hardback books.  I looked at the local book store and this set was 100 dollars everywhere.  With free shipping and the price this was an amazing deal.  These books have an old school look to them and is nicely done.    That being said, I have not read the books yet, however once my wife finishes a book I plan on picking them up myself.  This review was solely on the box set and how it looks.

B003NHRIVQ|5.0|The Last Song Review   Film reviewers everywhere are raving about the film The Last Song inspired by the world renowned Nicholas Sparks book. Even though you may have read the book, you are in for a big surprise. The film has nothing on the book but just how the actresses/actors portray the film makes the film worth seeing. This film is one to sit down and watch with your family or even have a girl's night with your friend that you can ball your eyes out to.    There were many different memorable characters in the film. The protagonist of \\"The Last Song\\" is the character Miley Cyrus played named Ronnie Miller. Ronnie Miller is a troubled teen that is shipped off to live with her father for the summer. It has been years since she has seen her father and she is very mad that she needs to be there with him. Her father Steve Miller is thrilled to have his two children to stay with him for the summer but what no one knows is that he has cancer. The way they build up the relationship between Ronnie and Steve is amazing just because it really shows how family is really important and that holding a grudge against your dad for something he couldn't fix is just not a way to live. I loved how Ronnie really grew into this person that her brother Jonah could look up to. She started as this angry teenager and became a woman you could believe in. There was also her love interest Will Blakelee who was a really good character. He started as this volleyball jock who you really didn't want to like because you thought that he was just playing Ronnie but then when he stands up to his parents for her and you really get to know about him and his life you really want to just root for the two of them to end up together.  It is a modern day telling of family trouble and of course finding true love. Ronnie's and her younger brother, Jonah's, parents are divorced. They live with their mother until this summer they are sent to live with their father in a small town on the beach. Ronnie resentsher father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy and beginning to fall in love, Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music, something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father, which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. Even though her love for her father never left, she still resents him for leaving and she feels like she was not important to him even though she is one of the most important things in his life.  The writing for this film is one of the best parts of the film because Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer. Nicholas Sparks writing is never something that disappoints. He gets you engaged so you fall in love with the characters. You are on the edge of your set till the very end of the film. His words are something that can touch anyone. If you are a romantic you will love the words that Ronnie and Will share. If you are into family values you will love the dynamic between Ronnie and her father. There is really something for everyone in the words of this film. The way that they play out the real emotions a break up would be life with someone you truly love is just something you want to believe in. All people even if they don't believe in love would believe it after see this film and hearing the words that the characters speak.   The main themes are forgiveness, heartbreak and love because they all connect in some way to most of the characters. Forgiveness is one of the themes in this film because Ronnie ends up making up with her father and realizing it really wasn't his fault that everything fell apart in there family. She also realizes that he didn't leave her but instead he left her mom because he couldn't stay in a loveless marriage. The other theme in this film is heartbreak and love, which tie together because on one hand Ronnie and Will fall in love and they are meant to be together but then there is the heartbreak when she finds out that Will set her father up to take the fall for the church fire even though it was his friends and his fault. He stood by and let Steve take the blame for everything. She really couldn't stand by Will after that because she doesn't like being lied to and knowing that her father took the blame for something that awful just made her hate him. Themes play a very big role in making this movie something that can touch everyone's heart.  The music plays a very important role in this film as well. Since Miley Cyrus is a world known singer she had a few songs in the film that related to her relationship with Will in the film. The songs really made the story line come alive and made it even more interesting to watch. There was other various artist used thought out the film but the best part was that all the music just made the film even more believable and more of something you want to watch. For example for the scene where Ronnie and Steve(her father) had there break through they used the perfect music to show the climax to that point. The film also used good young singers to show the film is about young love and of course the fight to keep that young love going. Another example is that when Ronnie first gets to town and she goes to the pier they play the perfect music that describes who she is at that point and how she doesn't want to be there.    In conclusion The Last Song is a must see movie that you will not regret paying for. It will become one movie that you will love and never grow old. The book by Nicholas Sparks has nothing on the film adaption and you will love every minute of it. I recommend you watch the film and I hope that it touch's your heart like it did for me.
B0016MJ6T2|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It is a wonderful movie! I would defiantly recommend it 2 others! Great story & great actors! =)
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|While Helen Mirren gets top billing and delivers her usual top-notch performance, the real \\"star\\" of THE DEBT is Jessica Chastain.  Chastain brings a remarkable sense of sensitivity, strength and vulnerability as the younger version of Rachel Singer.  This rising star certainly has a bright future if this performance is any indication.  Marton Csonka who plays the younger Stephan is also quite effective and AVATAR's Sam Worthington displays some serious acting chops as the doomed David.  The cast also boasts the estimable talents of Tom Wilkinson and Ciaran Hinds and the chilling performance from the actor playing the villainous surgeon (Sorry I can't find the actor's name!!).<br />Oscar winning director John Madden focuses on the complexity of the characters and the intricacies of the plot.  THE DEBT is slow-paced but riveting in its exploration of deceit and its consequences.  It is disturbing at times yet strangely inspirational.  Recommended.
0439023491|5.0|I must say that this series surprises me more an more with each word that I read.  This book is full of twists that makes you wonder how something can be put together so amazingly.  Katniss just can't seem to get out of the way of the capital.  She finds herself in more and more bad situations.  I feel as though the author found a good way to keep the readers interested and turning those pages.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first one.  The ending of this book made me want to continue the series.  I have started the last book and will review once I am done reading.  I can't wait to see what happens next!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|What can one expect when James Bond meets Indiana Jones?  A rousing if preposterous adventure blending two of Hollywood's most treasured genres--the epic western and the sweeping science fiction.<br />Director Jon Avnet does his Spielbergian best in pulling out all the stops in this entertaining film.<br />Daniel Craig trades tuxes and his Astin Martin for denims and beer as the mysterious drifter who butts heads with gruff town bully Harrison Ford in battling unusual outlaws--bloodthirsty aliens out to steal the gold and the town's citizens.  The fine supporting cast includes Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Clancy Brown and Walton Goggins.  The alien creatures are excellent and special effects are state of the art.<br />The movie is fun to watch and original in its execution.  Recommended.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|My husband and I really liked this movie. From the trailer, it seemed exciting and suspenseful, but a little confusing! Like, what in the world would make people want to replace some random doctor and pretend he doesn't exist?? But it all becomes clear as the movie progresses...<br /><br />We really like the fact that Liam Neesons' character turned away from that life. He could see from another perspective and realized it wasn't who he wanted to be. I guess we're just suckers for a happy ending!

B003L77GGU|5.0|I long awaited this wonderful series in blu-ray but found my machine, being 2 years old, did not load the blu-ray dvd.   Blu-ray discs have been updating its manufacture against piracy, which requires updating machine firmware, and has caused me no end of headaches, esp since no complete fix has yet been generated for this dvd.  It makes buying some Blu-ray problematic if it doesn't load in your machine.
1847879063|1.0|The author of this text has a sense of humor that is somewhat bizarre and off-color. I read the first 110 pages of the 800 text. Here are most of the egregious examples I noted, in page order.  1. Page xxi: \\"I apologize to those who think it's crass, hate it, or think that I am undermining the seriousness of science, but, come on, what's not funny about a man putting an eel up his anus?\\"  2. Page 7. \\"...take the scientific statement, 'Coca-Cola is an effective spermicide.'\\"  3. Page 11. \\"Imagine we took some Coke and some water and added them to two test tubes of sperm.\\"  4. Page 29. \\"What is the level of measurement of... (e) the weight of drugs bought by the bands with their royalties...(h) the gender of the people giving the bands their phone numbers...\\"  5. Page 31. \\"...while at nursery school one model of the world that I was ...to try out was 'If I get my penis out, it will be really funny.'\\"  6. Page 43. \\"...examined the learnt release of sperm in Japanese quail.\\"  7. Page 54: \\"Imagine we wanted to determine whether reading this book increased or decreased the desire to kill me.\\"  8. Page 62. \\"Because I wish to drown in a pool of my own excited dribble....\\"  9. Page 86. \\"Let's imagine ...we took some men and women and got their partners to tell them they had slept with someone else. The we took each person to two shooting galleries...\\"  10. \\"...a man who had nightmares about his workmates: 'He dreamt of one terribly mutilated, hanging from a meat hook'...\\"  11. Page 94. \\"Hygiene was measured using a standardized technique (don't worry it wasn't licking the person's armpit)...\\"  12. \\"The official treatment methods [for hiccups] include... digital rectal massage...\\" and he focuses on this method in his example of a within person design.  In short, based on what I have read so far there is an outrageous (bizarre or unnecessarily sexual) statement about every 10 pages.  Beyond the off-color and unusual examples, this text is unnecessarily wordy and ponderous.  There are much better textbooks available: clearer, shorter, and less controversial.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|WE were pleased to find a source at Amazon for \\"Dancing with wolves\\"  It is the same one we wore out years ago.  Received in good time. Quality if fine.  Thanks.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|I liked this movie. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be a solid action film with a scifi subject. I mean, its nothing ground-breaking... but it is a well crafted couple hours.
B004X80QNG|3.0|add a widget and I would love it. seriously though who doesn't want my love. once we get a widget it gets 5*
B003VANOFY|4.0|These headphones are extremely comfortable, I sometimes wear them for several hours at a time.  My ears don't get all sweaty like they do with other over-ear phones. The software is fun, though I don't really use the voice effects often. The battery lasts a very long time.. .like 8 hours. If the battery runs out, you can just plug in the micro-usb charger. The cord on it is long enough to make it non-bothersome. Basically, its just a corded set of headphones then.  One feature I didn't fully appreciate until I got it was the sidetone. Talking is a lot better when your voice isn't muffled by your own headphones. Never even realized that annoyed me.  My only gripe with these is that the G-buttons don't work with Ventrilo. But, I'll live.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Took a bit to get it running. But once I did, I found it was the best weather app. for the kindle fire. At least the best one yet.
B0033AI4F2|5.0|I recently purchased another Universal title and while the screen was on the Main Menu awaiting my selection I saw an advertisement (yes Virginia, they've found yet another place to spam you with ads) for \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" coming to Blu-ray on January 31st, though it didn't specify a year.  A small amount of leg work revealed this: [[ASIN:B006FE83U4 To Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy]]  And this: [[ASIN:B006FE83V8 To Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversary Edition Collector's Series [Blu-ray Book + DVD + Digital Copy]]  I've placed a pre-order for the latter and am crossing my fingers that these are thoughtfully crafted transfers & not just another copy on another format. Hope springs eternal ...  \\"Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between.  Boo was our neighbor.  He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives.  One time, Atticus said you never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them.  Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.  The summer that had begun so long ago had ended, and another summer had taken its place, and a fall, and Boo Radley had come out.  I was to think of these days many times ... of Jem and Dill and Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, and Atticus.  He would be in Jem's room all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.\\"  After countless reads, re-reads, synopses, books about the book, books about the movie, lectures about the author, various copies of the movie, etc., etc., etc., this still manages to bring a bloody tear to my eye every stinkin' time!
B002HK9HR8|2.0|I was pleased to find this and the pricing was good.  It arrived in a timely matter.  I was not that thrilled with the package of the DVD it's self.  Almost looked like it had been hand done.  The plastic covering the case was not very tight and corners and along the side were torn.  A bit disappointed because it is a gift!!!
B004SIPAJG|4.0|Strictly Ballroom has an intentionally predictable, familiar story: mix together a bit of the wayward underdog fighting the establishment, a bit of \\"The Ugly Duckling,\\" and a bit of Romeo and Juliet, and you can guess exactly what will happen. But the film isn't much the worse for that. It's still fun and cuttingly funny, making fun of its subject and characters while simultaneously showing honest respect for them--no small feat. The subject and setting (provincial amateur ballroom dancing in Australia) were certainly unusual for the time: remember this film was made way before the ballroom-dancing reality show craze.  This movie is also quintessential Baz Luhrmann. The first part of Luhrmann's \\"Red Curtain Trilogy,\\" Strictly Ballroom helps lay the groundwork for the self-consciously theatrical, artificial style that Luhrmann would perfect in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge! Here you see Lurhmann's exaggerated--at times almost surreal--visuals, his use of kaleidoscopic color set in hyperkinetic motion, his love for the garish and outlandish, his mixture of sentiment and sarcasm, as well as his love of pop tunes from the last few decades. If nothing else, Strictly Ballroom is certainly a treat for the eyes.
1419702238|5.0|hi. i have all books of the series, these are my favorite. and again a really funny and entertaining book from Jeff Kinney. i recommand to everyone, both to kids and adults.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It works great.  Have not had any issues.  Some options are slightly hard to find, but they are there.  Download it!
B005PTYOTE|3.0|Always wanted an upscaled version of all three mission impossibles.  I get tired of seeing people review a Blu ray set because of the companies marketing strategy.  Who cares?  Thats how the industry works. Your reviewing the product at hand, not the purpose of the release. If you don't want it, dont get it and move on.    Anyways, I've only gotten to the first blu ray, Mission Impossible and the video transfer is just OK.  I am in the video and film industry, so my eyes are more adjusted to particulars.  To me, the video seems a bit fuzzy compared to other upscaled transfers I've seen and owned. The colors are a bit washed out and not as vibrant as one would expect.  Not to bad given this version over a standard DVD but if your looking for that ultimate blu ray experience, I am not sure this is it.  The sound is only 5.1  surround, nothing special or upgraded there either which was a bit disappointing.   I am a huge fan of the series and always wanted to own all 3.  I only paid $9 bucks after using Discover reward points.  Definitely worth it for me.  SInce there is no other blu ray options for the series, I give this 3 stars.
0525423656|4.0|While some series tend to simply continue the story, Ally Condie has created entirely new challenge in CROSSED.  Cassia and Ky are still very much the same, but they know more...and less...about the Society and what's beyond its borders.  Xander (oh, Xander) also plays a role in this book, which left me a bit breathless.  It's a puzzle, and we're all trying to figure out the pieces.  Everyone has secrets to hide and lies to tell.  In the meantime, Cassia and Ky need to find one another.<br /><br />The chapters alternate between Cassia and Ky, so the reader is given access to what each of them are doing.  While I usually feel that this writing method is overdone, especially in YA, I feel like it fits here because each character has their own quest, their own story to tell.<br /><br />CROSSED is the second part in Ally Condie's Matched series. I absolutely flipped for MATCHED, which was my pick for the #1 Young Adult book of 2010 (For original review, click HERE).  For this reason, I was a bit afraid to read CROSSED.  While I preferred MATCHED, I feel like CROSSED is a worthy sequel and I can't wait to read the third book, which will be released in November 2012.  (I have a long time to wait!)<br /><br />\\"Love changes what is probable and makes unlikely things possible.\\"
0553582038|4.0|I loved the quality of the book and the speed of the delivery, though I did not like the content of the book as much as was expecting to like it. Most of the book covered parts of the story that I wasn't really interested in. I love the series as a whole though.
B004X80QNG|1.0|The inability to sync with tootle calendar on Kindle Fire made me feel like I wasted money on something I got for free. Looks like an amazing program but Amazon needs to get Google apps.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Seems to be a great app. BUT ... no sync to Google (or if it should work, it is very obtuse how to do so). Menu includes a \\"Google Sync\\" option. But it doesn't work. The documentation and product notes should clearly state what is available and what is not so people (like me) don't spend lots of time trying to make a feature work as well as hunting online for the answer to why what should be a simple feature-enable operation does not work. Come on folks ... a free app is great. Thank you! But, do the right thing and clearly indicate if you are providing crippleware. Were it not for feature-crippling, this would be a 4 or 5 star app.
0385534639|5.0|Excellent, excellent, story. I fell in love with the eloquent way The Night Circus was written. Not only do we hear it from Celia and Marco's points of view, but from several different characters who hold significance in the story. You understand how each person felt and how they handled a situation. The reader is also given the perspective of visiting the circus and the emotions that come along with it. This was a big plus for me, because Erin Morgenstern not only gave avid details of the sights and colors, but also the sounds of those around you, the smells of popcorn, and the feelings of elation and curiosity at being enthralled by Le Cirque des Rêve's uniqueness and allure. The Night Circus rates extremely high in opinion, and I highly recommend it to you.<br />Full Review on Mother/Gamer/Writer
B005URRCUY|4.0|First off, this is pretty much the album I thought they would make after reading that they were listening to a lot of early punk and rock music, and thats what influenced the sound of El Camino. So it was no suprise that it wasnt going to be as bluesy.  Ive been excited for this album since I read that they were working on a follow up to Brothers, which wasnt a great album. And after listening to the minute and a half previews on itunes, and the 30 second previews on Amazon, I wasnt sure if i would really like this album, but I bought it anyway.  But this is a great follow up to Brothers, so Im glad they made something different, and no, this is not a \\"Brothers Part 2\\", I would compare it more to another album like Attack and Release.  All the songs are just straight up rockin, and I think they are great!  So there you go, not a blues album since that didnt influece the sound, but it is a great upbeat rock album that was inspired by rock and punk.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|johnny- had great artist working with him, and he nailed this one. i really enjoyed the album and his support groups. tom. purchsed from amazon
B005V20JKI|5.0|Wow, that is all I can say. This is one of my favorite games on my Kindle Fire (next to Cut the Rope), and rightfully so. Its quick, fun, and has responsive controls. The only complaint I have that is sometimes when you grab the muffin your character moves causing you to die if an enemy is nearby.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|\\"Passive Me Aggressive You\\" by New Zealand's The Naked and Famous gets my vote for album of the year! Sheer soul candy!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is insanely addicting and so much fun. My fiancee constantly takes my Kindle Fire to play this game. The graphics are great and the controls are too. No complaints, well worth the $1.00!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I bought this DVD to take with me to Houston for Thanksgiving.  My elderly parents loved it and we can't wait to see the sequel!
B006J38144|5.0|I was a little surprised that the season finale was not quite as \\"Shakespearean\\" as they had set it up to be - but I'm just happy to know we've got another season coming.  Adore this show.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Got it in perfect condition and I love it. I got it so much cheaper here than purchasing it somewhere else. My boyfriend is going to love it for Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app works great on the Kindle Fire.  I use it daily when at home and while on the road.  I add the cities along my route and then select the city as I approach it.  The app is easy to set up and use.  I highly recommend it.
B006FS22Y8|4.0|This final collection of songs from Amy Winehouse proves that the world lost a true original talent with her tragic demise in 2011. And, yes, I can hear the critics and the haters with their snarky comments in the background- we all know that the singer's personal battles and demons were tabloid fodder and people seem to still enjoy projecting their own insecurity/superiority towards her. Granted, the collection is somewhat uneven and has rough patches as it is obviously not an \\"concept album\\" but it does not by any means feel like a hastily patched together effort from her label to \\"cash in\\" one last time. Rather, the songs are a mix of original compositions: \\"Between the Cheats\\" \\"Best Friends?\\" and covers from the likes of \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\\" \\"Our Day Will Come\\"...each selection showing Amy's masterful use of her vocal instrument that displays raw emotion as no one else can. My personal favorite is \\"Tears Dry\\" (original version) which in its lower level instrumentation than the final version on \\"Back To Black\\" allows Amy's vocal interpretation to transport the listener to her unique world where music reigned supreme. This collection is  a must for Amy's fans but also a valuable addition to our collective musical history. Bottom line, a credible and respectful addendum to Amy Winehouse's discography highlighting the singer's incredible range of voice, story, song, and emotion. R.I.P., Amy- you were a true original and cannot be replaced.
145551389X|5.0|this book is like the friggin bible is just so amazing, 350 pages of pure gaga, i just love it <3 worth every penny
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman is epic the plot is awesome the setting sweet the Charactors are just like they are supposed to be portrayed in the Spiderman Comics. Man Does spidermman Deliver??? You Betcha i was so amazed by the special effects of this film whe i watched it for the first time.My favorite actor in this film is Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane. Wow is she hot and she does a great job staying true to her charactor.        This is one of the best superhero movies out there bar none.it raises the envelope in terms of action suspense and canage and its a little different from the commic book but mostly the same which is a good thing.Spiderman aka Peter Parker is just like he is supposed to be portrayed in the comics as a nervouse dweeb - nerd that has a tough time making new friends and getting girlfriends.     All that will change when he gets bitten by a spider that gives him amazing SuPERPOWERS beyond his Wildest dreams. Lets just say Peter after  getting bitten by that Spider is never the same again. Like the saying goes change is good and in peter Parker's case it is but not in the green Goblin's case aka Harries dad. He makes a big mistake and turns into an evil dude with wicked powers.  This is a nice long well done movie that is so fantastic and epic i cant even begin to imagine  how hard it must have been for the directors and crew to get this film to be as special as it is.         So Sam Raimi  Directs this great film and boy does he do a great job staying true to the comic books and bringing Spiderman to life at last on the big screen. it seems these days no comic charactors or even cartoon charactors can stay away from the big screen and thats great for us movie lovers.      Scoobydoo was one cartoon among a few others that was made into a movie no not an animated movie a realistic looking movie like this one. Spiderman used to be considered a superhero just for kids but this aint the case anymore. This aint no animated spiderman tv show This is SPiderman themovie which i highly recommend to fans of superhero movies    and try to remember all your'e never to old to like superheros cause they give us hope even though they aren't real cause i find that theres a hero in all of us.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this solitaire game! easy to use, tons of options for customizing, and great features! definitely a good download.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I was disturbed that hat this app didn't authenticate my Google account information. I also didn't see a place to use an alternate account. The week view was not useful to me. I need to see the hours of the day and length of the appointments like the native web view. That's more of a taste opinion though. Perhaps more customized view options in future updates? I got this as a free app of the day. It was okay, but it doesn't warrant the daily driver status for me. I will keep it to see updates will evolve this software.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|It's a hot ass movie with Penelope Cruz in it in Barcelona Spain with this other hot ass bitch and this hot ass dude and they have hot ass sex on the reg.
B0060LYM34|5.0|the problem has been fixed it is armageddon and this is a really good movie. great action flick is a little too much love story at times but great movie
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I've reviewed this entire series again and give Fast Five a nod for the action, story and for bringing The Rock and original cast members along for the ride. scratch that, along for the story. The real difference between the series and Fast Five is less fast cars and racing and more plot storyline. I especially liked the truck. I don't know what make it is but it alone is worthy of credit(s). Not a stale scene, great action, well acted and gets you anxious for May 2013 to see TFATF6 keeping The Rock and adding Jason Statham.
0679746048|4.0|I recently read the book, after having loved the movie a decade ago.  I was delighted to find that the movie had been pretty much true to the book, based on how I remembered it at least.  I would highly recommend both.  The book is beautifully written, and can be appreciated at multiple levels.  On the surface, it is a compelling, interesting tale to read; ultimately, being a book about sorrow and redemption.  But if you delve a bit deeper, it's also a book that inspires questions.  What do you have in common with Susanna, and where do your minds diverge?  How might her treatment be different, or the same, if she presented today with the same symptoms?  If someone fluctuates from lucid to irrational, at what point do they need medical intervention?  At what point do they need an inpatient medical intervention?  To me, this was a very good book indeed, and my complaints were few.  One thing that did turn me off is that it is not a 100% chronological story.  It was a little off-putting to read about someone dying, then have them participate in the next chapter.  Plus, towards the end, especially, the individual chapters were actually collective thoughts about particular subjects, rather than a sequential story.  Still, the book was very effective overall, and I would recommend it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is what it is.  is free so you have to deal with an add after every hand.  not many bells or whistles but looks and plays well on my kindle fire.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Love this app, couldn't care less that it doesn't sync with google calendar. I will use this a long time.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I normally try to install the free applications of the day.... Normally do not say anything but this application would not open on my droid. I tried to uninstall it and reinstall it.
B005L38QHA|5.0|One of the best mouses I've bought. I got it strictly for playing MMO's and I love the extra buttons it comes with, they are well placed and easy to use!
B004JPJHME|5.0|Great Movie, a must have for any movie collection. Johnny Depp offers another amazing performance along with Benicio Del Toro.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you love Science Fiction this is GREAT. Never saw the series but being a fan of \\"Castle\\" drew me to this. The complete series is all here for a terrific price. The story line, the characters, the actors...perfect fit. Complete this series with the final chapter movie \\"Serenity\\".
