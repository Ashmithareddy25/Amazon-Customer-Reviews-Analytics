B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Ok, when I originally ordered this the description just said \\"Digital Copy\\" which has always equated to iTunes compatible and more importantly a true copy you could download to a device and take with you wherever you went, like say an airplane.  No, no, no...UltraViolet is Ultra annoying and impractical.  Honestly, you can use it on your mobile phone but only if you are connected to WiFi...if I were at home I would watch on my TV.   This is nothing but a deceptive business practice being used by WB to try and lock in people to a service that doesn't really work.  These people jsut don't get their consumers and more importantly don't care!    Horribly disappointed with this purchase...if I had know they would drop the ball on this when I originally ordered I would have just purchased via iTunes.  Save the couple bucks and just buy the standard 3D version if you want the discs.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|Buyer Beware! This boxed set does NOT come with a valid digital copy, even though the product picture says it does and the product description said it came with it when I bought it -- \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo + Digital Copy)\\".  There was nothing in the product description indicating that the digital copy had expired over a month before I purchased this.
B005UG53NS|5.0|Out of all the Harry Potter movies the final movie beats them all! It reveals more to the story. Sad to see the saga end. Has a lot of great actors and actress. Can't wait to see what else J.K. Rowling will write.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down the minute I read the first few pages. The characters jump out from the book in a way I hadn't experienced ever since the Harry Potter series, they are super believable and just perfect. Even though the plot didn't hook me in the first time I read the review, I loved the book since the very beginning.<br /><br />Collins puts in the story just the right amount of rebellion, surviving skills, romance, friendship, longing and morals. The second you finish this book you'll be reaching out for the second one (catching fire) so if you don't own a kindle, go ahead and buy the three of them all at once because it will be frustrating not having the second around when you're done.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|BOSTON-BOSTON: That iconic guitar-as-spaceship cover art...TOM SCHOLZ' production perfection and multi-layered guitars...BRAD DELP's soaring, other-worldly vocals...it all added up to nothin' short of a sonic orgasm in 1976. New England's other big name rockers (AEROSMITH, J. GEILS, and THE CARS) also pumped out delicious debut albums in that decade, but unlike those groups, BOSTON shot their wad on the first try. Most tracks were virtually indistinguishable...in fact, many showed up AGAIN in thin disguise on the follow up disc DON'T LOOK BACK. The &quot;band&quot;, such as it was, was plastered on the back cover mostly for show...control freak SCHOLZ basically created this juggernaut alone in his basement, calling on DELP only for vocals, the one department in which he was lacking. Even though every song garnered radio play, MORE THAN A FEELING, with its thumping LOUIE LOUIE riff, PEACE OF MIND's slick as hell groove, and the gradually building LONG TIME were the huge hits, spurring umpteen million album sales, in-fighting and inevitable backlash for the rest of their career. Such are the foibles of a rock and roll band.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE FOREPLAYS
B000056JYC|5.0|Since seeing Peter Frampton in Kansas City 35 years ago, I had wondered if the \\"Comes Alive\\" album would have been remastered to CD. I was pleased to see it was, and after purchasing it, I was also pleased with the sound quality of the show I have long remembered. To any Peter Frampton fan, this is well worth purchasing, to be able to take a trip back to the days of \\"arena rock\\" and one of the best shows, \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\". The songs are still crisp, and the production values still strong, even by today's standards. Two thumbs up!!!
B004EPYZT4|1.0|Essentially its \\"300\\" meets \\"The Mummy\\" with the baser aspects of each, non-stop action in the usual canned fashion, gore, blood, guts, boobs. Great if your a 10 year old boy, not so great if you are looking for things like plot and character development, and find canned action movies like this tedious and boring. Fast food movie making for the masses.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book is great! It's not like any other kids book. It's got a little humor, a little mystery, a little adventure all wrapped into one sad book. It's the first book in one of the best children's book series, and one of the best in the series (actually there all good). It's a must-read!  The cons:   none really. It's a great book!  The pros:  It has the keep-reading factor. You know those books you start and Finnish in one day. This is one of them. Every time I put the book down I would find myself picking it back up again ten minutes later. No part of it is boring, and once you start it you won't stop.  It's unique. Like I said earlier is not like any other kids book. There are times when you can't stop laughing and times you want to cry. The plot is different than anything and the characters are some of the best.    This book is great for readers 7 and up. If your looking for a new series to read then this book is just for you. Buy it now!

0307593312|3.0|Q. \\"Do you know anybody who has read the whole thing?\\" (p. 614)  A. Yes.I have. All 925 pages plus the trimmings.  Q. What did you like about it?  A. The trimmings. The cover, the art, the backward page numbers. Murakami does this better than anyone. Check out \\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle.\\"   Q. Anything else?  A. I like his sense of humor.  Q. Give me an example.  A. He has a character hold off ejaculating by imagining Sonny and Cher  socializing with the two pythons on Noah's Ark.  Q. So tell me about the sex.  A. Scintillating lines. E.g. \\"I like your thingy.\\"  Q. Anything else to say about the story.   A. His fiction is stranger than truth, that's for sure. No East meets West here.  Q. Strange?  A. Two moons, two-inch people, chrysalises all over the place,  sexless conception.   Q. So how come you gave it three stars?  A. Good question. One star for the story. It's the biggest dud since Nicholson Baker's \\"House of Holes.\\" Five stars for the trimmings. Averages out to three.  Q. So would you recommend that some one buy this book.  A. Absolutely. Mine's for sale for the postage.

B0054R6BFM|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about this story.  First, it felt very very contrived and I did not believe Hannah had compelling enough reasons to kill herself.  Freak out, yes; get hysterical, sure; start to hate people, even I did.  But kill herself?  Especially because she's an only child--she KNEW that killing herself would kill her parents too, it's something only children know from the moment they understand that they are the only offspring of their parents.  Perhaps if her parents had been abusive it may have made more sense, but they were not and she must have been loved and cared for because you don't grow up being like Hannah if you grew up ignored and unwanted.  It also is only hinted at that things happened at her former school but you get absolutely no idea what those things maybe have been and they may have contributed to her feelings that bad things happened to and around her.  Throughout the whole book, I expected Hannah to show up again after all the people had listened to her tape and felt suitably chastened for their crassness, they heartlessness, their selfishness (as in \\"shyness\\").  And although Clay may have been painted as a nice guy, his image is severely tarnished because he lets \\"shyness\\" stop him from doing what he knows he should be doing, he lets his worry about what everyone would say if he embarrassed himself stop him from doing what his heart and mind know are the right things.  He \\"steals\\" the tape cassette when he could have just asked to borrow it.  He lies to his mom when he could have been upfront and said he had to work some personal stuff out regarding the death of one of his classmates--his mom probably would have allowed it but would have known her son will be going through some emotional ups and downs.  Not sure what the whole significance of the map was considering it was a kind of small town and Clay had lived there all his life so he already knew all the landmarks Hannah referred to--that just seemed like a kind of unnecessary addition.  And when your life gets so hopeless you seriously start to consider suicide, you don't send out maps, you don't make tapes in such specific chronological order pointing the finger and post them; you're emotionally distraught and your thinking is way off, you may make a recording of who's to blame but you don't do it like Hannah supposedly did--that just felt so false.  And when you've really made up your mind to kill yourself, really kill yourself and not just faking or asking to be rescued, you just do it; you leave and let everyone deal with it, you let everyone figure out their own reasons for why.  Yea, maybe for school counselors this is a good book--because Hannah's counselor sure had no training on how to be counselor to a teenager; growing up for young women is quite different then for young men and trying to relate how it feels to have a sizeably bigger and stronger boy grab you against your will is something that most adult males can never understand fully.  I don't feel that any of the teenagers I know or have known would find this story realistic or instructive since THERE IS NO GUIDANCE FOR A TEENAGER ON THE VERGE OF SUICIDE TO TAKE except for a referral to a suicide hotline. I have a feeling most teenagers would not turn to an adult for help or guidance, would not feel comfortable divulging their inner feelings to an adult because so many adults in their lives do make them feel inexperienced and that their life experiences are insignificant but to the kids these things are paramount and are drowning them, they don't want to hear that in time it'll all be meaningless, they don't want to hear that you just shrug it off and ignore it.  To some, maybe most, reputation is huge.  I would only recommend this book to a teenager only to see how they feel about it.

B005LJITS0|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Story was choppy. Characters and storyline undeveloped.  What a waste of film.
B002436WFI|2.0|It's hard to know what to say about this:  they had such a mish-mash of ideas that came to nothing.  But some of them were good.<br /><br />One thing that'll make you sit bolt upright is the ending, which is abrupt, unexpected, thought-provoking, and, well, French in character.<br /><br />However, thinking back on it, I don't think the movie \\"earned\\" that ending:  it was not that coherent.  It seemed rather that they didn't know how to tie the two story threads together and so simply ended it by rolling the credits.  I found this highly dissatisfying and weird for a movie that was so light-hearted in character:  it was almost like it was a betrayal of what went before, rather than a completion or a resolution.<br /><br />And the tourist?  Please!  Why couldn't it have just been about a rogue wizard on the run?  That was a serviceable enough premise!  Why'd you have to add all that other junk?
B005AUWY90|5.0|Car's 2 and another triumph for Pixar. I am at a total lost about the people that whine and bellyache about the least little thing. IT's A MOVIE people! It's not the real world. It's entertainment and it does a wonderful job of entertaining. I am so fed up with people who have to complain about such a masterpiece just to make themselves feel important. I think they have all been brain washed by Michael Bay. I love most of his films but agree with what the guys said in Fanboys. All style and no substance. The edits don't have to be 3 per second to keep my attention. People are getting lazy about watching movies and if it don't constantly bash them in the brain with mindless sensory overload, they just about fall asleep. That's truly sad. Cars'2 delivers on the humor, the action, visuals of other countries that are breathtaking and a story that is easy to follow and has a positive message. To the person who complained about the cars threatening to kill other cars and how it was going to destroy their kids brains, trust me. Your kids have heard way worse than that on TV and even more so at school. Grow up and stop waiting for the world to sanitize everything for you. Mator has a much larger role in this film and I am so glad. McQueen is pretty much my least favorite character but I can take him or leave him. He don't destroy the show by any means. Pixar knew they had a wonderful character in Mator so they gave us more of him this time and I am SO glad they did. The scene in the Japanese restroom is fall out of your chair funny. The wasabi incident equally funny. Many little in jokes including a rare quote from the 60's Adam West Batman film where he says, \\"If I could just reverse the polarity\\". I bet very few people got that one. Pixar has huge amounts of time for the creators to come up with funny stuff and it surely shows. No film is perfect and everyone is entitled to their opinion but give Pixar a break and appreciate the endless hours that went into creating thiswonderful movie that is suitable for the entire family. 5 minutes in, I knew it had to be part of my collection and I fully recommend it to all ages.
B005LJITS0|4.0|Most of the bad reviews on Amazon seem to relate to problems with formats that don't work.<br /><br />I thought the film itself was well done, and I am sorry I missed it in the theater.<br />It is better than the critics said and you shouldn't listen to them anyway. I've discovered over the years that those that can't do, critique.<br />I don't think the lead actor portrayed Green Lantern as a silly irresponsible fool. He was dealing with his own very human weaknesses and I appreciated not having him be a one dimensional caricature. I made sure I waited to see the 'real' ending. I could see the train wreck coming and I hope they do a sequel.<br />If you want light, fast paced entertainment watch it. You can't beat Amazon's deal on the rental. If you are looking for some deep philosophical exploration of ...whatever, you won't find that here. LOL
B00005JKZV|4.0|I'll be honest; this wasn't my favorite of Peter Jackson's movies. Admittedly, I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to Rohan and its characters, so this is probably the reason why it had me angry for part of the movie. Specifically, any part of the movie involving Faramir. What does this have to do with Rohan, you may ask? Read the chapter \\"The Steward and the King\\" from \\"Return of the King\\" and you will understand. I felt that Faramir was weakened as a character due to the changes the movie made from the book. Why, for instance, did the ring have to go to Osgiliath, and why does Faramir just stare stupidly while Frodo climbs to the top of a random wall and stands in front of a Nazgul? Why would he then decide Frodo's an okay ringbearer and send him on his way? It doesn't make logical sense.<br /><br />There were enough good points in the movie to look over the logical fallacies, though. I did enjoy seeing the various locations as envisioned by the crew, and some of the visuals were downright spectacular. If I were judging by the visuals, I would be giving this movie five stars. However, the plot bothered me enough to mark this down to four stars.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Every year I buy Nicholas Sparks books for myself and my daughter.  We have loved everyone.  I was so disappointed by this book, the amount of violience was to much for me.  Not sure I will be in a big hurry to buy the next book until after the reviews are out.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Beautiful. I felt as though I was given the privledge of being a part of their love. The ending was typical Sparks but after the tears were dried, I felt satisfied and complete. Good job Mr. Sparks.
0143034901|5.0|One of the best novels I've read in recent years.<br />The raving reviews are correct: once you start reading it's difficult to put down.<br />Zafon's novel is an intricate story within a story; a mixture of mystery, humor, detective, love, deception, aphorisms, good vs. bad, \\"gothic\\" tale that is already considered a masterpiece for the right reasons.<br />Highly recommended fun told in a fluent language that is promised to be a mind-blowing page-turner.<br />Loved it and most probably I'm going to read it again in the future.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I bought this today for the so called \\"digital copy\\" since I'm on vacation so I could watch the movie on my iPad for the flight home.  Needless to say it ended up being pointless since iPads are not compatitable and IF an airline has wireless to stream you have to pay for that as well.  Save the $$$, buy the movie only version.
0393064476|3.0|I consider myself to be a person in the modern camp.  I am non-religious, scientifically minded and a humanist and when I heard about \\"Swerve\\", I had to read it.  It seemed like red meat for me.  Actually it was way too much red meat.    By the time I reached half way through the book, I was feeling such rage against the Roman Catholic Church that my heart was pounding.  An institution raging in obscuritanism, mass delusion,murder and suppression of the mind had blotted out the advance of Western Civilization, until a scribe found an ancient poem.  I put the book down and calmed down myself.  Later on, I skimmed the last half of the book.    The problem with \\"Swerve\\" is that it is a polemic and it is trying to be something else.  If you want a polemic against christianity and how it has ruined Western Civilization, I recommend Friedrich Nietzsche's \\"The Anti-Christ\\".  Nietzsche admitted he was writing a polemic and he was one of best polemic writers of all time.  The polemical nature of this book weakens it, since it seems that the fires have to be relit  constantly and you get the impression that a lot of information is being left out that does not feed the fire.    Another problem with \\"Swerve\\", is the way Lucretius is handled.  His poem is treated as the only spark that ignited generations of scientific minds in Western Civilization.  It is utterly too simplistic.  Indeed the Catholic Church itself harbored humanists and scientific thinkers before the Reformation caused them to shamefully over react later on.  The dome of Saint Peter's Basilica was not built by other worldly delusional thinkers.  Did the architects of St Peter's have a copy of Lucretius with them?    \\"Swerve\\" is an interesting read, but it is like I say sometimes after seeing a movie about a historical period.  If you are interested enough in the subject, go read some books on it.  If you are interested in how the world became modern, you need a lot of books, not just this one.

If your looking for high art or Batman qualities --go re-rent BATMAN,  if your looking for good fun hack/slash/quip film worth the admission price.

B0045U9WPU|5.0|If you want in a nutshell how good this book was.... After reading straight for 3 hrs i was halfway through the book (There are about 450 pages). I would have kept reading and read until i was done with it but sadly i had school the next day and i didn't want to stay up any later then i already had.<br /><br />I have to say it was somewhat predictable.<br /><br />*******SPOILER******<br />[ She gets a guy, she falls in love, hes actually not cured, they run away together, they get caught... The only real surprise was him not going with her.]*******<br /><br />I knew the basics what were going to happen it was just when and how they were going to happen. But i probably know the basics of will happen because i read too many romance/adventure/defying some kind of power books. So in the end it was a great book, it kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole ride.
B004R96TN2|4.0|Like others, my box arrived damaged.  The glue used to seal the box had let go and as a result, the box squished/collapsed.  What truly perplexed me though (maybe I'm just blind!?)  but WHAT are the 3 extra cards for???  I can find no meaning of them in the guide book, nor are they referenced in the description of spreads.  The box clearly advertises 68 cards, but they only number 65 cards and leave the reader hanging with these last 3 with absolutely no mention of what they represent in a reading.  Very peculiar indeed.  That said, I like Froud's oracle cards.  I do prefer the original box set but this is a nice addition if you already have the first.  If you don't have the original, I recommend that you start with it over this set.  This set is a little harder to do basic readings with but it is great for pulling a card to explore a cosmic message to yourself.  I'm finding it very accurate for that purpose.  Lastly, the artwork is not as impressive as in the original set.  Some characters are obvious reprints, but the depth of character is not the same.
0385738773|2.0|I have to say i am very disappointed in this book. The other 2 books in the series were very exciting and had lots of twists and turns. I felt like the book was just to tie the lose ends together. I think that it could of been done in a better fashion and the way it was done it was not exciting at all. There was barley any action and i just didn't like the book at all.
0525423656|5.0|My expectations were high after reading (and LOVING) Matched, and Crossed definitely didn't disappoint. Beautiful lanuage, compelling characters, fantastic plot and pacing- Condie just keeps getting better. As a word of warning, make sure you're sitting somewhere comfy and have a couple of hours free when you open the cover, because you won't want to put this one down. Hands-down the best book I've read this year.
1423140591|5.0|What I Liked: 1) Percy! I've liked him as a character ever since I read The Lightening Thief. I get really attached to characters with a long story, especially when I feel like I can see them growing and maturing and learning from their mistakes. That's something that Mr. Riordan has done really well. 2) The introduction of Camp Jupiter. Through six books now, we've focused on a central setting, or home base of Camp Half-Blood, where the Greek demi-gods learn to...stay alive. (Stayin' alive, stayin' alive!) Camp Jupiter, on the other hand, is something very different than Camp Half-Blood. And you'll just have to read it to find out what that is. 3) We also got some new characters in Hazel and Frank. I liked them...but I'm still partial to Annabeth and Grover. I even liked Piper and Leo I think better than Hazel and Frank. I'm really hoping that in the next book we get to see all these characters coming together! That would be awesome. 4) The Roman Gods. The Roman version of some of the gods we've already met were very interesting. And I always like it when there are new mythical creatures they have to fight, and meeting new gods. It had to have taken a lot of research to write all these different books, between the Greek and Romans. And a lot of talent, which Mr. Riordan definitely has, to make sure that they seem so different between books. 5) In Riordan fashion, there is of course a quest for the heros to follow. But Camp Jupiter has a completely different way of determining the quests, and who goes. It brings a lot of Roman history into the story, and everything melds really well into the story. I loved it.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: It made me curious that Poseidon/Neptune never made an appearance. It didn't detract from the book, but I did wonder about it once I was finished. This was also the first book that I didn't feel like had a main character. The Percy Jackson books were so much about Percy, but even The Lost Hero was a lot about Jason. It almost felt like in this one, the author was so worried about it becoming another Percy Jackson book, that he didn't spend as much time with Percy, who had a really interesting story line trying to discover who he was. I wish there had been a bit more on that. It seemed a little easy.<br /><br />Overall thoughts: Another phenomenal book from this fantastic author. Rick Riordan is probably in my top five favorite authors, and I'm thrilled to find out where he's going with the Heros of Olympus next. There was an interesting little twist at the very end that made me so curious that I can't believe we have almost a year to wait until we get The Mark of Athena. If you haven't ever read a Rick Riordan book, make sure you add some to your list. Best start with the Percy Jackson books before you move into the Heros of Olympus (it just makes more sense that way). And the Kane Chronicles are absolutely fabulous too!this one, the author was so worried about it becoming another Percy Jackson book, that he didn't spend as much time with Percy, who had a really interesting story line trying to discover who he was.

0385335997|2.0|So far I have only read Outlander and a few things popped out at me. 1) was the editor intoxicated while reading? There were a copious amount of mistakes. 2) in the first 200 pages which took place in one month three seasons passed. That's not how seasons work... 3) gabaldon did not develop her main character well. I seemed to be in third person omniscient but the reader was at a loss as to how Claire actually felt about important events that happened to her. For example in on night she almost got raped about a dozen times. Instead of being paranoid or afraid or anything she feels nothing and continues. Not even the strongest of women could go though something like that without so much as a shiver. 4) the relationships going on in that book were unrealistic. The moment Claire says hi she seems to immediately become best friends with them. As for when she met Jamie she immediately acted as if she had known him for years and freaked out like a little school girl when the \\"love of her life\\" fell of the horse after a few hours of knowing him. No love works that way in my opinion. 5) clearly this woman has never had a drink before because the moment she has a sip she automatically trips over things and acts drunk. 6) this author needs to do more research and seriously sit down with her characters and get to know them. 6) one thing positive about this book though is that it had a good plotline and an interesting world.

1451648537|5.0|I don't read books at all. The only reason I bought and read this was because recently I bought a mac and am loving it and secondly because there was so much in news about Steve Jobs when he passed away, that i could not resits not giving this a try. But unlike other big books where I run out of patience, this book kept my attention. The author has done an excellent job. It is written very well. And to that writing you add the personality of Steve Jobs and the output is an amazing experience for the reader. If you know technology and if you are around technology, you will love this book. If not, you will still like it because of the complexities in Steve Jobs and his relationships with his employees, his business partners and his family. Steve Jobs was far from perfect. But at the same time he was far from normal. Read it, you will not regret the experience.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|Ultraviloet is a rip off you cannot load it into iTunes. This needs to be addressed. When we pay for a digital copy it should be a digital copy and not some crackpot company trying to push their software on you, just because they don't like apple.
B004LROUNG|5.0|There is no right or wrong reading this book. Either you get it or you don't.<br />Not every book he published meet my taste, my brain wave so to speak. It is  like someone telling you a joke and you look at them blank face or you laugh till you need an adult diaper. This book, this story is one of them that I click, I enjoy how he telling a story. The law language is clear enough that I understand and not flew above my head. It's about everyday average people trying to make a living day to day, living on paycheck waiting for a big break just like us the higher % population in the country.. When opportunity  knock on you door in this case a widow's door that could make you rich and retire early you do whatever it takes to get it ..that set this story in motion and lives changing literally ... The plot and story line he wrote make you alway guess what next .. Did I guess right? Or darn.. missed it kind of pace he has written. From time to time when I  reach some chapter I have the moment that I want to hit the bar at 7.51 am too.. Similar feeling there like one of the main character has..<br />Again.. I love this book and it's for me. Hope others enjoy this book as much as I have..
B005LJK3AC|3.0|As the title of my review says, the movie was amusing enough. It was worth the rental fee, was entertaining enough, got some good laughs out of me, and was neither great nor horrible.  The one star reviews are unfair to it, but so are the five star ones, extremely so. The movie really deserves three stars, in my opinion. I'd rent it again, it was worth the money.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|This movie is a classic hit piece with no effort to present an unbiased review of the food industry. They say that they gave corporations opportunities for their input but I seriously doubt it given the effort this movie makes to purposely make them look bad.     Probably one of the most telling parts of this movie is the chicken farmer that ended up losing her contract with the food industry. They paint her as a victim of the food industry's greed but the first thing I noticed when they showed her chicken barns where the lack of air circulation. She didn't have fans keeping the chickens cool and they were dying because of it. They showed some dead but I would bet that more chickens died on the way to the \\"Big Five\\" due to the additional stress of being loaded and shipped. The corporations can't have farmers delivering to them dead stock. But this movie made little mention of this but instead focused its attention on her plight and the \\"bad\\" corporations who put her in this situation, only there are numerous other chicken farmers who were making money.    These type of people who produce these movies always look for victims and exploit them. They will put little or no weight on the victim possibly being responsible for their position. When you see this, take the entire movie with a giant grain of salt. They have an agenda and don't care what the truth is. No wonder the corporate bosses wanted nothing to do with this hit piece.    Its so sad that our young generation is so suseptible to this kind of propaganda. They make sure that the one side is painted as evil while the other side victims. They make sure that the evil side is faceless and not human. They make certain that their viewpoint cannot be countered.     There is some knowledge to be learned in this movie but the overall theme is just garbage. No corporate boss wants to put contaminated or questionable food into the market. There is no way they could know that it wouldn't come back to their family or friends. They have a HUGE interest in making the food they put into the market the safest and best product they can make.
B005NPCJ88|2.0|I gave this two stars only because it nice to have new music from 5FDP, but this album sounds like it was written during a weekend bbq. Every song uses the same formula as the first two records. I'll explain:  1. Opening: guitars lay down the opening riff. Drums double kick.   2. Verse: guitars repeat riff. Drums play a basic pattern. Vocals scream/growl  3. Chorus: guitars play whole notes. Drums double kick. Vocals sing  4. Verse: repeat   5. Chorus: repeat  6. Solo  7. Chorus  8. End  Each song around a radio friendly 3.5 minutes.  5FDP is one of my favorite bands but I was hoping now that they have a pretty large following they would expand their sound and try something different on a few songs. After a few listenings, I shelved it....already
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Unfortunately, Lucas keeps changing the movies because he sees them as unfinished. Well, what we fell in love with was what we saw, whether it was finished or not. He seems to be changing it for himself, because the majority of fans just want the theatrical release in Blu-Ray I would argue. The more he changes it so he likes it, the less we do.  Lucas did better when he had less technology, he did what he could and focused on the quality of the story. Now with technology easily wielded, he is doing unthinkable things to the franchise. The same thought process that came up with Jar Jar Binks.

159514188X|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book due to the many positive reviews I had read. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. I realise it has been written for \\"teens\\" but to respond to one comment that said \\" the best book I have read\\" I suggest you broaden your reading material. It is badly written, the characters did not grab me in any way and Hannah sounded like she needed to toughen up. To be honest I couldn't finish this utterly boring book.
1451648537|2.0|The Steve Jobs' biography is a best seller not because it is by a great writer nor is it good, but because people are interested in Steve Jobs.  It's a terrible book which reads like a manual of Jobs life and his careers and turning Jobs into a single dimensional robot.  If the theme is about a man needing perfection and control, Isaacson elucidates that it is because Jobs was abandoned at birth.  The abandonment seems to satisfy Isaacson in explaining Jobs mercurial, rude behavior and his easy tears when Jobs doesn't get his way.  It is too much clichés and trite by a writer who had been the chairman of CNN.  Yet, Jobs had asked Isaacson to write his biography and giving Isaacson free rein.  If Jobs had read the book, he would have really hated it not because of the things said about him in the book but because the book is dull, unimaginative, and it shows that Isaacson is detached, uninvolved, and even uninterested in his subject. The single important thing to Jobs is passion and the biography is a big yawn.    I wanted the myth of the man, and was not yet ready to have it demolished by a mediocre writer.  If only Jobs had left it all alone, then a great writer would come along with zest and excitement in a few years to fill the holes of an extraordinary man.    Perhaps we would truly know:    \\"O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend / The brightest heaven of invention.\\"
0061650498|5.0|I am 11 years old,and think this book is amazing!!!I cannot get over how detailed and brutally true to life this piece is. Really inspiring and beautiful. So many good scenes encased in the pages, like Francy(the main character)having to buy the saturday night meat from a surly butcher,and how they got there big green Christmas tree and getting several bumps and scrapes in the process,or how aunt Sissy got her baby............in a very pratical way.  All of them impeccably vivid and startling the way a little 11 year old saw the world in Broooklyn,New York in 1912 and then moving on to when Francy is 14,In 1915. It is great in audio(Kate Burton dose a fantastic emotinal reading!!!) or paper back.Has some sexual themes, but its all done in a very human and nataral way,nothing sleazy.This book is perfect for a slow rainy afternoon with a hot cup of mint tea!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|THERE WAS NO MENTION OF \\"ULTRAVIOLET\\" MONTHS AGO WHEN I ORDERED!  I also cancelled my order for Hangover 2 tonight when I realized it was part of the same studio scam. Do NOT believe the news release yesterday that \\"Ultraviolet has been \\"fixed\\" for HP7 or that there is a download of an actual movie involved with THIS purchase.  You will be directed to an APP on iTunes that will facilitate streaming through Flixster, but NO DIGITAL COPY! Hasn't the studio earned ENOUGH from U.S. Potter fans without subjecting them to this indignity for the LAST chapter? Pretty tragic and telling that they wouldn't dare try this scam overseas or with the region free edition! BOYCOTT ULTRAVIOLET/FLIXSTER by not funding this greedy bait and switch! Garden variety FRAUD!
B00002E224|5.0|It would take a hard heart indeed not to be warmed by this fantastic movie. Richard Linklater has never been better than when he made this part-improvised character piece, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy both shine as the star-crossed strangers who discover love blossoming between them over a twenty-four hour period. Few modern films have done a better job of exploring a particular time and place than this one does. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? You can't go wrong with this thoroughly contemporary romantic classic.

0385535139|4.0|This is another quick read from Grisham. Once again the subject is tort law, except this time the leading firm are a pair of low budget ambulance chasing lawyers who have never tried a big case in their careers. If you liked the earlier book The King of Torts, you will find many similaraties in this one. There are some laughs and the book is a quick read. Often the public  thinks the law is so exciting from watching tv, or that all lawyers are rich. You don't realize that many lawyers may never even see the inside of a courtroom. Grisham doesnt hold the large corporate firms in high regard which is noted in many of his books. Same goes for the big tort lawyers and how they operate. Clearly he knows this subject well. This book was more enjoyable for me than his last The Confession.

1847879071|5.0|Do not hesitate to buy this book! I just finished my PhD. While I had a couple of statistics courses, they were not sufficient to help me analyze the data in my study. Andy's book was a great way to re-familiarize myself with the statistics I already knew, to learn new tests, and most importantly, how to do conduct them with SPSS. The book is also good about referencing other helpful books and articles.   My only caveat about the book is that some of the information is misleading, particularly with regard to higher level tests. For example, if you you're doing multiple regression or ANCOVA and there's a significant interaction between treatment conditions and one of the co-variates, Andy kind of throws his hands up in the air and says \\"this violates the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes... see this other chapter to do a much more complicated test.\\" But, if you do your homework, you realize Andy's advice is wrong. In truth, there are ways to \\"probe\\" the interaction and learn how the treatments behave at different levels of the co-variate. It's a pretty common procedure, so it's kind of stunning that Andy missed this.  This issue aside, I still think of this book as my statistics bible. Just know that if you're interested in doing more complicated tests, you need to do your homework and look at other references, too.

1451648537|5.0|I'm among those who felt sorrow at Steve Job's passing. I must confess, not so much for him and his family as for the rest of the human family. That said, my heart does very much go out to his wife and children and to all those who loved him. I have no doubt that his absence is leaving an enormous hole. Why I am so sad is because I think the order of his accomplishments is on par with Prometheus bringing fire to humanity and he had it in him to do so, so much more.<br /><br />\\"Steve Jobs\\" was a riveting, fast and easy read, utterly fascinating because Jobs' life, accomplishments and personality was so. The rise of consumer technologies changed our world dramatically and it's surprising what an exciting story it makes. It's fairly clear to me that, had Jobs allowed others to temper him any more than they did, or had he done so himself, we would not be enjoying the fruits of his labor. He was of a piece and his products a clean expression of him.<br /><br />I read the book on my iPhone, using the Kindle app. It tells you what percentage of the book you've already read. When, as I was reading, I felt that the biographer was not getting to the meat of Steve's personality, when he failed to explore the deeper meaning of Steve Jobs, I thought there was plenty of time. I didn't realize that such a large percentage at the end of the book would be notes, etc. I was startled and disappointed when the book ended without any introspection around Jobs. This still being a 5 star review is a testament to what an amazing man Steve Jobs was and what a great story the story of Apple is.<br /><br />It fell to Isaacson to gain a deep (40 interviews) understanding of the man, the company, the times and the accomplishments and impact. And by deep I mean, the psychological, spiritual and even transcendent aspects of the life of this man who had such an extraordinary effect on so many of us. Isaacson, regrettably, truly and utterly missed the opportunity, to do so. It seems he made lots of notes and cobbled them together well. The reader gets many facts and quite a few opinions, but what is utterly lacking is insight.<br /><br />I don't understand how Walter Isaacson, an important man with many great responsibilities, could fail so completely in delivering insight that comes from a soulful understanding, that is overarching and gazes beyond the surface. Does he, himself, lack introspection and an active and conscious connection with his own subconscious, soul and spirit? Did he not see the mythological, another fine intersection, this one of the worldly and the transcendent? If he had made this connection he could have given us Steve Jobs and the story of Apple in a way such that we could apply it to our own lives, as the mythological is a universal context.<br /><br />But there is no one to blame but Jobs, I fear. He selected Isaacson and in those forty interviews, considering his perfectionism, as described by Isaacson, should have spotted the glaring absence of the special quality in the questions that allows for this deeper insight and revelation. It seems we will have to contend ourselves more so with his products than with insight into what made this all possible. And maybe that's okay. Maybe he couldn't be copied anyway; not everyone can be.<br /><br />The one hope I hold out is that, over time, Isaacson will gain a better understanding of what he got in those interviews, that things will gel and that he, himself will grow and that he will write another book that gives us what was absent in this one. To be fair, he was rushed. Steve Jobs did die too young.<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />It didn't happen right away, as my glowing review evinces, but something unexpected has transpired in the little over a year since I read this book. Before doing so, I was a genuine Apple and Steve Jobs admirer. It appears that \\"Steve Jobs,\\" ultimately, was a turn-off. I experience none of the enchantment I once felt with Apple and its products.notes and cobbled them together well.

0609610570|5.0|\\"The gap nobody knows\\" is growing throughout the business world, and is bridged by addressing how day-to-day operations work to get things done. Here is where your company lives and breathes--where ideas spring to life in the form of people, process, leadership and teamwork. Comprising 80% of most organizations, everyday operations are one of a company's largest investments and critical to success. It is the heart of execution--where strategy succeeds or fails. Yet it's often undervalued and ignored. Why??? This book begins to connect the dots between strategy and operations and why companies often fall short in delivering results. Highly recommended!
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I found this to be a very well thought-out and developed story.  Yes, it's a comic book story, so there are unrealities that come with the territory - they make it what it is.  Still, providing the well known Nazi experimentation philosophy with bioengineering and advanced technology as a vehicle for super-weaponry and menacing villains was a great approach, and really clicks.  The entire development of Steve Rogers to Captain America from weakling to warrior god is completely engrossing and worth watching alone.  his selfless, kind, reserved character is never lost to his strength and cunning, true to the good doctor's last request.  I also really liked the ending:  something far different from the usual fare, with a sadness that fits quite well and only adds to the overall, satisfying experience.  The World War II setting was a brilliant way to establish a superhuman character, and the cinematography only complimented this idea.  I did have to withhold one star, however, for the severely gapped plot.  Many demands are made of the audience to either assume or remember the old comic book back stories to fill in many holes.  this is otherwise also very noticeable in the romantic subplot.  this could have been much better developed without sacrificing or distracting from the rest of the story.  also, some action sequences seem to be incomplete and require the viewer to just figure out how a transition was made or a leap completed.  I think that an extended director's cut is definitely warranted; at least another 30 minutes is needed to smooth out this somewhat jagged storyline.  other than that, I can definitely recommend this one for the fun-action-comicbook section of your collection.  The endearing, enduring qualities of a true human hero are not conquered by the superhuman flash-bang of a unique and alluring action flick.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is Dream Theater's second album, but to me it's like their first.  Part of that's because it's the first album I got by them.  Also the core of Labrie vocals, Petruci guitars, and Portny drums, can't for the life of my remember the bass player's name but he's here too, are together for the first time.  the sound of this album is epic.Everything can be heard clearly.  The songs are mostly really good to great, with one exception.  The musicianship is really solid.  My only complaint is 2 instrumental breaks that not only drag their respective songs on longer than they needed to, but don't fit the songs at all, nearly caused me to drop the rating to 4 stars, but this is such a classic that I can overlook that.  Pull Me Under 10/10 is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs, and songs in general.  From the opening notes, clean guitars to the abrupt end it's just a fantastic track.  This was also their only brief time in the spotlight as it's their only song to hit major radio airwaves.  Love the clean guitar opening, the drum beats that kick in, and the keys also in the intro.  The song picks up with a fantastic beat, and everyone plays their part fantastically.  The verses are semi heavy, for this album anyways, James's vocals are great.  I get chills as he screams during what I'd guess is the second verse.  Seriously there's so much progressive goodness in the first 3 1/2 minutes and we haven't even hit the first chorus yet.  The chorus is fantastic also.  Overall this song is crafted perfectly.  This is a perfect example of Dream Theater at their best.  This is also the first song I ever heard by the band.  Another Day 8/10 isn't a typical song I'd normally like, but this one's pretty nice.  We get a ballad that features a sax, not a common instrument in the music I like, but it works.  Also a lot of piano with some clean guitars here and there.  James handles himself very well as always.  Take The Time 8/10 builds slowly with some keys and then guitars drums and bass as they build towards a killer riff.  Fantastic guitar work.  This song also has a very solid chorus.  This isn't a really heavy song, but it's up tempo which is nice.  The guitars are kind of funky in the verses.    Surrounded 8/10 is another mellower track, not as mellow as Another Day.  It starts with piano and keyboards.  The song picks up after a bit.  There's a percussion part that makes me think of Rush.  The song becomes fairly up tempo for a while and ends on a piano and vocals section similar to the intro.  Overall it's a very good song, with nice changes.  Metropolis 8/10 Starts with some keyboards.  the guitars and eventually drums kick in in a way as they build towards the main part of the song.  I love the opening guitar work.  The whole intro is realy good and probably my favorite part of the song.  There's a nice riff during the verses.  Probably the heaviest riff on the album.  there isn't really a chorus, but that doesn't stop this beast of a song.  This is the first of 2 songs however which contain an instrumental section which sounds like a jam session rather than an actual part of the song.  I don't really like much of it, especially towards the end of it.  Some of it's ok, but it just doesn't fit the song.  Under A Glass Moon 7/10 is an overall fairly solid track.  Starts with a guitar, eh not really riff, that leads into a nice drum beat and a cool guitar riff.  The verses have a nice guitar riff as well.  the chorus is ok, but not great.  there's a cool guitar solo as well.  Wait For Sleep 4/10 not really a fan of this one.It's just piano and vocals.  that doesn't necessarily make it a bad song, certainly not my style, but there's an acoustic version out there too and I really don't care for that either.  Overall I just don't think this is a very good song.  The piano reminds me of, I think it's Friday the 13th, those stupid slasher movies from the 80's, which is pretty cool, but that's about it.  Learning To Live 6/10 isn't a bad song, but it's drawn out way too long and this is the other song where it seems like they didn't know what they wanted to do during the instrumental break.  They have a Spanish guitar part there that while cool doesn't really fit.  This could've been a 6 or 7 minute song and I'd have liked it much better.    Overall this is a must own prog metal classic, for fans of the genre.  I'd definitely recommend this album as a good starting point for getting into Dream Theater.

B00000FCBC|3.0|Most know the Metallica story, and where they were at this point 98, in their career. They were one of the pioneers of thrash, releasing 3 thrash classics, Lightning, Justice, and Puppets, and Kill em all wasn't a terrible effort either. They released 3 pop metal albums in a row, one which put them on the map of being more than a band. They became a corporation after that. After a hiatus they released 2 more even more simplistic albums which alienated a lot of fans. So what would they do next?  they not only released a covers album, they also added a second disc with old covers that were never put on actual albums. Well for that discc I'll say it's about time, or I did at the time. Fans of old HAVE to own this album just for tracks 1-10 on disc 2 alone. But, disc 1 is a new, at the time, bunch of covers with the load sound fairly in tact.  Disc 1 5/10  For those who like the Load Reload albums this will suit you just fine. It can be a fairly eclectic mix of styles here, some you'd expect, and some you wouldn't. The Load sound is in tact, although it's a bit heavier, so that's a nice tweak. There are some stand out tracks here, but there are also 2 medly's and a country song, so this disc gets knocked down a lot for that. Also a couple of repetitive songs i don't really care for.  Free speach 3/10 fast paced heavy opener, probably a punk song originally. i know nothing about most of the original versions of these songs. This one pretty much, from memory does the same thing over and over. I never liked it and have only heard it once in the last 11 or 12 years, so I won't go further into detail. Overall forgettable, but tolerable if I must.  It's Electric 7/10 is a nice straight forward fast paced rocker. Some of the lyrics are a bit cheesy, but the guitar work and vocal melodies are nice, and overall I find this to be an enjoyable song.  Sabbra Cadabbra 5/10 forgive any misspelling. This is the first of 2 medleys. They play parts of 2 Black Sabbath songs from SabbathBloody Sabbath, can't remember the other one's name. I personally hate medleys. Give me the whole damn song and stop messing around. yeah! I'm talking to you Dream theater! They play the parts of the 2 songs well enough, but I already like the originals of both, so this one's pointless for me, especially since it has that more pop metal sound of the late 90's Metallica. Overall I find this to be a skippable track.  Turn The Page 9/10 I don't care what the haters say I love this song. They really add a punch that the original didn't have. It starts out slow and then fills in with heavier yet melodic guitars during most of the song. The solo's disappointing, but overall I really like this one. Love the vocal and guitar melodies too. Great song, and the highlight of this disc, 1 that is.  Die Die My Darling 6/10 is a listenable song. It's fast paced and heavier, for this era of Metallica. I still haven't, but I'd love to hear the Misfits version of this. Danzig is awesome, so I'd bet he sings this really well.  Loverman 5/10 is a slower song, that drags on way too long. Overall it's ok, but I don't really care much for it, and as time went on I cared for it less and less.  Mercyful Fate 1/10 The only good thing I can say about this song is it introduced me to one of my favorite Mercyful Fate songs , Curse Of The Pheroes. Otherwise it's a medley and I already said what I think of those pieces of crap This one is no exception.  Astronomy 7/10 is a fairly nice melodic, heavy mix song. There really isn't a chorus on this one, but that doesn't hold it down. Love the guitar work, and the mood this song sets. Metallica does a good job with this one, only heard the original once and I enjo this one more. Course I'm more familliar with this one.  Whiskey In The Jar 8/10 is my second favorite song on this disc. Love the lead interludes. the rhythm guitars work well, nice riff. the chorus is a little strange, but overall I love this song. It also has a decent solo.  Tuesday's Gone 1/10 is a country song, and I HATE country. But what's worse than country is Metallica doing country. they did a song like this on Load, and I think one on Reload, but I can't remember for sure. James doesn't have a country voice at all.  I can't remember the last song title, something about seeing I think. The clip sounded like it's a heavier song, but like Free Speach and the country song, I haven't heard this one since I got the disc when it came out. I never cared for it much, so I won't bother any further with it.  Disc 2 Garage Days or tracks 1=10 4 stars out of 5 The remainder 5/10  Generally this is where you get your money's worth. Sure there are a few good songs on disc 1, but this is the disc I pick to listen to the most. My only complaint is the random bs you hear in between the songs, one member burps at the end of one song. Completely stupid. The first 10 songs are very good, but the last several from the Load sessions mostly Motorhead covers, don't really do much for me. And, I never listen to them.  Helpless 8/10 is a fun fast paced thrasher. Love hearing better production on the old stuff. I wish I had a remastered versions of the 80's albums. overall the melodies are nice, despite the simple chorus. Love the slow down part in the end.  The Small Hours 8/10 is a slower heavy song. Love the clean electric guitars in the intro, and the build up to the song. The main riff is solid. The vocals and rhythm section are also solid. Love the chorus, and the faster part that comes up later on.  The Wait 7/10 is a nice groovy up tempo song. Love everything about the verses. Hetfield distorts his voice during the verses, but it sounds pretty good. The chorus is a bit of a let down, but it's not too bad, and definitely doesn't ruin the enjoyment of the song.  Crash Course In Brain Surgery 7/10 is another up tempo song, with a nice main riff. I like the flow of this song. there really isn't a chorus.  Last Caress/Green Hell 7/10 love Last Caress, Green Hell I'mindifferent to, but overall they flow well enough toggether I guess. Last Caress is an up tempo song with nice melodies and violent lyrics, followed by an ultra fast Green Hell, which is pretty repetitive. Part of it makes a nice change of pace in the song, but it goes on longer than it probably should, but then again these are covers of 2 songs. No I'm not going to bitch about this being another medley because this is the first version of this song I ever heard.  Am I Evil 10/10 is an epic song. Love the slow building intro that leads into a fun little guitar hammer on pulll off section to lead into the main riff. Great main riff too. The fist verse starts off slow, but heavy, and it picks up as it goes on. Nice build up to the chorus. Classic Metallica chorus. I was surprised to learn these songs from Garage Days were covers.  Blitzkrieg 8/10 is a faster paced song, with a nice riff. There's not really much of a chorus, but it doesn't really need one, enjoyable song.  Breadfan 9/10 love the opening riff. This is a fast paced thrasher. Again, not a chorus, but it doesn't need one. Great guitar work, decent vocals. I LOVE the quiet instrumental section. It's just awesome.  The Prince 6/10 my least favorite of these 10 songs. it's a fast paced song, and it's decent, but nothing really special. Heck I kind of wish one of the Motorhead covers had been done during this session instead, at least it'd have a better sound than the Load sound, and Overkill, Too Late Too Late amongst others are generally better songs. Still it's not bad.  Stone Cold Crazy 8/10 is another faster paced song that's a million times better than the original. Nice frantic pace, no pun intended. Overall this is a solid track.  As I said everything from here on out has that Load sound. They're Motorhead covers mostly, and the ones that aren't sound like it too. They're fairly simple rockers mostly fast to up tempo songs. they aren't terrible, although I could do without So What and hearing James singing about oral sex with an old man, but hey. Maybe some people are into that. I don't know, nor do I care. I haven't heard most of these songs in years, and have no desire to either. Overall they're listenable, but nothing special.  So overall if you're a fan of thrash Metallica you have to get this for the Garage Days songs, also you may find other songs you'll like. If you like everything Metallica does, then you have this already and probably like everything. If you like both the thrash and the load stuff then you'll enjoy most, if not all of this. Overall a must own for Metallica fans of all types.
B000002J0N|5.0|CSN is a great CD by Crosby, Stills & Nash. It doesn't have the \\"Wow!\\" factor of the 1969 debut or 1970's DEJA VU, but is just as rewarding an album as those two. High points include Stephen Stills' \\"Dark Star\\" and the David Crosby/Craig Doerge collaboration \\"Shadow Captain, as well as \\"I Give You Blind\\" and a couple of others. This CD is the sound of three adults giving it all they have to make a record that someone my age (I'm 39) could really enjoy. Graham Nash's songs here are gentle but not mawkish, and Stephen Stills contributes the most, with five writing credits. This CD is essential for anyone interested in 70s rock and pop.
B000002JKA|5.0|Following up a virtual masterpiece like Images And Words can be tough for any band, but the members of Dream theater were successful on this one.  Awake showcases Dream Theater's most complete and coheesive album to date, rivaled only by its predecessor and the fantastic Scenes From A Memory.  I still like this one better.  The band sounds great.  The production is also outstanding.  Something else that is rare, the songs on here transition between each other REALLY well.  I really like the flow of this album.  6:00 9/10 has a cool little drum beat with a guitar lick to start out.  The drumming is really cool in this song.  The vocal samples are strange.  There's nice guitar work during the verses.  James's vocals sound more aggressive than they did on Images, their last album.  The instrumental break and bridge are also crafted beautifully.  Overall this is a solid upper mid tempo opener.  Caught In A Web 9/10 is a really good rocker, and follows the previous track nicely.  James is still singing more raspy.  He'd do that on this one and the next album.  Still the melodies are solid.  The music is also great.  easily in my top favorite songs on the album and along with the first track on my list of Dream Theater must have songs.  There're a lot of songs on that list by the way.  Innocence Faded 9/10 is next, and as you can tell from the rating, I really like this one too.  this one's an upper mid tempo softer song, with heavier parts, chorus and whatnot.  James's vocals are great, and the clean guitars are really nice.  Love the chorus.  To me this song is one of James's strongest on the album.  Voices 10/10 comes in after an instrumental, and this one's full of progressive goodness.  Great work by every member of the band on this one.  There's an extended instrumental section to open the song.  The first verse starts with piano and some keyboards, and some guitar licks thrown in there.  The chorus sort of forces its way in there, in a good way.  I love how hard hitting it is.  There are heavier guitars James singing nearly at the top of his longs.  There are so many layers to this song.  the second verse is heavier, much heavier.  It's completely different than the first, which I love both.  The rest of the song mostly meanders off into some random stuff, but it's all good.  Lots of melodies.  There's a great solo by Petruci.  Overall this is a great progressive song.  Oh and the song ends on an acoustic note that transitions VERY well into the next track.  The Silent Man 8/10 is a very nice little acoustic tune.  Everything's put together perfectly.  I'm very neh on the backing vocals, but everything else is solid.  The Mirror 8/10 finally a heavy track.  We haven't had one in a while.  Very nice opening riff, and intro.  There's some cool double bass drumming.  The verses are very solid, almost sound sinister, for Dream theater anyways.  The verses have a kind of groove to them.  The chorus is only ok, but it serves its purpose.  There's a piano part heading into the instrumental section that reminds me of the last track on the album.  Man I miss Kevin More on Keys.  He's so much more talented and writes so much better music than Rhudes.  This song also runs into the next song, kind of like a medley, but it works.  Lie 8/10 is another rocker.  this one is also another where the chorus while decent is the only thing holding it back from greatness.  Still it's a very good song.  The seething is still in this one.  I'm guessing this and Mirror go together, since they run into each other and the themes seem to be about betrayal.  the verses are upper mid tempo, again grooves.  Love the vocals in the bridge.  There's also a really good solo in here too.  Would you expect anything else from this band?  Lifting Shadows Off A Dream 7/10 is a beautiful melodic tune.  It starts with some mellow drums and keys and a melodic guitar notes.  James sings very softly for most of it.  The second verse he sings louder and there's some background distorted guitars, layered in there.  I love how on some of these songs they manage to change each verse so the song doesn't become repetitive.  I noticed this on a later album of their's, but I can't remember which one, nor which song.  Scarred 7/10 Starts off kind of funky, not really, but moreso than anything else on here.  There's some cool guitar effects when it kicks in.  The drums and bass are excellent in the intro.  Hey I finally notice the bass player.  While this is a good song, it's not really a favorite, and probably my least favorite on the album, aside for the instrumental, which while decent I'm just not a fan of instrumentals.  The first, eh verse I guess is melodic with softer vocals and guitars.  It's more of a part of the intro.  When the actual song kicks in, the first verse is heavier.  Hey this one's coming back to me.  I honestly didn't remember this one as well.  James sounds pissed again.  there's sort of a pre-chorus which is pretty good as well.  The chorus is ok, but while good, this song just doesn't compare with the rest of the album.  Still a very good song and definitely worth your time.  To be a weak song on this album is to generally be a stronger song than most other albums' strong songs.  Space Dey Vest 10/10 is a really beautiful way to end the album, and kind of continues the betrayal theme from Mirror and Lie.  It starts with some jaw dropping piano notes.  As the song picks up there's some acoustic guitars lightly thrown in there, but James and Kevin are the stars of this song.  Granted everyone plays their parts to perfection, it's just that those are the 2 featured performers on here.  There are some random vocal samples thrown in there, which work really well.  Overall it's a great way to finish the album.  Normally I'm a fan of songs with catchy choruses, and the chorus really defines the song for me, normally.  This one doesn't have that, and I still love it.  This is one of my top favorite songs ever, not to mention favorite Dream Theater songs, it's one of those too.  Overall this, Scenes From A Memory and Images And Words are my 3 favorite Dream Theater albums, and 3 prog metal essentials.  I also really like Six Degrees and the live remake of When Dream And Day Unite, with James on vocals.  This is one of the best albums I've ever heard, and a definite must buy if you ask my opinion.  And, you did..  Kidding, but it is an outstanding achievement.

We as human \\"BEING\\"s need to put the past in the past, know that all that has happened to us has happened for a reason, to make us better BEINGS on this planet we call EARTH. We all need to put out into the world a positive \\"spirt\\" so that those around us can also be positive, giving that attitude to others. This is what Echart Tolle has given to me!!!

B0036S4C6G|5.0|This Pulitzer Prize winning book is more of a collection of short stories than a novel with each chapter focusing on a particular time in a character's life. Written in a non linear format the book spans from the 1970s punk rock scene to the distant future of 2020.  The American music scene is the focus for the diverse cast of characters that includes Sasha, a troubled young kleptomaniac and Bennie, an aging music producer. Throughout the book, the characters' lives intersect each other and in the end everyone is connected to one another to some degree. Egan's unique writing style allows the reader to see the characters at different points  in their lives and understand how time has changed them.<br /><br />This is an intriguing and engaging novel that explores memory and the passing of time in our lives.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|It's Freaky Friday for the modern age. Minus the lame attempt to send a wholesome message. It is instead replaced by what I recognize as a *successful* attempt at a relevant and up-to-date commentary on marriage, sex, and life as a modern-day man.
0316056863|5.0|Comedian Tina Fey entertains in her well-written memoir covering her personal life plus her stints at Chicago's Second City, Saturday Night Live, and 30 Rock. I suggest listening to the audiobook narrated by Fey. Even if you haven't followed her career, it's easy to relate to this down to earth comedian and actress. I burst out laughing during her recollections of her childhood and her honeymoon as well as her responses to mean-spirited comments.  There are many laugh-out-loud moments throughout the book, and she delivers them perfectly.  She's gutsy, intelligent, and irreverently funny, with a no-holds-barred attitude about most things. Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a good laugh.
B000003TA4|5.0|Grunge is my favorite genre of rock, and so of course I love Nirvana. They turned it into the next big thing of the '90s when they came out with Nevermind. It's a great album, and you can definitely hear why it became a sensation. The grunge scene was revolutionary to basically everyone who did not live in Washington state, with a sound that went against everything that the rock bands (aka hair bands, metal, and glam rock) of the '80s stood for and were like. I don't think there is any one other album that totally revolutionized rock like Nevermind. The lyrics are more negative and less radio-friendly than the average rock song, and distorted sounds matched the dark, drab topics perfectly. I mean, anyone who can come up with a song about a girl being kidnapped and tortured with a blowtorch (Polly) and put it on an album has guts, especially compared to the love-filled songs that made up the '80s.<br /><br />The best songs on Nevermind are probably ones that you have already heard. Of the twelve songs on the album, seven or eight get airplay on the radio station that I listen to (although I think one or two may be different versions, such as a live recording or whatever). Said radio station had a list of the 90 top songs from the '90s, and three or four of the top 10 were on Nevermind. These songs are all good in their own right. You don't always understand what they mean or even sometimes what the lyrics even are, but that is perfectly fine. Many of the titles are also pretty unusual and you just have to wonder what they are about, such as Lithium or the incredibly popular, Smells Like Teen Spirit.<br /><br />Favorite songs: It's way too hard to choose, but probably any of the first five songs on here: Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come as You Are, Breed, and Lithium, probably just because I know them from hearing them on the radio and because they are at the beginning of the album, so if I can't hear it all at one time, I hear those songs. Most of the others don't really bother me, either.<br /><br />Least favorite songs: I don't like how Territorial Pissings starts off. It's just so different from the rest of the album that you don't like how it doesn't fully fit, and because it's making fun of other types of rock, it's incredibly obvious. Polly is also a little quieter and less crazy musically (rather than lyrically). I can't always appreciate the sound because of that.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Nevermind before, listen to it. Marvel at it and how it totally changed the music scene. Enjoy it, care for it, love it. You won't be sorry.e, either.  Least favorite songs: I don't like how Territorial Pissings starts off.

B00406UK7S|5.0|This is an absolutely excellent historical fiction film, granted with extreme license.  OK, I am a Roman history pedant and aficionado of historical novels, so I brought to this a critical eye, but also a hope that I would get enveloped in the narrative, in subtle character, in wonder at the endless varieties of human ambition.  At this, it was so successful that I forgot the present with complete delight, even after 2 full viewings.<br /><br />In terms of history, this is fiction based on speculation about what happened to the 9th Legion, which disappeared from the historical record without a trace - the only way to limn what happened to them is to piece together ambiguous clues, such as the inscriptions on grave stones scattered throughout the former empire.  The time is that of the Emperor Hadrian, the golden age of the Roman Empire - the series of good, circumspect emperors who governed judiciously and without the insane excess that is remembered with Nero or Commodus.  Rome is one of the largest stable empires the world has ever known, though it has experienced resistance in certain areas, such as the Picts in Northern Britain or the Parthians in Central Asia.  Whatever happened, the film that concocts an explanation, and it is as plausible as an other, with plenty of fictional speculation and fantasy thrown in to build a narrative.<br /><br />To be honest, the film either works for you or it doesn't.  All I can say is, if you liked HBO's Rome, this is the same kind of grainy, highly textured portrait, just not in the center (Rome) but on the periphery.  I believe this preference is personal and subjective, a pure matter of taste.  It is extremely bloody, with realistic battle sequences that are not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The plot follows a non-commissioned officer (Centurion), acted by the wonderful Michael Fassbender.  Long a fighter of Picts (he knows their language), he survives an attack on an outpost and is rescued by the 9th, who are about to make war on the Picts.  They are led by the incredible Dominic West (of The Wire), a charismatic general who has led his men to glory in Spain and is now establishing them in Britain; he is a gifted brute, but extremely popular with the men, from whom he rose by talent.  Their scout is Olga Kurilenko (yes, a Bond girl), a mute and mysterious young Pict.<br /><br />After the quick decimation of the 9th, Fassbender and a handful of survivors seek to rescue the general by duty, deep in Pict Scotland.  Upon failure and an unfortunate murder, they must flee for their lives while an elite corps of Pict warriors pursue them with a blood oath of vengeance.  At their head is a killer of singular talent, whose family was brutalized and executed before her eyes, then she was raped and left for dead.  As described, \\"she is an empty vessel that can only be filled with Roman blood.\\"  When you see her, you believe it.  I will not reveal what happens, only to say that it is acted to utter perfection.<br /><br />There has been much criticism of the Romans as \\"good guys\\" in this film.  I think it is far more subtle than that:  no one is good, no one bad, they are all just striving to live the way they want, in accordance with their traditions.  The Picts are genuinely savage warriors, but the reasons for their ruthless ferocity are completely clear:  the Romans brutilized them in unspeakable ways as demonstrated more than once.  For their part, the Romans are simple soldiers, part of a military machine the likes of which the world had never known.  They are not good guys, they just are what they are:  disciplined killers who will follow their leaders to the death for duty and hopefully glory.  They are tougher beyond imagination, with their own codes of honor, though clearly one of the survivors is a sociopath.  Another much criticized plot incident is the girl and love story.  I suppose you could say it is unrealistic, but what the heck, it is a movie.  To me, it was believable and moving (in however a superficial way you might want).  Roman political machinations are also surprising, believable, and subtle.<br /><br />This is not the kind of thing a pedant like me should pick apart.  It is just a darn good story that completely absorbed me for 2 viewings.  I will certainly watch it again.  Warmly recommended.Roman political machinations are also surprising, believable, and subtle.  This is not the kind of thing a pedant like me should pick apart.

B004LWZW24|3.0|\\"Insidious\\" is 70 minutes of good old-fashioned horror movie creepiness. The story is familiar to any fan of classic horror movies. A happy family moves into a new house, and weird stuff starts to happen--books appear where they don't belong, odd noises emanate from the attic, apparitions appear and disappear. And then one of the sons lapses into a mysterious coma. The wife/mother (played by an appropriately distraught Rose Byrnes) implores her husband (Patrick Wilson) to move--she insists that the house is haunted. He acquiesces and they move to a new home, only to find that the haunting continues. For a brief time after the move to the new home, \\"Insidious\\" looks as if it's destined to become a contemporary horror classic, reminiscent of \\"Poltergeist.\\" But then there's a fateful scene involving a gas mask, and the movie rapidly goes downhill. The remaining 30 minutes or so of the film focuses on astral projection and other dimensions, and \\"Insidious\\" seriously loses its way. The ending telegraphs an almost inevitable sequel, which I'm sure will be a disappointment. Too bad--I had high hopes for this one.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|This 2 CD Box set deserves five stars, if only because it is out! There are plenty of other reviews here already - I got my copy late - and so there is no reason to repeat what others are saying, though I hope you will find my review comments helpful.<br /><br />Unlike many others, I have not heard the bootlegs of these recordings. I got the CD - as well as the DVD - of Wilson's solo version of  \\"Smile\\" when he released it in 2004 and loved it. I was really looking forward to this set.<br /><br />Immediately upon receiving it, I put on Disc 1 which contains the reconstructed album. There were familiar songs - the hits - like \\"Good Vibrations\\", \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Surf's Up\\". But there were also interludes I hadn't heard before (at least by the original Beach Boys. And they were sequenced the way Brian wanted them , and with great sound. I was a VERY happy camper. Then, on the same disc, was some bonus material, filling out the extended time allowed by a CD. It was only then that I looked at the other contents of the package. There's a cute little \\"smile\\" button (I'll try not to lose it) and a fold-out mini poster. (Does anyone really mount these things?). There's also the 36-page booklet with photos, A nice 3 page essay by Brian, a very confusing 2-page essay by Artie Shaw biographer Tom Nolan, mostly about Van Dyke Parks, and the lyrics to the songs. I guess I always listened to the combination of words and music, when listening to the Smile material and - with the exception of \\"good Vibrations\\" (a love song), and \\"Vegetables\\" (to me a Health food song), I never paid attention to the lyrics. Now reading them, I realize I have very little understanding of the meaning of many of them. But Wilson's music makes them whole for me, just like vocalese does on a Manhattan Transfer album. (I have to say that I was surprised that the booklet credits Parks for all the lyrics when he \\"borrows the chorus from \\" \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" without credit to former Louisiana Governor Jimmie Davis, who wrote that song in 1941!).<br /><br />The last item in the box is the second CD, which consists solely of recording session excerpts. There are many (I think seven takes on intro to \\"Heroes and Villains\\", or something like seven takes). This is great stuff, and important material to understand how Wilson worked with the musicians and other members of the Beach Boys. But this is not a disc you'll return to often after you listen once - unless you are obsessed with the album. I'm glad that EMI/Capitol allowed us to hear these pieces without having to buy the full five discs, two Lp mega box.<br /><br />So there you have my take on the set. I'll be playing Disc One a lot and the set will have a prime place in my collection. Finally we can all SMILE that the album is out, and has Wilson's stamp of approval.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"is, who wrote that song in 1941!).

B0013FSL3E|4.0|How can a movie with so few spoken words (Waaaaall-eeeee!) be so darn cute and touching?  I now want a Wall-E for a pet.  An added bonus: he won't shed.<br /><br />Since it's Disney and Pixar, Wall-E is obviously a great movie for the kids.  But I yet to meet an adult who's seen it who didn't like it!  It's full of those adorable little moments that just make you go \\"Awwwwww\\" and make you laugh like you did when you were eight years old.<br /><br />At the same time, the writers threw in a little message (okay, a HUGE message).  We need to watch how wasteful we are, and we need to be careful with our reliance on gadgets.  None of us want to be like the humans in this movie!  It's a very creative way to introduce these ideas to kids.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the movie is a little too long to hold a child's attention.  Speeding it up a bit would make it just a bit better for the kiddos.

B005ELQVGW|1.0|Call me old fashioned, but I like like music with a melody. If you want to meditate, a collection of pleasant sounds or tones will even suffice.  But this album is just a mess of odd and incohearant noises. Sometimes I wonder if Bjork made an album where she just hit keys at random, if people would give her 5 star reviews for being brilliant?  Cosmology is the only song on here that can even be called a \\"song\\".  I'm not sure what Bjork has against music at this stage in her life, but she seems to be hell bent on giving us noise.  This style of hers all started with Medulla, and since then she's only put out a few songs that have any sort of melody what so ever.
6305841861|4.0|Evil Dead 2(released March/87)stars Bruce Campbell,back as Ash in this not so much a sequel film,as a remake(on a much better budget) of the first Evil Dead.<br />This film finds our hero Ash back driving down a country road with his ballerina girlfriend Linda.They come upon the self same deserted cottage as in the first film and decide to stay overnight.In the cabin Ash again discovers a tape recorder(same brand too as in the first)and the Necronomicon.This is how we know this is not a sequel because 1)What would he be doing voluntarily back at the cabin again after what happened the first time around and 2)Ash would KNOW what the tape recorder contains and not play it.But Ash does indeed play it,unleashing the terrible force from the Book of the Dead.His girlfriend is possessed and Ash ends up taking her head off in an adjoining shack with a chainsaw.He buries her out front but becomes possessed by the evil himself,which throws him through the woods.This lasts only until daybreak when he jumps in the car and tears away from the cabin.However,like the first film,the bridge is out and he is going nowhere fast.<br />Thrown into this scenario is the professor(on the tape's)daughter and research partner.They are heading to the cabin but find the bridge out on the other side.A tow truck driver and his girlfriend show up and they accompany them to the cabin.Meanwhile,back at the ranch,Ash has his hands full as the evil has taken over much of the inanimate objects in the cabin and there is a couple of minute sequence where Ash laughs madly along with all the objects.Also,because the head of his girlfriend bit him on the hand,the evil took over that hand and he became forced to sever it,again with the handy-dandy chainsaw.When the outside group finally shows up Ash blasts a hole through the door,thinking it's the spirits.The group ends up subduing him and throwing him in the cellar,thinking he killed the professor and his wife.<br />While in the cellar Ash overhears the group talking about the professors wife and how she became possessed and was also thrown into the cellar.Of course in no time the wife indeed shows up,trying to turn Ash into a deadite.Ash makes it out just in time and finally explains the situation.However one by one the group is taken by the evil.First it's the research assistant,then it's the tow truck drivers girlfriend and next is the tow truck driver himself.To dispel the evil the professors daughter reads from the Necronimcon and a giant swirling portal opens up.Ash's car and then Ash himself get sucked into it.Next thing he knows he is plunked down into Medieval times,along with his car.He happens to arrive as a large group of soldiers are trying to kill a flying deadite.Ash takes out(what was to come to be known as)his boomstick,which sends the deadite back to where it came from.The soldiers believe he is the chosen one come back to save them and the film fades out as he screams in despair.<br />Of course the ending will lead into the third and final installment Army of Darkness.Bruce Campbell is in fine form as Ash and he virtually carries the whole movie.The co stars are mere window dressing,but watch for a cameo by director Sam's little brother Ted as the professors dead wife.This was definitely Evil Dead on a better budget as the film stock is better(35mm this time and widescreen),the S/Fx are better and Jo LoDuca is on hand to score the music;well known for his superb works in Hercules and Xena.<br />Technically speaking both the full frame and original widescreen version are presented here.Both picture and sound(in THX)have been remastered and the picture never looked better.Extras include audio commentary,still galleries,bios,the trailer and a featurette on the films making.The DVD is a one sided disc.<br />All in all a recommended film.It's Evil Dead on a better budget and will please all fans of the series.It's not a GREAT film per se',but it is satisfying none the less.It has a few scare the pants off you moments,along with some funny turns by the Campbell-meister.h some funny turns by the Campbell-meister.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this when I read the first chapter.  I thought I would have a hard time reading from a child's point of view.  However, once I got into the 2nd chapter I was hooked in, feeling like I was right there.    I haven't read any of Donaghue's books before, but this one I finished in 2 days.  Her descriptions from the view of a five year old were amazing, and her writing makes you almost feel like you are that five year old boy, and she takes you on an emotional roller coaster through the last third of the book, where you feel such enormous loss, but at the same time, you feel hope.    I could have done without the mother's drama with what she did towards the end, and I thought she did not give enough focus on the grandfather (the biological) and it felt like there was no point in even bringing him into the story.    When all was said and done, it was a fantastic read, and I definitely recommend this for a great rainy weekend!
B0024FADDI|4.0|Army of Darkness(released in Oct/92)finds our hero Ash back,played by Bruce don't-call-me-Ash Campbell.It's his film all the way through,as he chews the scenery up,right,left and centre stage.The co stars are really just incidental to the proceedings.<br />This film finds us about where the last left off.A passage read in the Necronomicon in the last film mentioned a man from the sky that would arrive in 1300 A.D. to help the people fend off the deadites.Well,Ash is THE man of legend,much to his chagrin.He takes care of the initial deadite onslaught and goes into the castle grounds.There he is forced to take care of a deadite down a large well.After this he finds that in order for the wizard to send him back to his own time,he must obtain the Necronomicon from a local cemetery.The wizard gives him the words to speak to get the book safely away:Klaatu,Barada,Nickto(words every film fan worth their salt knows as the self same ones Patricia Neal had to speak to Klaatu in the 1951 film,The Day the Earth Stood Still....and Ash obviously hadn't seen it!).<br />He arrives at the cemetery,after a brief encounter with deadites in a windmill,only to find not one but three Books of the Dead.He opens the first and gets sucked into it.After he gets out the second bites him and continually flies at him until he is able to subdue it.Of course the last one would be the real one.He starts to chant the sacred words:Klaatu,Barada...Necktie... Neckturn... Nickel... It's an \\"N\\" word, it's definitely an \\"N\\" word!...\\".In final desperation he says the first two and substitutes a drawn out cough for the last one.He looks around,nothing seemingly happens,but as he starts to return to his horse skeletal hands begin to rise up through the ground and trip him and try to grab the book.He gets away and returns to the castle.<br />He tells everyone that everything is alright,he has the book and now it's time he got returned to his own time.By now the people have thought he would stick around to fight the deadites and they are very disappointed.In the meantime the deadites have risen up from their graves and are marching on the castle.When a girl who had become infatuated with Ash is possessed by the deadites,he vows to stay and fight.It is a pitched battle but in the end good wins the day over evil and Ash is finally returned to his own time.<br />In the finale we find Ash back at work as he is explaining his exploits to some disbelieving fellow employees.Suddenly a deadite appears and Ash is forced to take action,as he grabs his weapon of choice,a boomstick(a shotgun to you Evil Dead noobs),and blasts the thing back to where it came.The film ends as Ash has a lovely lass bent over,ready for a kiss,as he utters the immortal words\\"Hail to the King,baby\\".<br />So ends the Evil Dead trilogy that really made a star out of Bruce Campbell;and rightfully so.Campbell has got to be the hardest B picture character actor in the business,along with being a very prudent and smart business man.He has written books,along with his movie work and has also directed.A man of many talents our Bruce is,and it shows that you don't have to be a Hollywood suck up to make it in films.We need more Campbells out there.<br />Technically speaking the print here is beautiful and is shown in its original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include a featurette on the S/Fx and the alternate ending to the film.<br />All in all a recommended picture.This is the last of the Evil Dead series and shows Bruce Campbell off in his element as Ash.It is not GREAT film per se',but just a fun,fun romp in the horror genre that will have you laughing as much as jumping scared.ites and they are very disappointed.In the meantime the deadites have risen up from their graves and are marching on the castle.When a girl who had become infatuated with Ash is possessed by the deadites,he vows to stay and fight.It is a pitched battle but in the end good wins the day over evil and Ash is finally returned to his own time.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I previously wrote a negative review years ago... But now? WOW! Prime Music has changed everything for me, and I'm happy to endorse this app and the service! I've deleted the old review and have totally changed my mind.<br /><br />My only complaint now is that this app is NOT compatible (or available) on Amazon Fire TV, and this just doesn't make sense! I can load Pandora and a dozen other music services on the Fire TV, but Amazon's own Prime Music service isn't available on their own hardware? WHY?!?  Amazon, PLEASE get with it and put this app on the Amazon Fire TV! I would definitely get a lot of use out of it!!!SD card, I will re-install and enjoy it. Until then, I need that 11 MB of space, and even though the logic is that I'm using 11 MB to access 30 GB, I can't justify deleting other, more essential apps just to use this one. It's actually easier just to get a bigger SD card and fill it with music.<br /><br />I would also say that the same complaint can be made for the Amazon Android Market app. It, too, won't allow a move to SD card, and takes up about 7 MB on my phone. It remains in place, for now, but only because it's necessary.<br /><br />GET IT TOGETHER AMAZON!  Any decent developer knows that limiting apps to phone storage only is a ridiculous, unnecessary limitation. There's absolutely no reason the Amazon MP3 app couldn't work from my SD card! Stop forcing me to keep it on the phone, and let me move it, already!<br /><br />I want this app. I want to give it five stars. I cannot do that in it's present form, and that's due to one very bad choice by the developers.<br /><br />UPDATE: So Here I Am. Crawling back because of a WORSE experience with the Google Music app, which takes up even MORE space than the Amazon MP3 app. I will put up with this app stealing space on my phone for now... But I want to see some changes in the Android Market, darn it! STOP MAKING APPS THAT CAN'T BE MOVED TO SD CARD, AMAZON! It's not user-friendly. It's not helping your app spread around. It's not good for your bottom line.<br /><br />As soon as a cloud music app comes alone that lets me move it to my SD card, IT WINS MY TIME AND MONEY. It's unforgivable that developers want to fight over my phone's limited internal space when I have essentially unlimited space available on the SD card.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/2012 - This will not be updated anymore, and I may have outdated information above because I opted to stop using Amazon Cloud Drive for music. This app wasn't convenient, and I just have a much easier time with a 32GB SD card in my phone. On top of that, Google's Music storage is free (for the moment) and I can't deny that free is a pretty attractive price point. I wish Amazon luck with this product line, but for me it wasn't worth the renewal.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Super little unit and it has shuffle/random mode that all the other FM transmitters do not have. I have had quite a few others but this is the best I have had. I will probably buy another for the shuffle mode alone. I will never buy another with out this feature.
B00406UK7S|2.0|My wife, daughter and I just watched this movie.  My wife was extremely repulsed by the violence in this movie.  I thought the violence was laughable, because basically every killing had to show a gallon of blood spurting or a cut off head.  Every ax and spear thrown just happened to be a kill and would show blood spurting feet in the air like it hit a gallon resevoir of blood.  The director worked so hard at showing graphic violence it was clear this was more important than the story line, which was weak.  I definitely would not watch this movie again.  I thought the actor who played the centurian did a good job in his role, but most of the rest of the acting was sub-par and the characters were not that well developed besides his.  The story line didn't even make sense at times, where the enemy fighting women could smell the centurian and his group a mile away at one point, but then she could not find them when they were hiding in a hut, or track them to the hut for the two days they spent living in the hut with the enemy women that took them in.  Other parts in the movie also made no sense, like when the wild enemies were able to shoot one of the centurians buddies with a bow when he was jumping off a cliff into the water when the enemy could not have been in a spot to even see this. If you grade movies by the amount of blood and violence they show this gets an A, but if you grade a movie by its plot and believability this gets a D-.  I give it two stars only, because of the centurians acting and the ending, but I would not recommend buying it.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|I can't understand the low ratings by some reviewers unless there is a bias against the desire to protect such treasures for future generations. My mom always wanted to take us on a rafting tour of the river but it was never within her means. I wish she at least would have been able to view this documentary. I'm glad that Wade Davis has found another way to channel his spirit and passions and am looking forward to reading the book he is authoring on the Grand Canyon. The 3D gives you not only a birds eye view of places you could only dream of and the narration by Robert Redford conveys the urgancy of protecting this natural wonder. I guess if you think the world is mankinds to plunder, then this documentary is not for you.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was a real page turner.  Not exactly Tolstoy but a great piece of entertainment.  Although it is a \\"young adult\\" novel, I think it would appeal to people of all ages, and particularly those interested in science fiction.
0374275637|5.0|Daniel Kahneman has produced an excellent book. He continues to build and expand on the famous paper he and Amos Tversky published in 1974 (\\"Judging Under Uncertainty\\", a copy of which is usefully appended to this book) and has since spawned innumerable books on the theme (eg Wray Herbert's \\"On Second Thought\\"), and even related themes like Nassim Taleb's \\"Black Swan\\". \\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\" is not a textbook; it is intended for the layman who wants to have a clear and deep understanding of man's cognitive functions. Most of Kahneman's studies will amaze readers not familiar with this subject. For example, when tested, it is still remarkable that the clinical judgments of trained professionals are less accurate than statistical predictions based on a few scores or ratings. Hence counsellors who interviewed students were less accurate in their predictions on the students' performance than statistical predictions using only a few denominators such as High School grades and aptitude test results. The reason Kahneman, a psychologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics was that his (and Tversky's) thesis was applied by economists to understand why economic and financial predictions so often go wildly wrong when they were (or so it was believed) so carefully and rationally made.  This review also hopes to point readers to a book I read as a student in 1967. It's called \\"Straight and Crooked Thinking\\" by R H Thouless. That book has so many similar points and Thouless was a teaching psychologist from Cambridge University in the UK. Although Thouless' book concerns flaws in the use of language and logic in thinking, it also discusses the effect of hidden bias and prejudice. Straight and Crooked Thinking has just been published in the 5th edition by R H Thouless' grandson, C R Thouless. The first was published in 1930. Kahneman's book will likely be as long lived.
0312427999|1.0|Oh good Lord, what a waste of time! Good thing I borrowed it and didn't waste money on it.<br /><br />Question: How do you \\"debunk\\" the economics of a Nobel Laureate and the most influential economist of the last century? Answer: If you're Naomi Klein, you character assassinate him. Read on...<br />The basic premise of the book is this - Free market is and can only be applied through shock and after a shocking event (war, military takeover etc). Even if that is true, can't the same argument be applied to socialist regimes? And more importantly can I use that as an argument against socialism? Wouldn't anyone with a brain say that I should actually argue against socialism on the basis of what it has achieved and not HOW it was implemented? Example: Former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said - \\"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before\\". And what followed in this economic CRISIS was trillions of dollars in bailouts and stimulus. Wasn't the New Deal also implemented under a crisis? Now maybe I should go write a book - Shock doctrine: The rise of disastrous Keynesianism OR I can argue against Keynesianism on economic grounds, not on who, what or how it was implemented.<br /><br />She uses a Milton Friedman quote, completely taken out of context, implying that he, Chicago boys, IMF and World bank were involved in some kind of conspiracy to use shock to introduce free market to the world. What Friedman's quote was referring to was history, that it's usually after a shock that political and economic (capitalistic or socialistic) changes come about.<br /><br />First off Chile: Friedman was never paid or had any official ties to Pinochet. Friedman gave a series of lectures on his visit to Chile and did meet with Pinochet. In his letter to Pinochet, Friedman actually criticized his military dictatorship. That about sums up Friedman's relationship to Pinochet. All other garbage provided in this book, including the insinuation that Friedman had anything to do with Letelier's assassination are absolutely false.<br />In Naomi's own words: \\"Nixon threw Friedman a bone and that bone was Chile\\". This statement is obviously false, Nixon didn't throw Friedman any bone, matter of fact Friedman was an ardent critic of Nixon and his price and wage controls. In a famous exchange between Nixon and Friedman, Nixon said to Friedman - \\"Don't blame George for this silly business of wage and price controls,\\" and Friedman replied \\"Oh, no, Mr. President. I don't blame George; I blame you!\\"<br />She goes on to mention the Chilean exchange student program trying to establish the existence of a conspiracy to brainwash the South Americans. Of course this is ridiculous. University of Chicago is a private institution and had no ties to the American government, Nixon or CIA. The exchange program was just like any other exchange program that existed.<br />This is just one of the many examples of gross distortions or outright lying by Naomi Klein. Naomi Klein, simply put, is a charlatan.<br />Now let's look at the result of Chilean reform:<br />Under Allende's socialist regime the inflation was 120%. Economy was stagnant, there was no growth and people were starving. But on the other hand the underground economy was vibrant and profitable. What does that tell you? After the reformation today Chile is the richest country (by nominal per capita) in South America and the most stable economy. It has averaged 4% growth since the 80s (as compared to .7% before). Chile had one of the lowest life expectancy in S. America, 57 years, today it's 79, almost the same as America and increase of 22 years in just 3 decades, a miracle in itself. Poverty which was 48% in 1980 is today 11%. Yet somehow, someway in Naomi Klein's deluded mind free market has destroyed Chile.<br /><br />One theme that's common throughout the book is Noami Klein's failure to understand the difference between free market and crony capitalism.<br /><br />For example she gives examples of Sri Lankan government expelling fishermen from beach property to sell lands to corporations and during the Russian transition to mixed-market economy, the selling of assets and resources to international companies at a fraction of the cost. Corrupt politicians selling off assets is NOT free market. As a matter of fact that just makes the case to reduce the power of the government.<br /><br />The most hilarious attempt at re-writing history comes when Naomi tries to pass off the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 as a protest AGAINST liberalization.<br />The protests were of course in response to the death of Hu Yaobang, who was FOR both political and economic freedoms. The protests were in demand of liberalization, and CFC were stubbornly resisting it.<br />And would anyone in their right mind today argue that the market reforms were bad for China? Since Naomi doesn't like to look at GDP as a measure of economic progress (yes she actually said it), per capita income rose six fold between 1978 and 2005. Poverty which was 85% in 1981, dropped to 16% in 2005. Hey Naomi, how you like them apples?<br /><br />She mentions South Africa, and I am not well read on South African economic history, so I cannot critique, but I do wonder why she didn't mention it's neighbor Zimbabwe. Why is it only a selective world history is presented? Zimbabwe of course under Mugabe's socialist land re-distribution policies, led to complete collapse of the economy and a hyper-inflation.<br /><br />What \\"shock\\" existed in India for it to adopt market reforms? The only shock was from the 4 decades of failed central planning, state control and license Raj that brought the country to the brink of economic disaster. And much like China, market reforms have helped the country develop at a break neck speed, GDP grew at 7-8% per year since 1991. Poverty which was 40% in 1990, is 25% today. India adds 80 million people to the middle class EVERY year. At the current rate, India is set to be a first world country by 2040. Apples, Naomi, do you like them?<br /><br />And she actually tries to give the reader \\"hope\\" by giving examples like Venezuela, who \\"resisted\\" the \\"devastation\\" of the free market (lol). You can't help but laugh when her example of hope is a country which was once the richest in South America but went exactly the opposite way under socialism. It's sitting on black gold yet it's GDP hasn't moved anywhere since 1978. Inflation is 30% even under a fixed exchange rate . In simple comparison Hong Kong (Friedman's example of capitalism) which has no resources, is one of the richest in the world. Between 1961-97, Hong Kong's per capita rose 87 fold. It went from a slum to a developed country, much like Singapore and Taiwan, the same path China and India are on and many other former socialist countries which have adopted market reforms. Apples, Naomi, they are expensive, I can't keep buying them.<br /><br />To summarize this is one of the saddest pieces of \\"journalism\\" I have ever read. This is definitely NOT a book on economics. Naomi Klein is not an economist, hell she doesn't even know the difference between classical economics and Chicago school and between capitalism and crony capitalism. The theme of \\"shock\\" is laughable from the start when she states the CIA experiment and implies it's only through \\"shock\\" that a population will accept the free market. Umm NO Naomi, I will gladly take market reforms over government control. The very term \\"shock therapy\\" which is an economic theory is changed to mean that it's supposed to be administered under shock. The mischaracterization doesn't stop there. Friedman who was for peace, trade and prosperity, and was staunchly anti Iraq war, was somehow thrown in with Bush in some kind of Bush-Friedman conspiracy to bring \\"free market\\" to Iraq. If you really want to know what Friedman was about, go read his work, listen to what he said, watch hisvideos, don't take Naomi's word for it. And ironically much like Michael Moore, bashing capitalism hasn't stopped her from getting rich off it. In my opinion, if you were convinced by this book, you are very very very ignorant about world economic history.<br /><br />P.S. If you want a better economic history of the world in the last half century, I will recommend: [[ASIN:068483569X The Commanding Heights : The Battle for the World Economy]]like them?

B0057DI0AC|5.0|Just purchased this Blu-ray/Dvd combo from Movie Emporium and the Blu-ray Dic played excellent on my PS3 and other Blu-ray player. However, the DVD (which is a region 2) DID NOT play on my PS3 or any DVD player. So if you are like me and live in the USA, you will have to wait a while for the DVD release. This is a Fantastic film on the greatest driver of all time !!! i just wish america could produce a good race car driver.
B005F96URI|5.0|Honestly, The main reason I bought Bunraku was to support my favorite Japanese musician, GACKT who stars as Yoshi in Bunraku. I didn't hold out much hope for the rest of the movie based on critic reviews.<br /><br />But I sat down and watched it, and honestly, I really really liked it. Not to say the movie isn't flawed. the beginning is a bit campy and confusing. I didn't know where they were going with anything until almost 15 minutes in. The way they introduced and built the characters up could have been done much better.<br /><br />However, once you got passed the corny introductions to the characters, and figured out what the heck was going on... the rest fell into place nicely.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett filled the role of \\"The Drifter\\" very well. he brought a bit of realism to what could best be described as a comic book character. There were moments where he made you laugh, like a scene where he has to use a trapeze. I really enjoyed the fight scenes with \\"The Drifter\\". They were exciting... Josh Hartnett was right on in his interpretation of the character.<br /><br />I think Woody Harrelson did a great job as the bartender. He seemed to fit the role perfectly, and I'm not talking about his bartending stint on 'Cheers'. (I was too little to really appreciate his time on that show - lol). what I liked about Harrelson in this movie... He has this sort of wisdom in his eye, and cunningly knowing smile. He really stuck out to me in this movie. I have to say, I have a new found respect for Harrelson as an actor after this role.<br /><br />Gackt surprised me. I'm a big fan of his music, and I liked him in Furin Kazan (a Japanese Samurai period piece)... however, I didn't know how he would handle the transition to and English speaking Hollywood movie. Surprisingly, his acting is very good. he wasn't over the top nor was he too understated. He made the character realistic and likable. You would never guess by watching this movie that this was his first Hollywood movie, or that he didn't have a large list of acting credits under his belt. There were a few times I had to remind myself that I was watching GACKT, because he brings you into his character. He really did a great job.<br /><br />There were a few things I didn't like, or at least, that disappointed me a bit. Nicola (the main baddie played brilliantly by Ron Perlman) and Alexandra (played also brilliantly by Demi Moore) were not properly utilized in the movie. There was so much that could have been done with both characters... I feel there were missed opportunities. Especially when we learn WHO Alexandra has a history with, and considering Nicola is the most feared, and most dangerous man that few dare stand up to him... once you see the movie, you'll spot a few places where the opportunities were missed...

There were a few times I had to remind myself that I was watching GACKT, because he brings you into his character. He really did a great job.   There were a few things I didn't like, or at least, that disappointed me a bit. Nicola (the main baddie played brilliantly by Ron Perlman) and Alexandra (played also brilliantly by Demi Moore) were not properly utilized in the movie. There was so much that could have been done with both characters... I feel there were missed opportunities. Especially when we learn WHO Alexandra has a history with, and considering Nicola is the most feared, and most dangerous man that few dare stand up to him... once you see the movie, you'll spot a few places where the opportunities were missed...

3836531038|3.0|It is true you can't judge a book by it's cover.  While I liked the cover image, I was disappointed by the images inside or should I say I didn't like and was distracted by teh cameras in the photographs.  However, the women are beautiful and sexy and some of the compositions are well crafted.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I must begin by stating I hate what Rick Rubin did to this album.  I expected so much more from the producer of \\"Danzig\\" and \\"Reign In Blood\\"... he butchered this otherwise spectacular effort.  It sounds like it was recorded through Saran Wrap; the mix of this album can be described as nothing less than rape.<br /><br />That out of the way, extreme kudos to Metallica.  After the abyssmal crap that they called \\"St. Anger\\", this is the most impressive piece of work from them since \\"And Justice For All\\".  There were no short-cuts in songwriting here (unlike the black album and the worse \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" albums); the boys definitely earned their money with the creation of \\"Death Magnetic\\".  Hooks, tightness, power, emotion, and headbanging inspiration are abundant.  This is the Metallica we remember from \\"Ride The Lightning\\", \\"Master Of Puppets\\" (my personal fave), and \\"And Justice For All\\".  A wonderful and overdue comeback for the gods of metal.<br /><br />I'm giving 5 stars for the album, but 3 for the crappy I'm-going-through-a-what-do-I-do-for-a-living-again? phase of producer Rick Rubin.  Anticipating Metallica's next work, hoping it follows the winning formula they re-discovered with the brilliant \\"Death Magnetic\\"!
0385534639|5.0|Fantasy is a very vibrant field, having found lots of different ways for humanity and the magical to interact.  The small, mismatched band of companions heading out to defeat the Dark Lord may still be there, but, as this book demonstrates, fantasy has taken off in all sorts of exciting directions.  This book is beautifully written and told compellingly.  Although the main characters are the two young wizards having to fight in a contest they don't fully understand, the most unforgettable \\"character\\" is the Circus itself.  I want to visit it!  I want to be a reveur!  A lot of trash makes best-seller lists, but this book fully deserves its excellent sales (even though I'm not sure I totally understand the final resolution).
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Everyone has heard Alice In Chains, and most people enjoy them.  Naturally, some albums were much better than others.  After the untimely death of Layne Staley, I found myself enjoying the solo albums of Jerry Cantrell.  I mean really enjoying and appreciating them, for their musical construction as well as their addictive songwriting.  Never got tired of listening to the Jerry Cantrell CDs.<br /><br />So when I heard of the reunion of Alice In Chains, I was prepared to sacrifice some of the coolness of the Cantrell albums for some of the necessary grimacing brought about by the weaker quality of songs like on the last (and worst) AIC (self-titled) album.  Boy, was I in for a surprise...<br /><br />This album impressed me more than I ever expected.  Everything I love about the old AIC albums and Cantrell's solo albums is here... and then some!  The new singer William DuVall is not Layne, but is more than suitable.  He fits very well with Cantrell's accompanying vocals.  And I love the songs!  Even the ones DuVall co-wrote are pretty awesome (love \\"Last Of My Kind\\"!), and Cantrell's songs still have the hypnotic spark we hope he will never lose.  It is the best AIC album since \\"Dirt\\", and a must-have for anyone who ever liked the band!
B00006BIO0|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend and he was so happy to receive it.  He said it was a very collection of one of his favorite artists from that time period.  I was very happy with the delivery time and the product as well.  Thank you
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I must start by stating I loved the Anthrax albums wherein Jon Bush sang (yes, even Stomp 442).  But before that I fell in love with the band that I grew up with in high school and college, monumental albums such as Spreading The Disease, Among The Living, and Persistence Of Time.  Once I found out the new album would finally be out with Joey Belladonna on vocals, I was okay with that.  I would miss Jon Bush, but knew that Anthrax with Joey was still Anthrax that had a place in my heart.<br /><br />It's been a long time, so I told myself not to expect greatness.  When I got an advance of Worship Music, I was freakin' blown away.  This album is nothing short of amazing!  It contains fragments of music that represents various years of their recording career, notably my fave \\"Fight 'Em Til You Can't\\" being reminiscent of the fury of the Spreading The Disease and Among The Living albums, but also offers glimpses of musical evolution with \\"I'm Alive\\", \\"In The End\\", and \\"Judas Priest\\".  (Not to mention the superior production of this album!)  The entire album is a treat for metal fans, and Joey Belladonna has never sounded better!<br /><br />Anthrax is back, stronger and better than ever!  Do yourself a favor and get this album!  You'll find yourself hooked, listening to it on a very regular basis.  Rock on, gentlemen... and thank you!
0307276902|4.0|I remember reading this book a long time ago when I was still in high school and doing drugs.

I don't think I will be doing drugs ever again.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Master of Crows was wonderful. If I'd hadn't gotten a rec from a Goodreads friend, I'd have probably been a bit skeptical going into the book, because the reviews I'd seen had been so overwhelmingly positive - well now you can add me to the 'gushers'.<br /><br />Having caught the eye of a corrupt god looking for vessel for his latest incarnation, outcast mage Silhara is desperately trying to resist the god's powerful lure. But the god is seductive and Silhara is running out of time and will power -  his only hope is to find a way to kill a god. Choosing the lesser of evils, Silhara petitions the Conclave for a scholar with expertise in archaic languages to help him dig through ancient texts for spell. The Conclave leader, sees Silhara's request as the perfect opportunity to install a spy in Silhara's house. Martise, who is secretly a slave promised her freedom in exchange for information leading to Silhara's downfall, is sent to 'aid' Silhara, and in exchange Silhara has promised help Martise to discover her hidden magic. As the pair slowly overcome their distrust and come to admire each other, both Martise and Silhara will have to decide whether their own freedom is worth the price of the other's life.<br /><br />I am really character-centric in my reading and I loved both Martise and Silhara. Author Draven really took the time to flesh out her cast - even her supporting characters are well drawn. So for me it was a big plus that instead of being action driven, Master of Crows was character driven. The interractions between Martise and Silharea were deftly crafted with 'key' moments that moved their relationship along throughout the story, even as they both fought not to 'go' there. And since the pair started out pretty much as adversaries who needed the other for their own salvation, they both had really good reasons for not wanting to want each other. As a result, their mutual admiration and later their romance built slowly before finally progressing to the physical and capping off with a nice amount of steam.<br /><br />So the bottom line is that I really enjoyed Master of Crows, it was a pleasant surprise and their story has an ending and a happily ever after that feel very finished. However, Draven apparently plans to revisit their world and continue the saga with their daughter in the lead. Though not available on Kindle yet, Draven does have several other standalone looking ebooks out there and I plan to find out whether they are just as good as Master of Crows.cal and capping off with a nice amount of steam.<br /><br />So the bottom line is that I really enjoyed Master of Crows, it was a pleasant surprise and their story has an ending and a happily ever after that feel very finished.

B001UV4XJ2|3.0|The movie is excellent, a masterpiece.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired.  Why WB decided to go with UltraViolet instead of standard digital copy is beyond me.  UltraViolet IS NOT COMPATIBLE with iTunes nor Apple products.  The way it works is your UltraViolet Digital Copy goes into a cloud for you to view whenever you want, up to 3 years, then it expires.  With a standard Digital Copy, you import it into iTunes and it's there until you delete it.  But best of all, you can Sync it onto your various iPod models to view whenever you wish.  That is no longer possible with UltraViolet
1451648537|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Walter Issacson and it definitely won't be the last! This book is nearly impossible to put down. Having spent years working in Silicon Valley, I found myself feeling somewhat nostalgic, longing for the old days. There was an incredible energy around here during the years described in this book. Undoubtedly, Steve Jobs is responsible for much of the excitement.  I appreciate the sincerity and accurate character descriptions presented in this book. Although Jobs had a few unsavory characteristics, I have a new respect for him. After all, the convergence of art and technology is the best thing that ever happened to technology. - Thanks Steve!
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I love this movie and have seen it many times actually. I wanted a DVD to replace my VHS tape. It's chock full of humor poking fun at the Ballroom scene. Along with all the exellence in dancing \\"Ballroom\\" has a very interesting social structure. Much in it to poke fun of as you can see in this movie.

0385344325|3.0|OK, this isn't the best in Lee Child's Reacher series, but it's still a good read. The pace is fast, the writing is straightforward, and the story is fairly well-constructed. Since it covered the period when Reacher was still an MP, it was interesting to fill in the blanks on some of his earlier history.  I try not to play the spoiler in reviewing novels, but suffice to say that the ending was a bit unsatisfying. The loose ends of the story were tied up sufficiently well, but some of the details in how we reached that point were a little incredible. I liked most of the characters, particularly the sheriff and Munro, the other MP, but others (like the Army higher-ups) weren't developed very well. Some of Reacher's rare violent actions took place with zero blowback, which I found to be somewhat unbelievable.   If you're a fan of the Reacher series, you'll probably like this well enough. If you're new to Lee Child, I'd recommend starting elsewhere. This is a good book that unfortunately is judged against previous efforts that were considerably better. And I still can't believe Tom Cruise will portray Reacher in a film.....

Also, we have many Apple TV's in the house that are great to watch movies on.  Not happening with the Ultra Violet copy.<br /><br />Here is the link to the REGION FREE version on the UK Site with a TRUE DIGITAL COPY: [[...]]<br /><br />As of now, it converts to just under $22.00.  Won't get here until 2nd week in December, but that's fine with me!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Everyone is comparing this one to the first. Why bother, if you like these guys chances are you will like everything they put out, I know I do. After all, you have four longtime hard driving rockers that have been doing it for years. Sammy sounds as good as ever and Joe is one of the all time greats. The highlight of the disc for me is Something Gone Wrong, what a great song! Joe pours his soul out with his guitar playing in this song. Mikes backup vocals are tremendous here. A good mix of rockers and ballads on this disc. When you mix this album with the other it will make one great concert. It should be a great tour. I am just glad these guys are still making new music after all these years. Great Cd!!!

I am NOT happy at all with my purchase & would recommend not buying any DVD's from this person.... Zero stars from me!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|First off, the movie is great.  My review is about the product. Every other Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy movie I've purchased has come with a code that allows me to import a digital copy of the movie into iTunes - including Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows.  After looking up \\"Ultraviolet\\", it looks like all you get is access to a \\"streamed\\" version of the movie.  In other words, I can't put it on my iPad and watch it on a trip.  To watch the so-called \\"digital copy\\" you have to use an app and stream the movie from Flixster.  So you have to have access to a fast enough internet connection to stream it.  If you're on a trip and it's even possible to stream over 3G, you're going to pay for the data.  The bottom line is that I'm sending this back as soon as it arrives (it's already shipped).

B005HWAOCA|5.0|Thank God they did this (and I DON'T mean Eric Clapton!). Cream was captured live on audio very well in 60's but the only live video is the execrable \\"Farewell Concert\\" (which you can totally forget about).  This video captures the band in fine form...they are as good as they were in the 60's which is astonishing when you consider the passage of years.  Jack Bruce drives Eric Clapton to levels we haven't seen since 1969 and it reminds us why he was referred to as God in his heydey.  Cream plays virtually every song in their catalogue (even \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\"!) and, if that wasn't enough, they add a NEW Cream song to the canon, a superb \\"Stormy Monday\\" sung by Eric Claption.  This is one of the best videos in my collection and I treasure owning it.  I wish something more had come out of this one-off reunion but I'm very happy that they got this right!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Ready Player One has been hailed as this generation's Neuromancer and Snow Crash -- though the comparisons may be a bit hyperbolic, it is undoubtedly the cleverest novel about virtual life I've read in awhile. Granted, Ernest Cline isn't writing on the same level as William Gibson or Neal Stephenson did in their prime, but that isn't to say that Ready Player One still isn't a thoroughly entertaining novel.<br /><br />The book centers on Wade Watts, a trailer-dwelling teenager living in the bleak year of 2044, where the planet's resources have been spent, unemployment is rampant, and basically the only meaningful life to be had is in an online game called OASIS, which has grown to encompass every imaginary universe ever created and the Internet, itself.<br /><br />The OASIS was designed by a misfit genius named James Halliday -- a Steve Jobsian figure complete his own estranged Steve Wozniakian partner -- who dies and leaves ownership of the OASIS to the first person who can find an easter egg hidden within the simulation. When the novel opens, some years have passed since Halliday's death, and no one -- not even the well-funded and totally nefarious IOI corporation -- have been able to locate the easter egg. That is, until Wade makes an unexpected discovery.<br /><br />What follows is an adventure story steeped in 80's nostalgia and references, most of which are pretty obvious to GenXers who grew up on the periphery of geek culture, but may seem obscure to the general population. The pop culture references and the hunt for the MacGuffin are just the shiny outer wrapper, though -- Ready Player One`s strongest elements involve explorations of online relationships and the effects of living your entire life in a digital world, two very important issues given how many people today choose to escape their own lives for the comfort offered by online games and communities.<br /><br />Although Ready Player One doesn't meet the incredible expectations and hype, it is both brisk and enjoyable. It's well worth the time of science fiction fans, gamers and 80's lovers, alike, just don't expect it to change the way you look at the future like Neuromancer and Snow Crash did.e of science fiction fans, gamers and 80s lovers, alike, just don't expect it to change the way you look at the future like Neuromancer and Snow Crash did.
B005VPSEK2|2.0|Kelly is such an epic voice and talent, but unfortunately, she has let the label pressure her into releasing the same re-cycled pop junk over and over.  What perplexes me is when you listen to her sing live, she is totally a different artist. Her live performances are simply stunning where she does amazing covers of songs like You're Cheating Heart by Hank Williams or I Never Loved a Man by Aretha Franklin. Then you listen to her studio albums (My December being the exception) and you think \\"is this is the same artist?\\" My December was the most honest album to date with raw/haunting songs like Irvine/Chivas and Be Still.  In listening to Stronger, many of the songs are so over-produced, her vocals are completely drowned out and the songs sound the same. Hopefully, she will finally get to the age that she doesn't care what the label execs want and will just put out songs that are more introspective and really showcase her vocal ability. Her Unplugged special will be airing soon and there's a sneak peek on her website of her singing \\"I Know You Won't\\" which will move you to tears. She said how much she loves and respects Adele and that style is right in her wheelhouse.  Without trying to \\"copy\\" Adele, why would she not release an album that's at least as honest and moving as Adele's 21? If Adele had released Irvine/Chivas, it would be a huge hit.  So why was it not for Kelly?  Advice to Kelly: record a live, unplugged or stripped down album of songs you like to perform and tell the label to stick it.  I'm sure Ellen Degeneres would love to have you on her Eleveneleven label as would many indie labels and then you could have more artistic freedom over your music.

B001UV4XJ2|2.0|A good many of us buying the combo version of HP7P2 are doing it for extra features and the DVD disc so that we have the niceties that come along with having the DVD.  The old method that WB used for 'digital copies' was decent.  Sure it was DRM'd to a degree...you had to be Apple slanted or Windows Media slanted, but that was bearable and convenient.  Ultraviolet IS NOT a true digital copy as it states, its just a DRM'ed stream and a method for the movie and electronic industry to sell us more stuff.  Sure it can be 'downloaded' but not in the manner most folks are used to and Joe consumer is going to be really confused when he downloads it withing the Flixster program and finds out he can't throw it over to his iPad for his kid like he used to do.  I won't and have not been buying any movies solely for the download feature, but in the past it was a nice bonus.  Future purchasers, be aware that you won't get what you are used to with Ultraviolet.  More like UltraControlled.  As far as the Blu-Ray of the movie itself....Priceless.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I've had this watch for about a year now, and I have lots of good things to say. First, I'll start with the negatives. The crystal is moderately easy to scratch, I would recommend replacing with a sapphire crystal. Secondly, the metal band becomes scratched by writing (I'm a lefty who wears his watch on his left hand while writing). I would imagine this wouldn't be a problem if you don't use the hand you wear your watch on to write, but the band does get scratched. I think it gives it character, but some may find it annoying. That's all I have to say on the negatives.  It keeps great time, has a nice weight to it, is quite flashy, and being a seiko, legendary durability and accuracy. My watch gains about two seconds a month, which isn't so bad at all. The chronograph function is bang on, and even the small dials are easy to read. It's one of my favorite watches, easy.

B0055PMJMW|3.0|I really enjoy Michael Connelly but was highly disappointed with this book.  It was split into three very shorts stories, all which had interesting story lines.

1594203059|2.0|My first reaction when I heard of the book title was extreme anger. Here comes another \\"Westerner\\" who has who just kidnapped \\"civilization\\" for the benefit of his larger homeland. So many writers have succumbed to the carefully engineered fallacy that the West ALONE has brought about the Modern World. Although they started lately to acknowledge that Western supremacy is a mere 500 year-old phenomenon (What's 500 years in 50 centuries of known civilization??), they still somehow appropriate for themselves many human values conveniently forgetting that the building of the Pyramids also required organization and \\"work ethics\\".   Like Max Weber in \\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\\", the author apparently thinks that \\"[o]nly in the West does science exist at a stage of development which we recognize to-day as valid\\"! Notwithstanding the \\"STILL\\" standing pyramids, to name but one of the Ancient (Non-Western) world wonders, a true testament to the pursuit of science and its applications!  Nevertheless, I have resigned myself to reading this book since its author has aroused in me such strong feelings...And I will write another review after reading the book, either to confirm my fears or to recant my earlier observations! It's just that the title itself is in need of a review!  I also agree with another reviewer who suggested that Mr. Fergusson has forgotten the most important \\"killer\\" app., i.e. brutal violence...Can one forget the tragic photos of the colonized Congo (The private domain of the Belgian king Leopold)???  So, please, let's be truthful about human nature and refrain from labelling one group, rather than another, as more prone to violence or terrorism or laziness or many of the bold faced lies that the Western World has become so adept at!
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" opens with the Duke of York (Colin Firth) suffering from stage fright and stammering while attempting to make an important address at Wembley Stadium.  He seeks help from Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist from Australia who uses novel methods to get his patients beyond their speech problems.<br /><br />The Duke becomes King George VI after the death of his father and the abdication of his brother--and it became vital as the age of radio flowered for the King to become an inspiring public speaker, especially since another major European war appeared imminent.  The two men work through issues of equality, hierarchy, and psychology as they build trust and an eventual friendship as they prepare for the King's speech that would lead the British Empire into World War II.<br /><br />Gallup polls consistently show public speaking at or near the top of the list of fears of Americans, which is one reason why the film was such a big hit--we all know that in public speaking, the stakes are high.  Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford surely regretted their debate performances for the rest of their days, and I'm sure that Al Gore will regret his for the rest of his.<br /><br />While the everyday citizen might not have speech issues on par with the King's, most of us can identify--you might have flubbed key lines during a one-act play competition in high school, or choked on a critical date, or frozen during a job interview, or botched a toast at a friend's wedding reception, or said something foolish during a presentation at work.  All but the smoothest among us have probably been there at one point or another along the trail.  What makes the movie so inspiring is that it teaches that while failure is part of life, so too is courage, struggle, mastery, and, finally, redemption.<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\" is just a great story, and I was glad to see it capture four Academy Awards, including the awards for Best Actor and Best Picture for 2010.  History lovers and especially Anglophiles would greatly enjoy it.would greatly enjoy it.

1451627289|5.0|Al Templeton (owner of Al's Diner) found a time portal. Whenever he uses it, it drops him in Lisbon Falls, Maine, on the morning of September 9, 1958. That's over five years before John F. Kennedy will be assassinated. Al thinks he can live in the past long enough to save the president. But the past is obdurate. (That's King's word. Good one, too, isn't it? It means obstinate, callous, unbending.) The past doesn't want to change. Lord knows, Al has tried, but he's now running out of time. He decides that he needs to recruit someone younger for the job, so he calls on local schoolteacher Jake Epping, who is in mid-30s, divorced, honest, caring, a real straight shooter.  Once Jake gets beyond the initial you-must-be-crazy conversation and the flaming doubt spawned by Al's fantastical suggestion, he agrees to give it a go and makes a trial run. After just a few months in 1958, he returns to 2011 (where only two minutes have passed, just like Al said). Time is of the essence, as they say, so Al pushes Jake with a huge nudge, leaving Jake little choice but to take up the endeavor.     Very shortly, Jake is back in 1958, with some ID showing him to be a man named George Amberson, carrying a sizable sum of old money plus some financial insurance in his briefcase in the form of winners' names in future sporting events. Jake/George settles into his new era, planning how to use the years until he can try to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from shooting Kennedy. He has an idea or two, and they could save lives. But, as mentioned before, the past is obdurate. It pushes back.     George shouldn't have, but he finds himself sidetracked by love. Maybe blindsided is more accurate. At any rate, the lady Sadie steals his heart and clouds his thinking. But, boy, do they dance!     So when the fateful 11/22/63 date comes, can George save the president? Thinking of Sadie, will he even want to? Or will the obdurate past stop him? \\"Al's final notes were sketchy and hurried; he had never expected Mission Oswald to go on so long...Getting to the disaffected little twerp was like traveling on a road littered with fallen branches, and in the end the past might succeed in protecting itself, after all.\\"     Every page is a blast to the past: dimmer switches on the floors of cars, rabbit ears on TVs (and the frustration of the picture rolling as you try to tune it), gas at 19.9 cents for regular, lobster going for 69 cents a pound, pay phones charging a dime for a local call. Not to mention the music! King always treats you to great music. To quote George Amberson: Dancing is life.     What separates King from the herd is extraordinary texture and multi-dimensional characters who will live with you forever after meeting them once. And he always sets his tales in small towns, partly because he knows them so well, and there's an intimacy in them that the mega population of cities just can't match. So we begin in small-town Maine and travel eventually to Dallas. And then...back again? We'll see.     There's a fun bonus here, too. If you've read King for as long as I have, you might recognize a few old friends --- or enemies --- from past novels. It's a huge delight finding a familiar name pop up on a page. Or two. Or three.     I don't believe I have ever called a 900-plus-page book a quick read. Until now. 11/22/63 isn't classic King. This is the New & Improved King, and you've never seen anything like it. It's the best of the best. For me, it's the Story of the Century.\\"  Reviewed by Kate Ayers

B003EYVXSW|1.0|I went to see this with my wife thinking a sci-fi flick and then some dinner would be a nice evening out.  Had I known the movie was going to go the way it did, I would have saved myself the agony of watching it by pouring gas on my feet and setting them on fire.  It would have been just as entertaining and nowhere near as painful.  Seriously, I've never had as many WTF moments in a movie as I did this one.  My wife and I left the theater shaking our heads and the only saving grace for me was that she was the one that picked this stinker of a movie, so I didn't have to listen to ANY bitching whatsoever about my poor movie choices.  In fact, Splice has become somewhat of an \\"ace-in-the-hole\\" for me when it comes to getting reamed over a movie she doesn't like.  The plot is standard to start, but then it gets a little twisted.  And by twisted, I mean depraved on a level that even a demon from hell would say \\"That's f'ing creepy, man!\\".  A plot overview is really unnecessary at this point and I'll probably try hypnosis to forget this degenerate film fest.  The moral of the story is: Don't stick your pee-pee in the science experiment.  Do not take kids to see this.  Do not take the elderly, faint of heart or anyone with at least a shred of dignity or moral fiber about them as it will stain their precious minds for the rest of their natural lives.  A Lindsay Lohan PSA on the virtues of abstaining from masturbating would be more tolerable to watch than this movie.    Good luck if you get it, but don't watch it on a full stomach.  You've been warned.

0812550706|5.0|The first time I picked up this book, I only got about five pages through before I put it down.  The next time I picked it up, I finished it in under a week.  This is probably one of my favorite sci-fi books of all time. Not to give anything away, but the way the book is written and the flow of the story was so impressive to me that I couldn't put it down.  It's hard to review this book without wanting to talk in depth about it, but I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi.   I always feel like I'm playing catch-up with sci-fi, but this should most certainly be on the top of everyone's list.  Finally, there is much discussion about which book to read next...I recommend 'Ender's Shadow.'

B00288KNL8|5.0|If any proof were needed that 3-D movies have entered a bold new era, Coraline is it; this stylistically bold, emotionally resonant stop-motion flick is a twisted marvel. Directed by Henry Selick and based upon the best seller by Neil Gaiman, Coraline follows the phantasmagoric exploits of the title character, a bored 11-year-old who discovers a door in her house that leads to a parallel version of her life -- one that at first is enchanting, but soon threatens to entrap our hero. Coraline is one of the most visually dazzling pictures to come along in many a moon, and it's anchored by a delightfully twisted storyline.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|If you loved the other HP movies you'll love this one. I did. Just don't read the books. If you do you will have much the same reactions as other reviewers who have given the movie a two star rating.

B002BI6SMI|1.0|Taken is an action flick that's both efficient and absurd, and so it's often entertaining -- but only up to a point. The film stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA agent who learns his daughter has been abducted in Paris; upon receiving a frantic phone call from her, he tracks her down -- and finds himself on the trail of a massive criminal enterprise. Taken is a sprightly piece of work, and Neeson is compelling in the lead role, but the film is weighted down by contrivances and leaps in logic.

B00164KYV4|1.0|He's Just Not That Into You is the latest in a long line of romantic comedies that attempt to navigate the complexities of modern relationships. The movie's problem, is that by juggling so many plot threads it ends up giving a short shrift to characterization and insight. An embarrassment of talented actors play Baltimore residents who are attempting to find the perfect match, but are regularly stymied by self-questioning and unreturned phone calls. The film is bogged down by the fact that there's too much going on for the characters to emerge as three-dimensional personalities, thus reducing its talented thespians to playing stereotypes.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I am writing this after buying what I thought would be a Blu-ray dvd digital copy for iTunes package. Instead, this digital copy is linked to flixster. You cannot watch it on your computer, nor without internet. To get it on your compter you must download some adobe program, and a flixster app that tracks your every move.  Not to mention that after 3 years, the move expires and you can't watch it anymore.   So in essence, you don't own the movie- so you can't do anything with it.

B005DIAJO6|5.0|This was required reading in my 9th grade class many, many  years ago, and recently when I was looking out at Treasure Island in San Francisco, I recalled the book and decided to send for a copy.  It is every bit as good a tale on rereading as it was at first.  It has a glossy hard cover, good print and appears to be, perhaps, one from a series of \\"classics\\"  for young readers.  If you like stories of pirates of old and buried treasure, you will enjoy this at any age.  However!    A caveat for youger readers.  Victorian prose usually has a lengthy development and is often excessively wordy for modern readers.  If you're looking for \\"fast\\", you won't find it here, but it is still a good tale and has, I believe, been made into a movie a couple of times, so if you're not into leisurely reading, go for the movie.  Amazon probably has it, Amazon has everything!

No, I won't do that because I can't, since I've never written a best-selling fantasy series that was picked up by HBO and is loved by millions of fans. Maybe if/when I write something better, I'll work up the gall to criticize someone else's work, but until then I'll just shut up.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For those who are here deciding whether to buy this book, I (for one) loved it and can't wait for \\"The Winds of Winter.\\"
0525423656|4.0|So, I could tell you that I really loved Crossed and that it lived up to all the expectations that I had for it. But that would be lying. And everyone knows I don't do that. ;) So let's talk. Or I can talk and you can listen. If you are a masochist. Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy this book. But, and there are a lot of buts, I just didn't feel it had the same magic that Matched did. Almost as if the author maybe was in a hurry to finish it and forgot the finer details that would have made the story spectacular. I don't know. But something was missing.<br /><br />Alright, so the one thing I really did enjoy was all the new information we were given about the society. I loved learning about it. All the different jobs that people held, how it ran, the air ships, how the outer provinces worked, etc. That's the part of Crossed that I really loved. The scene setting in this book was wonderful. It was the plot itself where I got frustrated.<br /><br />Even though I know Matched wasn't the most action oriented book out there, I felt Crossed was even worse. Nothing happened. It was just Cassia and Ky and sidekicks running from one place to another, trying to avoid the society. Then there would be some dialogue, they would hide something or they would sleep, and then they'd be off running again. It was just..frustrating.<br /><br />So, naturally I was disappointed. Some of our questions were answered, but not many. And there were a bunch of new questions raised. Look, parts of this book I really enjoyed. But it was nowhere near as good as Matched. Simply put, I just think this was a case of suffering from the book two sophomore slump. It happens. Book three should be better. I still love Ally Condie's writing style and I still loved the characters and their voices. At least there was that.

1451627289|5.0|When \\"Under the Dome\\" came out, I had really been excited to read it ... and ended up enjoying it but was disappointed. When \\"11/22/63\\" was announced, the premise did not really appeal to me, I must admit. I didn't want to read a political time travel thriller, but I purchased it anyway, as I'm a huge King fan. Boy, was I blown away! This novel, with its great first person narration and almost Dickensian prose, is amazing, the best King has written in years. And I don't think it's just that my expectations were low. This novel is wonderful. From the fast-paced opening chapters, where our hero descends from 2011 back to 1958, through the wonderful Derry circa 1958 sequences (including surprising and exciting references to, and even two cameos from, IT, my favourite all-time King), on to Texas, and the main action, this is a compelling, unputdownable tour-de-force that manages to be exciting, haunting, enjoyable, and thought-provoking. I've just now finished it and may come back to add more to this review once I allow my thoughts to settle a little more. But suffice it to say, this is now one of my favourite Kings. Very highly recommended.

B005CK76ZA|4.0|If you're considering buying this - you already know what you're getting into here.  A great classic album (with loads of extras) that belongs in any rock music fans collection.  Alot of people are complaining about the thin sound quality as compared to their original copy.  The reason for the sharpness is due to the audiophile vinyl... it reguires that you give this record a solid 20 spins before it warms up.  It will - however - stay warm - many years longer than a standard LP does.  I think they could have let us have this set for about $35. bux and still made their killing.  But, I'm not complaining... (too much)...  The packaging is really nice - and that's a big part of why we love vinyl.  So, grab one before they're all gone.  This will not be re-pressed.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|Final of four in the Twilight Saga, the Young Adult series that rocked the publishing world. Well . . . the world (lol). It may not have entered the household lexicon yet, like the Harry Potter books, but by now, most readers probably have a general idea about the romance of the human Belle and the vampire Edward.<br /><br />Meyer's world building is complex, but quiet. You always get the sense that there is more: the characters exist outside of the pages and you are seeing just a small part of their lives. It is hard to believe that she was a new writer.<br /><br />I liked the beginning of this book, but the middle had the same angsty tone of the last one. I actually put this down for a week, read other books as a palate cleanser, before picking it back up to finish. But the last half of this was extraordinary, my favorite of the entire series: beautiful and intense and a whole new layer of fascinating. At the end, Meyer introduced elements that just cried out for a completely separate series.<br /><br />The entire series is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B004LWZW8I|3.0|Western literature has been mining Greek mythology ever since the time of the Romans, but the last few years have seen a volume of screen adaptations not seen since Ray Harryhausen was in his prime.  The start of the 2000s saw a couple of films set in Ancient Greece but without the gods (\\"Troy\\", most notably, then \\"300\\", though the latter adopted an oft-copied stylized book that had little to do with reality either), which gave way to myth-based adventures (the \\"Clash of the Titans\\" remake, the adaptation of \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\"; incidentally, though that latter film was bad, I highly recommend the books it was based on).  \\"Immortals\\" has, based on the trailers, been pegged as a \\"300\\" knockoff with the gods present.  There are certainly some similarities, but Singh's visual sense is ultimately much different than Zack Snyder's was (there's a lot more beauty and colour in this world, for starters, whereas Snyder's emphasized earth tones and grime.  Plot details are discussed hence, so be warned for spoilers.    In Hellenas (Greece), our hero is Theseus (Henry Cavill, the future Superman) - actually, to get this out of the way, the film uses a bunch of mythological characters' names (Theseus, Phaedra, Lysander, Hyperion), but the characters in question haven't any real relation to their mythological counterparts - the bastard son of a village woman.  When the evil Heraclean king, Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, surprisingly not out of place in the ancient setting, though the heavy stylization doubtless facilitates that), sacks his village and kills his mother, Theseus finds himself in the company of Phaedra (\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\"'s Freida Pinto, on duty as the love interest for the second time this year; she has more to do here than in \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\", though that was the superior film), the virgin Oracle, who has prophesied that he will play a crucial role in the war between Hyperion and the gods (he seeks to unleash the Titans and end the reign of the Olympians, in revenge for the deaths of his family).  Hyperion, meanwhile, seeks Phaedra, who can reveal to him the location of the Epirus Bow, a fabled weapon of immense power.  A quite exceptional amount of violence ensues.  As a story with characters, it's pretty minimal, but I imagine anyone going into it expected that.  I will, nonetheless, comment on the plot in one aspect:  in the past I've encountered films where the hero's only heroism was all about stopping an evil that they had accidentally caused, which often doesn't come across as especially heroic; \\"Immortals\\", on the other hand, features a hero who *fails* to stop anything.  Theseus would have to be considered the least successful action hero since Indiana Jones in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" (if Dr. Jones had gone on an extended vacation to Yugoslavia, would the ultimate result have been very different at all?) - in fact, you can build a pretty good case that if Theseus had done nothing at all things would have turned out better, since his only meaningful action was finding the Epirus Bow and then losing it so that Hyperion could use it to free the Titans.  The gods defeat the Titans, and Theseus' killing of Hyperion is meaningless since the villain would have been killed along with his armies when Zeus collapsed the mountain.  Sure, he was brave, but what did he actually accomplish in the grand scheme of things?  Henry Cavill is a credible hero, and has great pecs (certainly, he feels less over-the-top than did Gerard Butler in \\"300\\", though I'm not sure whether he actually is).  The aforementioned Rourke is a menacing villain, aided by the director letting him do some memorably gory things to make an impression.  Freida Pinto, as I said, gets more to do here than in her last blockbuster, and I'd say she does fairly well with the movie's main female part (the movie never pretends that the petite Pinto is an action hero either, which I appreciated after too many movies featuring waifs with thecombat skills of a Green Beret), though it's hardly a demanding role.  Pinto is also, among the cast, the primary beneficiary of her director's aesthetic skill, as he finds many ways to showcase her beauty (a brief nude scene is not actually her, but there are many stunning images of her in a red dress).  The supporting cast includes Stephen Dorff as what I suppose is meant to be a Han Solo figure, Stavros, and Luke Evans, Isabel Lucas, and Kellan Lutz as gods.  Tarsem Singh is the real star of the proceedings, though.  He does some remarkable things with his camera, producing quite a few memorable images and setpieces.  His use of colour stands out repeatedly, particularly the aforementioned red dress that Pinto wears (which does a great job of staying clean even in the midst of a typhoon of oil that coats everything else).  His rendering of Mount Olympus is by far the best I've ever seen on film - there's not a trace of the simple fluffy clouds populated by people wearing bedsheets so often seen in older films; pure majesty.  For all the inventive fight scenes, though, I don't understand how Zeus (Evans) could go the whole movie without using his thunderbolt even once (though he proves adept with chains).  As a story, this is lacking in numerous respects, but as a visual experience it's quite a marvel.  I came away thinking that Singh could perhaps be a great director if would devote as much care to his stories as to the images used to tell them.  As it is, we have a visually stunning mediocrity.

B004E9CFZG|3.0|5/6 of the first season is over. We're introduced to a new character  and FINALLY we might get some info about the lead-up to the present  predicament the world is in. Jenner is a scientist with the CDC in  Atlanta, locked away alone for months with no contact with the outside  world. He doesn't even know if anyone else is alive as his outer  security cameras only show corpses piled up all around town. As he's  recording a video diary we get two new nuggets of info: It's been 194  days since \\"wildfire\\" was declared and 63 days since the disease went  inexplicably global.  What we don't know is what wildfire is. Could be a mutated vaccine he  was working on, could be a random outbreak from nature, could even be  an offshoot from a passing comet. Who knows? But over the last 6.5  months the situation has been getting worse, and about 2 months past it  became apparent no place on earth was safe from it. Which begs a few  questions, like, is Atlanta Ground Zero for the problem and as you go  farther away the problem is less pronounced? If so, that could be even  worse for people living far from the city as perhaps there was a flash  point phase where healthy people got sick without being bitten by a  walker. Perhaps the disease was airborne first and then altered. (Which  would go a long way towards explaining why there are so many zombies  walking around. Normally a body decomposes to liquidity within a month  without preservatives. Perhaps whatever is causing the walkers to  reanimate serves as a preservative too?) Maybe one reason family groups  survived is because they carry a resistant gene. Again, who knows? Point is, if for some reason this actually happened, these are all rational questions to be asked. I'm surprised this group is so wait-and-see about the end of the world. Obviously this is a little more than FEMA can handle. They've survived this long; now start defining some better parameters for going forward rather than just the nomadic caravan idea. Get tohigh ground. Find a water supply. Build a fence. These aren't tough ideas to come up with.  PS- the old man with the beard and Glenn, the Asian pizza delivery kid,  make this series. They are consistently the voice of self-preservation  balanced with logical reasoning. (In contrast to Rick, who always does the least logical thing concerning safety and planning.)

B005WGBQ9G|4.0|My buddy talked me into reality (as far as zombies go) today: \\"What,  you don't think they should move at different speeds? Ever been on a  sidewalk? NO ONE walks at the same pace. Height, weight, purpose; they   all play in.\\" Good point. Why exactly would every zombie be only able to   balance and walk at a slow mosey? I get running is out, that takes much   more coordination. But a semi quick trot in pursuit of food? I'll buy   that. And some zombies aren't as motivated as others, hence some shamble   aimlessly while some explore random places.  This makes sense.  Two things that don't though. \\"This is a graveyard. I don't know how I  feel about (scavenging).\\" More like a battlefield and even so, you're  like the last people on earth. Afraid of a little bad PR? Get your  children, friends, and compatriots anything that helps them survive.  It's not robbing the dead. It's picking something useful up off the  sidewalk. Seriously, I rolled my eyes just hearing her say that.  Dale keeping Andrea's gun because he doesn't feel comfortable with her  having it. What? Is that even his call? You're twice as likely to shoot  it accidentally, true. However, you're hundreds of times more likely to  shoot a zombie since there are millions of them around. This is all  after they've been overrun by zombies twice, first in the woods, now by  a herd. Obviously she needs a gun. As a matter of fact, everyone needs  a weapon, even the kids, at least a knife. How can that not be obvious?  You have two trained policemen with you. Start teaching people weapons  safety.  As opposed to some others I didn't think the CGI blood was overdone,  personally. (Dressing a deer is messy, I assume dead humans are too).  Plus, honestly, sometimes I want to see the gore. The lecture on  suicide was pretty collegiate but still good to hear. Can't even say I  totally disagreed with her. The religion undertones of this episode  weren't too much in your face and they basically fit. Even the three  walkershanging out in church: that's probably where they reanimated  after begging forgiveness, incapable of exiting, they eventually sat  down. Other zombies have been shown sitting in cars, buses, and at  home. Not really that odd.  All in all, I'm enjoying the ride. Way to come out swinging, keep the  punches coming, and then leave it on a massive cliffhanger. Well done.
B00005V0X5|1.0|Sounds like crap muddy and muffeled. The worst part , one of the best songs , these boots is bleeped out.. for legal reasons Dave censored it..It runied the whole thing. I do not reccomend it. Get Youthanasia it kicks ass. I am a huge fan have been since the begining in Calif back in the day.. I bought this when it came out on a cassette in the late 80's and loved it.. really a shame.
B004DTLK62|1.0|To begin with, the 1 star rate is for the seller alone, since this movie is a little masterpiece, yet underrated by many, and IMO Robert Downey Jr.´s best perfomance ever, because I´ve specifically bought the BLU-RAY edition of this film, however, this seller, iNETVIDEO, managed to send me the DVD edition, if it has been a mistake or not, I guess I´ll never know, but I`d like to ask how come someone send you a DVD when you ordered (AND PAID FOR) a Blu Ray? I wonder if the person don´t know the difference between both medias, but the person surely knows that a Blu Ray is most often more expensive than a DVD is, especially when it is a recent release, so, at least is weird, wouldn´t you say? You order a BLU RAY, you pay the price of a BLU RAY, and yet, you get a DVD? Come on? Since this has happened to me, it could well happen to anybody else, so, you´d better watch out, buy at your own risk, as for me, it has been an awful buying experience, so I´d never buy again from, nor will I reccomend this person to anybody else, someone who sends you a dvd when you order and pay for a blu ray can´t be serious, and it´s not worth to be on AMAZON team as well. People have the right to know what one may expect if choose iNETVIDEO over other sellers.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|Read the disclaimer of this book. It is spelled out loud and clear in the second paragraph. They will not even guarantee that the book is even true? I can understand not promising you the same success, but to not even guarantee that the content is even true? This book would be better under the science fiction catagory, at least there they don't even pretend to be true!!!!
B004XIZK5K|4.0|This is a great book to start a kettlebell workout.  It does have lots of fluff, but I consider it a good book.  It is a book that should be read closely there are significant details in the techniques.  The kettlebells offers a cardio and muscular endurance workout.  Tsatsouline also offers good references and instruction on strength workout.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I don't understand why they'd do the UltraViolet digital copy. Part 1 was iTunes digital copy. So now I have 1/2 of this epic movie in my iTunes and not the other. Nice. Pretty much complete fail. I guess its my fault for not reading what \\"UltraViolet Digital Copy\\" was to start with. I won't be buying anymore Blu-rays that have this terrible digital copy scheme. It's not even a \\"Digital Copy\\". You don't receive ANYTHING accept access to stream this movie from UltraViolet's service. Terrible.
1451627289|5.0|This one was really hard to put down.  SK has been on a real winning streak lately with some of the best work of his long career with two excellent collections (JUST AFTER SUNSET, FULL DARK,NO STARS) a terrific novella (BLOCKADE BILLY) and his epic UNDER THE DOME.  11/22/63 is really the icing on the cake.  11/22/63 is one of his most well written novels, ranking right up there with DOLORES CLAIBORNE and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS.  There are plenty of memorable characters and plot twists that King readers have come to expect, but there is something more restrained, mature and subdued about this novel and I think Mr. King's genious has never been more apparent.  If this one dosen't get him a Pulitzer nothing will.  The book really tugs at the heartstrings and, unlike the protaganist of this novel, I had tears in my eyes several times.  It's one of his best and King readers should be pleased.  I know you will have a fun time with all of the clever inside jokes and meeting up with some old friends from the town of Derry.  And do yourself a favor.  Buy the physical book.  This one is worth passing along to your kids someday (something you won't be able to do with a certain to be obsolete electronic book version).
0446585025|5.0|I am such a picky reader. I have started SO many books, but I rarely finish them. Not this one!  It's hilarious!  I have never laughed out loud while reading a book as much as I have with this one!  I haven't read Ellen's other two books yet, but this one is a winner!  Very light and quick read!

1856697525|5.0|From the iconic cover image to the unique illustrated footnotes, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design is a real design treat. Luxuriously paced to give the reader time to enter and enjoy each beautifully printed image. At 1400+ images this could become tiresome and over-saturated but I found it easy to lose myself in each of Bass's designs. Saul's stories and insights are scattered throughout. His voice and his work are presented in a way that would make him proud.

B004ZNACA6|5.0|I agree with many of the other reviews in that the packaging was OK except I would have preferred something more substantial for the CD covers rather than cardboard digi packs.  But, I did by this for the music not the looks, and the music is great.  All CDs were remastered well and produce very good sound.  I would not hesitate to buy this product again.
B000008M54|5.0|I first heard this band from one of my favorite films, Waking Ned Devine and I loved the opening song, Fisherman's Blues and wanted to familiarize myself with this band. Celtic rock aficionados like myself will enjoy this edgy Celtic Rock band. Those who like old country western would find a special appeal in this band as well. My own personal taste does not lean in that direction but the crossover works really well coming from an authentic Irish tradition. I sense the trajectory from traditional Irish music to folky, edgy rock.  I was so sad a nasty thunderstorm cancelled their gig at the 2011 Dublin Irish Music Festival in Dublin, Ohio. I would have loved to hear them perform. My favorites on this CD are Fisherman's Blues, Strange Boat, And a Bang on the Ear and When ye go away. They include their rendition of Woddy Guthrie's This Land is Your Land but with a version written for Ireland. The American folk tradition is definitely something the Waterboys have taken their influence from but they are not afraid to rock. I love these Waterboys.
1427208476|4.0|I did not realize the audio book was 8 CD's long. I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, so I ordered it on CD to listen to while on a trip. It was very good, clear, and easy to listen to. Not a very uplifting story, however.

B004WR125O|3.0|This adapter is small and integrates nicely with my Onkyo 509. Compared side-by-side with my Panasonic Viera Cast adapter, the signal strength on the Onkyo is some what less than on the Panasonic. I guess that can be attributed to the Onkyo's small size. There have been a few times when I have had to reset it because of stalling, but this can be caused by a number of things and can't be attributed directly to the adapter. Overall, I love the small size and it works great as long as you don't have a long distance to your network base station.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is one of the very best mini series I've ever seen. I couldn't wait to see the next installment. Timothy Dalton is the most charismatic Mr. Rochester I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. His performance is passionate and very intense. His acting is award worthy. Zelah Clarke was very impressive and likable as Jane. This version of Jane Eyre is a thorough exploration of the book. A mini series is necessary for something like that. It really can't be done in a two hour movie. I highly recommend this dvd. And if you haven't read the book it will make you want to.<br /><br />Jennifer K.

B003IY48PS|4.0|What more can be said about a classic movie that still keeps me involved in it everytime I watch it, and now that I have it on Blu-ray, it makes the experience even better.  The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star rating is that I don't have the Limited Edition version with the additional bonus features (I hope Amazon get's this version one day).
B003EV6DBM|2.0|I recieved this item with good packaging and in great time but when I opened the product the actual case the movies are in was broken. The disks were still fine but the plastic part that held the discs had disconnected from the movie case itself. Wish it would not have been broken, especially after paying over $50 on the item. It said it was new, I was hoping for perfect condition.
B0007DFJ0G|3.0|Anyone wanting to watch hot guys get worked up wailing on each other should watch the indie thriller BLOODLUST instead. It was made with a low budget, as a tribute to late 70s horror films. It not only has a similar message, it IS the soap. A homeless guy with a digital camcorder made it, and its SO well done its crazy. A lot of the themes are the same in both, but BLOODLUST pulls it off without the help of a major star or studio. It goes for a more SHINING-like atmosphere, so dont expect a thrill ride- but in a lot of ways its way better than this late 90s holdover, which smugly takes on corporate America and slick products by ....well, BEING the thing it hates. Not awful, but very overrated. BLOODLUST, however, is very UNDERrrated and fans of this movie should check it out.
B003Q6D1Z6|4.0|Like the documentary \\"Exit Through the Gift Shop\\", \\"Catfish\\" tends to blur the lines between legitimate documentary filmmaking and embellished reality.  In this case, the trailers tease of something more frightening.  Perhaps something like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".  Brilliant marketing I must say.  Even after reading some reviews when it was released, I was surprised that the film is what it is.  That is, it mostly is a home video of sorts that follows a 24 year old New York artsy type and his Facebook affair with an 8 year old, a 19 year old sister and their 30 something mother that live in the Michigan U.P.<br /><br />The film is shot by Nev's brother Ariel and their best friend Henry.  While in Vail for a job, shooting a live dance show, they become suspicious of the reality of the Facebook friends, including the 19 year old who had become smitten with Nev.  They decide to travel to Michigan to see for themselves.  This is where it gets interesting.  Yeah, I was getting a little squeamish when they decide to look in to a dark farmhouse at 2:30 AM.  Clearly, this was just a set up to spook the audience...and damn if it doesn't work.<br /><br />Ultimately we see what social media has done to us.  The guys have it right.  We have a lonely, talented housewife, not pretty, not educated and not going anywhere.  Instead of getting upset, we and the boys begin to feel sympathy for Angela's plight.  I have to say this is a well done film that is informative and entertaining.
1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs was the October book club pick here at Gin and Rhetoric. The consensus, from the feedback on both the facebook page and, gasp, in real life, was that the book was fantastic. It is a YA title but, like any good YA book, it has lots of appeal outside of the intended audience. In fact everyone that I know that has read it is over 25, with the exception of my niece, who is 12.<br />The story revolves around sixteen-year-old Jacob. Jacob was very close with his grandfather when he was little. His grandfather would tell him amazing stories of battling monsters and of the fantastic children he knew in his youth. Children that had very special (think X-Men-type) gifts. As Jacob got older, he began to realize the stories that his grandfather told him couldn't be anything more than fairytales made up to intrigue and frighten him. But, when his grandfather is brutally murdered, Jacob begins to believe that the stories he had been told in his youth were true. Thus, Jacob sets off on a mission to discover who his grandfather really was<br />In Miss Peregrine's Ransom Riggs sets up what is sure to be an amazing series. The story takes place both in the past and in the present, and the transitions between World War II and present day Wales are crafted seamlessly. The characters and the plot are strong and well developed. The genuinely unique thing about this book, and I'm pretty sure that most people would agree with me on this, is Riggs' use of photographs.<br />Ransom Riggs has been a collector of vintage photographs for some time, he wrote a little piece for the Huff Post about his collection that includes a sampling of some of the amazing photos he used in the book. The selections from his collection that were used in the book are phenomenal, I found that they really gave me pause, even outside of the context of the book. You can't help but think \\"what's the deal with that picture? How did it come to be taken, and who were those people?\\" That is definitely not to say that they detract, or distract the reader from the story. They don't at all. My musings took place after I was finished the story and was flipping back through the photos.<br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a great story on its own, but that story is fortified and made even more compelling through Riggs' effective use of photographs. The one thing about the story that drove me crazy was the ending. Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler. It's just that the book ends as an obvious set up for the next book in the series, so as a reader you're left dying to know what happens next. I guess that's not so much a complaint as it is a compliment. I absolutely cannot wait for the next book to come out, even though I'm sure it's going to be a while.se people?\\" That is definitely not to say that they detract, or distract the reader from the story.

B004LROUNG|4.0|I just got out of law school and this book provided a real life perspective of what I do not want to become. I enjoyed reading the book, it was very funny and real. Lots of twist and turns to arrive at the a happy ending which I was rooting for. However, at some point I did not know what to expect. Excellent book for baby lawyers. Buying up another ..JG book for sure
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have only seen and had the 1rst film on DVD and was not impressed with the extras on that DVD but really enjoyed the film. This set is perfect for me as I am not interested in the special features or any other things that may come next year in another set. For $6.00 a film this will work for me personally so I can see the other films in the series and then have them for my younger children later on. Great price on this set and very happy to have purchased it-

B0055PMJMW|1.0|I wish there had been reviews of this \\"book\\" before I pre-ordered it.  I usually love the Harry Bosch Stories.  But this book was awful.  The stories were way to short.  You just get into the story idea and then it ends.

B000A6EXNO|3.0|I ordered the DK-22 Eyepiece Adapter and this for my Nikon D7000. I received both at the same time and tried installing onto the camera to find that the eye cup does not fit on the adapter. I thought I lost a piece but it turns out that neither the DK-22 or the DK-19 come with the adapter screw. Which really pisses me off. I just ended up gluing the eye cup to the adapter with gorilla glue and it works fine.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I did not realize how much my stereo missed Amy Lee until I bought this album. Today, American radio is 24 hours of auto-harmonized morons who can't carry a tune. How marvelous to hear a real voice singing her heart out to some great heavy metal songs. With a crackerjack band backing up Amy's angelic vocals, Evanescence has never sounded better.  The DVD is a great treat to see them making the initial music video from the album. There are a lot of potential hits on this album, great tracks through the very end. Although I listened through this disc on my computer, nothing beats hearing this CD while driving in your car. As Amy says in the opening track, Hello Hello!
0525423656|4.0|I was eager to see how Ally Condie would move the tales of Cassie, Ky, and Xander forward from where we left off with \\"Matched\\". Fully aware that it was to be a trio of books, I understood that \\"Matched\\" was the set-up piece and allowed myself to become familiar with the characters in a fairly straight forward plot-line hoping they'd be \\"tortured\\" in the following segments of their stories. I'm happy to say that Ms. Condie has not disappointed here. She adds more depth to their struggles, creates solid tension between the characters we know and the new ones we meet, and supplies the reader with some unexpected twists. I think she also deals with the stress that love between two people creates in a realistic manner (the axiom - you always hurt the one you love - comes to mind here); she doesn't filter the tale through rose-colored glasses. While the overall weight of the writing isn't as heavy as a series like \\"Hunger Games\\", I am definitely on board for the final installment - hopefully sooner than later.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun game, it is easily worth the money. Challenging and runs very smoothly! Try it out and support the devs!
B0059F7I24|5.0|I think Trivium have honed their style.  The near constant screaming of their older records got old and the melodies were not as hooky (in my humble opinion).  The Crusade was a turning point for them.  I dug it, but the Shogun was a nice balance between the trademark melodic singing and screaming that continues on in this record.  The vocal melodies have really been refined.  They lost an amazing drummer along the way, but the new guy fills the shoes.  I might not have noticed if I didn't know about Travis's departure, but there is definately a different groove to the new drummer.  He also throws in some blast beats, but it is not obnoxiously prolonged like it is with black metal.  The dualing solos are as awesome as ever and that is the best thing about this band.  You will always get sweet guitar riffs and solos.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Florence emerged as one of the most interesting new acts in a long time, and Lungs was an extraordinary debut album.  Ceremonials, her second, is even better.  She has developed a consistent sound that may seem repetitive at times, but is never anything but thoroughly engaging.  This record has a HUGE sound.  It's like Phil Spector in Africa meets Kate Bush's The Dreaming.  Very similar to her approach on Lungs, of course, but Ceremonials is tighter and the arrangements are more haunting.  You are sucked in right from the first track, \\"Only If for a Night\\", and Florence never lets up, enveloping you with her alternately sweet, sad, scary, and inspiring music for the entire album.  My favorite tracks were \\"Breaking Down\\" (instantly my all-time favorite Florence song), \\"Shake It Out\\" (which I believe has the potential to be a #1 U.S. hit), \\"Lover to Lover\\", \\"Spectrum\\", and \\"Leave My Body\\".  The last six tracks suffer just a little bit compared to the excellent first six, but I really don't think Florence could have done any better with this album.  It's stunning.  Even the deluxe edition bonus tracks are essential - one wonders why the intoxicating and erotic \\"Bedroom Hymns\\" didn't officially make the cut.  Lungs was a great record, but the songs didn't grab me quite as much as these ones do.  EDIT:  I must clarify my opinion of Florence.  The thing is, I'm not crazy about her voice.  She has one of those deep wails that always sounds like she's trying too hard.  The reason I love this album so much - and the reason some people don't - is her willingness to go for bombast; to be positively theatrical with the music and the drums and the strings and the soaring choruses.  Her voice isn't what I find addictive about the record (though I do like her performances) so I don't mind that the instruments cover it up a bit.  I guess that's why I think Lungs is a lesser album than Ceremonials overall.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|First things first I'm really sick of people who review ablums after listening to them once or twice.  Judging an album after one or two listens is just not a valued opinion from my stand point. That being said for those who rated this ablum poorly. My first couple listens where not bliss to my ears. I too thought what is this ??? but its funny. Just like ENDGAME or any other metal album that is fast paced you can't just soak it all in with a couple listens. I found myself skipping between tracks at first. But after I gave it about 20-30 listens which is my standard to review an album this album not only beats ENGAME but it just may be in their top 3 albums ever !! Behind.......... well you already know.    As for the idea of completing demos to add to perhaps get the track total up to Thirteen to correspond with the title I read into the reviews. I thought well thats not cool at all they need to finish demos to add to the album. However I do own the YOUTHANASIA but I never dug into those demos becuase I was not a big fan of that particular album (sorry fellow Deth heads). But after listening to the new finished songs they stand out as some of the best on the album I also went back and listened to the demos to compare and contrast. The demos of course sounded a bit more raw on the guitar which was a grimmier sound but the finished tracks compositions far exceed the demos.   1. SUDDEN DEATH _______ Well I have never played the guitar hero game with this song on it. It sounds as though they tried to make it a tough song with all of the solos. This is a slightly above average song not their best opening song but still good nontheless.  2. PUBLIC ENEMY NO.1 ________ Very radio friendly nice fast pace with blistering solos to enter the track sounds like it would belong as one of the better songs off ENDGAME.  3. WHO'S LIFE (IS IT ANYWAYS?)___________ Dave's got a different temp to his voice on this track it comes off as sounding like his earlier work perhaps a bit immature like something off of SFSGSW which with the lyrics match perfectly, one of my personal favorites. Dave's basically asking his cridicts to get off his A$$  4. WE THE PEOPLE ________ Might be my favorite off the album, nice military drum in the begining, this is what makes Megadeth top notch they have the gonads to say what we all think about our country \\"In greed we trust\\", \\"Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves, the land of liberty needs a regime change\\" I mean C'mon if you cant dig those lycs then go listen to some meaningless dribble Lacuna Coil or some crap like that.   5. GUNS, DRUGS & MONEY _______ Some sort of story about ... well you guessed it guns drugs and money in mexico the ending has some nice little mexican music which sounds kinda cool too add. This song took a little to get use to but is quite nice now.   6. NEVER DEAD ___________ A lot of people dig this track and there's good reason to the intro is a nice slow paced drum and erie guitar distortion which then picks up into unleashing pure evilish hell of guitar riffs coming right at you. The riff sounds a bit recylced from ENDGAME's \\"This day we fight\\" but other than that the two songs are def. different in their own senses.  7. NEW WORLD ORDER ____________ One of the completed demos off of the remastered YOUTHANASIA this was one of the songs that I liked from the get go. Nice back up Vocals sounds almost like some early Overkill.  8. FAST LANE ______________ Well some people stated they are sick of hearing about Dave wanting to go fast... I agreed to a bit until I heard this song a bit more. The lyrics can be a bit tacky but again this is what gives the late 80's early 90's feel to this song. It is well..... very fast paced, its a great song to drive to, it reminds me of 502 a lot more than ENDGAMES 1,320 did.  9. BLACK SWAN ____________ Another favorite this was I believe tied with UNITED ABOMINATIONS album in some way or another I never heard it before this album however the opening is a blistering solo a la KILLING IS MY BUSINESS.... This song WILL get stuck in your head gaurenteed.  10. WRECKER __________ Some say there may be some lyrical ties to things other than the direct lyrics themselves however this is the only song that I sometimes skip. It just doesn't really do it for me but 12/13 isn't bad.  11. MILLINNIUM OF THE BLIND ____________ the introduction differs a lot from the demo. Where as the demo intro is now at the end of this track. Again this is one of the strong songs off the album. It sounds almost like a Megadeth anthem. The guitar work off this track is pure bliss.  12. DEADLY NIGHTSHADE ___________ The only track the Ellefson really shines on this is another fan favorite already and may be used during touring to give Ellefson some shine time. There is a brief bass solo section a la \\"Peace Sells\\" but obviously not a strong a song or strong a bass groove.   13. 13____________________ A nice erie sound to this track sounds like it could have been off COUNTDOWN... One of the best songs off this album.    For those discussing the album artwork and cover ! Vic with his back turned on the cover ? His funeral and death inside the insert pages ? What does it all mean you ask ? Some say that this is the end of Megadeth but a note this was their last album under their Road Runner contract. If anything this is Vic and Megadeth saying goodbye to Road Runner haha.     This is one of the Megadeth albums that you should defeintly not skip. It just may be in their top 3 being very close to Peace Sells and SFSGSW. Well I can at least say it is on par with those albums at the very least.     If you are new to Megadeth or good metal this would not be a bad album to start with but I would'nt recommend to start with it. However if you are looking for post YOUTHANASIA albums this is the cream of the crop. I never thought after listening to it during early listens it could touch ENDGAME but it pulls slightly ahead of ENDGAME in the END.   Thank you and Cheers everyone
B004UBM4TA|3.0|Grossly over-priced for this 40+ minute movie, but enjoyable, although maybe a little boring. I questioned the native 3D camera, let alone an IMAX camera, in such a tight and small space, but the effects were pretty cool however they achieved them.   The best part for me were the titles, which would burst into stars that appeared to float all around the room.   There are a couple of special feature clips, in 2D, but haven't checked them out yet.   Nice watch, but wish I hadn't actually purchased it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thought this book was delightful and a pleasant break from heavy reading... the only thing I did not like was not getting a good view of the pictures and letters that were in the book on my Kindle.  I thought it was also interesting that it starts out in Englewood,Florida where I reside in the winter.  I'm anxious for the next adventure and I really hope he writes one! I'm 65 years old and still love reading this stuff....keeps my mind young : - )

B0058VA2U4|5.0|I became an Anthrax fan during the release of State of Euphoria when I was 14.  A couple short years later Joey split and it was never the same again for me.  Actually, I think they should've changed their name during the John Bush years.  Not that that stuff was bad, but it was kinda similar the thing with Van Halen and Sammy Hagar, not the same thing.  With a different singer it was like \\"Can I still believe that this is Antrax?\\"  The answer was no.  Anyway, I was psyched to hear Joey again.  I was also used to Dan Spitz handling the leads, but that is a minor point in comparison.  Rob pulls it off.  If Scott left, you can straight up just forget it.  Anyway, I checked out the new stuff excited, but with some reserve.  Now I have to say it is friggin awesome.  This album is really heavy and has with great sound production.  All the elements are there to create the Antrax energy.  Charlie was always a great drummer, but on this one he pulls no punches.  Scott Ian, the foundation of Anthrax, is as solid as ever.  Joey sounds just as good, and even singers lower on some songs, unless that is a guest vocalist, but I don't think so.  Nonetheless, it rocks.  The real test for me is if a band makes it into my car CD rotation-I have only 6 spots for my current favorites.  The question is: Do I like it enough to burn it and put it in my car CD changer so I can hear it almost every day?  The answer is yes. And they won't be switched out for a long time.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I really loved this movie. It felt like I knew each character as well as I know my own friends. I think this is a movie worthy of Academy Awards. I laughed and cried and was completely taken in by this story! I have seen it 3 times and will purchase a DVD.

B00004R7X5|2.0|Though to this day I consider Karajan to be unsurpassed as a conductor, this is one of the few of his recordings than can be avoided.  As others have pointed out, the strings are particularly in Scheherazade polished but in the overall I get the feeling that the ensemble was not able to get their usual synergy. It sounds as little pieces of music put together one after another instead of a whole work.  For Scheherazade I seriously recommend trying Gergiev's, Reiner's, Mackerras's or Kondrashin's. As for the 1812, again, not bad but far from being the best around.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Green Lantern is a recipe how not to make a superhero movie. There are so  many things wrong with it that it's difficult to know where to start. I am a comic book geek - I even enjoyed the Fantastic Four Movies and I appreciate on most levels they are pretty bad!  Ok ...Green Lantern  Ryan Reynolds give it his best shot as Hal Jordan but he is miscast. As many people  say he would be far better as The Wally West version of The Flash. His character comes across as whiny and weak and there's no sense of wonder in the character. Hal Jordan discovers there are a multitude of alien species in the Universe and there is an intergalactic peacekeeping core that he has been chosen to be a member of. All he does after is whine about not being worthy. Frankly I agree with him.  This is not the actors fault - the script is terrible.   The two main villains are ridiculous. Hector Hammond is just a nothing character with some very uninteresting back story. Parralax is just a big CGI Cloud.   Having some of the Green Lantern characters voiced by famous actors just takes you out of the illusion that they are real characters. Mark Strong is the best thing in the movie.   This is a film that was obviously made by committee ( more than most) and none of the elements come together. It never even comes close to potential in Green Lantern comics.   Marvels Thor Movie was far more successful and overcame the same problem green lantern fails to do - having to introduce an alien world, having a rather ridiculous main character and maintaining some sense of a relationship between Earth and the alien world.   Warner should rewatch this film every time they are considering making a superhero movie so they can remember what   not to do. This is a massive failure of a film.  Chances of a sequel? Zero.   Ok on the plus side the blu ray looks and sounds great.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|As aggressive as ever with the trademark hooks to take you on a sonic rollercoaster ride.  Perhaps the best yet, hard to say since all their albums rock.  Don't agree with their political message, but whatever. At least the subject matter on the other tracks don't make me roll my eyes.
B000002UCN|5.0|After seeing the Martin Scorcese show about George Harrison, I wanted to hear more.  This CD captures both the old and newer Harrison and ever track is great.  I would recommend.
B005DKLPQ0|1.0|The \\"Vinyl Replica\\" sleeves, as Rhino refers to them, look great, however, the printed lyrics/credits are so small that they are basically impossible to read. It would have made a lot of sense for Rhino to include a separate lyric/credit booklet so those without magnifying glasses could read the lyrics. (The one star rating has nothing to do with the amazing music!)
B004LWZW4C|4.0|The film is great, some might say the best in the series. Great action and direction, the actors did pretty good jobs in their portrayals of these somewhat under the radar X men characters. The biggest problem with the movie is I can't for the life of me figure out if  it's a prequel or a reboot!!! I'm not putting any spoilers in here for those who haven't seen the movie. But for fans who've seen every X men movie to date you'll see what I mean. I just wish that this was the first EVER X men film and thus subsequently the series could've go on from here. But alas not so. Still a very enjoyable film in which you guys know will recieve it's much deserved sequels. As far as blue ray/dvd features and such, not too many to speak of besides the customary behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes (one in particular is hilarious), etc. Must buy for X men fans and action movie buffs.

B005MVJM3I|5.0|I was a Machine Head fan when The Burning Red came out.  But that album was put out during the \\"nu metal\\" era of metal and lacked guitar solos thanks to the impact of grunge on the music industry. They mostly dropped off my radar thereafter, but since The Blackening, MH has gone from a once-in-a-while mood changer to heavy rotation in my car.  Compared to The Blackening, this new album does not diasappoint.  It has all the complexity with multiple parts, neoclassical solos, intricate drums, and long epic songs.  Skill-wise MH continues to hang with the big boys.  I don't even listen to their earlier stuff these days because the real MH continues to rock on. The version of Unto the Locusts I have has a nice Judas Priest cover \\"The Sentinel.\\" It's a headbanging good time for diehard metalheads.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am an avid David Baldacci reader and this was my first on my new Kindle.  The Camel Club are by far my favorites but this kept me glued to the screen, much to my wife's dismay, until the end.  The writing was brilliant as usual and had me guessing, incorrectly as I always do in his thrillers.  I have yet to start Lee Child but my son, who got me hooked on the Deaver-Lincoln Rhyme novels has intoduced me to Lee Child-Jack Reacher so I will reserve judgement on any copycat plots until after I read those.  Nevertheless, this was an excellent read and as usual gets me hyped for his next novel.
B005AUWY90|4.0|Walt Disney's childhood idyll of a farm family life is the stuff of legend and has influenced many a Disney film and theme park. I can also be said that John Lasseter's childhood of road trips in the southwest, small towns that no longer exist due to superhighways and a love of automobiles is directly attached to what is now two Cars movies.<br /><br />Most critics have been less than kind regarding Disney*Pixar's Cars 2, but the public is clearly honing in on Lasseter's wavelength and responding with enthusiasm (and strong summer box office and huge DVD sales) for the sequel especially for Mater, who takes center stage in this family-friendly spy thriller.<br /><br />In the -- THANK YOU!! -- audio commentary, Lasseter and co-director Brad Lewis offer lots of cool factoids as well as their reasoning behind the creative decisions.<br /><br />Lasseter says, \\"When we do a sequel, it's not just to retread the same emotional story that the original is. We want to find something new and something different.\\" Little of the movie takes place in Radiator Springs, but rather in colorful, exciting international locales that offer the Pixar artists a chance to dazzle with truly breathtaking aerial views and meticulous details, which I find most enjoyable in high-def Blu-ray (3-D is nice, but you lose some clarlty and I'd rather revel in the details).<br /><br />Lasseter also mentions that the story for Cars 2 sprang from a scene in the first film in which Lightning and Sally (who is not given enough to do in the sequel) see a spy thriller at a drive-in. He loved spy movies as a kid, particularly likes the Bourne series and<br />bourne movies and believes that Cars 2 isn't a spy movie spoof so much as a solid story that can stand on its own.<br /><br />I personally found Cars 2 to be a throwback to the spy shows and films that I grew up with, like The Avengers, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Secret Agent and even Get Smart. These were all somewhat comedic as well as thrilling (especially Smart of course) -- but of all the spy genre films, Cars 2 reminded me most of one of my favorites theatrical features, Hanna-Barbera's The Man Called Flintstone.<br /><br />My I favor you with a parody of the unforgettable theme to this epic adventure, with special Cars 2 lyrics?<br /><br />THE TRUCK CALLED MATER<br /><br />Who do they call<br />When gears are startin' to fall<br />When all the oil is spillin'<br />And synth fuels beginnin' to brew?<br />The truck called Mater, that's who-oo-oo-oo!<br /><br />Who's always there,<br />There to shoot and fly through the air<br />Who defeats Pacers and Gremlins<br />And all those cars we disliked too?<br />The truck called Mater, that's who-oo-oo-oo!<br /><br />He screams after eating wasabi<br />Down to the lobby<br />To learn the charms<br />Of the Japanese joh-onnns!<br /><br />Who is the truck<br />Who succeeds with mostly dumb luck<br />While his pal Lightning is winning<br />Who's spinning the crooks like fan belts?<br />The truck called Mater!<br />Who else, who else, who ELLLLLse!!<br /><br />One final note on Cars 2 -- I drove a Gremlin in college and was hysterical with laughter that it and the Pacer were held is such comical \\"esteem\\" in Cars 2.

B004G606K8|5.0|I read this series way way way back.  Before Nintendo and WoW we used our imaginations (e-mag-en-a-shuns)and books.  This series is, in my opinion, one of the best ever written.  Now it is the reason I finally bought a Kindle.  My paperback versions are yellowing and will soon become dreadfully brittle.  But the Kindle versions will stay forever.
B000001ELD|5.0|I'll be brief. Gene Simmons! KISS! Fire breathing, blood drooling, face painted rock and roll! Well, that was the first impression I had way back in the 1970's. This was one of four separate solo releases the guys from KISS had done back in the late 1970's. Having heard all four, Gene's is the best. He does the typical hard rock stuff, but also some  really nice ballads. I ESPECIALLY like his straight forward cover of \\"WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR\\".
B003QCNFN8|2.0|This album is not that good. The songs are medicore, average at best.  I listened to it maybe 5 times before I shelved it.  I ran it by my brother, a fellow Ozzy fan and he felt the same way.  It just lacked energy.  It isn't because of the departure of Zakk, Gus is awesome and more than capable.  It is the same mistake as what Ozzy did with Down to Earth.  Down to Earth was written by various different artists, most which were not metal players, without Zakk.  Then Zakk came in and had to metalize the tracks and essentially try to whip them into descent shape. The product was predictably mediocre.    In this case Ozzy again wrote the songs without Zakk.  Many of the songs were written in collaboration with the producer he was working with at the time. Then he split with Zakk.  The problem was that Zakk was fired (though that was a mistake in my opinion), but not starting from scratch when he brought in Gus.  Gus had to take the songs and do the same thing Zakk did with Down to Earth.  You simply can't take a pile of crap, give it to a talented artist, and expect him to turn it into gold. Ozzy always has a good ear for talent, but he has to trust them to deliver the goods.  I hope he gives Gus the freedom to ACTUALLY WRITE THE SONGS in the studio next time.  Then we might hear genius.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Will you figure that out this time Ozzy?
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|Please remember, anything that has Ultraviolet = Streaming.  True portability without an Internet connection won't work.  Guess it is back to the old time method of ripping (non-US of course).  I would agree, that this is another way for the studios to make you buy multiple copies depending on your use.  Please do not believe the studios hype about Ultraviolet, you will be disappointed.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|UPDATED with a correction and an acknowledgment:   Correction: As many others have noted, while WB/UV/Flixter did a much-less-than-stellar job explaining it (as subsequent how-to explanations and videos attest), you can download a movie from Ultraviolet for offline viewing.  You just have to install 3 different applications (two on your computer, one on your i-device), and create 2 new user accounts along the way. Oh, and the downloads take forever (mine took something like 15 minutes just to start!).  But, ultimately, you can get a download to your computer, and presumably--I haven't tried--get it to a handheld or tablet for watching offline.  Of course, this means you'll have movies outside your primary collection; but, that's WB's goal. (And yes, I know WB/UV/Flixster wants you to import all your videos into their system).  Having made this correction, I should also raise another issue embedded in the \\"fine print\\" of the WB/UV/Flixster mess: you only own the digital download as long as you keep your account.  So, after all the trouble of downloading \\"your\\" digital copy, it turns out it's not really your copy at all!  It's really more like a long-term license for only so long as you keep the service; cancel your account, bye-bye movie.    Acknowledgment: WB/UV/Flixster has been issuing iTunes codes to download the movie from Apple.  Ironic?  Yep.  See many other reviews for the how-to-do-it, but in short, file a complaint with Flixster.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: HP7.2 is, of course, fantastic; it deserves everything good said about it.  Ultraviolet, however, is vomitously bad.  I'm actually not just annoyed, I'm angry at this ill-conceived, consumer-hostile sham, packaged as a \\"digital copy\\".  I'm amazed at what a crappy bait and switch Warner Bros perpetrated on us after the previous editions had the expected personal download (i.e., that you could actually put into iTunes or whatever viewer you like).  If I could return the opened movie, I would in half a heart-beat.  As other reviews note, Ultraviolet is not a download--it's a service that streams the movie to your device. I can't begin to tell you how annoying that is for so many reasons.  Of course, the most obvious: how, precisely, can I watch this on a plane, or anywhere else where bandwidth is bad or missing?  In other words, how exactly can I use the digital copy in any setting where I'd actually WANT to use it?  If you want the Blu-ray version it, just buy that version without the download; if you primarily want the download, head to iTunes or somewhere else.  Other reviewers are saying the UK version will have an actual download.  Whatever route you go, just DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION if you expect your own download.  Warner Brothers, poor form!
B000SEGCRS|5.0|People say I \\"have an eye\\".  So, I took a photography class and tried to figure out the meaning of things I should know about my camera such as aperture, depth of field, shutter speed, etc.  Though having an \\"eye\\" I am yet born with no talent to be technical.  I blew out good shots by playing with aperture.  I was confused and didn't get the concepts.  Scott Kelby's book has brought me back to right action between my brain and camera-- to find the scene and then \\"do this...!!\\"  Thank you so much Scott Kelby.  I have given my book to my camera buddy at work and now I'm going to buy myself the boxed set.
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|Dear Steven,  Thanks for recommending Restless.  I did find it compelling storytelling and will recommend it.  Nevertheless, I ended up feeling annoyed with the author for a number of really pointless and avoidable flaws and literary pretensions.  If I didn't like it so much, the flaws would not annoy me so.  So I'll refrain from summarizing the good aspects of the book (which I'm sure you see) and get the ennui off my chest.  The book has or course 2 parallel stories alternating by chapter: First of a daughter in the 1970's alternating with a story of her mother beginning in the 1939.  The book begins with a male author (Boyd) telling the story of daughter in the first person.  Her elderly mother hands her secret memoir (of her life as a spy) to the daughter at the end of the first chapter.  The second chapter begins with the telling of the story in the memoir.  Although the memoir is presumably written by the mother in the first person, the chapters telling her story are instead told by the Boyd in the third person. Why?  The Daughter chapters all have titles presumably indicative of their content.  (But they aren't: Often they instead refer to something mentioned only in the last paragraph of the chapter.)  The Mother chapters all have the same unhelpful title: \\"The Story of Eva Delectorskaya\\".  Although the switching back and forth in time at the end of each chapter goes smoothly enough, Boyd also insists on playing pointless time games within the chapters:  Several chapters start in the middle and then track back to explain what happened since the end of the chapter 2 chapters ago.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Overall the Mother's story is the heart of the book.  The Daughter's story does serve the important role of driving home the theme of how little we may know the people closest to us.  But beyond that the daughter's story is littered with irrelevant subplots (her nasty room mates who might be terrorists, the student who might be an Iranian revolutionary who wantsto marry her) which the reader expects might be relevant to the overall novel but turn out to be pointless and gratuitous distractions.  What amazes about the mother is how careful and thorough she has been trained to be.  She has kept herself hidden away and incognito for 30 years to avoid being tracked down and killed.  But now she does something completely out of character: She wants to find her nemesis.  She could do it herself.  But no.  For no conceivable reason, she involves her daughter in the hunt, using her real name, needlessly endangering the daughter's life and perhaps the life of her young son.  There is no reason for this other than the author's need perhaps to somehow tie the two stories together at the end.  Lastly, the villain also does something completely out of character:  Does his devious mind try to find a way to eliminate his enemies (the mother, daughter, the history professor) as he has done successfully so many times before?  No. He obligingly commits suicide. Huh?  All fiction requires the reader to suspend disbelief.  All fiction authors have to make thousands of choices from an infinite set of possibilities.  Great authors tell their stories so smoothly that they appear to be true.  The stories \\"have to\\" unfold the way they do because that's what \\"happened\\".  The authors hide their arbitrary choices so skillfully that the story \\"rings true\\".  But if they don't hide their choices well (or they shove them in my face to show me how clever they are), I waste too much time thinking: \\"Why is the author doing this??.  Then I get annoyed.

B000O8OTNC|1.0|This is my new review from four stars down to one.  I used the hell out of this and yeah if your blade is totally dull you'll get a lame edge on it.  But it does not sharpen no matter whether your pushing and pulling hard or just sliding the blade lightyly.  I don't see how anyone can say this thing works.  I've tried swiss knives, pocket knives, boot knives, kitchen knives and nothing,  You will never cut paper or even close with this joke item.  I finally spent the bucks and bought a work shop knife sharpener.  Now my blades on everything are dangerously sharp.  Especially fine edge kitchen knives, their so thin to start with they come out deadly.  Every knife I have now cuts paper like butter and I used my smith and wesson boot knife to open a box the other day and was like wow it ate up the job, then I felt it and was like oh yeah, forgot I did such a good job on this really hard to sharpen knife, double edge and thick blade.  You can buy this but if your like me and a honing stone doesn't work for you either then this is the same, just a lot of work and no or barely any results, when three minutes with the work shop and your done.  I use medium belt and don't even need the fine belt half the time, medium belt is good enough to impress my needs.

B005O30Y5Y|1.0|Like others I am really dissatisfied that this disc shipped with the Ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\".  When I pre-ordered, this wasn't specified, so I assumed it would be an iTunes download (like HP7 part 1).  I don't have any interest in multiplying the number of incompatible video files, copy protections, and media players on my system, so the \\"digital copy\\" isn't any use to me.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Once again Megadeth proves they are the big dogs of thrash metal.  Great songs, solid lyrics, great structure and just awesome riffs as only Mustaine can provide.  Listen to this album and Lulu (from the loutallica site of course don't waste money on it) and see why yet again Megadeth rules.  Solid album and a pleasure to listen too. \m/\m/ Hail Megadeth!
B005SYLKT8|2.0|People dont get me wrong I love her work but a lot has changed since her first few recordings. I almost cant listen to her anymore because I feel depressed & sad. Meshell if U read these reviews @ all, Im tired of feeling sad. I wanna dance and have fun again & I miss the grooves & the the happy feeling I used to get when I heard your music. Theres enough sadness in the world I dont need to buy a whole CD full of it.
B000002KNY|4.0|...this is an album by a band called Talking Heads, who were one of the main groups involved in New Wave music in the 70's and 80's. I only vaguely knew of this band, at the time of buying this CD. I mostly just thought that it had the coolest sounding title of anything...ever. The CD not the band. Anyways, the title is a perfect representation of what themes run through this album. Life and fear. Fear of everything that exists to the average person. Fear of the question and the answer. Fear of war. Fear of people. FEAR OF MODERN MUSIC ITSELF, I MEAN COME ON, TALK ABOUT MESSED UP! This is just weird and awesome. If you are a fan of this group or, of a group called Joy Division, you will highly appreciate this CD for what it is: Chaos under control. NEW WAVE 4 LIFE!!!
1451627289|5.0|I first read about this book a few months ago.  While I am a fan of Stephen King, I'm not a huge fan.  I don't typically buy his books the day they are released, but when I read the premise for this one I just thought that it was a really neat idea and I couldn't wait for it to be released so that I could read it.  Then I got a little nervous about it.  From the time I read the teaser I thought that there were so many interesting directions that someone could take this story, but what if it tanks?  That's always the pitfall of a really neat idea...  what if it fails to really bloom like you think it could?  But this is Stephen King.  For my review, I'd like to establish that I was born almost 7 years after JFK died.  I am not a JFK scholar and I did not read this book trying to hyper-analyze the historical accuracy of the book.  I took it as a fictional exploration of a historical event produced not to answer any historical questions but just to entertain and provoke thought.  I feel it was very successful on both points.  My fears that Stephen King was going to take a great idea and go nowhere with it were definitely unfounded.  He also works in all his usual Stephen King \\"givens\\"...  the story starts in Maine.  We even get to \\"visit\\" a couple of characters from other Stephen King books and the town of Derry, though the majority of the book is set in Texas of course.  On the whole I usually review books based on how well spent I feel my time was in reading it and I am in no way disappointed in this one.  If you buy the book I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and thank you for taking the time to read my review.

0385535139|5.0|The first 100 pages of this book will keep you in stitches - lap-slapping, \\"hee-haw,\\" tears-streaming stuff.  Then comes the head-scratcher, like a blues tune suddenly turned operatic the thing morphs into dead-pan, with stitches and hee-haw interspersed just enough to yo-yo you along for the entire ride.  When it comes to courtroom biz and lawyers doing lawyer stuff, Grisham is without rivals.  Fantastic book!
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Perhaps you've noticed that this set has received an exorbitant amount of fame, with many reviewers pointing to this as the definitive set of the Bruckner symphonies.  Karajan, we're told, has worked wonders with his Berliners, making for an amazing musical experience.<br /><br />But I want you to know that this is a terrible set to acquire if you want your Bruckner to be a pleasantry.  Perhaps you want to hear the composer interpreted in a matter-of-fact way, eschewing anything that would threaten to grip you or move you too deeply.  Karajan cares nothing for the relaxation of his listeners, and he seems to pride himself in his monumental approach to the symphonies.  He is taking us to grand heights, soaring above the practicality of life.  For this reason, it wouldn't make good background music.  It would be too disturbing and moving to listen to this music without giving it your full attention.<br /><br />Maybe I've scared you away, but I hope and think not.  Who ever said that the chief concern in Bruckner is pleasantness?  Karajan refuses to let himself be constrained, and his vision in these symphonies is staggering.  He is a magnificent master of building the music, preparing us for the impassioned climactic moments without letting go too soon.  It would be easy to get lost in the vast scope of things, resulting in chaos.  But with Karajan on the podium, never fear.  He has a strong grip over his orchestra and everything is done with control, yet vitality is still present.  This is not impersonal Bruckner; this is simply Bruckner that is speaking of things that aren't in our reach.  The music transports us out of this world, into the skies, if not into heaven itself.<br /><br />This is what gives this set its almost mysterious nature.  Penning a review of this set is no easy task, simply because this is the kind of music that I find to be almost sacred, making it difficult to jot my thoughts down on paper.  I'll simply say that it has been a rewarding experience for me to listen to this music, leaving me inspired on every page.<br /><br /> If you're wondering if I think Karajan's way with Bruckner is the only way, I'll be quick to say no.  There are certainly other ways one could look at these symphonies, perhaps in a less bombastic way that would spend more time delving into the intricacies of the individual moments.  But I don't think anyone is ever going to give us Bruckner that will make us forget Karajan, so glorious is his vision.  I don't hesitate to recommend this to all music lovers alike--unless you are wary of the unearthly, of course.usic, leaving me inspired on every page.

B0026NWBY2|5.0|As probably a good many people did....  I watched the George Harrison documentary on HBO a few weeks back.  I decided that I wanted a cd of his stuff... so I hit amazon.  Let it Roll had all the songs I knew I liked by Harrison and a few songs I liked that I hadn't even realized were Harrison along with a few more that I feel will probably grow on me.  This is (and I know in these days of iPod's etc...) an album that you can play all the way through and probably not feel like skipping a single song.  If you buy it I hope you enjoy and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
B0053B347M|4.0|My Dell 2412M is one foot from a light yellow wall and these lights work great. An added bonus with this particular monitor is that it has 2 USB outlets on the back. I used one for these lights, so less cables on my desk and the lights turn off when the monitor turns off (makes sense!). I like the little halo behind my monitor, especially at night.  The quality doesn't seem to be the greatest, but the LEDs work so far. Instead of using the built-in sticky tape (which would probably leave some unsightly marks on my monitor after a while), I simply used two little pieces of painter's tape which works just as well.
B000086EOE|5.0|I felt I had to chime in here, given all of the \\"4 Star\\" ratings I see that SOUND as though they should be 5 Stars. Man, you guys are tough with stars!<br /><br />Except for the die hard EARLY Genesis fans, Steve Hackett is probably almost totally unknown. Even during his time with Genesis, I don't think he got the credit he deserved for his guitar work - truly a virtuoso player with a unique and original style, yet understated. A lot of his playing back then was almost subliminal. Maybe why he didn't get the notoriety he rightfully deserved? I can't think of any other guitarist, along with Alan Holdsworth, who have this much talent, and yet remain relatively unknown for the most part, even by other guitarists.<br /><br />As for this CD - I originally bought this CD back in the mid 90's while I was looking for one of Hackett's classical CDs (Midsummer Night's Dream also a phenom disc - pick it up when you have the chance). I looked at this track listing and saw that he was basically offering re-worked, re-recorded versions of some of the great old Genesis music. This immediately struck a chord with me but for no other reason then just to answer a question that I've been asking myself for the past 25 or so years - when I listen to many of my old great favorite albums of the 60s and 70s (particularly the Prog/Art Rock ones) I find myself always wondering what these recordings would sound like if done today, in our modern recording studios. Well Steve has gone ahead and answered that question for me, at least as far as a few of Genesis' songs are concerned, and the results are astounding.<br /><br />The lineup of musicians he has put together for this project is also very noteworthy. And they do NOT disappoint. John Wetton sounds as though he's been singing these songs all his life. And Hackett's playing? - NO MORE understated guitar here. H efinally pulls out all the stops and shows once and for all that he belongs at the top amongst any of the other guitar greats.<br /><br />One can only hope that sometime in the future He will do a follow up to this CD with a few more \\"re-awakenings\\" of the early Gensis stuff. My own personal wish list:<br /><br />Suppers Ready (with Gabriel doing the \\"guest\\" vocal)<br />Get `em out by Friday (with John Wetton)<br />Cinema Show<br />Robbery, Assault and Battery<br />Squonk<br />For Absent Friendsometime in the future He will do a follow up to this CD with a few more \\"re-awakenings\\" of the early Gensis stuff. My own personal wish list:  Suppers Ready (with Gabriel doing the \\"guest\\" vocal)  Get `em out by Friday (with John Wetton)  Cinema Show  Robbery, Assault and Battery  Squonk  For Absent Friends
B0065FFMR0|5.0|In this episode of AHS, we get the full background on Tate, what he did, and how he died. Hard to watch at times, and hard to look at Tate the same way. I think most of us figured out what he did in the Halloween episodes, but seeing it was a different story. This is one of the sadder episodes.<br /><br />Also, go Vivien! I'm glad she is standing up for herself.<br /><br />I can't wait for Wednesdays anymore. My only issue is that I have to wait so long in between episodes!
B003JTHESA|1.0|I wanted to like this cd but it just doesn't cut it. I'm a long time maiden fan, grew up on all their first albums and still liked AMOLAD, but they've gotta stop with the boring slow intros and the mid tempo crap. It also seems like Bruce was really straining to get high notes, and for lack of better lyrics just screams the chorus line 4 times[\\"The final frontier\\"].C'mon, they can do better than this...
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This movie was absoluly the bomb, it was great. It was full of corruption, blood, sex, action, deceit. What more could you ask for in an action pack drama.  Spartacus Blood and Sand was just as good.... GREAT!!!!!!
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|Can't say much more then all of the other 5 star reviewers here. I'd give it 6 if I could. The only thing more astounding then the music on this CD is the fact that this was all done LIVE. Even had this been a studio recording, I'd call these performances amazing. The fact that is a live performance(s) is just mind boggling. One of the tightest, most talented groups of musicians I've ever heard, and the recording is impeccable.<br /><br />A true dream come true would be for Steve to release a DVD of this same concert footage, if indeed it was \\"filmed\\".<br /><br />I'm just gald to hear, after sooooo many years, one of my favorite all time guitarists, and personal guitar inspirations, still going so strong, and in fact sounding better then ever! Thank you again Mr Hackett !!!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love the game. Was hard at first easier now after a few stratagies been developed. Sorta like golf as far as the difficulty and think thats why still interested. If was easy I would get bored quick. Downloaded it to samsung galaxy s and no lag problems or any other for that matter
B0015AARJI|4.0|After years of waiting for the price of a Dualshock controller to drop, I gave up but then decided to check again on Amazon and I found this one for less than the usual $54.99 (less than $40 once I used my points towards the cost). The buttons work perfectly and the battery life, once fully charged is around several days if you use it hours on end everyday.  My only gripe is with the packaging. It came in that old school, laceration-giving, difficult to open plastic. Just be mindful when freeing the controller from it's plastic packaging and you should come away unscathed.
0452273331|4.0|I would give this book 5 stars if it were a little more moral. The author doesn't believe in God and so while I deeply enjoyed the story and the principles of capitalism and production that were taught, I can't condone the general lack of Christian values.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Wow - what a read!  Steve Jobs the visionary versus Steve Jobs the wounded and severely flawed human being.  From the professional highs, to the personal lows, it's all here. While it's hard to take the man out of the story, the history lesson on the Silicon Valley and how it grew to where it is today is, by itself, worth the price of admission.  If you work in IT and don't know what to get your boss for Christmas, look no further.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|You have to smile, reading these reviews and seeing PG getting under people's skin (again) garnering (again) the usual results. Love or hate this music: As usual, PG's oeuvre won't leave anyone unaffected, with predictably strong feelings either way. There is so much thought-provoking new stuff to take in here, it will take some time (and pleasure!) to percolate fully. All the best music does.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Just as the first book, Pillars of the Earth, this is a captivating story of intermingling lives in Medieval Europe. The character development is well thought-out and the story takes interesting and unexpected twists. With such a vast character list, you will inevitably have a wide variety of emotions and love, hate, despise, fear, or encourage them. Very much worth your time!
0316010669|4.0|For me this book was [[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)]] with a theme. A bunch of really cool studies that were centered around explaining the good and bad of our sub-conscious. Super fascinating and fun. One of those books that make you want to tell everybody about what you just read. The sad part was how it left me wanting a sequel called: \\"Blink II, Training and Shaping Your Subconscious.\\" It left me feeling like our thought \\"locked behind the door\\" can shaped into a skill set but it didn't explain at all how to really go about it
B005WFUZTE|5.0|I have been chomping at the bit to finally hear this album. To be honest, it does not dissapoint...at all!! This is the best effort from Dave and Co. that I have heard in a very long time. This album is solid from start to finish. I did not want the cd to stop! I wanted more!! I recommend this to anyone who loves metal.   It made my ears bleed with pure joy!!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Don't waste your money on this ultraviolet STREAMING \\"digital copy\\".  It does not create a copy on your pc, apparently it just streams.  Plus, you will have to create an account on \\"Flixter\\" - yet another site that wants to require you to keep your digital movies on the cloud.    Another attempt to keep folks from OWNING and possessing digital content. I will nevr purchase a digital copy in this manner again.    I hope this review prevents others from making my mistake and saves some time and money.  UPDATE - The Blu-Ray audio does not sync with the picture.  Had to stop and reload 3 times during the movie to try to get the thing to run.  This appears to be a terrible transfer of the Blu-Ray.  If I didn't buy it from Amazon, I would swear the whole thing is a pirated copy.

0553801473|1.0|Why do you hate your fans Mr. Martin?  Dragging us along for sooo many tedious tiresome pages with not even a hint of reward. Skipping anything we want to see but forcing us to endure the never ending stream of new characters for no payoff. Killing (maybe) the only decent characters without any drama, and going on endlessly about characters we don't know or care about.  Do we really need 25 different perspectives? No, it amounts to smarter-type filler from a writer who clearly knows better.  I will definitely not buy any more of the books.  Maybe if, by some miracle, they get back on track with the rich drama of the first book or two, I will rent it first.  Thanks for a very very disappointing 1000 pages.  Jerk.

086571701X|4.0|This book will tell you what you need in order to get started in aquaponics, however there is little info about the commercial growing aspects. So if you plan on starting a business this is a very good way to start but you will need other information, such as the book engineering aquaculture. I would also suggest a hands on course at an aquaponics facility. All in all a very good book and I'm very happy with the purchase, a must have if your into aquaponics, great quick reference guide and very easy to read.
0470638842|4.0|A wonderful overview by a great author. This is not a how to book but it should be read by businesses and consumers who are trying to understand how social media is changing our world and why we should embrace it as a tool of production and not a time waster of teenagers.
B000002J6F|5.0|Possibly because I was 12 when it got released :) I just had the priviledge of seeing Stephen Stills perform at the Wolf Den in CT. I have been a long-time CSNY,Buffalo Springfield fan and couldn't wait to see Stephen! Excellent performance! The one song that blew me away was \\"Johnny's Garden\\". I do remember hearing that on the radio many moons ago. I had to order this CD immediately! I have an hour's drive each way to work, so I couldn't wait to play it on the drive in. \\"Johnny's Garden\\" gives me goosebumps, what a beautiful, peaceful tune!! Stephen's signature voice and guitar work take me to another place :) I love the entire cd and will get much enjoyment on my long drives to and from work :)  Thank you to Stephen and musicians on this absolutely awesome cd!!!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This application rocks.  It is one of the few I use every day to plan my work week.  The application reports are very accurate. I have not found anything I can complaint about.
0385341679|5.0|I am a huge fan of KMM's books.  If I could rate it higher I would. I love how Mac evolved in this book, from a girly girl all into pink, to a bad ass, take no prisoners character.  This series is by far at the top of my list.  A must buy.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Make Acrobat Compatible PDF Documents From Your Android Phone:  How cool is that?  Working as a Realtor, sometimes I have surprise documents pop up at closings.  Without a computer or scanner, I can make a decent copy of those documents and then email them to our corporate office for review.  That's really convenient.  I subsequently upgraded to the paid version which omits the advertising.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I've been using this for about six months, and it makes troubleshooting wireless networks fantastically easier on Android.  Full discovery, port scans, and even connections to services/servers (some native, some through plugins).  I'd pay for this if they sold it.  Droid Incredible with Cyanogen Mod 7.1 (and previously several versions of SkyRaider and OMFGB, all without issue).
B004DH8IK0|5.0|Not much to say. I've followed/enjoyed Pendulum for awhile, mostly streaming from various avenues online (Pandora, various radio stations, Spotify), but when I ran across this album, I had to pick it up. By far, my favorite album in a long time, and my favorite album from Pendulum.  I highly recommend picking this up if you're into Pendulum or electronic music in general. Seriously, give it a try!
0553801473|1.0|There was some quick media work to create an image for this author and this series. I got suckered in through the New Yorker profile. The first couple of books were tolerably interesting, though terribly over written and very poorly edited. Then the thing completely dissolves into random intrigue, cruel killing, almost always grotesque sex and endless references to excrement, mucus and other bodily fluids. Character development is completely disappointing. If you conceived a scrap of interest in someone you can count on the fact that they either disappear, are subject to some randomly concocted barbarous death, or get mired to unrecognition in some hokey and over-written plot line. The only comparison to Tolkien is the pretentious RR in the author's name. Spare yourself unless you'll get a kick out of an epic parody. Cheers!
1400032717|3.0|I would actually give this book 3.5 stars I think. It was a very interesting glimpse into how the mind works of one individual with Autism...obviously this is not representative of the thoughts and behaviors of all with Autism.  Behaviors that may seem irrational and highly unpredictable (like hitting a police officer) suddenly make sense when relayed through the main characters thought processes.<br /><br />There was a lot of additional/useless information in this book.  I understand the purpose of these meanderings was to support the premise that the author is autistic, but it was difficult to wade through.  However, after a slow start the story line really picked up and kept me reading.<br /><br />Also note that this book has a LOT of cursing (mostly the F word).<br /><br />overall, an interesting read, but too drawn out, read.  i would recommend it to those interesting in the topic of Autism, but would not recommend it to others outside of that mindset.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|I don't know what I was thinking; I am not a fan of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, or Michele Williams.  But, curiosity got the better of me, that, and so many misleading/glowing reviews posted here.  I just had to see what the fuss was all about.<br />I guess I should have read the negative reviews first.<br />All I can add is that I didn't absolutely hate it, but I saw nothing of real merit either.  It didn't engage me on any level.  I found it cold and detached from start to finish.  Everything about it was euphuistic: the grandiose score that never felt appropriate to the matter at hand, the mismatched acting styles that gave the BIG secret away, the intrusion of too many flashbacks (misleading clues), the dead slow pacing.....  Not to mention having to watch DiCaprio scowl/squint and misplace his accent for 137 minutes!<br />On an amusing note, the very qualities that people raved about were the very qualities that irritated me.  I found them more gimmicky than artistic.  Which brings this down to a matter of taste.  I can guarantee you'll either love it or hate it, or like me, not be moved to have any deep feelings for it.<br />I will add that I'm not sorry I watched it and didn't feel it was a waste of my time.  But, I have absolutely no interest in watching it again.  Not a keeper.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|Basically, I went through my box of vhs tapes and realized there were a bunch of wonderful movies that we needed in cd format so we could enjoy them, again!  Best place for taking care of such a task is ... coming to Amazon.com!  Service was great!

B000H4QD1O|5.0|Amazing show.  Only got cancelled because of Fox's baffling poor development of new content in the early 2000's.  This show created such an incredibly strong fan following that the major motion picture Serenity was created to give the fans and ending to the series.
030788743X|5.0|Any child of the 70s or 80s will love it. Bonus points if you're a gamer. Extra high marks of you're a reader. DVD bonuses if you're a TV addict.

Except maybe for the jocks and cheerleaders, but really, you had your 15 minutes back in high school, so close enough to make no difference, eh wot?
1878424939|4.0|In this popular self-help offering from 1997,  Don Miguel Ruiz has presented a clever way for us to return to a form of original wisdom via four key agreements we make with ourselves and others.<br /><br />Ruiz weaves his teachings with the wisdom tradition of the ancient Toltec people of southern Mexico which imbues the agreements with spiritual in addition to psychological power.<br /><br />According to the author, through our process of \\"domestication\\" (what some might call conditioning), we have adopted beliefs that do not serve us.  In fact, our domestication leads to beliefs that act much like a false dream, resulting in injustice, violence, and war. The false dream acts as a sort of law, and we are continuously fearful of challenging its power.<br /><br />Ruiz's antidote to this false dream is to engage with four agreements.  The agreements are simple enough, though perhaps not always easy to achieve:<br /><br />1. Be impeccable with your word.<br />Tell the truth and to use your energy in favor of love and truth.<br /><br />2. Don't take anything personally.<br />Don't poison your life by thinking that everything is about you. Events happen.  Other people do things for reasons of their own.<br /><br />3. Don't make assumptions.<br />Much trouble arises from what you think you know but really are only assuming.  Ask questions and check in with other people before you make conclusions.<br /><br />4. Always do your best.<br />Take action based on your judgment of what is best.<br /><br />While reducing life to four agreements may seem like an oversimplification, these agreements are part inspiration and part cognitive therapy.  They can help us to examine and renegotiate many of our old, damaging beliefs and place us on a wiser and more authentic path.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This thing is literally a slab of steel that has been sharpened. It's built like an ax but in knife form. The blade is thick and can get very sharp. My smaller knives can get more of a razor edge, but this blade is made for hard use so you wouldn't want a blade that sharp. It will shave your hair. The handles are perfectly doable. I prefer custom ones, only because I like different colors. It's an awesome knife and the sheath dulling problem has been addressed and fixed by Ka-Bar.
1451637500|5.0|The latest Vorkisigan novel delivers all the elements we've come to love in Bujold's tales: wit and intelligence, strategy and courage, and the best elements of humanity embodied in people who at first glance, are unlikely to have these qualities.<br /><br />Bujold also routinely tackles larger questions, but so thoroughly enmeshes them in the narrative that you might not realize they're being addressed: abortion, genetic engineering, empowerment of the \\"differently abled\\", abuse of power in the military and the government, and other weighty topics have featured in previous stories. Cryoburn is no different.<br /><br />The result is, once again, a solid read that captures us with its action and suspense, but satisfies on a much deeper level as well.
B004X4RU9I|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome.  Look up \\"New Territories\\" in Wikipedia about the history behind this film.  It is a bit exaggerated of course, for your entertainment.  A worthy 109 minutes.

B0053YGYO4|1.0|Enough said.  If I wanted to hear the nasal whining of this \\"diva\\" then I would spend an evening at the Old Navy. Viva la Vida was a tasteful and timeless masterpiece. MYLO XYLOTO is kitsch radio noise.  There are two or three catchy songs on this album, but they're easy to come by without purchasing the full album.
0553278398|2.0|This is the first book that I've ever read by I. Asimov. I'm a science fiction fan, and I've been told by like-minded friends that the Foundation books are superb. So, after some research, I found that Prelude to Foundation was chronologically the first book in the series--so that I might read them in order, despite each novel's publication date.   This fresh perspective, I believe, makes me unbiased in my review. I had no affinity or disdain for Asimov or the Foundation series prior to reading this book.  That being said, I was not impressed. For such an experienced writer, Asimov's PtF seemed to be the work of an amateur. The plot was meandering, the characterization was less so than my brief description of what brought me to read this book, and, frankly, the execution of the story was forced and just bad. Characters are introduced awkwardly, and their motivations are not believable or natural.  Perhaps, this being one of Asimov's later novels, by this time in the author's career, he was no longer criticized or edited. I'm hoping that I enjoy the following Foundation books. I'm hoping that they were/are more interesting and written better. 4.9/10
B004XWLN20|5.0|Here's a review from someone who actually has this item. So, let me get to the point. The box set is out of this world! I have all the seasons in my collection from their first release date. So, when I finally decided to go ahead and pick up the Complete Series, I was alittle worried that I was wasting my money by buying the seasons agian. But, when the box set came in by UPS yeasterday. I was blown away by the sight, wieght and very high quality of the item. It's has two book like dvd holders that are split by 1st to 5th seasons and 6th to 10th seasons. It's made of highly compressed board and will stay togather for a very long time. WB pulled out all the stops on this great set. It also comes with a very detailed Daily Planet news paper and a high gloss 24 page epoisode quide.   Not only is it the best set I've ever seen. It's has over 24 hours (two dvd's) of new features that will not be on the regular Season Ten set. I am a blu-ray owner and I can tell you the DVD's qaulity are great (plus any player will up sample the discs to almost 1080 dpi) So, this set only being released in DVD is not a problem for me. The set is so well put to gather I know if you decide to pick it up. You will not be dissapointed.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The digital copy coupled with this Blu-Ray set is more aptly named unlimited streaming copy. Which does me no good unless I have internet available.  Why would WB not include a standard iTunes copy like every other Studio out there. I rate the movie Five Stars I rate Warner brothers less then one.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I bought this to remind myself that I had a childhood and there's still fun in this world.<br /><br />Watched it 3 times already since I bought it. It's a most have for everybody. My children will fall in love with Simba when they are introduced into this troubled world. Doesn't hurt to have a kid in your heart, does it?<br /><br />The music, the graphic, the whole movie is the best in animated history. What more can I say?
B000HC2LI0|2.0|I purchased a new set but when I opened the set it was evident that they sent me a refurbished set. The disks in series one were not in their proper sleeves, the flap on the outside of the set was torn and the season jackets were dog eared.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|For someone who has been a fan of the Smurfs comic books and cartoon series since the 1980s, I have been waiting for a live-action/CGI-animated movie featuring them since that time, and have always wondered what the boys (and angel) in blue would look like in the matter of real-life looking characters. Well, Sony Pictures Animation finally brings the Smurfs to life, and I have to say that they look great! They neither look too real or like a bunch of animated PVCs, but they are still fairly recognizable and the texturing is just so awesome (Papa Smurf's beard and Smurfette's hair are particular standouts) it makes me jealous of the character model developers. And unlike other attempts to create CGI-animated cartoon characters in live-action settings (Garfield, Alvin And The Chipmunks, Scooby Doo), they work very well blending it with their surroundings.  I like all the characters in the film, both the Smurfs and the humans, though I would personally prefer Hefty being one of the main characters instead of Gutsy, who is basically an ethnic duplicate of the character thrown in just to have that type of a Smurf character. Hank Azaria was perfect as Gargamel, though he voices him much different from the deliciously hammy (and now eternally unavailable) Paul Winchell. For Smurf voice actors, Jonathan Winters was perfect as Papa Smurf (though only second to the late Don Messick who was basically THE voice of Papa Smurf), and Katy Perry was perfect as Smurfette. There was hardly a voice actor for the Smurfs that I didn't like, but with the film focusing mostly on six primary Smurf characters, there was hardly any place in it for the other Smurfs to appear except in the early and later parts.  As for the story, it does time-travel from their ancient medieval forest world to modern-day New York City and how the characters deal with being thrown into a future world while trying to find a way to get back home -- or in Gargamel's case, how to capture the Smurfs and use them tobecome the most powerful wizard. I like how the creators use a bit of recursive canon as far as the Smurfs' real-world creator, Peyo, using his cartoon skills to show the world his discovery of their legend, which becomes an important part of the film as the Smurfs must find one of his books in order to find the spell that opens the portal back to their own world and time. Overall the story is very funny and entertaining, but I really don't want to see this story idea get used too often in the sequels that Sony Pictures Animation plans to do.  While I will rate this one star lower for not using enough Smurf characters in the story, I would have to say that this film is definitely a must-get for Smurf fans of any age.  UPDATE: The Christmas Carol special got leaked early, but it's definitely worth seeing when you get this package. The quality of the 2D animation is better than that of the original Hanna-Barbera cartoon show, even though it shares a similar style.
B00288KNL8|2.0|I ordered this video on 9/30 and it didn't arrive until 10/25 or so. This was within the designated time frame advertised, but I received notice that it could arrive as soon as 10/9. When it got here, the 2D works fine, but the 3D doesn't work on the specific scenes that look best in 3D. Very disappointing.
B003L77G6A|4.0|The Big Bang Theory remains one of the funniest shows on TV, and perhaps the only comedy I watch regularly. Despite that, though, it's slipped a bit from the initial seasons in a key way.  Those first seasons really made the characters seem like real scientists in that they talked about real science.  Scientific references in the dialog weren't just technobabble: they were real physics. The equations on the whiteboard were correct.<br /><br />It's not that what they have now is incorrect.  It's just that it's very infrequent. We almost never see the whiteboard anymore.  And the characters rarely make physics or math references. While this may seem minor to some, I thought it added a layer to the show missing from other sitcoms.
0307593312|4.0|This book is written as a serial, with chapters ending in cliffhangers such as \\"...and started to squeeze the trigger.\\" True to the serial format, when we come back, the gun has of course not fired.  For all the fantastic settings and wonderful characters,  the storyline is simply a version of the star crossed lover tale.   Worth reading for the rich creation of a unique world and several memorable characters.  I could see the ending 500 pages before it happened, but still enjoyed the twists and turns getting there.
6302314186|5.0|Loads of great clips from both the Gooden/Strawberry era back to the start when the Mets were arguably the worst expansion team ever. Decent footage of early games at the Polo Grounds before their move to Shea Stadium. Parade footage of the 1969 World Series title is pretty cool, too. All in all a solid fun package of Mets' highlights (and some of the lowlights) of the team that made baseball fun again in New York City.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I just received my Jurassic park set today and I will say this is not the best blu ray transfer i've ever seen but it is by far not the worst...in fact is a major cut above the DVD if nothing more than for the new audio mix which just blows the DVD audio mix away.  Now back to the movies...the blacks are spot on ...deep and rich with no grain at all...in Jurassic park the reds are much brighter and the picture is much sharper...but I will admit ...it could have been better...but i'm pleased with this set.  I would also recommend that you upgrade your firmwear before you get this set...just to make sure you get the best results from your blu ray system.
B003VANOFY|5.0|All in all Product is perfect. Software is slightly glitchy.  Im using Win7 Enterprise X64.  Pros:   -Everything that is given on specs work. Voice morph, 7.1, buttons etc.  -The build is strong and wont break easily  -Battery life is as predicted (between 2.5 - 10 hours)  Cons: The software bugs are a problem, here's a few i had:  -The software doesn't pick up the headset after restart (to fix, plug out and plug dongle back in.)  -The buttons on headset doesn't respond (to fix try unplugging the headset dongle, plug back in with headset switched off, then switch on headset.)  The noise that can be heard on videos is sometimes the encoding video and might not be made for surround sound. Or its caused by external interference which i found can be avoided.  PS. Remember that the red light on the mic means your mic is muted.  To turn your sound to play through speakers while the headset is plugged in, set the speakers to default output device instead of the headset.  With bugs and all its the perfect gaming and performance headset
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I have never been a huge gamer but when my husband bought me a Kinect that changed.  I love my Kinect.  I'm a huge fan of dancing games.  Honestly I haven't really enjoyed or played more than dancing or aerobic games because those are the things that interest me.  I have found the Kincet to be very responsive and easy to use.  The only problem we've faced has been making room in the den for the play area.  You really need to make sure you have enough room to easily move around without running into seating or tables.  Also my cat has been known to interrupt play by walking into the sensor area.  Not a huge issue but still something to think about. Overall I love this product.
1592332803|2.0|I too was excited to get this cookbook. So I jumped right in a tried one of the recipes for a quick bread that looked and sounded great...the olive bread..Verrry bland and pasty. So more recently I tried another quick bread and that batch turned out to be blah, too. I think she needs to use more spice or up the quantities of the flavorful elements. Vegan cooking doesn't have to be bland and tasteless, but if you follow these recipes you may be in for disappointment. I gave the book away to charity!
B000025802|3.0|One might describe Dvorak's symphonies as a blend of the styles of Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Smetana - grand, vast, expansive, lush, lyrical works in the romantic style that retain those elements of rustic simplicity and nostalgia so dear to the heart. This is evident even in his earliest two symphonies, which, though not as economically written as his subsequent ones, pave the way for the great composer to come. Symphonies 3-6 are beautiful works as well while the last three are simply over the top (the seventh is considered his masterpiece in the genre, and rightly so). Familiarity with early works is exceedingly important if one wishes to fully understand a composer's development over time and transition into maturity. This is especially true for conductors of orchestras, without whom we would not enjoy the fruits of the composer's labor. That being said, the symphonies referenced above are masterfully executed by Kubelik et al., especially number 8 (I particularly like the driving energy he brings to the finale of the first movement!). I might, in fact, even say I prefer Kubelik's renditions of the last two to those of Kertesz (who also does an amazing job and whose Dvorak set I'd prefer over any other). He skillfully brings out the Tchaikovskian lushness and lyricism of the Third Symphony, the pastoral bucolicism of the Fifth and the passion and yearning of the Ninth (From the New World). As for the others - well, he seems just plain disinterested! It's as if he were operating compulsively and without any emotional investment in the works. The Sixth, for example, drags on and on from beginning to end. I am particularly disappointed in the last movement, which is not only entirely too slow for my taste, but at a point two minutes from the end where it is supposed to speed up, Kubelik just takes his sweet old time with the same glacial tempo! Another prominent example is the Scherzo of the Fourth, lasting nearly 8 minutes. Compare to Kertesz, whose interpretation lasts between 4 and 5 minutes and is much lighter and crisper. I will admit that most of the last movement of the Seventh (my absolute favorite) is incredible, but it falls off at the tail end when it loses its energy. Symphonies 1 and 2 lag as well and contribute to the generally somnolent effect of this set. If I had heard only these and not Kertesz's much better interpretations of the early works, I would not have developed the interest in them that I now have, nor would I have come to view them as crucial works in Dvorak's evolution as a composer.<br /><br />My advice to prospective buyers: buy the more spirited and energetic Kertesz set. He obviously has a thorough interest in bringing the early Dvorak symphonies to light and eliciting all of the typical Dvorakian elements in these works - and they're very much present. It's only a matter of what the conductor chooses to realise.lasts between 4 and 5 minutes and is much lighter and crisper.

He always gets cheap walmart brand shoes like this, and I decided to go behind his back to order him some good shoes for work since the other ones always wear out so fast. He is going to be so glad that I did because I tried these out around the house and they are WONDERFUL! I definitely will be getting a pair for myself!

1451648537|5.0|As a long time member of the Mac cult, I thought I knew something about Steve Jobs.  I was mistaken.  Isaacson has done a splendid job presenting a difficult and driven genius.  Along with a fascinating character (and cultural) exploration, Isaacson has managed to capture a unique philosophical approach to success, with lessons for all entrepreneurs to glean from.  Thank you for writing this book.

It would have been nice if the bad guy had seemed like a bigger threat than he was...I mean come on, blow up a small city to show us what you can do....pfffft...nada. Melty Cube.  I must admit I have never read the comic and don't know anything about Captain America, but I can say I really don't want to learn more.  This was a totally forgettable movie. Meh.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I do not understand how this movie has so many 5 and 4 star reviews.  The story is flat; there is no real emotion; it feels thrown together.  It feels like it was written by some 20s art/lit fanboy (who is probably much like the \\"pedantic\\" character in the movie we're supposed to hate).<br /><br />The story is predicable and not engaging whatsoever.  The acting is sub-par; same with the directing.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone; even my literature-buff friends.<br /><br />I'm not really sure who would like this movie.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is an admirable close to a great franchise, and does justice to the author's vision.  There some very nice reviews of the film itself and the 5 star ratings are certainly a fair assessment for fans of all things Harry Potter.   The 1 star is due to the false advertising, the bait and switch, the requirement to sign up for new services you likely do not want or need, and the questionable delivery of a promised product.    Sadly, the studio's business side has made a bad decision going with  UltraViolet.  The \\"copy\\" is cloud-based, not local to your machine.  Frankly the vendor can discontinue access at their whim and a user would have little recourse. The \\"copy\\" could disappear if UltraViolet fails as a business entity (hopefully).  The \\"copy\\" is likely not available in flight and on an international travel could cost you a bundle in data fees.  Not worth the risk, not worth paying extra for, and arguably the fewer people that buy the product the sooner this particular attempt at DRM fades in the sunset.    Recommendation:  Avoid purchasing any product with UltraViolet \\"digital\\" copies.  Wait for the studios supporting this scheme to come to their senses when they see revenues fall.  An email campaign to the studios wouldn't hurt.  See reviews of Green Lantern for additional rants on UltraViolet.
B000KBELWM|5.0|I have seen three adaptions of Jane Eyre and this is by far the best.  Timothy Dalton makes a wonderful Rochester.  You really gain the depth of his frustration and agony.  Zelah Clarke also plays Jane Eyre, to a tea!  I have read the book twice and this adaption is very good in following the story.  There are so many parts that are left out in other versions, that truly add to the story.  This is a must see for all fans of Jane Eyre or any other classic!
0061537934|5.0|A family friend gave me this book when our beloved 15 year old dog died.  If this book was only about a cute dog narrating a story it would still be a fine read. And for a while that is what I thought as I read.    In the end, however, my friend wanted me to see that like Enzo, our dog was old and sick and was really ready to go.  It is about the only time Enzo or our dog ever thought about itself more than loving us.
B00012FXAE|5.0|1986 saw the return of Ripley in Aliens, which was directed by James Cameron(yes, that James Cameron). This science-fiction action film follows Ripley as she returns to the planet where she first encountered her first Alien creature. Only this time, she is accompanied by a unit of Colonial Marines.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice with this film that's different from the first film is that this film has more action in it and less horror in it. Although, there are moments where things are intensely frightening. Like the product review states, it's one of those rare cases when the sequel outdoes the original. While the majority of the masses out there will mention The Terminator as being Cameron's claim to fame, I honestly believe this movie was. I'll probably get alot of flack for saying this but, after viewing this and The Terminator, I feel this movie was a little more solid in terms of story and whatnot.<br /><br />Overall, even though the original will hold a special place in my heart, Aliens is the best movie out of the bunch.
B00004XPPE|4.0|Columbia Pictures presents \\"FAIL-SAFE\\" (1964) ~ (112 min/B&W) ~ Starring: Henry Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy, Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, Edward Binns, Larry Hagman & Fritz Weaver<br /><br />Directed by Sidney Lumet<br /><br />Based on the novel by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler, Fail-Safe tells of what happens when a misguided transmission sends a squadron of bombers hurtling towards Russia, fully prepared to drop their atomic weaponry on Moscow. Air Force commander Frank Overton desperately tries to establish radio contact with the bombers, but once the pilots have passed the \\"fail safe\\" point, they've been instructed to disregard any reversal of orders. Racing against time, US President Henry Fonda, through his interpreter (Larry Hagman), informs the Russian premiere of the impending nuclear disaster. Working in concert with SAC, the Russians send up interceptors to shoot down the American bombers, while some of the planes run out of fuel and crash. Unfortunately, one aircraft, piloted by Edward Binns, manages to escape destruction and continues on its fatal mission.<br /><br />Special footnote: ~ Columbia Pictures produced both this movie and 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Director Stanley Kubrick insisted his movie be released first, and it was, in January 1964. When Fail-Safe was released, it garnered excellent reviews, but audiences found it unintentionally funny because of \\"Strangelove\\", and stayed away. Henry Fonda later said he would never have made this movie if he had seen \\"Strangelove\\" first, because he would have laughed too.<br /><br />BIOS:<br />1.

B0057R5XRG|4.0|I've read the reviews of people STEAMING that this release looks terrible: one person even said, \\"My old VHS copies look better than this!\\" Hyperbole or no, come on. I'm a movie lover who upgraded to Blu-ray about a year ago, and I've collected a handful of film releases (Inception, Sherlock Holmes BBC, Firefly/Serenity), and a handful of big box set releases (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Extended, Matrix Ultimate Collection, Alien Anthology, to name a few).   I picked up this set because I loved and grew up with the movies, this is my take as someone who loves movies, has a decent set up on which to watch them (5.1 surround, 55\\" Plasma, mid-range Samsung Blu-ray player): they look very, very good. The first two films don't look as crisp as the third, and yes - there is some grain. Does it detract from the excitement of the movies, and the AMAZING sound mix (the roar of a T-Rex literally gave me chills the first time, hearing the raptors run around you is great - and that booming soundtrack - really one of the best sounding box sets I have)? No. They do look better than the DVD set that I had, but no, they aren't the BEST looking Blu-rays I've seen: Alien Anthology, Star Wars Trilogy, even the Back to the Future set look cleaner and crisper.  But - all in all, as an average guy who loves movies, who enjoys the look and sound that Blu-ray has to offer, I'll say this is a great set. The extras are great and comprehensive for each film, the movies are fun (even if the quality does go downhill after the first film), and they do look the best they ever have on a home release - I give this set 4 out of 5 stars just in comparison to other big box set releases I've bought recently. If you love Jurassic Park, love movies, and don't have the tendency to analyze every pixel on the screen with a magnifying class, looking for DNR and blah blah...this box set will definitely satisfy you.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I just got this movie today in the mail.  I've been looking forward to seeing the last installment of Harry Potter and got the Blu-Ray and, as always, got the Digital Copy to go along with it.  All I can say is, STAY AWAY FROM THE ULTRAVIOLET!  Getting a digital copy movie used to be an easy and pleasant experience.  I really liked the idea of expanding my digital and Blu-Ray library.  Not anymore.  The Ultraviolet process could not be more offensive and disgusting if they tried.  This may be the last digital copy I purchase.  I really have no words.  Still haven't watched the movie yet as I've been messing around with this digital copy all night.  Awful.  Oh - and by the way, the Ultraviolet Digital Copy does NOT work with iTunes.  So if you are purchasing this copy to use with iTunes, you are SOL!
0062101897|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful.  I wish they had the Potter books in the same design.  Looks great on my shelf AND is full of mystery and wonder.  I'm slowly making my way through the book but I look forward to learning more about the filmmaking and the set pieces for Harry Potter.    This is definitely a book that every fan should own.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Not his best writing. The book had some intriguing plot lines, but they weren't developed in a very interesting manner.  The women characters were stereotypical. Two of the main male characters were anything but role models: divorce, premarital sex, drinking to excess, unethical behavior...all in a day's work.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This movie was in great condition with no scratcches or anything and played perfectly!! Halloween is honestly my FAVORITE! horror movie so i cant really say anything bad! Its a great movie! I actually just ordered halloween 2 last friday!:D
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love it! This apps forces you to think!! Its definently presents a challenge. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a puzzle type person.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|It was a great movie, but save your money and don't buy the digital copy.  They provide their ultraviolet digital copy which isn't compatible with iTunes.  You have to download their slow crappy software on each device.  Complain so we can have a good quality product back.
B004SBX112|5.0|This is an ad free version. You must uninstall the free version first and then install this version. Also updating from android market instead of amazon market can cause it to have ads. People need to use common sense before saying something isn't working and posting a bad review.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Downloaded this app from the free app of the day.  Works great with little to no issues on a HTC Thunderbolt (Verizon).
0446567329|5.0|Book was excellent. Very different from the movie but it was very interesting seeing the difference between the two. Excellent conditioned book as promised as well.
1451648537|4.0|Not as elegantly written as Snowball, the biography of Warren Buffet, but a very good book indeed.  It's kind of astonishing that such a secretive and controlling personality as Jobs would ever let so many people tell so many unvarnished stories about his life and the book doesn't pull any punches.  I particularly liked his insights into business, negotiations, building a company, and vision.  I would be the first to enroll in Apple University if they ever allowed non Apple employees to grace its glass atrium.
B004ZNB12O|2.0|For years now, I've hoped for a Pink Floyd rarities disc. One of the songs that I would like to have is  \\"Point me at the Sky.\\" However, I refused to buy the over-priced box set for one (count it) rarities disc.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Is it too much to ask for a little respect for the fans? Apparently so. . .
0307891402|5.0|I just got my Skyrim Collector's Guide this morning delivered by ONTRAC. Thanks Amazon! WOW: this guide is HUGE. It comes sealed in plastic and has the Free Access to the Interactive World Map Code inside. This is worth the price alone, imho.  The interactive world map is awesome if you truly want to discover everything there is in Skyrim. The guide itself is beautifully illustrated and is a MONSTER of valuable info. This is a must-have purchase for any fan of The Elder Scrolls or serious collector. I will use this guide for playing the game with but I want to get another just for my collection and leave it untouched and displayed. BLOWN AWAY!!!
B005FNVDSA|2.0|What was DG thinking? I was so looking forward to this recording. Being an admirer of both Maurizio Pollini and Christian Thielemann, I thought this would be wonderful. Well, the playing certainly is wonderful as far as I can hear, but the recording is abominable. It sounds like a bad 1950's recording. It is almost impossible to hear any of the orchestra instruments except the violins. Muddy sound and no detail at all. I wish Kenneth Wilkinson was still around. Compare this recording to the Clifford Curzon with George Szell on Decca and the difference becomes very clear. Buyer beware!!
1442337966|5.0|Great motivational CD by Rhonda, I highly recommend it.  At first when she started talking about love, I was thinking it didn't make sense, then I realized that to get what you want, you do have to \\"love\\" it.  Focus on the positive.  I enjoy it on my commute.  I also loved the Secret.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was riveting from beginning to end I can't wait for the third book to be released!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best series ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Toward Tiger CK you spelt Gaia wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But very good review it covered all the major points without giving away the story!!!!!!!!
0446547654|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books, and this book certainly didn't disappoint!I will be anxiously looking for his next book as always!  Cindy Jarrett
B004LWZW8I|4.0|This film is not a masterpiece but that does not mean that it is a horrible film. The fight sequences were done very well. the story flowed right along, What i liked about the film is that we get to see henry cavill who will be playing the man of steel in the new superman film coming in 2013 in action. He really does have the look for playing superman.I do not want to give away anything but if you go and see this movie and do not expect an epic epic film then this movie can be enjoyable.
B0018BF1MM|5.0|I like so much this presentation of the album \\"Nostradamus\\", it's very fine digi-book, always I wanted in this edition. The best part is the price, because was very cheap. In actuality is dificult to find this deluxe version in stores. In general very happy with the product.
B004WR125O|4.0|Bought the UWF-1 to work with my recently purchased Onkyo TX-NR709 Receiver. I works as described, but was a bit of an effort to set up. First attempts (many) the unit, though it saw my router, failed to connnect. Then after a one hour update I saw \\"ERROR\\" on the display. Looked in the manual and could not find the proper error ID in the troubleshooting section. Two paragraphs described my next option: 1. Do not unplug receiver during upgrade. 2. Unplug receiver to reset. Well I tried the receiver without unplugging and no sound from the receiver. So I unplugged, restarted the OS update and went to bed. Woke up and the display read \\"Completed\\" [or something similar]. After upgrading the OS I felt that the sound was actually better, but it is hard to say as I cannot go back to the orignal to test. I would recommend purchase of this item, but be prepared for a little frustration, and a few hours to get working.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|great app for productivity . linking  with docs stored on Google  makes me productive everywhere. I only wish I could see more of the screen while typing.
B001NLKT60|3.0|It's a good read. It's suspenseful, interesting, and keeps you reading. I particularly like the fact of actually getting to know The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Lisbeth is one of the most unique characters I have ever read, but she makes sense and she's a kick butt kind of girl.<br /><br />The story does, however, seem to cut off abruptly. It's not really a full story on its own; you have to read the next in the series to get the whole picture. My other problem is the weaving in of other people's story that don't add more to the overall story. Some of narrative following the other characters just seemed like fillers.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth a read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried many keyboards and this is by far the best looking and most functional one there is.  Very decent product.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book kept me reading start to finish. The characters are very vivid and unique. It's a great story. It's kind of insane but very believable at the same time. It's a thrilling and suspenseful read that doesn't let you down.<br /><br />I have a few problems with it, though. One, I'm not a big fan of Mikael Blomkvist. I don't find him particularly likable and he is the central character, arguably. Two, I feel like the climax of the story happened way too soon. After that, the story took forever to wrap up.
B005SV9X22|2.0|Having discovered Gaga in early 2008 and falling instantly in love, I was bumbed that i was never able to catch her live- either where she played was a 21+ club, i was broke at the time, or tickets were sold out. When she finally played arenas with this tour, I found myself being less attracted to her. I was one of few that didnt fall for her whole \\"I was bullied in highschool,\\" \\"I felt like a freak,\\" and \\"monster-like\\" shpiel. Regardless of me not liking her as much, I attended one of the last shows of the Monster Ball Tour but unfortunately I found my phone to be more entertaining throughout it. Her show, which would have normally lasted an hour and half, managed to surpass the 2 hour mark because she would NOT SHUT THE HELL UP! I love when artists interact with their audience but she completely overdid it. Her show, which started as a theater show when the tour first kicked off, failed to translate into a bigger-venue show even with the huge budged. The show was very bland, uninspiring, and blasé.  One of the main things that took away from the show was the too-obvious black&white-to-color film shots which were very [[ASIN:0784010501 Madonna - Truth or Dare]]. There are already way too many comparisons to Madonna so why do what's already been done? Gaga keeps pushing the limits but not always in a good way.  This was one of those shows where it would have been better to catch it live as it didn't translate too well on the screen. The directing for this dvd was horrid, unfocused, and headache-y. I cannot comprehend how the show managed to win an Emmy for Outstanding Picture Editing for a Special.  The only reason this show will be purchased is because i buy every dvd pertaining to the shows i have been to.  Setlist:  1.\\"Dance in the Dark\\"  2.\\"Glitter and Grease\\"  3.\\"Just Dance\\"  4.\\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\"  5.\\"The Fame\\"  6.\\"LoveGame\\"  7.\\"Boys Boys Boys\\"  8.\\"Money Honey\\"  9.\\"Telephone\\"  10.\\"Speechless\\"  11.\\"You and I\\"  12.\\"So Happy I Could Die\\"  13.\\"Monster\\"  14.\\"Teeth\\"  15.\\"Alejandro\\"  16.\\"Poker Face\\"  17.\\"Paparazzi\\"  18.\\"Bad Romance\\"  19.\\"Born This Way\\"
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I love the conclusion. It's dramatic, pleasing, and worthy of the story of Lisbeth Salander. I love the interactions between Salander and her supporters.<br /><br />I can't say I loved much else about this novel. The omniscience took away suspense and drama to a point of making the story feel predictable. I also didn't find the conclusion of Mikael Blomkvist and Erika Berger believable. Of course, I still don't understand why every woman seems to throw herself at Mikael. As a stand alone novel, it isn't worth a read.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you have read the two previous books in the series. Otherwise, you just have to read it for the conclusion.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I was able to preview this and it is with pleasure that I call myself one of the biggest Adele fans ever. It is almost impossible to find someone you don't know that makes you feel as if though they took the words right out of your mouth and put them in song. She said that she concentrated on making music for the ears, not the eyes, but in this video, you're clearly able to see that the eyes get a treat as well- she is breathtaking.  In a modern age, where concerts rely on special effects, pyro, dancers, and theatrics, Adele manages to achieve the same results one would get from such shows by just having a backing band, 2 background singers, and a stool- her voice IS the show! I will be honest, I was worried about Adele having so many throat problems while on tour and when she had surgery in early summer, I was expecting a drastic notice in her voice. You do hear her throat a little scratchy in the dvd/cd but the \\"imperfections\\" only managed to bring more truth to the songs.  It should be in everyone's bucket list to catch an Adele show- I guarantee she is not to be missed!  1.\\"Hometown Glory\\"  2.\\"I'll Be Waiting\\"  3.\\"Don't You Remember\\"  4.\\"Turning Tables\\"  5.\\"Set Fire to the Rain\\"  6.\\"If It Hadn't Been for Love\\"  7.\\"My Same\\"  8.\\"Take It All\\"  9.\\"Rumour Has It\\"  10.\\"Right As Rain\\"  11.\\"One & Only\\"  12.\\"Lovesong\\"  13.\\"Chasing Pavements\\"  14.\\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\"  15.\\"Make You Feel My Love  16.\\"Someone Like You\\"  17.\\"Rolling in the Deep\\"
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I was hoping the release of the Iphone 4s wouldn't bring with it a different body shape; I love the look of the 4/4s. So when I got mine, I definitely didn't want to hide it under a bulky case. However I do drop phones fairly regularly. This is perfect for my needs. It shows off the white phone perfectly. It's crystal clear. It's slippery enough that I can slide the phone in my pocket, but the phone doesn't slide out of my hands. It did drop off of a coffee table today onto the wood floor and just did a little bounce. All was fine. I don't want to test it out dropping it on concrete, but more than likely it would be ok in this case (if not dropped with force or from very high). The screen protector is on, bubble free and not at all noticeable in look or feel. I am not a huge fan of the circles on the back. If they made one without them I'd buy it to replace this one. I'm not looking to announce my use of an apple product to the world. But I'm not docking any stars for that because I'm really so happy with it.<br />Edit after 7 months: still love the case. Have dropped the phone quite a bit and all is fine so I'm only docking one star for the gross color it has turned after 7 months (see product photos) It's cheap enough to replace once a year IMO. Screen protector still great and bubble free!
B00288KNJU|1.0|I watched this movie on a sunny afternoon while I was pregnant. My husband was with me. But I had to turn the TV off midway because it is just TOO SCARY! OMG! I had never imagined someone or some team would make such a terrible scary movie and name it \\"for kids\\". It is definitely NOT FOR KIDS! From the characters to the scenes to the music and worst of all to the plot, nothing is for kids! Especially the music! It is just disturbing and horrifying. The darkness in the storyline is not even appropriate for adults. The whole idea of the movie is almost like telling you: \\"be happy with your naughty parents because if not, your dreamy parents are actually the devils and would love to kill you!\\" It made me feel very very uncomfortable for few days. I had even wondered if it had impacted my baby girl. Its just stinks! I have tons of Disney movies and Non-Disney Kids movies, and this one is not even 1% belongs to KIDs. Horrible, it is more horrible than a horror movie! I could not even think about it anymore in my mind. If there is a ZERO rating I would like to select that, or maybe even NEGATIVE rating. This movie should really be destroyed world-wide.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These headphones do everything they claim to.  They deliver good quality surround sound, chat capability for xbox live and are extremely comfortable over extended periods of time.  The only downside is the battery life.  In my experience, though they claim to get more, the pair of aaa's only lasts about 10 to 12 hours with sound and chat in use so definately look to get rechargeables because the batteries get expensive fast.  Even though this is true I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking at it, especially at the good price I got them at from amazon.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Who is the monster? The creation or the creator? Frankenstein. Classic. Terrifying. Chilling. The birth of horror. The birth of a nightmare. This film was directed by James Whale and stars Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles and Boris Karloff. The premise of this one is simple and very effective: A mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein collects lifeless cadaver parts and assembles them in his lab. On a stormy night Dr. Frankenstein and his lab assistant Fritz discover a way to bring this creation to life. The only one problem is that the good doctor Frankenstein accidentally gave the creation a criminal brain. The monster soon escapes and reaps terror on the nearby town. The town mob corner the monster and supposedly burn him alive. This chilling tale set the perfect template for countless horror movies to come. The terror, the fear, the unknown, the monster.

B004EPYZQC|3.0|I ordered this movie which was supposed to be in \\"brand new perfect condition\\", I received it far from promptly which wasn't was a big deal but when I opened the package the case was smashed in (when it was stated case in perfect condition, still in orginal wrapping and everything) and also when I played the movie it had a glitch in it (the movie freezes during one scene)I had to start the movie all over and fast forward to the next chapter completely. So that was upsetting considering I was expecting a movie in brand new condition which obviously means no scratches or skipping. The movie itself I loved, first time I saw it (which is why it was even more frustrating I had to miss the whole part where it stops working, during the last car chasing scene too!)

1466208686|4.0|I've bought several books to help me brush up for interviewing, and this is hands down my favorite. There's no fluff - it's concise and all of the material is relevant.   The book is broken down into a brief section on interview tips: What to wear, how to negotiate, etc. You might be tempted to skip it, but I think it's worth a read. The rest of the book is 1/4 questions and 3/4 solutions to the questions. The questions are on track and the detailed solutions really help you work through the problems.  Highly recommended, especially over this frequently mentioned book: [[ASIN:047012167X Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job, 2nd Edition (Programmer to Programmer)]].  In comparison that book is about the same length but with a a quarter of the content.   A recommended read!
0571283578|2.0|As a longtime \\"Jane-ite\\", I have always considered Jane Austen's work to be sacrosanct and not to be touched by other, lesser writers. I've stayed away from modern attempts to bring Austen's characters and stories - particularly those of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - to life in sequels. No one, I thought, had the literary \\"chops\\" to take Austen's characters and write a competent sequel. Then I heard that PD James, a mystery writer I had long admired, had taken a stab at writing a sequel.<br /><br />The resulting novel - \\"Death Comes to Pemberly\\" - is an awkward combination of mystery and comedy-of-manners and doesn't quite come off. The two genres don't quite come together, even in Ms James' deft hands. Maybe it was the choice of centering the story on George Wickham and a murder he is being tried for having committed. Wickham has never been a particularly interesting character in the original novel; he was the center around which events took place, but I never wanted to know more about what happened to him after the novel ended. And, in fact, that raises a particular question in my mind. Who ARE the characters in \\"P&P\\" I would want to read about? I can't think of a single one, actually.<br /><br />Maybe that's because I figured a long time ago that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was a completed story. There's a reason an author doesn't write sequels; maybe everything that can be said about a cast of characters has already been said. That's what Margaret Mitchell always felt about \\"Gone With The Wind\\". And Jane Austen certainly didn't return to any of her older books when writing new ones. (In this book, James writes a little about the \\"Eliot family\\").<br /><br />So what about PD James' book? It seemed like an \\"adequate\\" mystery and an \\"adequate\\" comedy-of-manners. I've read most of James' back list and I wouldn't put this book near the top of the list. But, on the other hand, sometimes \\"adequate\\" can be a good read, which this book is. If you're not a Jane Austen fan, you'd probably like the book; however, most Jane-its should stay away.bly like the book; however, most Jane-its should stay away.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I had heard nothing but good things about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and so it was added to my extensive reading list a couple of years ago. When I picked it up and started to tell people I was going to read it I started to hear mixed reviews. I kept and open mind and dove in.<br /><br />However, it was hard to dive in because it was very slow and hard to get into. Around 40% of the way through I started to worry that I had made a mistake. But I kept trudging along. And then BAM, at 49% it turns into a speeding train and a fascinating story.<br /><br />Where it took me two weeks to read the first half of the book, it took me 3 days to finish it. I realized at the end of the book, while reading the about the author section, that the author had planned this being a trilogy which would explain the in depth character introduction.<br /><br />Overall I give this book 4 stars and a heads up that the read will have to power through that first half but after that it's completely worth the read. I have already read the first part of the second book and it's much more promising!

0307891372|5.0|When it comes to an RPG game, you know that it'll be massive. So much so that some of those games will require you to get the strategy guide because with a game as big as Skyrim, you need the guide to help you get around this massive world. So I went to my local Gamestop and was the first customer of the day and was also the first to purchase this huge almost 700 page guide. And it's huge and helpful.<br /><br />What you will find in this guide is everything you ever wanted to know about the game: Every major quest and side quests. Tips on beating the enemies, all locations for the goodies. All magic potions and spells. A map poster, Every inn, every guild, every side game. I could mention everything but it's best to let you the reader be surprised on your own.<br /><br />All I can say is that with The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim walk through, playing the game will be a breeze because you'll never get stuck and you'll be able to know how to beat a dragon or a tough guy through this book.<br /><br />Enjoy the world of Skyrim and happy reading.
B005MYEQ9U|4.0|Wow got this DVD from Amazon three days ago and have watched it three times....what a great opera!  Too bad it is not more routinely staged...the music is fantastic..................In this production the two real standouts were the Vienna Opera Orchestra and the great Elina Garanca.  Anna Netrebko looks great but honestly she cannot sing belcanto to save her life.........why does she continue to embarass herself by singing this kind of opera?  She really looks bad when paired with Garanca who is the best female voice on the planet and who sings belcanto with authority.  In spite of all this, this is a great opera and so much fun to watch...............I really want to see the two other Donizetti Tudor queen operas.
0385738773|5.0|The Death Cure by James Dashner  Random House, 324 pages  Purchased    Oh man, I waited so impatiently for this book! When it was finally released, I was about to die from the anticipation of getting this book in the mail! If you haven't read The Maze Runner, you must get your buttocks to a bookstore STAT! It is amazing. If you liked The Hunger Games, this series is a must-read. On to the analysis... if you haven't read this book yet, you may want to skip to the rating at the bottom.    To begin with, I must say that I really enjoy Thomas as a main character. He is one of the few characters that I have read about in a young adult novel that actually thinks things through before he makes a decision. It is very refreshing. Also, I think it is important to make a note of the fact that I am an INSANE Minho cheerleader! I absolutely love him. He has the best comments at the most intense moments, which pretty much is the entire book. Last note about characters... I really do not like Teresa or Brenda at all, although Teresa did redeem herself a bit in my eyes by the end of the book. But, I still find Brenda as a weak and annoying character.    Even though The Scorch Trials is my favorite out of the trilogy, The Death Cure still is one of my favorite books. Some things kind of did appear out of nowhere, but Dashner typically went on to explain the situation, and if he didn't, it wasn't terribly important in the whole scheme of things. Like any Dashner book, the plot was riveting and kept you hooked the whole time. Even when Thomas is locked up in a boring old cell, the chapter is still fascinating!    The ending for me was a bit disappointing. I have no idea what I was expecting, but I think I had extremely unrealistic expectations. I am still grappling with myself and trying to decide if I liked the ending or not. But, like The Hunger Games, I was not a fan of the ending, and that is most likely because I am the most critical about my favorite books. I have heard from several people that they did indeed enjoy the ending, so maybe I just have to wait for it to grow on me.    Regardless of the minor facets of the book that I didn't particularly enjoy, The Death Cure was a stunning conclusion to The Maze Runner Trilogy. It brings up intriguing philosophical questions and leaves some things to the reader's imagination. It is one of those books that leaves you breathless while you think about it for the next few days. And most importantly, it leaves you with a major question for you to decide... Is Wicked really good?    Rating: 5 stars - I loved it! Buy a copy!    To see this post in context, visit: [...]

B005J29HD0|5.0|While opening the excellent 2 LP package, I was struck by the strangeness of these original mid-60s era recordings being released as a \\"new\\" record in 2011. Only a record of this legend, with these odd recordings, could have been released like this. The music runs the gamut from delightfully corny to absolutely, stunningly beautiful. It is indeed incredible music - a masterpiece of Americana married to Dali. Some of the songs were left incomplete, but the musical genius of Brian Wilson is on full display, with or without lyrics. In a contemporary context, this album will never be revered as much the vaunted \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" or even the Beach Boys own \\"Pet Sounds\\", but the future may be much kinder to this once and future Greatest Record of All Time...
0061743526|5.0|Got the book on with speed and efficiency. Good quality with the money well worth it. Nothing much to really ask for!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|So how did a guy who was described by one of his closest friends as \\"reflexively cruel and harmful to some people\\" and by the mother of his first child as \\"an enlightened being who was cruel\\"; who honed a \\"trick of using stares and silences to master other people\\"; who threw a \\"tantrum\\" when Apple's first president gave him employee badge #2 while Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak got badge #1, then demanded, and got, badge #0;  who shouted down strangers at business meetings by yelling \\"Let's stop this b----s----!\\" and wooed engineering prospects by telling them \\"Everything you've ever done in your life is s---, so why don't you come work for me?\\"; who parked his car in the handicapped spot at the front of his building so frequently that an Apple employee \\"painted over the handicapped wheelchair symbol with a Mercedes logo\\"; who was considered by his first boss at that same company to be \\"not a great engineer\\"...how, exactly, did Steven P. Jobs become the unstoppable force who, by intelligence, intuition and sheer willpower lead the creation of not one, but two dominate companies of their times, and directly affect the lives of more human beings than any other individual of his generation?   For the answer to that question, read this book.  It's a terrific story, and Isaacson tells the story very, very well--mainly by letting other voices do the talking.  The book flows quickly and without a hitch, because even though the author spent a great deal of time with Jobs in the waning days of his life, he does not interject himself, except when absolutely necessary to tell the story.   Also, it's not written as a straight chronology: it jumps ahead at times--for example, to explain Jobs' bond with Jony Ive, Apple's chief design guru, before going back to the `aha' moments that led to the iPod, the design of which Ive and Jobs shaped together--and always to good effect.   And Isaacson sugarcoats very little.   Along the way, you'll learn where Jobs got his love of craftsmanship; how the first product Wozniak and Jobs came up with was in fact illegal; why Apple was named \\"Apple\\"; how employees manipulated Jobs to (sometimes) reach the conclusion they thought he should reach; why the first iPod was all-white (even the ear-buds); how Jobs' work at NeXT and Pixar informed his return to Apple; how Jobs' exile in Italy after his first Apple career influenced the floors you walk on today in every Apple store; why Jobs wore turtlenecks; what he told the CEO of Corning while successfully persuading him to resurrect a failed Corning glass R&D project into what became the rugged but clear glass screen on your iPhone; and, over and over, how the perfectionist Jobs could obsess over any detail when it came to the design of a product, a hotel room, a business card--even an oxygen mask in the hospital as he lay near death.   Indeed, the word \\"obsess\\" appears nine times in this book, the word \\"tantrum\\" eight times, and the phrase \\"Jobs insisted\\" appears--I am not making this up--28 times in the book.   Still, the word that sticks in the mind after reading all of Steve Jobs is neither.  In fact, it is in no way negative. The word is \\"magical,\\" and it appears 19 times in the book, including three times when it's used by Jobs describing a technology or a product. But the most poignant and powerful use of the word comes from Jobs' wife who, in explaining how he at first avoided coming to terms with his initial cancer diagnosis--in a similar fashion to the way he routinely avoided coming to terms with the limitations of fellow human beings, thereby pushing them into making products that literally changed the world--called it, \\"his magical thinking.\\"   So read this book.  If you're a teenager who \\"thinks different\\" and wants to understand how Jobs took that same quality and changed it from a liability to a world-changing asset; if you're a geek who wants to understand how Jobs identified break-through technologies and made them commercial; if you're an investor who wants to understand how a company learns less from great success than from failure; if you're a board member who wants to understand how destructive a creative genius can be, and how to harness that genius without destroying a company; if you're a CEO who wants to discover what makes a product a flop like Microsoft's Zune instead of a hit like the iPod; if you're a design student who doesn't care about business but wants to understand why the iPad feels so comfortable to pick up (hint: rounded edges); if you're an advertiser who wants to understand how two frames can be the difference between a \\"great\\" TV commercial and a bad one\\"; if you don't care about any of that but just want to understand how all these products came to be...read this book.   It's great.  Maybe even insanely great.

B00005OWIU|5.0|The music was beautiful and the quality was excellent. There was a classically mesmerizing haunting feel to it which was so very Harry Potter-ish even to those unfamiliar with the movie.
0156027321|5.0|Just to add to the many reviews already written, I thought I would share what I heard Yann Martel say about the book when I went to a literary talk with him. He relayed how he had grown up in a very secular society (Canada) and that there were no religious or spiritual references in his upbringing as his family were (are) very pragmatic and scientific in their approach to life. This would explain his use of Pi, the exacting mathematical theory which represents how Yann thought and felt when he was young. Then, at some point he found himself drifting along in his twenties without much clear direction when he encountered religion and the spiritual life. He says he found this to be deeply challenging and yet intriguing. Thereafter he embarked on a journey of enquiry, travelling extensively in order to investigate various religions in an attempt to understand why whole societies of people would apply so much meaning to that which had no evidence,and believe with conviction something with no scientific basis. He wanted to understand the mindset of religious people individually as well as collectively, and through his adventures he says he became fascinated and enchanted by all the world religions. This book is represents that collision of Yanns worlds - both literal and scientific ; and also mythical and spiritual. The layering of meanings, the story within a story within another story, and the open ended questions the readers are left with are synonymous with the levels of belief and disbelief within our society, and even of Yanns own beliefs. A tight magical read and perhaps my favourite book ever.
B00559B9N8|5.0|This is a fabulous book, I took a look into it when my daughter was reading it and was hooked!  The only reason I'm writing this review though is to beg you to buy the book edition and NOT the Kindle,  I don't know  how books are transferred onto Kindle and have had little trouble in the past but the Kindle version reads like it has been proof read by a robot! 'From' is invariably 'form', sometimes names are capitalised sometimes not.'She unlocked the shop door and towed (threw) the wet boots onto the pavement' 'There seemed no reason to sell the sop(shop)\\" She took roosts (roots)from all the bags'. You get the picture. Does it spoil the read? Yes! Buy the book - a great airplane read.
0307593312|5.0|1Q84 is about two people whose actions, some harmless, some not, lead them down paths that eventually trap them in an alternate world.  It's a hard-edge world and Murakami does not spare his characters or the reader.   It begins when Aomame, avoiding gridlock traffic, descends a metal staircase buffeted by wind and traffic exhaust to reach her assignment on time.  Things of course are not as they appear, and while Aomame looks like a young professional, the nature of her business is much more deadly.  As the story unfolds, both Aomame's and Tengo's demeaning childhood experiences are revealed.  How these early experiences shape their adult personalities and lives is the crux of the story, impelling first Aomame, then Tengo, into a parallel existence, peopled by both normal and surreal beings.    Every person in the book - whether it's Tengo's editor Komatsu, who convinces Tengo to take an ethically questionable writing assignment - the underworld figure of Ushikawa, who is an astute detective but with little moral restraint, the dowager who with Aomame's help removes abusive men from their earthly existence, or Tamaru the deadly bodyguard with refined sensibilities - they are all fully fleshed out.  Murakami knows his characters inside and out, why they do what they do, and so will the reader.  It's a comment on life and, while everyone makes his or her own choices, some, like Ushikawa who is physically ugly and shunned by everyone, seem to have a pre-destined fate.  Realistic detail anchors the world and makes it believable.  There is nothing flowery and sharp edges are not softened, yet it is mystical, ethereal, and filled with deep longing.  Like many classics, it will either resonate and the specter remain long after the last page, or it will not.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|First off, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, the type that stood in line at midnight each time a new book was released and was probably 1/2-3/4 through the book by the time the sun came up in the morning.  I have purchased each of the HP movies and watch them pretty regularly.  But the release of the last movie with an \\"Ultraviolet\\" digital copy that doesn't support iTunes really put me off - why now?  I was really tempted to just download the iTunes version but it wasn't in HD and for the HP movies, I like the ability to put it in my Blu-Ray player sometimes.......   I researched it and purchased my Blu-Ray \\"Triple Pack\\" from Amazon UK, doesn't ship until 12/1/11 - disc is region free and the digital copy is allegedly compatible with iTunes (unlike the Amazon US version) and it was only $21.00 after currency conversion.  I wanted the Blu-Ray for my library but I keep all my movies on iTunes on a Mac Mini HTPC (which sadly doesn't support Blu-Ray) I have hooked up to my Sony LCD - I needed the TRUE digital copy (even though it's not HD) for my iPhone - I will NEVER purchase an Ultraviolet Blu-Ray.  Admittedly, I'm an Apple fanboi.....  If the \\"Digital Copy\\" doesn't work (but nothing I've researched says it will not) I'll just \\"Handbrake\\" it......  I purchased the disc, so I don't mind it if I have to do that to get it into iTunes.  Warner Bros should have thought about this when they decided to use Ultraviolet - True digital copies actually fight piracy because they have DRM, and they provide an incentive for people to actually buy their product.  Junk like Ultraviolet just discourages otherwise honest people by forcing them to do something they otherwise wouldn't do to get the product the way THEY, not the way the studios want it.  Ultraviolet is just another way for the studios to control their product after they've sold it - fortunately, THAT genie cannot be put back in the bottle.  If you're honest, aren't going to steal, and really want the true digital copy, just by the combo-pack from Amazon UK.......  Warner Bros/JK Rowling still get their money (as they should), but as a customer, you get the movie the way you want it........
0446573019|3.0|I agree with the other reviewer who called John Puller a Jack Reacher clone, but hey, I like Jack Reacher books.  For my taste, this is not Baducci's best effort but it's pretty darn good. The last one I read, True blue, was so far from the reality of real police work and procedures I didn't even finish it.  I'm still waiting for something as good as the Camel Club series, but this wasn't bad.  If Amazon had a 3.5 stars rating, I would have gone there.

1400052181|5.0|I rarely read non fiction, and I cannot even remember why and how I discovered this book.  I am so glad I did.  It took me inside the life of poor, uneducated Henrietta Lacks and her family.  It also opened me up to what really goes on behind the scenes in medical science.  Unlike other reviewers, I loved all the detail in the book, as I felt I was being educated and challenged on every page.  The writing is superb, and I often felt I was reading fiction.  I could not put this book down.  What remains with me are tears and sadness for the Lacks family, anger at our treatment of these unknowing subjects, and many thoughts about the medical ethics and science behind the cures.  This book will stay with me forever, and I thank the author for challenging us all to think and reflect on this.  Read this book!  Tell your kids to read this book!  It should be required reading.
B005I64U5C|4.0|I Like Ryan Renolds anyways, I thought this was a good film, i liked the Bright Colors and I thought the acting was ok, not Great, 3D was Excellent. This is not the proper Rating for this movie however alot of people are commenting on the digital copy instead of the movie witch i dont understand and giveing it a 1 because of this, they say nothing of the movie at all, But anyhow, all and all Good Movie if you like Ry Renolds, i thought he properly fit the film!!! if you ever read the comics, he looks just like him!!!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|First off, I find it slightly amusing that Amazon has the rating system for this gaming headset require the reviewer to rate \\"How much fun is this game?\\" and \\"How do you rate this game overall?\\"  Perhaps because this is in the video game section of Amazon, I suppose.  Obviously, I chose 5 stars, though those 5 stars cannot be applied to a concept that is moot in regard to the product, I still want the product to have 5 stars overall.  I have only had this headset for a couple weeks.  Since then, however, I have put it to extensive use: I've used this headset for playing Battlefield 3, Uncharted 3, Modern Warfare 3, and I have watched Netflix television shows and movies.  As Uncharted 3 was listed, I think you realize that I have used this for PS3.    The Physical:  The cord for the headset is plenty long.  The remote is integrated into the cord; there is no chance of losing it.  Except if you lose the cord, which is attached to the headset, then you've lost the entire headset.  Why'd you do that?  The remote not only contains the volume adjustment wheel, but also a chat volume wheel, a bass adjustment wheel, a mute tab, and a surround sound type tab.  The remote also has a clip so that you can clip it on your shirt or something.  The only downnside to the remote, in my experience, is that if you don't clip it to something, as I often do not, and let it lay across your lap or whatever, the volume wheels can be adjusted as you move your body or if the remote falls off your lap to the floor.  I don't mean the wheels adjust via gravity or motion itself, but that your motion may cause your leg to rub against the wheel.  This is entirely the user's fault and didn't effect my rating, but a sudden onslaught of noise is a sudden onslaught of noise.  The Quality:  This headset is truly phenomenal.  The sound quality is not to be compared.  Well, except perhaps to a very expensive headset, but, who honestly has hundreds of dollars for something like that?  Sadly, not I.

Or, rather, it allows you to become more immersed into whatever game you are playing, increasing your attention to the small details.  And there are details.  You really will never appreciate the sound capabilities of a game like BF3 or UC3 without a headset such as this one to consolidate the sound right into your ear canals.  Great value.  I've done a lot of research. So save yourself some time and buy this headset.  =)  -Cheeers!
B005XY67WI|5.0|Once more I was fortunate to see this amazing concert live in San Diego, CA and Tijuana, Mexico. Shakira humbly reaches out to her fans throughout the entire night and is entirely devout to her audience. This performance shatters her stereotype as a \\"hip shaker\\". Although the stage set up was simple, Shakira was and continues to be the firework that makes the crowd roar. If you are a Shakira fan no need to convince you to buy because chances are you have 2 copies pre-ordered already, for everyone else this is a must have as a demonstration that true talent still exists. Not only did she deconstruct all her songs, she flawlessly re mastered them into a raw electric eargasm. Not to mention that she actually sings and dances from start to finish, there is no doubt that this petite woman packs the power of the sun not only in her voice but her soul as well. 5 stars does not do this justice!  Bravo Shakira que continue saliendo el sol!

B005FUTBV4|3.0|I am a huge Kevin Smith fan, and so I was intrigued to see what this film had to offer. The premise is quite clever and unique (small town, religious nutcases, entrapping folks for torture/murder, etc). In terms of gore, the film does not have much at all. This is quite a good thing, as it leaves room for a more chilling psychological journey. I found the religious zealots to be quite scary, and of course, John Goodman's acting as a Gov't official was superb! All in all, the diologue was sparse and a little trite, the film different, worth at least one viewing. This film has zero comedy in it which is quite a departure from Smith. Fans of his trademark monologue will find it being delivered by Goodman in the closing scene.
0385535139|5.0|Well, I had great plans to jot down some notes and quotes to share with you about John Grisham's newest book - The Litigators. Yeah, that didn't happen.... because it ended up being a non stop read for me - I picked it up on a Sunday morning and turned the last page late (late) that night.<br /><br />I was hooked from the opening pages. David Zinc has toiled away at a prestigious law firm in relative obscurity for the last five years. Until the morning he realizes he can't do it anymore and walks away. And lands at the firm of Finley & Figg -  ambulance chasers, divorce court specialists and anything else they can make a buck at. Although Wally and Oscar refer to the office as a 'boutique firm', they are anything but - Wally has just placed an ad for the firm on local bingo hall cards.<br /><br />When Wally gets wind of a potentially big case involving a big name cholesterol drug. It seems folks taking it are suffering heart damage and even death. If they can find a few cases of their own and ride on the coat tails of the big players in a mass claim action suit, they could all be rich. It seems simple enough......and that's enough of the plot given away.<br /><br />What made The Litigators a non stop read? The characters for sure. Wally and Oscar's tactics are cringe worthy, their actions walk a fine line between working for the law and breaking it, but you just can't help rooting for them in this David and Goliath fight. David is eminently likable as well. He is sense and reason, but with a new found freedom since escaping the big firm drudgery.The personal storyline involving his wife Helen also added much to the book.<br /><br />It seems like Grisham has a lot of fun writing The Litigators - there is a sly sense of humour underlying the entire book. I laughed out loud many times at the situations and dialogue. It was eye opening to see the legal maneuvering  - much of the machinations involving the drug companies and lawyers gave me pause and made me wonder how much of it is fact. Quite frightening actually.<br /><br />The Litigators is by far one of Grisham's best in my opinion (and I've read them all) An absolutely entertaining page turner that will be a well deserved best seller!tually.

Imagine the most boring characters in the most pointless situations you were forced to write about in your thearaputic drunk driving class and you'd have Freedom.  Or not.  True Freedom is not reading this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|After reading most of what Stephen King has written over the last many years, I find that getting into 11/22/63 is like hooking up with that old friend that you haven't seen in a couple of years; picking up the easy conversation after a brief thoughtful moment. No expectations, no requirements just continuing on like life-long best friends just hanging out together for most of their lives.   The story is very well written as all of his books are but with a comfortably smooth pulse that you can feel in every paragraph. This is a book that has been a joy to read, hard to put down and easy to recommend to others. It is definitely a jewel to be added to anyone's collection.

1904994679|5.0|i've been an enthusiast of the guiness book of world records since i was VERY young.  i used to spend countless hours perusing the annual records books - memorizing often useless details.  it turned out that, over the decades, many of those details have been useful, especially at parties and social gatherings.  several times the information has been useful in academic settings.  imagine how thrilled i was when my children both expressed an interest in the guiness book of world records.  the format changed some years ago - it's much easier to read, page through, perhaps it has a few less records but it has bigger, brighter, and more photogenic images that grab the attention of kids!  year after year, it's not significantly different.  most of us can go 2-3 years without a new volume.  the quality of the information, images, and the books itself is outstanding.  this book, this year, is my effort to encourage my son to read a bit more.  i give everything a grade, and i believe that this merits a solid \\"A\\".  i believe that the guiness book of world records is excellent in detail and quality, and ought to be considered essential to public libraries, school libraries, and homes of individuals with an interest in \\"trivia\\".

031603438X|5.0|A very fun read. Keef does a nice job balancing the debauchery with the artistry. 500 pages of drunken high excesses would be dull as would 500 pages of song craft and musicianship. But he explores both with passion and humor. Anyone who plays guitar will appreciate some of his open tuning commentary and his exploration of alternate tuning. He's a bad boy that you can't help love.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The point of buying the movie with a digital copy is so I can take the movie with my on my iPad and iPhone on a business trip and watch while on a plane or train, or at a hotel with the typical miserable Wifi connection.

B006671NPM|5.0|**Actual Review of 3D Bluray release**<br /><br />The final chapter of the Harry Potter series is here.  The film was well done, relaying the dark tone of the story.  I first saw this movie on Bluray in 2D.<br /><br />After my 3 year son threw one of his toys into my flat-screen TV (lucky for him I was not a witness to his tantrum and destruction of a HDTV I paid nearly $4000 for.)<br /><br />This lead to me having a good excuse to buy the latest tech.  Now kitted out with a 70\\" 3D compatible HDTV and 3D Bluray I was able to experience a format that I has dismissed as a fad.  I had a few titles already in 3D and to my great surprise the 3D effects of Active Shutter 3D glasses were astounding rivaling the 3D features at Disneyland's Kodak Theatre (Captain Eo, and Honey I shrunk the audience.)<br /><br />I got my hands on Harry Potter 7 parts 1 & 2 anticipating breathtaking 3D effects, boy was I sorely disappointed.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one was so poorly 3D encoded that I had to check my glasses to make sure they were charged, checked the TV to make sure it was in 3D mode.  That was how poor the 3D effects were.  It is no wonder Part 1 was never released in the theater in 3D.  I thought \\"This must just be a poor quality 2D to 3D conversion after the film was completed.  Now I figured \\"They had to have filmed part 2 with 3D cameras, they had to.\\"  I was wrong, save a few gags (e.g. the floating plate Professor Snape's tears are poured into to show Harry Professor Snape's memories and Voldemort's snake striking out) and even those were very poor.  There is nothing to be gained in purchasing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 3D.  The quality of the 2D transfers from film to Bluray are excellent.  Unless you can find the 3D for the same price, save your money, buy the 2D set.<br /><br />And those who are taking shots at this movie and giving it 1 star because of it having a Ultraviolet code, enough already.  Just the fact that Warner Bros. has chosen to support the Ultraviolet streaming service, yes it's a streaming service not a digital copy, does not warrant 1 star reviews.  WB has been issuing iTunes codes and in some cases Plays for sure discs when asked.  I have gotten iTunes codes for every Bluray and DVD that had a redemption code for the UV streaming service.  Many people may look to buy a copy of this film, see the sub 3 star rating, and not purchase this excellent film.  Save you 1 star ratings for films like The Wicker Man or Ishtar.  Unfortunately UV may be here to stay, be happy that most DVD and Bluray sets include both UV and regular digital copies.  Enough trolling.chosen to support the Ultraviolet streaming service, yes it's a streaming service not a digital copy, does not warrant 1 star reviews.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This being the last Harry Potter movie ever one would think that it would be the best of all time.  This is true Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was the best Harry Potter movie by far.  The special effects in the film were impeccable and the battle scenes really came to life.  The actors did a wonderful job making every scene believable and making the viewers think that there really is a magical world out there.  The emotion that the actors showed during the last battle was amazing.  The viewer can really see how much the characters cared about each other.  After reading the books the movie definitely lived up the the novel.  The details were spectacular and they really kept you on the edge of your seat.  The ending of the movie was the part that finished the stories for good.  The viewers knew that that was the end and there was nothing left to the imagination of the viewers.  After eight long movies a cliff hanger ending would not be something that the fans would want to see.  This movie was the best Harry Potter movie by far.  Every Harry Potter fan must see this movie.
B0065FFMR0|4.0|In my reviews of earlier episodes, I've complained about quasi-interesting characters and hyper-speed exposition. With this episode, though, I've found that what may not be a complex narrative is still a truly engaging one. I can see the interpersonal elements more clearly, too, with Vivien emerging as the level head in her marriage with Ben and the relationship between Tate and Violet taking the drama of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" into a tense variant. Let's not forget Constance; I hate her a lot less after her visit with a spiritual medium. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't give up on this show before it got to live up to its promise.

0393061310|3.0|His contention that geography is a major determinant in human societies is quite interesting and relevant, but on the other hand I think he overstates his case.  He also repeats his arguments, and repeats them, and repeats them again.  So much so that I could not finish it because it had gotten so boring.  I think he could've shortened the book to roughly 1/3 its current length (where were the editors??)  There are many arguments that could considerably water down Diamond's, many of which are contained in the online reviews.  I will add a few more.  For instance, his case that most of the easily domesticable grains are contained in the fertile crescent.  Is this because the wild versions are truly more edible, or because they have been hybridized with the domestic varieties?  He doesn't elaborate enough on the genetics research for one to make a judgement.  He also states that there are no large domesticable animals in N. America.  What about caribou?  A very closely related species, the reindeer, (Wikipedia claims that they are the same) has been domesticated in Europe.  It is also quite probable that the bison could also have been domesticated, and they were probably well on their way to being so when the white man showed up.  Personally, I think that the white race IS different, and not necessarily in a good way.  He doesn't mention anything about what has been lost in the bargain.  When I first heard about the Dreaming, I knew exactly what it was and what it meant.  I also realize, that as a modern, white Westerner, I no longer have access to this state of mind.  To quote Neil Young: \\"They give you this, but you pay for that...\\"  Perhaps some cultures refused to \\"progress\\" because they knew what they would have to give up in return.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I came to this series late. I only started reading Book 1, A Game of Thrones, a year ago. So, I have the benefit of reading all 5 books in a go.<br /><br />After a great roller coaster ride from Book 1,2 and 3, the series seemed to grind to a slow descend starting with Book 4. There are a lot of hope that the story and action would start to pick up in Book 5, A Dance With Dragons. I'm sorry to say that it doesn't. This book is filled with pointless story arc, most notably the one with the Dornish Prince. His arc is like the Brienne arc in Book 4. A wild goose chase around a bush for no particular reasons except as filler to beef up the number of pages.<br /><br />Book 5 continues to have filler by creating another new character - another dragon descendant (it seems the babe, Price Aegon, survived) - so here's another arc that should be interesting but it turned out boring to me because it is drowned by other point of views - more Ironmen, more Davos Seaworth, even more frolicking in Meereen. In fact, half the book was dedicated to Daenerys not doing anything in Meereen except brooding and thinking about sex and eating and drinking.<br /><br />I started to skip pages, which made me sad, because I really like this series and was hoping that the story would move along. Combined, both Book 4 and 5 are 2,000 pages long. But 80% of the pages are pointless rambling and the story stood still!<br /><br />Disappointing.. I wish I didn't pay full price!

0525423842|1.0|Somehow we selected this book for our lit club reading as my 7th and 8th graders work their way through a variety of mysteries. None of the students liked the book, finding it simplistic yet self-contradictory, unrealistic, and uncompelling.  However, it did actually inspire the students to think critically about authorial intent.  Even my 7th graders could tell there was something dodgy about Grisham's view of Theodore Boone's world.<br /><br />Let's start with the sexism- particularly poisonous in a book for adolescents! Yes, Theo's mother is a token \\"strong female character\\".... supposedly. While she's described as a good lawyer and a fierce defender of divorced wives, she plays practically no role in the book.  I can't even remember her name. And while I can remember April, Theo's \\"best friend\\", I almost wish I couldn't. She shows up long enough to be needy and frail, and to give Grisham a chance to point out how important it is for a girl to look like a girl even in jeans. Then she disappears! Theo is caught up in a complicated moral and legal dilemma, and never once mentions it to his \\"best friend\\".  The clear implication is that women are weak and helpless and there to be coddled but certainly not confided in or treated as an equal.  And don't get me started on Hallie, the ditzy \\"popular girl\\" whom Theo finds \\"even cuter\\" after she asks questions he deems idiotic! It's as though Grisham has been told that his books should include female characters but has NO IDEA how to actually treat these characters like regular humans.<br /><br />Then there's the us vs them attitude Grisham uses to divide the world into good people and bad people. Apart from the drug charges, all the other complaints against April's parents boil down to \\"they're weird and different and that's bad\\". Even the 13 year olds in Theo's class are already sorted!  There are the good students with talents who receive names and apparently have a future waiting for them- and then there are the \\"hopeless nerds and at least one potential felon\\" who are already doomed forever.<br /><br />I could go on and on.  Grisham comes across as a grade A stupidface in this book. I'm assuming most of his novels have gripping plots which make his singularly un-nuanced view of the world seem unimportant, but this book does not.<br /><br />In an attempt to make the most of our choice, I pointed out two things I liked at our first meeting and the assignment we gave the kids was to find something they liked for next time- most of them had difficulty doing so. I found Grisham's worldview deeply offensive and the kids just labeled the book as \\"bad\\".<br /><br />Overall a terrible, terrible book.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|This is not a review of this wonderful movie. It's a warning for anyone who wants to buy this movie to get a digital copy along with the actual disc. Now to get your digital copy you have to open 2 accounts, one with Flixster and one with Ultraviolet. Forget it!   I will not be buying any products from Warner Bros. in the future, they have lost my business. I will continue buy movies from studios that either let me easily download the digital copy I paid for or include it on a disc. These studios are just too Greedy!
1595826971|5.0|Really didn't know what to expect when I got this book but knowing the game revolved around the art style I knew it would at least be interesting. Most games have very sub par art books especially the one's that are preorder items and such but this book really pulls out all the stops. This book isn't just a bunch of sketches and advertisement art with in game screen shots, it is a well written and interesting and informed book with some large unused art. Some haunting imagery and explanations of the thought process behind the creation and why they decided to go with the designs they chose for the game. If you like some serious art books, Dark Horse really did a great job on this and their work on the Avatar The Last Air Bender Book was also a great book. Check it out.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|This is the worst film I've ever watched. Ed Wood couldn't have taken this story and made anything less watchable. A stellar cast failed to rescue this from the pit. I recommend you save your money and find something else to watch.
B005P89F1C|5.0|I honestly think this is his best record since he's been in the music industry. I'm a big belieber (Justin Bieber fan) and of course I've heard all of his albums and demos. His debut EP, My World, and his full length album, My World 2.0, were good but not as much as this one. You can actually tell how much he and his voice have grown up in this past 2 years and how even the lyrics' quality is better. He's growing up and I think he shows it with his music. He's not the \\"baby, baby, baby ohhh\\" kid anymore, he's a young man now.  I recommend people to listen to this album and judge him on this, and actually enjoy some good christmas stuff. I can imagine me and my family on Christmas eve listening to this all night long.  And something I really love about this album is that portions of the money Justin gets are going to different CHARITIES and   organizations such as Make A Wish, Pencils Of Promise and many more. He's taking the time to give back to others who are not lucky enough to actually have gifts on Christmas and something to celebrate. CHEERS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!
B001P06GX4|4.0|Picked up this game a few years ago when it was on sale because we needed something interesting to do at a family Christmas gathering which usually means participating in games.   Up to four players can play this game. Each person chooses their colored pieces and the object of the game is to get as many of your oddly shaped tiles on the board as you can. Only the corners of your own pieces can touch (and they HAVE to touch... you cannot randomly place a piece), they cannot be side by side. If you're competitive there may be some \\"table talk\\" involved so that some of you team up against one player and try to \\"block\\" them; making it so they have no place to put their pieces. My family quite enjoyed this aspect of it, and we would usually work together against the person who was always winning.  PROS:  ~Easy to Use and Understand  ~Challenging and Makes You Think (to plan your next moves)  ~For multiple players  CONS:  ~It might become time consuming closer to the finish as more pieces are on the board which makes it more difficult to find a spot that works.
B005974CDU|2.0|My reaction when I heard Portny was leaving was somewhat mixed. I was kind of impressed with the direction they were taking musically with Black Clouds, specifically Mikey's drumming. But, I hated his shouting or chanting or whatever the flipping hell it is he does on albums nowadays, and not just on Dream Theater, I've heard other projects he's ruined just by thinking he can sing too. Case in point, the Vocal section at 11:20 into Nightmare to Are,ember. He must have been listening to too much Opeth because he cannot do the death growl well.<br /><br />So anyways, having listened to this album quite a few times, I'll admit is it slightly better than past few? Yes, but is it a good album? Well...<br /><br />On the Backs of Angels- a very good tune. Begins with a very relaxed and laid back sounding acoustic intro, which kicks into a very typical DT song. Very reminiscent of Six Degrees, and worth checking out for sure.<br /><br />Build Me Up Break Me Down- awesome riff, that's about it. Honestly, this sounds more like something you'd hear in a JL solo disc. The chorus especially is just recycled from Strange Deja Vu and the BUIIILD! MEEEE! UP! part just ruins the whole thing.<br /><br />Lost Not Forgotten: I literally cant remember this song at all.<br /><br />This is the Life: Boring city.<br /><br />Bridges in the Sky: this is a very interesting track, to me at least. I like the middle eastern intro, and the theme that rings throughout the song, HOWEVER, they almost slip back into Systematic Chaos territory there's a long and drawn out instrumental section, which feels really out of place and just wedged in to pad the song out. Still, there's some amazing vocal melodies andmthe outro is nice too, so i guess it's worth checking out.<br /><br />Outcry: I can't remember this song at all. Not sure if I should Listen to it for this review ether...<br /><br />Far From Heaven: SNOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRREEEEEE.<br /><br />Breaking All Illusions: what I'm talking about right here! Excellent, fun, silly and catchy tune. Very reminiscent of the old time DT. I'm very fond of the 70s feel it has too. Guaranteed, the whole album should be like this.<br /><br />Beneath the Surface, well, that's very consistent now, 3 ballads on a 9 track album. That said, this is the best of those ballads. Very heart wrenching, amazing vocals and lyrics. Definitely sure to wake up your tear ducts too.<br /><br />Alright, I've said enough about the songs. The new drummer? Well, I cant really tell how he is, because he doesn't sound much different than Portnoy. That said, he doesn't think he can sing, and I shows, as well as he doesn't go all crazy with the double bass every 6 seconds.<br /><br />That said, the problem with this album is that it's just not memorable at all. I mean sure, you'll enjoy certain songs when listening to them, but you won't remember much about them. Only OTBOA, BITS, BAI and BTS Manage to be truly Memorable, but not worth the prices of the whole album.<br /><br />In addition most of the songs are too long and they don't need to be. I counted at least 3 generic verse/chorus/verse/chorus/verse/chorus tunes, which isn't good for flipping 9 minutes. Only one band gets away with long songs nowadays, and that band would be Iron Maiden, due to one word: interestingness. Don't believe me, listen to The Man Who Would Be King and Isle of Avalon off The Final Frontier, those songs are well over 8 minutes and offer complexity worthy of DT themselves.<br /><br />As well as the fact that plenty of the songs are very unoriginal. BMUBMD is ripped off from Train of Thought with the chorus of Strange Deja Vu thrown in for extra measure. BITD and OTBOA are that wasn't done on Six Degrees, and the rest is just...

B003Y5H57Y|5.0|Thats one of the early lines in the film from Kate,  it could also be asked about making a prequel to the much loved '82 classic. Just like in the movie, my answer is \\"yes I do\\". Making a film this many years after a classic and trying to make the story before that movie is challenging. I had no great expectations for this film going into the theater. When watching The Thing from '82 you had to wonder about the Norwegians and the back story, thats why this film is interesting.   Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate a paleontologist, brought to Antartica to help in bringing a frozen \\"thing\\" out of the ice. She starts out observing and asking questions while Dr. Halvorson conducts his analysis of the specimen. As the story unfolds however, its Kate that uses her head and leads the group. The question throughout the film is- who is human? Nobody is who they seem all the way til the end. And some people you think aren't human, turn out to be only to be different later. The effects and cgi are executed very well here. The examination of a consumed human within a thing is creepy. They even have to cut through a casing around the human- sick stuff. The star of the movie is definately Winstead, although the cast is collectively good. The casting was very good for a film that mixes characters from different countries. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the group gathers for a test to see who is human. This is where Winstead is at her best. Great work here.  And the best weapon against these things is THE FLAMETHROWER! Great action throughout the movie- you won't be disappointed. Theres even some time spent in the craft these visitors came to Antartica in. And you'll get that feeling of isolation and fear that the '82 movie was effective at. Not to mention not everyone speaks English which adds another dimension. What could be worse than being in the freezing cold, thousands of miles from civilization and  not knowing if the person next to you is human? The movie doesn't end with the credits. Most the people at the theater left at this time. But there is a bridging of this film straight into the '82 film. The dog being chased by the helicopter is here. \\"Thats no dog!\\"  Some production notes that I thought were interesting. There was a million screen captures of the '82 film on a lap top. That was used to create as close as possible, the Norwegian camp.  The film used practical effects as much as possible over CGI. The movie was shot in Toronto. The lead character of Kate was inspired by Weaver's character in the Aliens films. John Carpenter wanted to make an appearance in the film, but this didn't happen because of scheduling.   4 1/2 stars

Joe Strummer and Mick Jones collaborations are at their peak. \\"London Calling, Spanish Bombs, Train in a Vein, Lost In the Supermarket\\"  are all pop/punk classics. The rest of the album is just as amazing. If you haven't listened to this yet, you have to. It's an essential piece of work.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|This is a great headset and to my knowledge there isn't a better wireless headset on the market.  It will definitely give you an edge in just about any 1st person shooter game.  However this is not true surround sound and calling it 7.1 surround is a stretch.  It is simulated surround only.  It only has 2 speakers folks!<br /><br />The pros:<br />-  Outstanding sound quality and definition.<br />-  Good battery life (about 24 hours of solid use)<br />-  Good microphone noise canceling for the recipients of your war cries.  The best I've used so far.<br />-  Good online chat sound quality for listening to others.  The voice volume balances to your master volume.  Also the game chat voices seem to come from the center rather than just your left or right ear.  It doesn't drown out sticks cracking under a stalking predators feet.<br />-  The SIMULATED surround works very well although not perfect.<br />-  They have been durable.  (I have had mine for about 1 1/2 years and they are still going strong)<br />-  They are great for those late night sessions when the kids and wife are sleeping .  Just try not to talk too loud! :)  Great for late night TV/movies too!<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  As mentioned before it is NOT TRUE SURROUND.  It is advertised as 7.1 which is total bogus.  Its simulated surround with two 50mm speakers only.  The simulated surround does work exceptionally well though.  Be sure to use Toslink to connect the transmitter or you may end up with stereo sound only.<br />-  Depending on your setup, you may need to purchase a separate Toslink adapter to connect the transmitter. (Fortunately this didn't apply to me)<br />-  No warning before battery failure.  It just shuts off abruptly.  (I recommend purchasing hybrid rechargeable batteries since they maintain their charged shelf life much better than typical rechargeable batteries.  They will save you tons of money in the long run over alkaline batteries too. You can always keep a fresh set charged and on standby.)<br />-  The mute switch/volume control is mounted on the cord.  (They sell an optional adapter on the turtle beach website.  I highly recommend this little option as it's far superior to the factory cord mounted mute/volume control).<br />-  Limited Range at around 25-30'.  I guess this is adequate for most but my needs require about 20 more feet.<br />-  Prone to interference from some WiFi.  This will generally manifest itself as a loud pop (or series of pops) in your ears.  It will usually change channels and resolve the problem on its own.  It is quite annoying when it does happen though.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a good headset (not great).  However, it's probably the best wireless set you'll find at this price range.  Turtle Beach claims they had to simulate surround sound to preserve battery life and weight.  I would gladly wear a heavier set with true surround if they were made available at a reasonable price.  But they have done an excellent job for what this is hence the 4 star review.  I was borderline on giving this a 3 or 2 star review just for their misleading advertising but since it performs so well, I kept it at 4.<br /><br />I don't know if they are worth the asking price, but at the time of this writing they really don't have much competition. So it's the best you're currently going to do at this price range.  While not a \\"must have\\", I would purchase this again.the cord.  (They sell an optional adapter on the turtle beach website.

0062112430|5.0|I have to start out by saying that no other author can make me cry like Lauren Oliver can. I never cry when I read, so this is a major achievement for an author - and for me to cry at both her books, well, it's unheard of. Anyway, onto the proper review.  I loved Delirium right from the get go. Admittedly, some of the world-building at the start was a bit slow, but I could read Lauren's prose all day so it didn't feel like a chore to read. The world-building was integrated seamlessly into the story and honestly loved every word of it. I also enjoyed the paragraphs above each chapter that were supposedly from this new world's handbooks and literature, they definitely gave me more insight into the world of Delirium.  Lauren has such a talent for creating believable characters, from the protagonist, Lena, to her best friend, family and every other character. Even the main characters feel rich and well-developed, like a book could be written about each of them as well. I especially like Hana, Lena's best friend. She was fun and rebellious, and for a while I wondered why the author didn't focus the novel on her. And although I loved her, I soon realized why Lena needed to be the main focus. Lena was very goody-good and never questioned the rules about the cure, and so she had the most developing to do.   She had the most potential for growth throughout the story, while Hana was already there.  Now onto the part you really want to hear about - the love interest, Alex. He was utterly dreamy and I loved how natural his and Lena's relationship felt. It wasn't wham-bam, we're in love, but rather well thought out and their relationship developed slowly but steadily. It felt natural, but with the right amount of paranoia added to the meetings - they could not be caught under any circumstances. The suspense was also very well written - my heart was often pounding right along with these characters as they got themselves in and out of some sticky situations.  Honestly, I was not expecting Lauren Oliver's second novel to be as fantastic as her first, but I loved Delirium equally, if not more, than Before I Fall.   I fell in love with the characters and needed to know how their stories turned out. The only complaint I have is that we have to wait another year for the next installment in the series! This is a definite must-read.  (I received this novel free of charge via NetGalley. This in no way influenced my review.)

0446569909|3.0|I Am Ozzy is a hilarious autobiography by Ozzy Osbourne, former lead singer of Black Sabbath. It's filled with humourous anecdotes from his life before and after the band and is a more than enjoyable read.  I've read a few musician's autobiographies, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever made me laugh like this one did. I was laughing aloud at something on almost every page and I loved Ozzy's British humour. There were some great stories about his time in the band and although the book was filled with humour, Ozzy also showed a sensitivity when it came to writing about the hard things, like death and drug addiction.   Although I loved the book and the stories in it, I couldn't help get the feeling that maybe there was some extra spice being added to some of the anecdotes. I mean, yeah, he was a crazy rocker, but after all these years and all these drugs, can he really remember as much as he claims to? Maybe so, but for me it didn't quite feel right, so I was unable to fully `click' with the book. It's a real shame, because I really did enjoy Ozzy's easy writing style.  I Am Ozzy was a fun read, but overall something just didn't come together for me. If you're looking for a musician's autobiography that has plenty of hilarity go for this one, but just don't expect too much depth.
0307477479|2.0|I am giving this book 2 stars because I really thought I would like it when I first started reading. I was intrigued by Sasha and why she was stealing from people and acting the way she did. But then as each chapter went on, it was as if reading short stories about distantly connected characters that I cared less and less about. There was no character development or real insight into any of the characters or their actions. I thought the power point chapter was too clever for its own good and by the end of this book I was flipping through the pages just to finish it. I stopped caring about any of the characters then.   I realize that this book won many awards, but that does not mean I liked it.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I really like the look of the case and the feel of the case in my hand. It feels very sturdy and gives the iPhone a more robust grip. For white iPhones, this type of case is an absolute must since clear cases show off the elegance of the design of the phone itself without detracting. I'm quite happy with the case.<br /><br />But that's not to say that there aren't detracting points. Firstly, the case sticks out a lot right where you put your ear to talk. For those of you who rarely actually talk to others on your phone (yes, I'm talking to you, you crazy kids), this won't be a problem. But I've found that for conversations lasting longer than 10-15 minutes, this can actually hurt my ear. And while switching ears can help, I'm a right ear kind of talker, so it's not a perfect solution.<br /><br />And then there's the issue of dust, dirt, and grime. With a lot of iPhone cases, they often only have raised corners while leaving a lowered section of the case between the corners where dirt and dust can filter off the phone. But this case has a raised ridge around the entirety of the phone, so dirt and dust particles have nowhere to go but into the silicone lining itself. So you're going to end up taking your phone out and cleaning this more often than you probably like. Be forewarned.
0062011847|2.0|WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!  As a qualifier to what is a generally negative review, let me state that it is absolutely phenomenal that Mr. Pratchett has, for the most part, been able to keep up the quality and originality of the Discworld series through nearly 40 books. By this time in their careers, most series writers simply reuse the same riffs and vary the plot lines slightly. Pratchett always has something new to say in each book, even the most recent books that, alas, demonstrate the decline in his writing ability. And this review is only comparing Snuff against Pterry's wider body of work. Compared to most lousy fiction on bookshelves today, Snuff is a worthier read.   Unfortunately, Snuff follows the same sorry trend that became readily apparent in Unseen Academicals. Characters behaving totally out of character. The replacement of short, concise dialogue with long-winded monologues with tortured phrasing. Overemphasis of unimportant narrative details. And--the worst thing a comic writer can do--forced humor.   In Snuff, Mr. Pratchett commits so many literary gaffes and resorts to so many ill-advised shortcuts that one wonders whether an editor even looked at the manuscript before publishing it. An example: On the second pages, the Patrician, Lord Vetinari, is standing looking out of the window while talking to his clerk. A paragraph later, he is described as looking up from papers on his desk. Only seconds of time have between these two events, so either Vetinari moves faster than light or there is a sloppy continuity error. I'll lean toward the latter.   Or, here's an example of Mr. Pratchett's obsession with unimportant details: He spends nearly two pages in an unfunny dialogue between Sam Vimes and his buter, Willikens, over the whereabouts of an illegal crossbow.   One could go on and on about these small flaws, but they could be forgiven if they weren't eclipsed by larger problems. Such as the replacement of Pterry's usual sharp, quick dialogues with long-winded speeches that all too often seem completely out of character. Or the evolution of Sam Vimes from a tough copper who is haunted by fear of losing both his moral compass, his sanity, and his family to a supercop who is aided by a supernatural force he supposedly triumphed over--both physically and spiritually--in Thud! This 'force' is a cludgy narrative shortcut that allows Vimes to speak in foreign languages, and learn about criminal events that have no other witnesses. It's a terrible convention, and one that cheapens Vimes' historically sterling character.   The Vimes of Snuff is unrecognizable from earlier books. He has fully embraced his status of a member of the aristocracy, and has no problem pushing his power around. He is completely comfortable with himself; no more of the haunting doubts that made him such a compelling characters in past books. He is nearly invincible, so there's no tension at all--never do we fear that either he or his family are in danger or that he is not in total control of every situation. The whole 'crime' plot of Snuff is just a game--a diversion from an unwanted country vacation.    Unfortunately, I also believe that Mr. Pratchett's struggle with Alzheimer's has rapidly degraded his writing skills. Snuff reads like a book that has been dictated (in fact, Mr. Pratchett does dictate, since he can no longer type) rather than written. A dictated book requires an extremely strong and aggressive editor to down the excesses that can occur, and it seems that no one served in this role for Snuff, in the same way that no one seemed to served in a similar role for Unseen Academicals.    Is it fair to suggest an association between a writer's declining skills and a physical condition? Unfortunately, it has to be. Mr. Pratchett has chosen to continue publishing and, as such, everything he writes is an open book for criticism and speculation. Perhaps his writing skills would have declined even if he wasn't suffering from Alzheimer's--as said before, very few writers can keep their literary quality over the length of their career (as the latter works of Faulkner and Twain, among many others, clearly demonstrate).    Should Mr. Pratchett stop writing books? That's a question only he and his publishers can answer. It will be a sad day when we can no longer look forward to the next Discworld book. Paired with a very strong and assertive editor, he may be able to produce a few more Discworld books that avoid--or at least minimize--the problems that have occurred in his more recent work.   Then again, Mr. Pratchett's huge body of work, most of it highly original and exquisitely written, will withstand any sub-par works he continues to produce.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Im not a die hard Harry Potter fan but I love the movies. I can't believe all the negative reviews! I think this box set is amazing!

0452289963|1.0|I have yet to finish this book and I doubt I will. So I may not exactly be qualified to review- but the fact that I just cannot finish speaks volumes because I once read the whole entire information section of a phonebook when I was bored.<br /><br />According to the first three quarters of this book, I am not even writing this review. My EGO is writing this review. My ego needs attention. My ego seeks to set itself apart. My ego is looking for opposition and something to fight against. YOU are not reading this review- your ego is reading this review either to oppose me or agree with my because you long for attention and/or opposition. The word EGO is mentioned on every page of this book at least 6 times. At 309 pages I estimate you will read the word EGO 1,854 times.<br /><br />I guarantee you have had the same exact thoughts that Eckhart Tolle has put forth in this book. When you were sixteen. Smoking a joint. Listening to Pink Floyd.<br /><br />According to the book, every single thought you have, every action you do is because your ego is looking for gratification. The book states that the only time you are not in a state of ego controlled something-ness is when you are not thinking. YET you cannot be conscious of the fact that you are not thinking. Otherwise you ARE thinking. Do you see where I'm going here? Yeah, neither do I. And that is exactly how I felt while reading \\"A New Earth\\", like I had just drank a giant Purple For The People Slurpee then jumped on a merry-go-round going warp speed.<br /><br />I am not sure how \\"not thinking\\" constitutes a new earth (probably because I didn't read it all). By his own account and theories, Eckhart Tolle's writing this book....wait a second! Eckhart didn't write this book! His ego did! Unless he wasn't thinking the entire time he wrote it, which is entirely possible given the number of times I said: \\"What the fudge?\\" (not fudge but I think you get it)<br /><br />Since writing the first part of the review, I took it upon myself to skim a bit more. I had already been reading about the made up compound word \\"pain-body\\" and true to form the remainder of the book has the word \\"pain-body\\" in it at least 563 times. If you are OCD, you will find yourself traipsing through your day repeating the words ego and pain-body over and over and over. Because, you know how words sound really freaky and not like real words when you repeat them in your head like a thousand times? That is what happens while you are reading this book.<br /><br />Your pain-body is what is commonly referred to in the psycho-self-help industry as baggage. So now, instead of saying:\\"I can't date that chic because she has a ton of baggage.\\" , you say with an enlightened look on your bearded face in the voice of Mr. Van Driessen from Beavis and Butthead: \\"Hey you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is.\\" OOOPS! Mixed up my Science Fiction, I meant: \\"I can't date that chic, she has such an active pain-body.\\".<br /><br />Aaaaah, the pain-body. According to Eckhart Tolle, nothing bad happens in your life that isn't/wasn't the result of your \\"pain-body\\" in revolt. His example: Massive car collisions don't happen as the result of a lady (or dude) that was talking on his/her cell and running a red light. Massive car collisions are the result of two pain-bodies looking to crash and cash in on insurance. Therefore, I conclude that a massive pile-up of vehicles on a highway is the result of every single person in REM's video \\"Everybody Hurts\\" suddenly flooring the accelerator in that traffic jam they were in and causing mayhem.<br /><br />This book isn't completely without good advice and observation. Example: men have distorted religion into self-serving ideologies. I agree. And instead of just parenting your kid- just sit and look at him or her once in a while. I agree. Good advice. Problem is you have to wade through acid-trip like observations in order to glean these little gems.<br /><br />If only Eckhart Tolle had a cruise-ship where he could set up shop and convince all the movie stars and celebrities that he is God, he would be the new L.Ron Hubbard. Oh. Dear. God. It just hit me! He already has Oprah!! Someone stop him! I do not think I can handle Tom Cruise jumping on a couch and discussing his pain-body with Jimmy Kimmel.<br /><br />To summarize: save yourself the $9. Download \\"Heaven Is A Place On Earth\\" by Belinda Carlisle. She says all the same stuff Eckhart Tolle does at a fraction of the cost.the movie stars and celebrities that he is God, he would be the new L.Ron Hubbard. Oh. Dear. God. It just hit me!

0525423656|2.0|I rarely pay full price for hard-covers but did so in this case based on my liking for Matched.  I was sorely disappointed.  The story starts out rather well but quickly loses steam.  I finished only because I was invested in the story and the price of the book.  Once she finds Ki.... snooze fest.  More space was devoted to climbing canyon walls then anything of real interest.  And what they found in the cave?  So what?  In the context of this story, it's like coming across an early pregnancy test at Walgreens. Again, so what? And I disagree with other reviewers who say that a middle book in a trilogy should be cut some slack.  No way.  Try reading the Hunger Games.  And a rebel cause that sends a newbie into enemy territory after only a few hours orientation?  Yeah right.  Won't waste my money on Book 3.

B005D0RDKW|4.0|The only downside to seeing Rush live, be it in person or on DVD or Blu-Ray, is that they perform long concerts with lots of new material that people don't care for.  You get the best of Rush side by side with songs that you would like to fast-forward through.  Truly, Rush are a nostalgia band.  Seeing them on the Snakes and Arrows tour, I thought it was an hour too long.  But, the band is doing what they should be doing - touring new material, otherwise they wouldn't have much reason to continue.  Go see them live and buy the Blu-Ray to see the close-ups of what you may have missed.  Apart from Geddy not singing as well as he did years ago, these guys are still a force to be reckoned with.
1451648537|3.0|Honestly wish that Steve Jobs' sister, Monica Simpson, could have written his biography. She is a prolific writer and, judging by her eulogy to her brother, a very affecting writer as well. This book does an adequate job at presenting the facts from the writer's interviews with Jobs but his writing is very matter-of-fact, almost dry. However, I do grant that Isaacson has a tough job treading the thin line between writing about Jobs as a human and Jobs as a demigod. Overall a good peek into the life of a very private man highly revered by the world.

0307593312|1.0|About the best thing I can say about this giant blob of nonsense is that I learned a bit about 1980's Japan, although this too may have been a product of the author's imagination.  A parallel world with two moons where the \\"little people\\", who emerge from the mouths of dead goats, seem to have some  fundamental power over the harmony of the universe. Or not. It's never really made clear.  A female assassin Aomame(she only offs wife abusers) is hired to kill the leader of a religious cult who is known to have abused young girls. Meanwhile she is mystically drawn to her soul mate, whom  she has not seen since they were 10, but whom she's convinced she's destined to be with. The soul mate, Tengo, has adventures of his own, having been drawn into rewriting a mysterious book written by one of the abused girls who escaped from the cult. The book reveals secrets about the little people, and they are vaguely unhappy, causing thunderstorms  with no lightning, but otherwise taking no direct action.  Tengo and Aomame follow their own paths while yearning for each other for literally hundreds of pages. Oh - lots of detail about preparing meals, classical music, clothing, and countless other mildly interesting but extraneous topics.  After 500 pages I had given up hope and began skimming, only to discover an equally disappointing ending - poorly conceived and leaving countless questions that had arisen during the book infuriatingly unanswered.  Take my advice and avoid this book. Life is too short and time too precious to waste on a poorly written mess like this.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Don't be confused.  When it says the digital copy is not compatible with all devices, they mean it's not compatible.  With all devices.  Unless you want to use their special viewer.  I have happily used digital copies in the past, making it possible to watch the movies conveniently on my iPad or through my Apple TV without needing to put in the blu-ray disc or DVD.  This one was a real pain.  The digital copy steps were first, go to a special website; second, download their special software (and don't forget to read the terms and conditions, over a hundred small screens worth).  Install their software and use it to download the movie.  Then you can \\"watch the movie!\\"  Well, according to QuickTime it uses an unknown codec.  iTunes won't let me copy it in.  VLC player plays it, but without any video or sound...the ONLY way to watch it appears to be using their software.  Why can't I use the digital copy as, well, a digital copy?  I actually paid extra to get the digital copy and it is useless.  Worse than useless...I wasted a lot of time on it.  And when I checked the info on the file, it was 640x360 -- when my AppleTV is 1280x720.  So even if I were to find a way to play it, it would be lower resolution than I'm used to.  Basically, I've learned that Ultraviolet Digital Copy means don't bother.  The movie is great, it's just the wasted time and money for the digital copy that has me peeved (and drops three stars off what would otherwise be a five-star movie).
1594203059|1.0|First, to be honest, I hate Niall Ferguson. I started reading him at the urging of a 'friend' many years ago in order to give the other side of the argument a fair shake. I know very few conservatives who read material outside of their fixed interests, by the way, and while that sounds boastful on my part it is intended merely as an observation. Ferguson himself is one who most exemplifies this effortless ignorance of anything else beyond his own preconstructed views.<br /><br />I am absolutely weary of these cases that are being made for 'Western civilization' by now. They spring from an entirely egocentric take on history that is happily uninterested in anything that doesn't remotely relate to one's own own culture, no matter how significant or equivalent. It's like meeting someone from Scotland who asks if you're Scottish... when the answer is no, the conversation is promptly abandoned.<br /><br />If you need yet another convincing argument to reinforce your strong predilections about the West, then you will welcome this book. If however you'd like to learn something new and challenging for a change, I would recommend instead anything by David Graeber, or even better: start paying attention to the majority of voices in existence that far outweigh ours in the West. You'd be surprised how many people don't give a damn about the things Ferguson claims have enlightened the world. Even our language is not as pervasive as he thinks: only a rarified business elite can speak English fluently in much of Asia. Of course, when you are part of the catering class that serves power and moves in exclusive circles, like Ferguson, all of this is out of focus and simply doesn't register in one's consciousness.

B001HN6922|5.0|Cars 2 was an improvement on the first Cars film.  The violence was true to the secret agent film genre that this movie was celebrating. It was not disturbing to see cars, with eyes and a mouth, getting finished off, any more than seeing droids getting wasted in Star Wars The Clone Wars.  I'm a sucker for Mater's personality so, seeing him get more face-time in this film was good with me. This second Cars movie had a strong story compared to the first Cars, which hardly had a story at all. I thought the movie was strong and worthy of owning on DVD after I rented it.

They became people I cared about and was emotionally attached to the characters.  When I finished the last book in the series.  I was depressed not because the book was bad or anything but because of a feeling of separation.  It was as if I would not ever see my close friends or family.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|\\"It All Ends\\" boasts a pale faced Neville up aloft my local AMC's fresh-plastered promo posters. In case you're over thirty or have somehow, like me, failed to leap aboard the Potter-Train (they started sometime back around eighth grade), Neville's just one of the lads at Hogwarts Academy for Wizards--like the X-Men series' mutant academy but with a pagan twist, or high-end Camden prep school once the cafe's milk cartons have all been laced with pharm-grade LSD. It's a heavy telephoto job--his bloodied Russel Crowe-like chin (did they recast with Russell Crowe?) fully distended from the twee marshmallow cheeks of Nevilles past. Director David Yeats, the series' fourth, has even propped him up there with a broadsword--the old fashioned kind that used to hack one's foes, tendon by meaty tendon, into little bits (conduct most unwizardly). When Neville does liquidate his Slythrine classmates you can rest assured he'll do em good n' clean.<br /><br />Though don't be fooled, Harry is the man we've come to see--he's got a good thing going, too: Still in school means probably he sleeps till noon most days. He's a sports star so easily gets whichever girls he wants. He's fated to save Earth, or Wizard-Realm...Great Britain, maybe? (Is Hogwarts tax-exempt?) Basically, he can't go wrong. Let's not forget that now he's clearly alpha-wizard-internationale by the ripe age of 17. Hail, Harry Potter, King of Kindness, Face of Fortitude since 2001 (the books don't count)--my generation's new ideal for Chivalry and Virtue, prolonged and neatly franchised--now complete.<br /><br />As far as storyline's concerned there isn't too much, really, to wrap up. Lord Voldemort and his pet snake must go. (He looks like the same ghoul that Jedi Mace Windu [Samuel L. Jackson] zapped some long time ago back in the Clone Wars film...same dull complexion, anyway...since then he's had his nose touched up at least a couple times--by Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons, it would seem) To do this Potter and his servile classmates must smash up all of the Dark Lord's favorite stuff: an evil cup, a deadly hat, and other monsters spawned from V's pernicious soul. Of course there's lots of 3d wandplay (wands...the anti-light saber), gratifying spells with Latin names that kill or maim without excessive bloodshed, racist Muggle jokes, and long awaited awkward sexual outbursts--though really, have we paid for eight admissions just to see them kiss? (They do derobe together, briefly, after falling in a lake)<br /><br />Usually these late night fantasy/sci-fi premieres tend to marshal a particular fringe: the Basement-Dwellers--your neighborhood's most woefully obsessive demographic--yet on the morning of Friday July 17th all sorts of normal looking people marched around in black collegiate robes with strange hairdos and crudely whittled sticks--the `magic wands.' (Minnesota Law controversially allows its citizens to conceal and carry firearms pretty much wherever they please these days) As we arrived two fully grown adults were `magic dueling' in the foyer: faux Latin spells, looks of abstract concentration, phony British accents with prevailing Midwestern-American vowel sounds--the whole bit. With all the flash photography (most common were the suicide photographers: cameras firing backwards at arms length, approximating maybe two thirds of a shooter's frontal lobe), we had to rely basically on touch and intuition just to find our seats. (Without our 3d glasses, surely someone would have lost an eye) It seems that merely claiming `I was there' just doesn't cut it anymore--you need a thorough Twit-picking, or pretty much you don't exist--smart phones, the new pre-requisite for `real' participation in today's excessively objective #cinematichistory.<br /><br />Aloft our 30th row stadium-style vantage of the great blank screen I spoke briefly with a woman dressed as Belatrix LeStrange, one of the Dark Lord's (really only moderately evil) thugs who is played by Helena BonhamCarter (a dish commonly paired with Johnny Depp) of Sweeny Todd and Fight Club fame. I'm not surprised that Ms. LeStrange outnumbered Grangers, Weasleys, and the ever-lovely Luna Lovegoods all combined--LeStrange: the Potterized equivalent of half the roles that Carter's ever played: a coquettish and sardonic goth stuffed in a doll-house style black dress. She's a bad girl but not so bad that teenage girls browsing around Hot Topic think there's something truly (perhaps only a bit aesthetically) weird about liking and maybe emulating her.<br /><br />I asked her how she felt about the series ending. She fumbled, feeding fresh lithium-ion ammunition through a stout-lensed Cannon Powershot. \\"It's over.\\" she said. \\"After tonight my childhood's really over.\\"  She sounded thoughtful and composed, as if she'd given this a lot of thought. Her camera chirped and twittered as she tapped its LCD display--I tried to shield my eyes but never seemed to quite anticipate her flash. She went on to recall assorted adolescent memories with J.K. Rowling's books--pausing now and then to double-check the empty screen for trailers and taking little pulls from a friend's naggin-bottle of orange schnapps. There was an anecdote involving an ex-boyfriend and the third film's Blu-Ray DVD, something cute she'd read on Emma Thompson at NewsOfTheWorld.com, her thoughts regarding the true origins of Severus Snape. From 1997 to the present her whole life's chronology was pretty well intact. (I think I'm safe to just to assume that nothing of real consequence had transpired for this girl up until then) \\"Tomorrow we will all wake up and I'll be an adult.\\" Indeed. I hope she took a really good new profile pic.<br /><br />Slightly more dramatic were the revelers encountered in the parking lot after the show, lying prone and tearing at appropriately tailored clothes. One crawled and beat the asphalt audibly, another walked slowly in circles staring nowhere with dull eyes, wailing lamentations like a tweaking ex-narcotic fiend. \\"It's over, dude!\\" Hey man, nobody said that wizardry was easy.<br /><br />These Potter addicts aren't the only ones upset. Since its Friday night release assorted non-secular institutions and their respective spokespeople have continued to take issue with the series' theologically unsavory themes which include but are not limited to witchcraft, spectral exaltation, and the lack of Christ as a central protagonist. Unlike Star Wars and Tolken's spirit hounding Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Harry Potter sets and dramatizes pagan worship in close proximity to our own Earth-bound human lives (at least it didn't take place in America)--too close to home to pass as purely fantasy. Though this is not withstanding all the really sinful stuff that's passing for reality in cinema these days. After all, Nick Stoller's Get Him to The Greek (2010) depicts a man being forcefully (and quite unconsensually) sodomized...by A WOMAN. Even confirmation flunkies of the rankest sort will know that's a deadly, if not extra-extraordinary sin. Once you've even seen the previews for a flick like Harry Potter, nowadays, a little quidditch and a horcrux here and there just doesn't seem so bad.<br /><br />Besides the brutal disappointment this film left me feeling about my own non-magical genetic makeup and the usual sprained visual cortex upon apprehending two and a half hours of the world as it might appear had God created his own image in brilliant Imax-3d, I left the theatre on Friday with the notion that whoa, maybe I have missed out on a decade's worth of dragon-singed adventure and Hogwartian camaraderie.

B003YOXIVW|5.0|Former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel released his fifth studio solo rock album entitled So in May of 1986.<br />The year 1986 was the year of Genesis past and present. Whilst Peter released So, his former Genesis bandmate guitarist Steve Hackett released his hit collaboration with Yes guitarist Steve Howe calling themselves GTR  and released its self-titled album. Also, Hackett and Gabriel's ex-colleages the rest of Genesis (singer/drummer Phil Collins, keyboard player Tony Banks and bass player/guitarist Mike Rutherford) released the hugely successful Invisible Touch (see review).<br />A month before Invisible Touch hit the streets, Gabriel released So which was a year in the making but was well worth the time it took to create this now classic to rock history. It was four years since his last proper solo album (1982's fourth self-titled album which was released with the title Security here in the US at the request of his US label Geffen).<br />This time, Gabriel and his supreme team of session players, including the reliable Tony Levin on bass and Chapman Stick plus David Rhodes on guitar are joined by Police drummer Stewart Copeland and drummers Manu Katche and Rick Marotta.<br />The thunderous \\"Red Rain\\" is a stellar opener to this album and is possibly one of his best solo tracks of the 1980s. Next is the smash hit \\"Sledgehammer\\" (with Gabriel going a bit funky on the R&B thing) and was rightfully a #1 hit. In a strange twist of fate, it KO-ed his ex-bandmembers' \\"Invisible Touch\\" single out of #1 in the US. Also this track's video was groundbreaking with its animation effects. Next is the excellent duet with British singer/songwriter Kate Bush called \\"Don't Give Up\\" which is a stellar song and one of the best duets I ever heard. We end the first half with the atmospheric sounding \\"That Voice Again\\" which was a rock radio hit in the US yet didn't get released to pop radio.<br />\\"Mercy Street\\" starts the second half off (it was \\"In Your Eyes\\" but Gabriel changed the CD tracklisting for the remaster) and is a nice piece. We follow with another big hit called \\"Big Time\\" which featured Stewart Copeland on drums and was also known for its classic video (similar to \\"Sledgehammer\\" with his effects and Claymation). The original vinyl album's closer \\"We Do What Were Told\\" is reminiscent of Gabriel's darker late 1970s material. It's brief, lyrically simple, but very, very haunting. The original CD and cassette closer \\"This Is The Picture\\" is a terrific, light-groove collaboration with avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson which combined singing with spoken word, and the funky guitar of Nile Rodgers. The original album's second half opener and now album closer \\"In Your Eyes\\" is the album's most well known hit. This track was a #1 on US rock radio and is a nice love song and featured the late Michael Been from The Call and Simple Minds frontman Jim Kerr on backing vocals plus African singer Y'oussor N'Dour helping out at the end.<br />So became Peter Gabriel's biggest selling solo album reaching #2 on the Billboard album charts and has sold FIVE million copies to date in the US alone. The album was nominated for the Grammy for Album Of The Year, but it lost to Paul Simon's arguable masterpiece Graceland. However, Gabriel did win the MTV Video Music Award Video of the Year for \\"Sledgehammer\\" which ironically beat his old Genesis mates' \\"Land of Confusion\\" video. Aside sales, So proved Peter Gabriel was a force to be reckoned with and 25 years on is still his best album as this remastered version attests.<br />RECOMMENDED!isting for the remaster) and is a nice piece.

B005ELQVDA|5.0|Either you like her or you don't, but you can't argue that she creates every time she produces an album.  The use of the harp throughout this album is similar to how she focused on brass in the volta album.  I really like it and on vinyl and with a good stereo the depth of the music is breathtaking.

B00005NGAL|5.0|Not all great stage musicals translate well to film.  Many lose a bit of the connection between the audience and performers and others just seem to bog down.  The director and producers of this filmed version of CATS went out of their way to make a movie that captured the essential parts of the musical.  They succeeded completely.  Here you can a much closer view of the action than you would on any stage, but they don't get so close that you can't see all the action.  It's a wonderful way to see thei great musical.  And the special feature on making the film is equally interesting.  they not only interview Andrew Lloyd Webber and Gillian Lynne, but take the time to talk to several of toe cast who have their own unique insights into the joys and trials of filming this musical.  If you love musicals, this is worth adding to your collection.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Wow, I think this disc is actually better than the first Chickenfoot album. Satch is my favorite guitarist of all time and Van Halen is one of my favorite bands of all time. I really get sick of hearing the term \\"Van Hagar\\" as if Sammy is responsible for dismantling that band. Van Halen was as good with Sammy as they were with Roth; musically they just got better and better. Let's face it, Ed is responsible for all of VHs woes; it had nothing to do with the singers. The fact that Michael Anthony finally bailed on the VH brothers should tell you something. I mean really, is there anyone cooler than Michael Anthony? Anyway, getting back to Chickenfoot, these guys rock! I seriously laugh when I read some of the reviews criticizing Hagar's religious/political lyrics. Really, I mean really? There are a lot of bands that are much more overtly political than Chickenfoot. In terms of religion, who cares really? Hagar believes what he believes. You can agree with him or you can disagree with him. This is rock and roll. This band exists to rock and that's all that really matters. When Sammy was in VH he said that he considered his voice as an instrument in and of itself. If you don't agree with Sammy's message, you can at least respect his voice as one of the best in rock. When I think about the greatest hard rock/heavy metal singers of the last twenty years, I think about Ed Vedder, Chris Cornell, Dave Mustaine, and Sammy Hagar. And when we're talking about Chickenfoot, Hagar is just one of four outstanding musicians. Satriani, Anthony, and Smith are icons in and of themselves. There is just no way I can express how special Satriani is to instrumental guitar music. There are lots of technically skilled guitarists, but when it comes to guitarists who have a true sense of great musical composition, there is Joe Satriani and Steve Morse. The fact that Joe Satriani is in an actual band just makes me smile. :) It just proves to me how humble this guy is. The latest Chickenfoot album simply rocks, and this is its purpose.
B003LR5BD0|3.0|A follow up to the critical pleaser `Memento', `Insomnia' shows that Christopher Nolan isn't perfect.  In fact, this is the glitch in his fimography; a list of impressive feats that circle around an impressive re-imagining of Batman and some intriguing sci-fi ventures.  `Insomnia' has some superb moments, and facets of this film are truly strong, but overall there is a feeling of apathy that surrounds my concluding sentiments on the film itself.<br /><br />The idea here (of a LA cop lost in Alaskan daylight as he searches for a killer) has potential, and Nolan tries to uncover that potential, but it becomes too formulaic and predictable for its own good.  Instead of feeling lived in and exciting, most of the obvious `tricks' feel stagy and fake.  Swank proves that she cannot perform effectively without a gimmick, delivering a forgettable performance.  Pacino reigns in his usual theatrics, but he is less convincing than he needed to be.  Robin Williams gets under the skin with ease, and he festers.  He truly is the best thing about this film and definitely proves that he has more talent than many want to admit (he pigeonholes himself).<br /><br />I love Nolan (not as much as some, but far more than others).  He has a gift of imagery and he can capture moods with ease.  He does some good atmospheric work here (capturing unease in bright sunlight is hard to do), but at the end of the day, `Insomnia' is a little too mundane to make the desired impact.  It actually becomes tiresome and a tad boring.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Yep I was dooped by the Ultraviolet copy.  Excuse me for believing that \\"Copy\\" really meant a copy of the movie on my computer.  If you were planning on putting it in your iTunes collection don't bother with this crap, it won't work.
1594744769|5.0|A fabulous read!  Detailed and thought provoking.  Don't even think of buying it for your Kindle because you will find yourself going back to the odd photographs constantly.  As other reviewers have stated, there has to be a sequel due to the aggravating cliff-hanger ending.   I'm begging the author to row faster, please!

B004ZNB12O|5.0|This is a solid collection for anyone who wants an introduction to Pink Floyd. Every classic rock radio cut (hence, nothing from 'Animals'), and then some (OK, OK, they coulda put one 'Animals' cut on this), is on here, perfect for the casual fan. Let me repeat that: perfect for the casual fan... like my brother. I'm getting this for him for his birthday. I almost considered getting him 'Echoes' last year, but knew he would not listen to it, too much unfamiliar material. With this disc there are 13 out of 16 songs I know he would know. Pretty solid.  As for me I have the albums, so this would be a superfluous purchase for myself. But for my brother or anyone else who wants to get a... foot in the door, this is the perfect place to start.

0062060554|5.0|I have just finished this intriguing novel, and feel a bit blown away. Leaving this story behind will be difficult as I have come to love these characters, to want to know more about them. Watson has created characters that I want very much to sit and sip tea with, or better yet, a cold beer.   I understand what other reviewers have said about the implausibility of the plot. That the journal is far, far too professional to be real, that this shattered woman would not go off blindly with strangers, that people who loved her so would not act as they do. However, I don't care. Not in the least. I'm glad for all of it! I was compelled to continue and was riveted with every page. It's quite a task to make the implausible so intriguing.   If you like original tales wrapped around fascinating characters who in the end stay around banging inside your head, then this is the novel for you.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|but my latest secret is out of the bag...I LOVED THIS BOOK!! This story was entertaining, sweet, and FUNNY!! I can't tell you how many times I literally found myself laughing out loud. I loved Emma's character. I would have thought, by being an American, that I wouldn't really relate to the British main character. I couldn't have been more wrong. She really IS every ordinary woman! A super breezey and enjoyable read. You won't be disappointed!
B000063DHL|5.0|They changed direction a lot from Powerslave which was a very fast paced and energetic album. They slow down a bit and get more progressive. They incorporated synthesizer into their music which gives it a more atmospheric sound throughout. The band evolved and start to show a lot of maturity in their music. It may not be as heavy as their early stuff but it's original and they put a lot of effort into it. Rather than the ancient Egyptian theme on Powerslave, Somewhere In Time takes a completely different theme. More of a futuristic, sci-fi theme like \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\". The whole album's solid throughout but my absolute favorite tracks is \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\". The songs are all unique and I've never heard an album that sounded like it before.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|I saw this in the theater twice and laughed out loud both times. There is one crouch joke in the beginning, otherwise it is a clean, action packed, fun movie for the family.  I don't remember the first movie, but I  do remember I thought it was stupid. This is better.
B004EPZ08Y|1.0|I ended up getting royaly screwed with the final destination I bought the first blu ray and then a few months later the 3d one comes out!  Its shocking that the 3D and the regular dont come out at the same time so people can choose which they want.  Personally I thought the movie was ok but I would probably never watch it again in 2d same with my bloody valantine remake it would suck in 2d only the 3d effects make it worth a watch

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I am not sticking up for the Ultraviolet concept, but look what the pros for once. They just released a new update for Flixster on iphone and now they made so we can download the movies to our device. This is the only thing they didn't have that ticked me off. Now that we can download the movies to watch without an internet connection it is the same as iTunes if not better at the moment because we can choose to stream or download them now. This is very new give it time it will be better. The TV integration and VUDU being partners with UV will make watching on tv's possible shortly. I hope they get working on it more. I dislike how they started half ass. They should've had easier flow to start like on more platforms (televisions) I am sure it is coming very soon we'll just have to wait and see. I Love iTunes, but they need to get there movies in the cloud as soon as possible because then and only then will theu be the best out there. I want to switch 100 percent to digital movies, but that won't happen until 1080p digital movies come. VUDU is already showing there HDX rentals which are amazing if I might say so... I just wish everyone would wait a bit before reviewing harshly on something so new. I ssy Ultraviolet is worth it.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|The FiiO D3 DAC compares very favorably to other, much more expensive DACs I've owned or still own, including the PS Audio Digital Link III  and Cambridge Audio DACMagic. Granted, I haven't done a side-by-side, level-matched comparison and I don't intend do. I decide a while back that if I have to mentally squint to convince myself I'm hearing differences then I'm not really hearing differences. And with the aforementioned DACs costing 15 to 28 times more than the FiiO D3, the differences should be night and day, no squinting involved.   For what it's worth, I bought the FiiO D3 DAC to use in a secondary setup with a dedicated headphone amplifier and MacBook Pro. My headphones include Sennheiser HD650,  Audio-Technica A-W1000X and Hi-Fi Man HE-5LE.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I needed an mp3 player for the Jensen HD910 radio on my motorcycle. The Jensen is a terrific weatherproof radio, but it lacks an input for either usb memory sticks or sd memory cards for my cd music collection. But it does have an auxiliary input. My search for an input device led me to the Soundfly AUX MP3 Player.  The Soundfly has the ability to use the radio's FM stations for input, or again of most importance to me, the ability to use a hardwire 3.5 connector between the radio and the Soundfly. What a great combination. Sure I wish the Jensen had built in a usb port, but they didn't, so I needed to improvise once again. BUT it was well worth it. The Soundfly transmits the sound of my music tracks as well as any mp3 player I have yet listened to, and the price is extremely low for a quality mp3 player.  If you need an mp3 palyer, I highly recommend the Soundfly, and I would definitely recommend the Soundfly to my family and friends.
B004A8ZWWY|4.0|A movie that delivers a few real laughs, not a bad thing. It also lets Eddie Murphy show what he once was, really funny. No oscars will be won, but it does entertain. Thank you.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|It is strange to remember the fact that when I first heard of Coldplay I was not a fan of theirs in the slightest. Once I heard the song `Clocks' I finally admitted that this band was one of the most original out there at the time. Every single time a new album of theirs was released it was always something new and it just made me a bigger fan.<br /><br />Their 5th release `Mylo Xyloto' is once again something different and something fresh. This time it is an album that is more up tempo with a more technological sound. It is also their first concept album about a relationship going downhill until it finally ends. Each song unique from each other and that is what draws you into this album. I think the best part about this album is just that it is a sound from Coldplay that you have never heard before. Still, at the same time you know it is a Coldplay album because of Chris Martins' signature voice.<br /><br />I feel that this album is not as great as `Viva La Vida' however, it is a great listen and I am glad to see `Coldplay back with a new album and I feel that we are going to get something just as new and fresh when it comes time to make their 6th studio recording.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|I always loved watching this movie on tv and now i can watch it all the time. This is an excellent movie. I recieved it exactly the way they stated.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|The journey that began with an innocent young boy discovering the world he belonged to comes to an end in an explosive and emotional finale in `The Deathly Hallows Part 2'.<br /><br /> It is just so amazing to see how far these actors who were practically no names changed into incredible young men and women that managed to give such great performances for the final time. What started as an incredible drama ends in a fast paced battle between good and evil in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Still, in all the explosions and special effects the film is filled with emotion in two ways. The final film ties together the whole story, including some major revelations in Harrys' world and certain characters. Of course the main event in this film is the final showdown between himself and the one who wanted him dead ever since he was a child.<br /><br />Personally I felt that there was just a little bit missing from this film, but as a whole especially seeing it along with `The Deathly Hallows Part 1' it does a great job giving the fans the ending they have been expecting to see. As a whole I am happy to say that while these films may not have been as great as the books themselves, they were by no means horrible films. I am so excited to finally have my complete collection of Harry Potter films and I intend to enjoy them again and again.<br /><br />If you have read all my reviews of all 8 Harry Potter Films...thank you. Please check me out my Harry Potter film documentary on YouTube at smdelta4.
B0052U59F4|5.0|In this review I will not give a synopsis as other reviewers have already done good job in doing that. I will however impress on the would-be reader that this is an intense book. I like erotica books just fine and own a good amount. I've read about BDSM and never batted an eye lash. However, I was taken aback at the depth of emotion I get from Ana and Christian which was deep and dark. There were some instances where I felt uncomfortable because I identified with Ana during her interactions with Christian and felt her fascination with the man even though half the stuff he was teaching went against the grain of her being. Christian called himself \\"fifty shades of f___d up\\" but the author does a great job in making sure Ana (and you the reader, of course) is uncontrollably, almost unwillingly attracted to, and fascinated by Mr. Christian Grey. Spoiler Alert!!!! I also want to warn the reader that there is a cliff hanger at the end... but please don't be disappointed because the next part is already out. I also want to point out to the reader that BDSM is not my style (too kinky for me) but Christian Grey makes it worth while.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the best puzzle games I've played. Great graphics and relaxing background music. I highly rcommend it to any puzzle enthusiast. I'm ready for the sequel.  Not sure how they figured what a perfect score is for each board. Did them all perfectly (didn't stop trying till I did) and the last board two under the &quot;perfect&quot; score.
6304936303|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch that never seems to get old.  It has a little of everything, action, suspense, mystery and some per say crazy humor.  Why is is not available on blu-ray I wonder since it should be.  It is available with another Willis movie together on one blu-ray, but should be by itself on blu-ray.  Very entertaining movie and has a lot of different twists along with a well written storyline.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I found this product to be very user friendly and the price I paid for it was very reasonable. I recommend it highly.
B000002UZ4|5.0|I have listened to this C.D. hundreds of times. I need another one after 19 years of listening this C.D. What a hit !
B005UG53NS|5.0|I LOVE HARRY POTTER AND I HATE VOLDEMORT!!!! THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM, AND I BELIEVE EVERYONE GETS WHAT THEY DESERVE.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I was so excited to get this, I had said a long time ago how amazing I thought these films on Blu-ray would be....DISSAPOINTED BIG TIME!!! I watched only the first one so far and you can see the grain of parts of the film and it goes back and forth with being picture perfect then goes back to grainy. This occurs several times and makes me feel like I wasted $50.00!! I could understand if I had bought the Wizard of Oz or any of the old Planet of the Apes films on Blu-ray- You can ony get the best with the masters they had at the time without touch-ups being done to films. I just think for the price and the Millions plus to be made off this that they would have had someone watch these and give their feedback. Oh well Feel Duped and wish it would have been better.  Rent this first then decide for yourself.
0553801473|1.0|I won't go into all the details, as they have already been mentioned. Foremost, I LOVED the first 3 books. A Feast for Crows was pretty awful, but I chalked it up to a transitional book setting up elements for DWD. And after much waiting, delaying, excuses, HBO deal, more delays, etc. we get a book with about 200 pages of actual storyline and 800 pages of tedious details. And not the kind of details that really add value to anything... just details that seem like pointless filler.<br /><br />I understand that a writer's job isn't easy and expectations were really high for this one, but I've pretty much decided to give up on this series, as I didn't get any real gratification or enjoyment from these last two books. 1 star.
B004LROUNG|5.0|At first I thought this would be just another legal mass torts story by JG as it reminded me of his \\"King of Torts\\" and \\"The Appeal\\" - lots of shady wheeling and dealing in and out of the courtroom. It IS that, but it also has a nice cool story of ethics and integrity surrounding the plight of three inexperienced lawyers (tagged \\"The Three Stooges\\") on their maiden journey into the big time mass torts arena.<br /><br />The colorful characters are the big highlight in this novel, from the poor plaintiffs to the Gulfstream jet-setting big shots. Grisham is on top of his game in \\"The Litigators\\" I give it 5 stars as I should've given his last novel \\"The Confession\\" I'm learning how hard it is to find good writers who can tell a good story as masterful as Grisham does. This ranks up there with his best.<br /><br />Movie wish cast;<br />David Zinc/Ryan Gosling<br />Wally Figg/Jon Lovitz or Paul Giammati<br />Oscar Finley/Bill Macy<br />Rochelle/Queen Latifah<br />Nadine Karros/Catherine Zeta-Jones
B005H1SDQU|4.0|It's been awhile since I've visited a Steve Hackett album and I stumbled across this one the other day and enjoy it very much. Compared to much of the dreck out there these days this is tasty, mature, varied music for those of us who are past head banging, power chords and shock lyrics but aren't ready for the Norah Jones crowd yet either. Do yourself a favor and pick it up and listen to it on a good sound system. It will take you back to the days 30-40 years ago when music was THIS good. You will not be sorry.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|Great filter holder.  Holds my 77mm filters without a problem.  Not intended to seal out the elements, so if you need one of those, look at other options.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|It would be nice if I could review the film separately from the packaged product.  However, I am extremely disappointed that Warner Bros. decided to switch to Ultraviolet during the last Harry Potter offering.  Simply put, I intentionally purchased Blu-Ray's which included digital copies so that they could be available on my iPad while travelling WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION.  So, while my previous Harry Potters have been loaded onto my iPad, Warner Bros just lost a customer with this one.  But I guess this is what happens when you legitimately purchase things you could otherwise download for free...
B004GJDQT8|2.0|Downloaded this app to my phone and now I am getting a ton of junk email. I have uninstalled the 2 apps that I installed and have Uninstalled the App Store app as well. Did not check any box to receive any junk emails from any affilliates. I would prefer not to download the apps vice getting junk email in my inbox.
140053271X|5.0|I heartily recommend the Nook Touch.     Battery: Depending on usage levels you don't have to charge it too often, I read on mine in breaks between classes and when I have an assignment for an English class and only have to charge it every couple of weeks. Part of this is that I turn off the wireless connection when I'm not using it, which saves battery power.     Usability: very easy to use, command prompts in setup were great and after that it's somewhat intuitive. Once you have books or other materials in your library you can organize them onto \\"shelves\\" of your own choice. Press lightly on the outside rim of the page to turn it either way, press buttons on either side to turn the page the same direction that you have been turning. Press near the top right corner to \\"bookmark\\" the page, press in the middle of the screen to open up a small main menu (from which you can access your homepage, your library, the shop, settings, etc), press and hold over a word to highlight, mark, or look it up. You can search through your books for a typed phrase or word (very handy when trying to find a certain passage for writing a paper, or in-class discussions!) It also locks the screen, to unlock you press the n button and then slide your finger across the screen.    Price: I have hundreds of books (some of them impossible to find in a physical copy), and I've spent less than $10 total on books. Modern books cost less than a new physical copy, and there are amazing values of treasure trove books which only cost a dollar or two but house complete collections or hundreds of classics. Free books are not to be underestimated also! I've only found one or two which hadn't been scanned in properly.    Screen: you can adjust font, font size, and other features. Screen saver is a woodcut-like image of a classic author (my favorites are the Bronte Sisters or Jules Verne) or you may choose instead to show a nature scene (black and white photograph). Since it's eInk, it really is like a printed page-- you need light to read it, but it doesn't stress out your eyes like a computer screen would.    Service: I have never had a problem with my Nook, but if I did I can take it straight to the nearest Barnes and Noble to have it fixed. Also, I've heard that you get free coupons and even occasionally a free book when you enter B&N -- haven't gotten to try that feature out yet, my campus bookstore isn't officially a real B&N, but I'm looking forward to it.     Wifi: the Nook doesn't generate its own hotspot, but considering that practically everywhere you're going to go is jumping on the wifi bandwagon you shouldn't need one. You only need the internet when shopping for new books. Once purchased I've yet to have a book that took even near 10 seconds to fully download -- and that includes a complete Shakespeare!  It's thin, easy to carry-- mine's never gotten scratched in a light sleeve, and that's after carrying it around in both a purse and a big bookbag-- and generally wonderful. I looked at both Kindle and Nook, and I'm really glad I got my Nook. I love using it, have gotten compliments on it, and after seeing me use mine my mom wants one!
0785153322|5.0|MARVELOUS. That's what this collection of MARVELS movie art books should have been titled. It is truly GREAT. Iron Man I & II, Captain America, Thor; If you liked those movies and you enjoy movie art books then this a collection for you.
1451648537|4.0|A good biography, very readable, but as some other reviewers have noted, there are curious gaps.  I would very much like to have seen more pictures of people in his life, such as Tina Redse.   Even though I knew enough some about Jobs's history before reading this, I was still amazed at how awful his behavior was to almost everyone who came within his orbit.  I found myself using the word \\"toxic\\" to describe him.  Sooner or later he was not just rude but brutal to almost everyone. I guess it is to the credit of those who could tolerate it in either a working or personal relationship.  The more I read about Jobs, the better Bill Gates looks as a human being.
0762434260|5.0|i have harry potter wand by noble collection but i cant play with it because im afraid to break it so i bought this mini kit wand and im so pleased because it is made out of plastic that u have to screw together and an enclosed bokk of 8 stickers  i love it and it never broke to me i dont know y allot of people complaining about it
0446585025|3.0|this book was funny. just simply funny. it was like having her do a 3 hour monolog. simple and witty all in the same page. i would recommend others read it. it takes you away from daily life3 and reminds you to see the humor in things.
1401223176|5.0|this is absolutley amazing, the plot, the drawing the SITUATIONS!! everything, a beautiful graphic novel to have, actually, if you are reading it from a pdf. SHAME ON YOU!!!
B00014NE62|5.0|Cannot count the times I have seen this masterpiece on home video, but this Merchant Ivory Collection (through Criterion) is the best Maurice has ever looked! The anamorphic video looks really good. The sound is just two channel (not 5.1) but that doesn't matter when the movie is as excellent as this one. The company did justice by releasing this on two discs so the movie won't be plagued with compression problems once you squeeze the special features in. Seems great care was taken to release this particular version. My only question: where is the blu ray? This little film cries out for a blu ray release, then the picture would really add life to this masterpiece! But as is, get this two disc set if you appreciate Merchant Ivory films. Don't settle for anything less.
1401216676|5.0|everyone of us knows who's the joker but WHY the joker became the joker?!! if you have this question walking by the walls of your brain!! you should buy this book, and the hardcover version got a really nice cover... one of the best buys i ever made 10/10
030746363X|2.0|This book is backed by the cult of personality of the owner and ridiculous sensationalist claims.  It has about as much credibility as those \\"become a millionaire with one easy trick\\" web ads and lacks any verifiability or integrity.  If you want to learn about marketing, specifically marketing a bad book with immense amounts of hype, by all means join the cult of Tim Ferriss but if you have any interest in becoming healthier, fitter, leaner, or bigger get a book that actually covers exercise and nutrition and learn something real.

0061120073|5.0|A beautiful and extraordinary book I first read some 60 years ago. Today, in a re-reading, I find the same attraction to the sensitive detailing of optimism and courage during the \\"depressive\\" years of the 20s and 30s.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is sooo ridiculously stupid that it's funny, and I can't believe Jerry Stiller is Ben Stiller's dad. Weirdest father and son movie ever made.
0385534639|3.0|I can definitely understand the appeal of this novel.  The setting is unique, a fantastic and mysterious circus that bridges reality and dreams.  The entire novel is ethereal and dreamlike, with most of the action occurring at night where reality is elusive and things are possible that seem impossible in the light of day.  Morgenstern does a nice job of immersing the reader in this world created literally by the characters in the novel.  The theme of time, I feel, was well-executed throughout the novel.  There are many dichotomies in the novel with \\"Day vs. Night\\" symbolizing reality and dreams; and the prominence of midnight in the story acts as a bridge between reality and dreams, and between yesterday and tomorrow.  The novel is structured in three time settings: the characters' past, the characters' present, and the reader's present.  I like how the characters' past literally catches up to their present as the story unfolds, emphasizing the idea that our actions have significant ramifications for ourselves and others in the future.  The inclusion of the reader's perspective exploring the circus is intended to make you a part of the story and illustrates how our lives and experiences are effected by others who we may not even know.  Time is the most powerful force in the novel, beyond the control of even the strongest magicians.  Clocks figure prominently in the tale and the marvelous clock of Herr Thiessen is the visible centerpiece of the circus.  In one scene a clock conspicuously measures not only the hours but astronomical time as well, further linking the present with a grander scope of time.  While I appreciated these elements of the novel, ultimately I was disappointed in the book.  The writing is often amateurish - somewhat trite and overwrought.  The black and white theme (with numerous gray bridges between the two, and repeated flashes of red) became for me like a driving rhythm in a song that lacks a sophisticated melody, hammering away incessantly inmy head.  The descriptions of the tents and exhibits were often beautiful, but became repetitive without advancing the story.  Many of the metaphors were stale, like comparing the performers who were frozen in time to statues.  The most significant flaw for me, however, was the lack of character development.  The characters seemed to be simply vehicles for the story - pawns manipulated by Morgenstern to fit the themes.  But, none of the characters faces any moral challenge that would make them compelling.  The only real challenge in the story is the game into which Celia and Marco are thrust; but because the characters do not develop, I found little suspense in the game.  The two protagonists had only to figure out how to be together despite the rules of the game, and in the end they were the same individuals as they were in the beginning.  The same is true of all the characters - although significant things happen to them, no one is significantly different after these events.  Bailey (a cheap nod to Barnum and Bailey's circus) is a good example of the one-dimensionality of the characters.  His internal struggle of whether to stay at home and help with the farm or go to Harvard - the mutually exclusive dreams of his parents - is inadequately elucidated so that his ultimate resolution seemed capricious, designed to fit the plot rather than the character.  A good story is important to me, but I prefer stories that support rich characters facing tough and profound dilemmas.  In fact, if I had to sacrifice one or the other, I'd sacrifice the story in favor of a good philosophical message (à la Milan Kundera).
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The standard for any Matrix enthusiast!!  Great picture quality and it came at a really good price.  Very Happy!!  The Package came with several Blu-Rays with TONS of additional videos.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|A brilliant interpretation of the classic tale, performed admirably by a fantastic cast, capably directed and set in awe inspiring icelandic quarters.   Highly recommended, especially for those looking for a more grown-up fantasy fix.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I'm so happy I can finally watch a show on regular cable that isn't just plain dumb.  This show is intence and keeps you wanting more. I can't wait too own this on Blu Ray. Horror, Love, and some drama this show's got it all. F/X you did it again.

1451629184|5.0|I first saw Jaycee in an interview with Diane Sawyer and was amazed by her lack of self pity.  Later in her book I could see why.  Even in the midst of unimaginable horror her journal entries during captivity spoke of hope and freedom.  I especially liked the way she gave updates of her present feelings in her book and how she is coping today.  I wish her and her family continued peace.
B0002EXH5E|1.0|A major problem with this album, imo, is expectations.  Megadeth has set a precedent for what kind of music they put out and, even though they have deviated from one album to the next at times (Cryptic Writings is not Rust in Peace, for example) in terms of sound, they have always put out a style of music that fans expect and that the name of the band, MEGADETH, suggests.  Until this one.  Yes, I understand that the album is called \\"Risk\\" for a reason...the band took a Risk.  However, there is a difference between taking a 'risk' and completely changing your musical style.    While I have thoroughly enjoyed every single album Megadeth had put out prior to this one, I will admit something here.  When I like to jam, I listen to Megadeth, Ozzy, etc.  When I want to relax, though, I sometimes listen to Enya or similar type music.  Imagine my surprise if I purchased an Enya CD and she was cranking heavy metal and screaming!  I would be shocked because she had not met my expectations that she herself had set, and I probably would not like the album.  Well, the same thing applies with Risk.  You buy Megadeth, and you expect MEGADETH.  It's fine if this is what Dave wanted to do, it's his band and his career, after all.  Perhaps if he had simply called it the \\"Dave Mustaine Experiment\\" or \\"A Night out with Dave\\" we might not have expected MEGADETH (the name alone implies HEAVY).  So, whether the songs are actually decent or not, once that first impression failed miserably, it's hard to recover from.  I myself have actually tried to listen to it a few times and just have not gotten into it at all.  Again, I think it's due to failed expectations.  That may not be Dave's problem, perhaps it's mine.  But I no more want to hear Megadeth playing Enya than I want to hear Enya playing Megadeth.    Megadeth rocks, just not here.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stayed up late last night to finish this book and it was terrific!!!  I just could not put it down and walked around the house like a teenager with my head bowed over my Kindle.  I too thought the the price was a little steep for an ebook, but am now so pleased that I spent the money.  I ABSORBED this book with so much enjoyment, I'm writing my first Amazon review!  Thank you again for such a great book!  Donna
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I really enjoy Megadeth's unique, heavy sound and this album certainly does not disappoint.  I've liked Megadeth from way back and own every one of their discs (that's right, all TH1RT3EN - although I thought it should be called TWELVE - does Risk really count? lol), and this one falls right in line with their best stuff, especially their 3 previous discs, which are among my favorite.  The best songs, imo, are Sudden Death, Public Enemy no.1, New World Order, We the People, Black Swan, and 13.  I'm not going to get into all of the intricacies of each song like many others do because I honestly don't understand that stuff, but I'll just tell you that this album will kick your butt so hard from start to finish that you won't be able to sit down...not that you'll want to!  If you jammed out to The System Has Failed, United Abominations, Endgame, or any other top notch Megadeth, you'll rock out to this one, too.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|A true masterpiece.  This is a movie I will be sharing with many people.  A work of art I will never forget. Words can't do this film justice.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Was very disappointed to find that I could not download a digital copy (which I paid for!) to use as I wanted.  Instead we're stuck with this streaming thing that forces you to use their software to view the movie.  I sent a complaint already to the company but they were unsympathetic.  I would strongly suggest those of you who want to buy the blu ray, just buy that.  Don't spend extra for a \\"digital copy\\"...it's a complete scam and ripoff.  I will return mine and purchase a digital copy thru ITunes.
0525423273|5.0|I'm in love with this book, like I haven't fallen in love with a book in a long time. The last time I can honestly say that I enjoyed a book THIS much was with Jandy Nelson's The Sky is Everywhere, aka my all time favorite young adult novel ever. And that's saying something. I've been kicking myself in the ass ever since I finished it for a) holding off on reading this one due to skepticism which was derived from reading mixed reviews and for b) holding off on reading it!<br /><br />Gosh, it has everything! Intense romance...hilarious bits...awesome, comical characters... and it's in FREAKIN' PARIS for crying out loud! Paris! As in the French city, or the famous city in France. However you slice it, this novel is - again, I say this - in PARIS, FRANCE! I've always wanted to travel the world, but reading a novel like ANNA makes me want to sell my soul for airplane tickets (and other necessary accommodations, of course! Can't come back from Paris without some Mousse au chocolat. &lt;-- indeed a necessity.) I can't tell you how bad I want to see all the huge and historically significant monuments (their beauty doesn't hurt either)... and I've seriously been craving croissants since I put this book down! It's not fair to tease a girl like that!<br /><br />But, enough about the setting and food. Or the deliciousness of the French language. Or how the French get to drink wine and beer before eighteen (did you know that?). Or how it's like the movie capital of the world. Okay, seriously enough about how great France is, I mean it... There's the wonderful characters. I couldn't be angry that I didn't feel like I got to know all of Anna's new friends as thoroughly as I'd've liked, simply because they made up for all of that with good humor and being great people just in general. Anna herself was a hilarious, authentic, incredible heroine - a compliment I do not give to often to the heroines I read about. I felt so blissfully connected to her. Even when she was being bitchy or immature, or angry and upset, the bad facets of her personality, I didn't mind. I felt like she became my best friend by the time I was through reading about her. I even felt a little envious toward her. I mean how many girls can say that they've gotten to live in France, make awesome friends, and kiss the most gorgeous American French Englishman in fictional existence? (Can you? Didn't think so.)<br /><br />Riding out the plot wasn't tedious at all, which I had expected it to be. I guess you could call ANNA a character-driven story, and I typically enjoy epic novels with a substantial, action-y plot. But, being alongside Anna day in and day out, watching as new friendships are forged, as she slowly realizes she's in love with &Egrave;tienne St. Clair, I fell in love with the story in its entirety.<br /><br />And one of the things that makes this an all time favorite of mine is definitely the breathtaking love and romance in this novel! It's beautiful. The whole experience. And genuine and real. First thing, St. Clair is imperfectly perfect. He's a gorgeous guy with a spine-tingling British accent, but he's short. He's totally chill in personality, but he likes to bite his fingernails out of nervousness or excitement. I bet you you can't say Aww! as loud as and enthusiastically as me... Him being so perfectly flawed, gives me hope. I feel like my guy, whoever he is out there, will be just right for me. He won't be too perfect, just plain brilliant. I only have to look at St. Clair as evidence... I don't know how many times I sighed or stared in awe at this pair.  And what Anna and St. Clair have is downright awe-inspiring! They just fit so well!<br /><br />The ending blew me away the most. It requires a reread and OFTEN. Very rarely am I entirely satisfied with the way a book closes, but all the angst and drama and implications were all worth it by the end. I was so scared I was going to be disappointed.

0385535139|3.0|I enjoyed this book as an average Grisham book, sometimes caught up in the story, finding myself going from hating some characters to liking them by the end, and vice verse, etc. However, more often I found myself just plodding along trying to get through the book. I absolutely loved Grisham's last novel, The Confession, and was expecting this one to be just as good. Personally, I thought it fell short of that. It was a good story overall, but I found it lacking one key thing: a gripping climax that just sucks you in.<br /><br />The book is worth reading if you have extra time, but nothing to brag about. There are many other books worth filling your time.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|A laugh out loud read. The characters are so cute and funny. I hate to shop but this made me want to run to the store!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Its too bad Cannes movies dont get advertised and never make it to a box office because, this movie would have taken everyone's money.  It is a must see! Its one heck of a wild ride, chilling and thrilling. In the flavor of a modern day Deliverance  Southern Missouri, red-neck drug mafia.
0525423656|3.0|In my review of Matched, I was anxiously anticipating this sequel and was hoping to learn more about The Society, The Rising and Xander in particular (a promising character that I felt was underserved in Matched). Well, I did learn more about some of those things...  I liked Crossed, but it also frustrated me as well. When we last saw our protagonists, Ky was being hauled off to the Outer Provinces by The Society and to certain, eventual death. Cassia decides to somehow follow him no matter what the cost. Xander sadly watches the entire scene unfold, still harboring his love for Cassia despite her inherent idiocy, sorry, I mean tenacity...and Cassia's family is shipped off to do some farming for awhile and learn the errors of their rebellious ways.  So...that brings us to Crossed. Here's what I liked:  I liked (and disliked, see below) that Crossed was told from the perspectives of both Cassia and KY. This technique helped me to like and understand Ky more. (Full disclosure: I'm a budding Xander fan.) They are both in the Outer Provinces and then ultimately on the run, but for a great deal of the book they are apart, searching for each other.   Along the way they pick up some friends and I liked these characters. They are a great addition to the series, especially Indie (you know I like strong female characters who don't put up with BS) and I know we will see more of them in the sequel.  Condie's descriptions are beautiful and you can visualize easily the surroundings of The Carving and The Outer Provinces.  Now here's what I had a problem with:   1. Where the heck's Xander?   He shows up for like a minute, is mysterious and then leaves. I really feel like his character has potential and possibly more depth than Ky given all of theses \\"secrets\\" and \\"mysteries\\" surrounding him. I again am hoping we see more of him in the third book, how about the next book is from his perspective? That I would be interested to read: \\"Cassie's breaking my heart, so I gave her a big packet of blue pills. Hope they work...\\"  2. Speaking of perspectives...  While I liked the idea of both POV's, after a while they both started sounding the same. The only thing that helped me in this regard was that I actually listened to Crossed as an unabridged audio book on Audible and they had a guy and a girl reading each chapter. However, in tone and sappiness, they both sounded alike to me.  3. Enough with the poetry already.   I get how integral these poems are to the story, just not sure if I need to read them again every other chapter until I have them memorized too. Sidenote: I was reading another book last night where a character died and they were looking for the perfect poem for his memorial. Immediately I started reciting Tennyson's \\"Crossing the Bar\\" (brainwashed much?) and guess what? That's the exact one they used...  4. The Society sucks at catching people. Or do they?...   I can't decide if Cassia and Ky are still part of some big Society experiment or if The Society is in a recession and they just don't have the manpower and resources to find our motley crew. Cassia and Ky both spend a great deal of time piddling around and very little (or absolutely zero) time actually in danger of being caught. This decreased the suspense and thus my enjoyment of Crossed.  Well...after that diatribe, I guess it looks like I didn't really like Crossed at all, but I did. I think the series overall has promise and Crossed was just a slow Act II. I love Condie's writing style in general and it is a testament to Matched that I even am riled up enough to be a little disappointed in the sequel. I promise, I will be first in line for the third book and there better be more Xander, dang it!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I have seen till date. It's true to the classic. The essence of the story is not lost. The costumes, language everything depicts the Regency era. Background score is excellent. Great performances by the cast. Colin Firth in one of his most memorable performances as Mr.Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is perfect as Elizabeth Bennet. All other supporting characters are portrayed so well, they all came alive. Brilliant performances in the roles of Mr.Collins, Lydia, Lady Catherine de Burgh, Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet. All those who have read the novel should watch this classic.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this for listening to music at work via my work PC.  The internal sound card is horrid, so the amount of sound coming from the headphone jack was pretty poor.  I attempted to use some software amps, and they seemed to distort the music moreso than making it louder.<br /><br />I've had this item for 3 days now, and I can say it works wonderfully.  It boosts all levels of sound from my crappy internal card to great levels with clear as a bell sound.  Wonderful lows and Excellent highs.<br /><br />I'll be using this for just about anything that I need to have an inline amp for :)<br /><br />Would highly recommend this product.
1612130283|5.0|A very intense, emotional, sexual, funny and dark book. I was sceptical to read this one because it has bdsm and i don't like erotica, but after i read the reviews i thought to give it a try. Well believe me it took my breath away...literally! The relationship of Christian and Ana is so well written and intense that you wouldn't be able to put it down, you must have although a little open mind! The sensuality is very high and yet you don't feel uncomfortably, the obssesion of Christian for Ana is so wonderfull given that you wish you were Ana! This author knows how to write! I highly recommend this book, it's a Must Read!!
B0018QPPXW|4.0|Risky Business is a Tom Cruise classic film, which has a narrative that focuses on young men looking for thrills, as they approach adulthood. It is a promiscuous desire by Joel Goodson (Cruise) that exposes him to a world where every pleasure can be bought. Goodson at first enjoys all the spoils, but soon finds himself in over his head in a sleazy world, where fair play is an unknown rule. The movie has some memorable scenes, including Cruise's home alone dance to \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" by Bob Seger.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

030726999X|4.0|one of a series, all with lots of dialogue and characters, lots to keep track of and remember, in the end worth it;  Amazon purchase arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion, and the price was right, condition of book was correctly represented
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Don't buy this if you're interested in the digital copy! It is not a real copy, but rather a streaming version through a third party service. What a rip off of Warner Bros. to pull this on loyal fans and customers for the final film. I will be returning mine and ordering the version sold from amazon.uk -- same price but with a real digital copy, just have to wait a couple more weeks. Worth it to me. Shame on Warner Bros!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Agree with other reviewers on here that it will put a serviceable edge back on a knife, but won't get it razor sharp.  Good for its purpose and I would love to have one handy in the woods.  If u want razor sharp buy a ceramic or a whetsone and spend your time with it.  This is idiot proof and quick.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was great read. The plot was solid and the characters were fun.  The main character fun, flippant and brave. The descriptive quality of the book kept me hooked and of course the upcoming movie probably won't  do it justice but I'll watch it anyway.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|I buy a lot of CDs, especially country music ones and this is one of the best I've heard in a while.  I would put his vocals up against any of the big names like Tim McGraw, Dierks Bentley, or Blake Shelton.  The song choice is appropriate and well-mixed.  Buy this CD!

B004LWZW8I|5.0|This is a very cool movie. I love many types of gladiator style movies and this movie was just awesome. A lot of battles and kicking butt. The only flaw I found is that they just show and mention a few of the gods. I was hoping to see more of them fight.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I didn't know ultraviolet digital was any different from any other digital copy until I'd spent the $$'s. DON'T BUY THE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL set before reading all the other reviews! You won't have a digital copy saved to your media library but you have to set up an account to livestream the \\"digital\\" copy! Lame!! Buy the hard copy from Amazon and the digital from Amazon digital or itunes.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I have the distinct impression that some of the negative reviews here are being written by people who did not buy the album and haven't listened to it.  (Amazon should really make it a requirement that you purchase the album, on Amazon, before you can review it.)  This is Coldplay's strongest release to date, surpassing even X&Y.  You don't need to listen to it ten times all the way through to realize it, either.  You will know it after three listens.  There are no duds.  Charlie Brown will likely be Grammy song of the year -- give it a little time to percolate, then you'll see.  So, pay no attention to the detractors here, most of whom probably haven't even heard the album.  Just sit back and enjoy!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul McCartney was never more to me than \\"the cute one\\" belonging to the quartet known as The Beatles. There is not one person on this planet that has never heard a Beatles or McCartney/Wings tune. Myself included.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to have a mother born one day after McCartney and one who made it known year after year. We had 2 Beatles and 1 PM LP around the house so I had a fairly decent knowlege of the music. However of the Brits, my personal favorite were: The Stones and DC5 (Dave Cark 5). Over the years I got the \\"beat down\\" for not recognizing The Beatles or PM's contribution to music. To me they were just another British band that got lucky and PM was just another oldie star that didn't know when to quit.<br /><br />Long story short, I ordered this particular item out of renewed interest in Paul. Have never been a real fan of LIVE concerts. The last one seen having been The Concert for New York City. This one I thought would just be a few old songs from his Beatle era and from his solo career and that would be it.<br /><br />This concert really opened my mind: It brought out things musically in my mind that I didn't know were there. If you are a fan you know the music but there is so much more than just the songs.<br /><br />I learned that PM is a true entertainer. Not just a studio musician. He performed more than 30 songs without an intermission and all of them were top notch! Just like the originals. Voice still in shape.<br /><br />PM's influence by the Beach Boys and specifically Brian Wilson and his \\"melodic bass lines\\". It got me to thinking about each song performed. They became more than just oldies. It was an education process that I went through listening to Paul and each song and things that he did. However minor. Like \\"Something\\": A sweet song to me; but too slow for my taste. He took that song and played the intro on Ukulele speeding it up by playing within the melody. Something that Parker did many decades before he was born. I heard this with my musical ear and it truly intrigued me!!!! Then the rest of the orchestra came in and played it as it was originally. You have to have some musical training to understand what I am trying to say (pouring a quart into a pint).<br /><br />My favorites: I'm Down, Long and Winding Road, My Love and Get Back. Hoped to hear: She's a Woman or Long Tall Sally.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I just thought i'd check in and say how much I enjoyed this concert. I played it on my computer and it was just like being there! Packaging was great: 3 disks. The first two were the audio cd's and the third the dvd. I thought the dvd better. Once you view it the dvd's the cd's were just music from the concert.<br /><br />Paul really taught me that he and his fellow Beatles are everything and more. I have a \\"renewed\\" interest in them and have ordered the Apple box set and will review that in the future! I HIGHLY recommend!!!<br /><br />Thank you for reading!heard this with my musical ear and it truly intrigued me!!!! Then the rest of the orchestra came in and played it as it was originally.

B000W4KSVA|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite John Coltrane records(among many). If you love this album or want to introduce someone close to something special, try this: Get Coltrane's Ballads and Karyn Allison's Ballads album (vocals of the same underrecorded songs) and make up a disc from both albums alternating Coltrane's instrumentals with Allison's vocals. She has done such an amazingly respectful and soulful album and it makes the experience very special.<br /><br />Trust me.  [[ASIN:B00005J716 Ballads: Remembering John Coltrane]]
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I loved the final movie.  It contained much of the book, the missing parts were unfortunate, but I understand why they were left out for movie purposes.
0857685570|4.0|The book is amazing, but our copy was missing pages.  Pages 54-55 appear twice, once where they should be and then again pages 166-167  Missing art work is two paintings of darth maul comic book covers (  darth maul numbers 1-3)  Otherwise this is an incredible book.
B005QKYIZ2|3.0|Count me among the disappointed. Lungs is amazing, but this is taking all of the excesses of that album, putting them end to end, then turning the dials to 11. To borrow from Gertrude Stein, there is simply too much there there. Not every song needs to be an anthem. One over-the-top moment seems to blend into the next into the next. Florence Welch has a truly fantastic and BIG voice, so I don't see the need to surround it with such over-produced orchestrations that too often compete with the vocals. I can only hope that on future albums the producers turn the background machine down and let the voice shine.
0756405890|5.0|Normally, extended flashbacks are a good reason for me to put a book aside. Here, the jumps from the present to the past are handled so well that it isn't intrusive or annoying. As a sometime writer myself, I am in awe of Rothfuss' mastery of the craft.  I'm eagerly awaiting the third in this series.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I want to get digital copy easily. I don't want a flixter account (required). I don't want to spend 1.5+ hours downloading (time keeps going up). I wanted to put in iTunes, but it's not showing up as an option. Will have to see if I end up with a viewable version of movie--I'm not feeling optimistic.   Update: The digital file that downloaded can't be played.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Everyone who is buying the edition for its digital copy, stay away!!!!  Warner Brothers is paired with the legalized scam \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy,\\" which is only usable by streaming your movie through flixster.com.  The say that you can download a copy to your computer, but there is some arbitrary date in the future that you have to wait for before the download option is available. . .    For those of you that want to try it anyway. . . . the iPhone flixster app seems to be able to stream when you have a high speed wifi available.  I am still currently unable to test on my Toshiba Thrive as the flixster app does NOT support Android Honeycomb 3.1 or above at this time. .FAIL!  So my advice is just by the base disc you want and make your own digital copy that is DRM free.  And by the way love the movie. . .
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|saying this item has \\"Digital Copy\\" is a straight up lie.  \\"Digital Copy\\" is understood by users to be a file that can be loaded onto you iTunes or Windows Media Device to be used as you wish (granted there is always some form of DRM).  simply put this item DOES NOT HAVE A DIGITAL COPY it is false advertising
B000002GBJ|5.0|I really should have heard Six Wives of Henry VIII several years ago.  No excuse why I've waited this long when back in 2003 I was enjoying the heck out of my aunts record collection and especially Journey to the Center of the Earth.    Six Wives of Henry VIII is pretty awesome.  In case you're wondering, no, it doesn't resemble Yes.  At least to me it doesn't.  Not even a little bit.  This feels more like a symphonic fantasy come to life through several exciting arrangements includings keyboards, synths, classical pianos and choirs.  You can tell a ton of effort went into the making of this carefully planned music.  \\"Catherine Parr\\" is a dazzling display of the arrangements I mention above, and it's performed with such passion and excitement that it's honestly nearly impossible to find any faults with it.  Perhaps only those who believe rock and classical should never be combined would hate it.    Alright, perhaps moments of \\"Anne of Cleves\\" remind me of the classic period of Yes (in the bass work especially).  The keyboard jam is probably nothing Yes ever would have played, though (unless they attempted such a thing in a live setting and I'm not aware of it).  For the most part it's a pretty extraordinary jam.  Some of it feels sort of forgettable to me though.  Perhaps it's because it's overlong by a few minutes... or maybe it just needs to grow on me some more.  Anyway the guitar solo at the end is pretty outrageous.  Overall, this entire song is significantly more aggressive than anything from Journey to the Center of the Earth.   Update- wow that keyboard jam DOES improve!  Improves dramatically might I add!  I guess I was just too overwhelmed by it originally- overwhelmed by the complex nature of it.  \\"Catherine Howard\\" has a piano intro strikingly similar to the Cat Stevens classic \\"Morning Has Broken\\" (and you can probably guess why!) before eventually morphing into a partially somber/mostly upbeat classical piece.  I LOVE the switch to a ragtime jam halfway through!  I wasn't expecting that at all.  I guess if I HAD to find a complaint it's that the synths feel sort of incomplete and out of place.  Not really a problem since those moments are few and far between, though.  \\"Anne Boleyn\\" jumps around from delicate piano solos to effectively written moody classical parts.  I actually think this is my favorite song on the album.  The instrumental passages continue to explore new territory for the entire 7-minute run, and I can't recall the last time I heard a chorus used so creatively.  In one spot the chorus is humming softly behind some piano lines in a moody way and then suddenly EXPLODES in a moment of emotional glory.  It's a wonderful song.  Actually the whole album is wonderful.  I really shouldn't have waited this long to finally give it a chance (as I mention above).  Where my Rick Wakeman journey takes me from here is yet to be determined.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|stay away from this!!!!!!! why would you have an ultra violet digital copy stay away. i know everyone loves Harry as i due but why are they changing this after 10 years of movies!!!! stay away.

B001F12J48|1.0|Only good thing is that it has 3D disc and 2D disc. Even after using the included glasses we could not see it in 3D. All one would see is picture with dual lines. Do NOT buy if you're buying this for 3D.
B00005JLKB|3.0|Smallville is one of the best things to happen to the Superman brand in a long time. In this--its first season--Clark Kent is introduced as a freshman in high school. He faces a myriad of \\"meteor freaks\\" (villians spawned from the meteor shower that he arrived in as a child) throughout the season.  It is visually fantastic. Everything in Smallville is beautiful, and the director/s do a good job of showing that beauty. From the Kents' farm, to the meteor shower that started it all, the sets are perfect. The actors are also (visually) perfect. While Tom Welling is ten years older than the character he plays, that fact is overshadowed by the fact that he is an ideal mold of the Superman icon (tall, dark and handsome/sexy).  There is no seasonal story arc. Each episode stands on its own in this season. There is some character development, but over all nothing significant happens in this season if you are considering the entirety of the series. The actors, for the most part, aren't all that skilled. Tom/Clark doesn't emote well and is awkward in his reactions. Allison/Chloe is the only actor, I believe, who portrays her character well. The rest of them, while very attractive, aren't all that skilled. Soap Opera stock, I suppose.  The writing is OK in this season. As I said, it is a season of stand alone episodes. If that floats your boat, then I'm sure the handful of ludicrous episodes will be outweighed by the half a dozen great ones. The writers start the infamous super villian Lex Luthor as Clark's friend, so there is something to watch and take note of in that relationship. The interpersonal relationships are common and predictable.  + Beautifully done  + Sexy cast  + Each episode is a mini movie; isolated story arcs  - Poor acting  - Predictable writing  - The season itself has no greater impact than itself. There isn't character progression or development, and if you like seasonal story arcs, there is none in season one of Smallville.  5/10

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I buy these combo packs because of the versatility of watching high def at home, DVD's for road trips, and digital copies for when we are out and about or flying and the kids need some type of distractor. I had no idea that \\"UltraViolet\\" Digital Copy meant that you really don't get a copy, you just get access over the internet. Who wants that? This is a worthless product and I am upset that I opened the combo pack with out reading the reviews before hand. Also I want my stuff together and I don't want a different app from different movie companies to find my stuff. How is someone supposed to remember to look on iTunes for one movie and flixster for another? Ridiculous.   We buy Digital copies to simplify our collections and be able to have access anywhere! It is false advertising to say that you have access \\"anywhere\\" with ultraviolet because you have to have wi-fi. it is access where there is wifi, not everywhere. It also says if you download the app you can stream with iPod touch's and iPhones and this is also a lie. I have an IPod 3gs with the newest operating system and it gives me an error warning say \\"Full movie streaming is not supported by your device!\\" This new \\"digital copy\\" product is crap and you should hold out and not make my mistake!

0385534639|5.0|What can one add to all the accolades this book has been getting?  To say that Le Cirque des Reves, The Circus of Dreams was magical would be an understatement.  It is a fantastical creation from the opening lines to the very last word.<br />What I loved most about this book was overwhelming admiration for this author's<br />Talent in creating a world that doesn't exist but one I completely believed in. I want to go to this circus, to see the various tents. I want to walk in the Ice Garden, to walk in the hall with the snow, see The Wishing Tree, walk among the clouds and be there for the bonfire.  I was so immersed in this world I didn't want the book to end.<br /><br />The narrative of the book takes a little getting used to, it is split in two parts; Marco and Celia's story and that of the various characters of the circus; the second story is of Bailey, a young boy who falls in love with the circus.  This narrative begins at a later point in time until eventually the two storylines merge.  It takes patience to get to the point when all the threads of the story finally begin to come together.<br /><br />My only quibble would be the lack of character development, there was so much more I wanted to know about a number of the people of the circus.  It seemed at times their descriptions or purpose was rather vague and not well defined. But that is really a minor complaint.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of the book, narrated by the always brilliant Jim Dale who breathes life into every book he `performs'.  Fantasy is not one of my favorite genres but for me this book defines fantastical.<br /><br />Without a doubt one of my favorite reads this year.
B003L77G06|5.0|The first season of this show kept me laughing all season, and Season 2 did not disappoint. Hilarious as always. In my opinion, this is the best all-around cast in a tv comedy. Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen, Eric Stonestreet, Sofia Vergara, Ed O'Neill, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and all the child actors are fantastic. Each one shines individually and they play so well off each other.
0062060554|3.0|Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of the past 20 years of her life. She thinks she is 20 years old, still in college. Each day her husband Ben must tell her who she is and fill her in on her life.  Every night she goes to sleep knowing that she will wake up with all her memories gone again.  Eventually she finds a journal she has been keeping; when she opens it the first sentence is \\"Don't trust Ben.\\"  With the help of her doctor Christine slowly (ever so slowly) ties to put together the bits and pieces of memories that she has trying to understand what has happened to her. Are they true memories? Who should be trusted; the loyal husband  or the unreliable narrator Christine?<br /><br />Sounds good right? And in fact for about 1/3 of the book it is.  About that point I was wondering if there was something wrong with my memory because I was having d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again.  Every chapter started almost identically to the previous chapter.  My eyes would glaze over until I got to the one point in the chapter that was different from the one before.  By the time I got to the end I was wishing I could forget the weeks I had spent slogging through this \\"thriller\\", that was unfortunately not very thrilling.<br /><br />I thought in some spots the writing was good, but the pacing was tedious. Also it isn't beneficial to a thriller when you figure out most of the ending half way through the book.  Towards the end the book took some dramatic twists and turns that you've probably seen on a Made for TV Movie of the Week. My eyes were rolling so much I was getting dizzy.  One major plot point that I just couldn't comprehend is how Christine had lived like this for 20 years, it would seem that something more could have been done to help her in all that time and then all of a sudden everything in her life is solved so easily in a rather short period of time.  It was quite unrealistic.  So it was for me an average read, maybe a bit below average. Nothing outstanding or that I will remember after a few months.mber after a few months.
B004GGM444|4.0|This and Feed Me's Big Adventure are my go-to dubstep albums.  There's some reference to the use of autotune in another review, and that had me concerned, but it's not what you think.  It's mostly really interesting pitch-shifting that's going on.<br /><br />Overall, this is what I think dubstep should sound like.  Dirty, nasty bass lines and melodic noise.<br /><br />Just brilliant.
0446573019|4.0|See book summaries above.<br />Well I have to say I'm guilty when it comes to thinking 'Jack Reacher', et al, when it comes to this thriller. There's nothing original when it comes to the protagonist, John Puller, who is a combat veteran and 'one of the best' in the Army's CID. What made this good was the writing one comes to expect from David Baldacci. I have to say that when I was about halfway through I thought it was a little slow in pulling me in. The latter half made up for it all. I like the Camel Club series better as of now but I'm willing to give Puller another go.
B0000029LG|5.0|I love MJ and love his music. This collection has the most of my favorite songs and when i am walking  every morning, i listen these CDs all the time. It gives me the energy and positive spirit to do my walking. This is mt favorite CD and I feel so sorry MJ is not with us anymore.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I definitely suggest buying it. It's tough, but its crazy fun. Definitely worth the 99 cents, and it doesn't have ads, so support the developer. It's not gonna hurt you at all.
B0060V1WJ6|2.0|Based on the powerhouse of a cast (particularly Gosling and Moore), I expected this film to be funny and intelligent.  It was neither!  Instead, it was incredibly trite, unrealistic and filled with lowbrow humor.  SUCH a disappointment.
0151003084|5.0|Dark humor fills these pages. The sentences are very simple but convey a sense of brutality that cannot be expressed any other way. I have given one copy away as a gift, and I always show it to friends who have never seen it before. We have tons of fun with this.
B005DD7H50|5.0|This is an excellent film!  Limitless is well-acted, has a very interesting plot line, and makes creative use of cinematography and special effects without going overboard.  It's also extremely suspenseful and contains enough plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the very end, where it leaves you feeling sad to see the credits roll because it was such an exciting ride.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like this one. Mellow app, good time waster. Didn't cost much so not too bad all around I guess.
0670022411|5.0|This was a very enjoyable cold weather, curl up and read all day book.  The historical and cultural (e.g. Oxford) information was fascinating.  The use of famous literature and people to move the story or relationship along was fun.  The characters were multi-faceted and complicated.  Nobody was perfect (hallelujah).  And it all came together and moved along and kept me very interested.  I wish the sequel was available now!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This movie is not just one of the best movies of 2011 but of all time.  This movie did not just beautifully tell the tale of the Jews in Europe during WWII, it illustrated how wrong it is for one group of human beings to hate another group of different human beings.  As I have read about and watched the plight of the Jews in Movies, I have always viewed Jews as Jews (not us), when the terrible truth is that we are all just human beings, each as important as the other.  This was the first story telling vehicle (out of so many) to make me realize that.  Aside from that most important life lesson, the movie was perfect and beautiful in everyway - filmed, acted, directed, edited, scored, and with stories of today's investigative reporter and WWII holocaust woven together most skillfully.  I am a person of Scotch, Irish, German, and English descent yet I loved this movie at least as much as any of the great ones that I have seen.  I cried during this movie as I realized that the younger generations who could really benefit from seeing this probably won't.  For those of you who love Kristin Scott Thomas, she does not disappoint here.  She is supported by a yeoman class of veteran supporting actors.
1451648537|4.0|I'm not a big fan of biographies, particularly contemporary subjects. But the resurrection of Apple and the loss of Steve Jobs seemed like a pivotal point in our near history that deserved a bit more attention than what the evening news could offer. While I was right in assuming most of it, the truth is that Jobs just isn't riveting enough to warrant a novel of this size. Much of the book contains mundane details that could really apply to almost anyone working within the tech industry today.  I was also turned off by the vivisected detail of drug use/abuse and not at all impressed with his failed comprehension of the severity of his own health and the profound luck of having a second chance, if only he had bothered to use it.  In the end, I walked away from this book feeling a bit sad for Jobs. He's much more human now than I had perceived his as before and ultimately, I suppose that is the intent of a biopic. Good read, but not recommended if you'd prefer to think of Jobs as the superhuman we had all believed he was in life.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Dear my fellows, first let me project out that 4 Stars instead of 5 only because like a woman who is a 9 out of 10, she becomes a 10 out of 10 the day she begins to like me and a woman who is a 7 out of 10 becomes a 9, similarly, the day she is mine. This film for me is 4 out of 5 only because I don't own it. I saw it in the Cinema 3 times fast. Fast because time does fly when you're having fun. I rented the film as soon as it was released on DVD and I rented the Double Disk Edition that is available here on Amazon. I viewed the film both as per usual as well as with the Directors Commentary Feature. I then viewed the additional materials on the other disk that showed some of the making of the feature as well as little inside scoops on the training Sir Thomas Cruise Mapother III (Tom Cruise) went through, or should I say 'endured' in the name of creating this masterplay of motion picture. Before I continue, I would like to point out that I am being careful not to give any information away that could tell you about the important threads and currents throughout the film that I think you would be best discovering yourself from ensuring you partake in your own viewing pleasure of it. However, for those of you who have seen the film already or are wanting a deeper insight before watching it, I do have a page that explains the film in great detail and a simple search of my obscure name pertaining to things of a lock & key nature will immediately draw up my film explanations website as a first result. Tom Cruise stars as Vincent The Assassin, a philosophical hitman with a chip on his shoulder and a haircut to pay a hundred bucks for and a suit to sell your car for. He is chiseled into a humanoid picturesque walking, talking, breathing upright version of a Wild Grey Wolf. Many Acting Aficionados claim that his character is from a Method Acting perspective strongly rooted in the animal's demeanor and appearance. As Vincent, he kidnaps Max who is an LA cab driver played by Jamie Foxx. He is smooth, charming, slick and graceful and he makes things he does that are disgraceful seem like a loaded barrel full of fun. There are many stand out moments and entire scenes that become a poignant memory. Michael Mann, who directs this beautiful motion picture manages to capture essences of Los Angeles and Urban Life like Peter Parker catches photographs of Spiderman. Michael, much like Peter, knows how to do this all too well, because Michael is Urban Life and Peter IS Spiderman. No one captures spider better than spider can. And this film captures those so many subtle threads of Corporate Reality and the Pursuit of Happiness. Max, the cab driver, reminds me of Will Smith in the aforementioned feature where he is trying to become financially free and is working his way up the entrepreneur / sales person's jacob ladder. In this film however, it's an even more typical dream, Max simply wants to move up from being a cab driver to being a limo driver. But after being kidnapped by Vincent The Cold Blooded Killer Assassin from a place worse than hell and possibly more beautiful at the same time - will he even make it through the night? Watch Collateral to learn harsh lessons without having to go through harsh hardships to get there. In the name of those people like Max; who have learned the hard way.
0307593312|4.0|I had this book on my recommended reads list for a little while and it's been some time since I broke for my usual genres to try a book like this. I wasn't disappointed. The story and detail of 1980's Tokyo was a unique treat. I can't say I'm familiar with any other book quite like it. A lot of the text did drag on a little longer than necessary and I couldn't shake the feeling this would have been a spectacular short story (albeit one I probably would have never read then ha!). But that little nagging aside, the book is great and I'm glad I finally got to it. This has been an unusual year of books for me but I'm enjoying expanding my horizons a little bit.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Works on HTC flyer, but the graphics are horrendous. I wish that popcap would resolve the issue. Resolution is bad even on my optimus v, which is sad because it has such a small screen.
B00005214X|5.0|Music, at its best, can be transcendent.  George Harrison's brilliant \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is beautiful, powerful behind its wall of sound, and goes straight to the heart.  It had been years since I listened to it.  After watching Martin Scorcese's new film on the life of George Harrison, I realized how much I missed Harrison and his music.  Harrison was a seeker, and what he found is here for everyone to share.  This is one of the great albums of all time, and there really is no comparable work.
0515149489|5.0|Nov. 12, 2011: I've been reading Nora Roberts' books since 1982 when I met her at a meeting of Washington Romance Writers, where she handed me copies of her first five paperbacks. I have been reading her books ever since. What a career she has managed to create for herself! She's amazing. \\"The Search\\" is surely one of her finest. She does exhaustive research; she describes people well, their feelings, their perspective, their pain, their faults. She does dialog well. I know that she is an inspiration for other writers. In \\"The Search\\" she is writing about Search and Rescue, and wonderful dogs. In \\"Northern Lights,\\" which I am reading now, she draws us into Alaska, cold, frozen, challenging, difficult. She makes me feel as if I'm really there. If you are daunted by long descriptions, friend, you have the right to skip, skim, or put the book down forever! I have read hundreds of her books and have at least a dozen waiting for me. I just shake my head in amazement at her incomparable skill! Good work, Elke. Bravo! Kate Rose Carson (author of \\"When Not to Kiss!).

0765350386|5.0|Wow.  I kind of wish I had discovered this book a whole lot earlier.<br /><br />I really, really enjoyed this story.  The characters were rich and well-imagined, and all of them endearing in their own way.  Vin was so believable as a heroine, and Kelsier...well, he was just amazing too.  In some ways he reminded me a bit of a cross between Howl in Howl's Moving Castle and Spike from Cowboy Bebop.  I don't know why.  But I love those characters.<br /><br />There were so many things about this story to love.  The unexpected premise, the unique system of Allomancy, the dismal but richly explored world, the unlikely group of heroes, the complexities of the plot -- intrigue, roguery, corruption, betrayal, failure, success...delicious.  From fairly early on I thought I had figured out some secrets about the background story...and then...just when I thought my presumptions had been confirmed...Sanderson blew them all away.  That was absolutely fabulous.  I love being surprised.<br /><br />There were times when the descriptions of Allomantic battles got a bit tiresome, just trying to keep track of all the Pushing and Pulling on this or that object with this or that metal.  But even without trying to keep all the exact particulars visualized in my imagination, the accounts still gave me enough anchor to see some truly spectacular battles.<br /><br />On the one hand, I did feel a little bit betrayed by the way the story played out.  Somehow I was expecting this to be the sort of story where the heroes are completely...I don't know...normal, or even a little less noble than the average run of men.  But this isn't just a crew of cunning, talented, and resourceful thieves.  There is something special about them that sets them apart from others.  But that might just be a problem caused by my expectations.  I'm not entirely sure where I got those expectations in the first place.  But they are such believable, such real characters that I can get over it...in fact, I might have been disappointed if my expectations were met.<br /><br />Now I can't wait to read the next book...especially with the question we are left with at the ending of this one.  Fabulous.t.    Now I can't wait to read the next book...especially with the question we are left with at the ending of this one.  Fabulous.
B0052U59F4|4.0|Well I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this book. I found parts of it to be amazing and others found wanting.   I love that there was no real rhyme or reason for the attraction between Christian and Ana, I think people meet randomly everyday and become \\"obsessive\\" about it. I like that when the relationship took off there was an intense passion. I enjoyed the bdsm portions of the book I think it really brought out a \\"different\\" kind of love story.  However, the constatnt insecurities and the whole \\"trying to change someone\\" theme really became tiresome. I love that they were willing to compromise on what a 'relationship\\" would be but I can't help being severly annoyed with the \\"oh woe is me, what am I gonna do, I love him but not all of him\\" attitude. I might also say that when you give into someone and their desires I don't think it's ok to hold it against them. I didn't want to put out spoliers hence the lack of exact detail.    Overall I'm glad I gave it a try, after reading some other reviews I was just too curious not to. If it had been either longer or cheaper I would have been more inclined to jump into the second book. enjoy :)
0385339100|5.0|I was turned onto this book by literary agent Donald Maass in his instructional book Writing the Breakout Novel, in which Maass gives many examples from  works of other authors to support his writing theories. Of all the books he mentioned, I felt The Partner received the highest praise. Although I have seen two movies based on Grisham's books, this if the first novel of his I have read. Too many books, too little time. This one is a gem. Patrick Lanigan has disappeared to Brazil and with him ninety million dollars. He is caught in the first few pages and the remainder of the book consists of intelligent twists and turns as he attempts to free himself from his misdeeds. It's a complicated story, simply and well told, and I stayed up for two straight nights to get to the amazing conclusion. I highly recommend it.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|The images on this DVD are so dark that I had to watch it on my television with all the lights off.  The movie itself is far from perfect (I agree with many of the complaints in other reviews regarding creative changes made from the source material) but it does work in its way.  The deleted scenes are not many and I wonder if they are all of them, since I've read otherwise online (among other claims is that Fred's full death scene is included).  I would say that this movie got more right than it did wrong and I enjoyed it in the theaters, although I was not estatic about it.  A word of caution to any of those who are tempted to get the Walmart exclusive 2 DVD version because there are only three features on that second disk.  Like DH pt.1, Warner Brothers has really crapped out on the DVD extras.  If you have a choice, definitely go with the BlueRay.  I have no intention of using that Ultraviolet copy so I can't comment on that, but judging from most of the 1 star ratings, its not good.
0307474275|5.0|I finally got around to reading this best selling book more than eight years after it was published, had led to a hit movie starring Tom Hanks, and inspired a slew of other books on DaVinci and his secret codes. I opened it up with some reluctance. I didn't think I would like it. Codes and secret societies and highly involved mysteries are not my cup of tea. Was I wrong! I don't believe I have ever read the last few dozen pages of a book quicker than I read these. I was in an absolute frenzy to get to the end and solve the riddles so delicately and passionately presented by author Brown. The suspense generated by this story is intense. I will think of it often in the months to come.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|This movie is AWESOME!! WB (Warner Brother's) SUCKS!!  They have included in your $26 purchase a blu-ray, a dvd and an Ultraviolet digital copy of the movie.  Ultraviolet is a Streamed version through Flixster (which WB acquired in May, 2011) and is NOT an actual digital copy.  This process is so BACKWARDS it's crazy!  You are required to have a FLIXSTER account which then want's to access your FACEBOOK account.  Then when your all finished guess what.  You can't WATCH the movie on your TV trying to use your DIGITAL copy that you paid for.  Here's why:  You download the copy to your flixster account, which then you download the Flixster app to your Apple I-touch or I-pad and then when you try to connect your Television with your I-touch or I-pad the flixster app doesn't send the signal to your Television!  SCAM!!    The actual Harry Potter movie is AWESOME!  The 3 star review is for the Ultraviolet Digital copy that Warner Brother's is SCAMMING you into buying!!  So unless you have a Blu-ray player then don't try to use your paid for digital copy!
B005J29HCQ|5.0|do not be fooled by the fact that you have already downloaded a bootlegged version, or own the good vibrations box, which has a healthy helping of smile outtakes, but nothing near the completed album, or brian wilson's 2004 re-recording, although he did a great job with his band. the remastering is excellent: listen to how awesome the opening track \\"heroes and villains\\" sounds on this. brian wilson was right when he said 'smile' would be a huge quantum leap forward from 'pet sounds' , a milestone album in its own right. also, disc 2 has some awesome recordings, the original versions of the songs recorded at the end of 1966. sometimes these second disc are a total letdown (remember the \\"bonus disc\\" that came with the beatles \\"let it be naked\\" a few years ago? what a letdown!) also, the edition i obtained at barnes and noble includes a poster and a little 'smile' button. a very cool package, it's been a long time coming...
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Why, Why, WHY would they change the format of the 'digital copy' for PART TWO of a movie.  So I have part one downloaded to Itunes and my Ipad, but NOT the second half of a movie??  This format is completely wrong.  Will never buy another movie that says it's an ULTRAVIOLET 'digital copy'. They say UltraViolet like you're getting something special... you can't download it to itunes, you can't watch it 'anywhere' you want.  How anyone thought this would be popular is beyond me!
B000002OTL|5.0|essentially, it began as a quentin tarantino 'mix tape' (as all of his movie soundtracks usually are) it played a big part in the mid nineties resurgence of surf music (especially beneficial to the career of surf guitarist dick dale, who's miserelou features on the soundtrack and is played at the very beginning of the movie. the bits of movie dialogue included in between the songs on the soundtrack are very cool (the movie dialogue bits are annoying on the natural born killers ost. another tarantino project)just about every single song on this is a stone cold classic, most are forgotten instrumental surf jams by bands like the centurions and some cools songs from ricky nelson (lonesome town), dusty springfield (son of a preacher man) and flowers on the wall (by the statler bros) also love some of the newer songs on the soundtrack, like the maria mckee song and urge overkill's smokin cover of neil diamond gem \\"girl, you'll be a woman soon) they are selling it for a penny here on amazon. what the heck are you waiting for? if you don't already own this, BUY THE DARN THING!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Evanescence may take awhile between CDs, but that is because EVERY song on their CD is worthy of the spot. Not one song on their CD is every bad.

B004ZN9W5M|2.0|Couldn't wait to get this but was very dissappointed.  I suggest buying the SAX remaster before it becomes unavailable.  First Remaster ever where I have to say it is not loud enough.  Sax version has much more punch.  That being said I believe the DSOTM, WYWH, and ANIMALS do sound better on 2011 version.  Not sure what went wrong on The Wall....I am extremely disappointed.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|BEWARE - This bluray is listed on Ultraviolet as containing a digital copy in that format.<br /><br />This means it won't work.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|It's easy to hear how Brian Wilson got stuck working on this stuff for so long.  It's infectious.  It gets inside you and stays there.  I can't get that falsetto from \\"Surf's Up\\" on \\"columnated ruins domino\\" out of my head.  All the sections of \\"Heroes and Villians\\" are still just a happy jumble in my head, sorting itself out, ever so slowly.  SMiLE is great.  Get it.  Find out what it is to you.  I can't tell you that, so I'll move on the presentation.<br /><br />The box is beautiful.  Expect it to take up about as much room on your shelf as around 7 or 8 regular-cover single LPs on your shelf.  It is also a bit taller than a regular LP cover, so if you've got tight clearance, you may have to put it somewhere else.<br /><br />The book is put together well, and fascinating.<br /><br />The folder with the 45s and CDs is neat, but the 45s had come loose in my set and were just bouncing around in there.  No damage, but that might not have worked out well if my box had been bounced around more before I got to it.  Also, the CDs are slipped into slot in the cardboard folder, just like Sony did with the Miles Davis Kind of Blue 50th Anniversary box a few years back.  In Sony's case, every disc was pretty badly scratched.  That didn't happen to any of my SMiLE discs, but you should probably check that out as soon as you dig in, just in case you have a return on your hands.  The photo set inside the folder was a nice addition; it gave me something to hold onto by side four.<br /><br />My LPs were perfect on all four sides.  Extremely flat, almost CD-quiet.  The 180-gram discs feel like they will be around for a very long time.  The gatefold sleeve seems a perfect match for the music.  One caveat:  I understand the inner sleeves on the stand-alone LP package are the Capitol ad sleeves; in this set, the inner sleeves are plain white paper.<br /><br />All told, I'm extremely happy with the SMiLE box.  I'll sleep for several night dreaming about the music.  I just hope there aren't too many dreams about Mrs. O'Leary's Cow.

B001B0G5WA|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of the music; I won't try to add to that.  I just want to chime in and say my 180-gram vinyl copy is perfectly flat and very quiet.<br /><br />While it would be great to see a clarification on the back-and-forth between Michael Fremer and Mark Linett here on whether this release is all-analog, I must say I disagree with Fremer's assessment that the sound is flat and lifeless.  I find the vinyl to have a deeper soundstage than the Mono/Stereo CD that's currently out, which is itself fantastic (especially the stereo mixes of the instrumentals--there's so much going on there that the separation really helps dig out the details).  There seems to be a little more room around the arrangements on the vinyl, and this record is dense, if anything, so any room helps.  Also, I hear significantly less hiss on the vinyl than on the mono half of the CD (it seems like the hiss gets cancelled out in the stereo--it's there if you put your ear up to one speaker, but mostly gone if you sit in a reasonable listening position).  I guess that could be a difference in my own chain, but the high bells and cymbals are all there on the vinyl, so I really think there's just less of it there.<br /><br />To close, I'll just add that I don't have any earlier pressings of Pet Sounds to compare this one to, but this one is one of the best-sounding records I have.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|Quick background:  a fan since 1980 Perm. Waves tour.  I've seen them 10x,  twice on the Time Machine Tour (2010,2011).<br /><br />No Blu-Ray will ever substitute for being at the show live.  But this is a great momento of that tour.  The audio is fine and the videography is VERY fine !  It is so much better than Rush In Rio, which I think is a visual disaster.  The boys are right on the money with their respective playing.  My only negative comment is Geddy's voice:  it's not able to meet the demands of the early work, and at times, it's just not good.  He slurs lyrics like Elton; if I didn't know the words, I'd have no idea what he was saying.  Time waits for no one, so give him a break on his vocals and instead, enjoy the tight riffs and the genuine commaraderie shown between the three of them while they are playing.  Best Buy has this in stores right now for $19.99.  I'm not sure why Amazon has a Decemember release date on this ?

B0000028UK|5.0|After a HUGE INCREDIBLE MASTERPIECE like TEN, PEARL JAM did it again...the songs from Vs may not be ABSURD classics like ALIVE, EVEN FLOW or JEREMY...but for me, this one, VS is on the same level of TEN...All the songs are really great...from the heavy punk of GO, REARVIEWMIRROR, ANIMAL and BLOOD...to the acoustics of DAUGHTER and ELDERLY WOMAN...WOW!!!!This is a tremendous classic!!!!one of the best albuns of all time, without any doubt!!!!BRAVO, PEARL JAM!!!This one and TEN are INCREDIBLE!!!
0571283578|3.0|The grande dame of British mysteries, P. D. James, forsakes her most famous protagonist, Commander Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard, and chooses as heroine of her latest novel the most successful of the Bennet family disposals, Elizabeth, the second of five daughters, who married Mr. Darcy, a most desirable gentleman and owner of the vast estate of Pemberley. As one surmises from early pages, it's a continuation of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1813), a novel which deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th-century England.<br /><br />James, however, throws in a murder in the woodland near Pemberley with apologies to \\"the shade of Jane Austen for involving her beloved Elizabeth in the trauma of a murder investigation.\\" Well, something had to enliven the rather dull married lives of privileged Englishwomen at the turn of the 19th century other than fancy balls and new gowns ... and after all...\\"A murder in the family can provide the fission of excitement at fashionable dinner parties, but little social credit can be expected from the brutal dispatch of an underdistinguished captain of the infantry without money or breeding to make him interesting.\\" (159-160)<br /><br />Expect little reading excitement with the resolution of the murder. But in true Austenite spirit a reader can become very interested in which suitor Mr. Darcy's sister Georgiana will choose to marry: the poor but handsome Mr. Alveston, a lawyer, or the monied but arrogant Colonel Fitzwilliam.<br /><br />The Baroness, in a way, is spoofing us.  Early in the book, when Elizabeth is thinking of her short courtship and subsequent marriage with Darcy, she muses:  \\"If this were fiction, could even the most brillant novelist contrive to make credible so short a period in which pride has been subdued and prejudice overcome?\\" (50)<br /><br />Yes, Elizabeth, it can be done in 310 pages with a rather large font...

B005P89F1C|5.0|This is his best album yet!!! my favourite songs are:  Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas.  Mistletoe.  Christmas Eve.  All I Want Is You.  Home This Christmas feat. The Band Perry.  Silent Night.(This song gave me the chills when I first heard it)  Christmas Love.  Someday At Christmas.(This song reminded me of what he used to be like before the fame)  Overall I love this whole album I listened to it without bypassing one song!! But the song I like the least is Drummer Boy feat. Bysta Rhymes I don't like it because I think he just ruins the song by rapping I think he should have sung the song instead of rapping and should have taken Busta off the song.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Rarely use the word \\"love\\" when referring to games...but I can say, without equivocation, that I love this game. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating -- with the benefit of the perfect score being provided as an added challenge for those who aspire for more.
B004VQFQ2Q|3.0|I bought this mistakenly thinking it was a remaster of the admittedly horrid sounding original disc. Well that's not the case as reportedly the original masters were lost making a re-master impossible. The good news is its a GREAT album! Very nearly as good as the Dio years. Also you get a kicka** live disc that makes this worth the price of admission.

0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss makes my heart thump, thump, thump.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins did a perfect job creating this sweet- yet slightly sticky- romance.  The story is filled with so much emotion.  One minute your heart is content, your stomach is starting to feel little wings fluttering against your insides and the next your eyebrows are furrowed in confusion, trying to figure out why one of the characters would do such a thing.  The anticipation fills you up until you think you're just about to bust, when finally, there's relief.  But wait, it's not over yet.  There's that turn you were expecting.  Then everything is okay again.  Poor Anna and St. Clair and the emotional roller coaster they're trapped on.<br /><br />St. Clair and I have a love/hate relationship.  I love him, I really do, but there are just things about him that irk me.  Throughout the book, he barely seems to make the decisions I'm begging him to make.  I know it's not always his fault, but come on, dude!  I've never, ever felt this way about any other book character.  The moments where the author showed the intimate feelings between St. Clair and Anna were breathtaking and I can relate to that feeling, so it made the experience even better.<br /><br />Before reading, I barely knew anything about Paris, and now I feel like I've lived there with Anna for nine months.  I feel like I've watched this girl blossom from an insecure teenager into a confident young woman, battling heartbreak and forgotten friendships.<br /><br />I believe that most people who pick up this book will realize that these characters are definitely relatable, making it easier to become attached to the story.  I'm a hopeless romantic and I always love a happy ending.  This book sure gave me what I wanted.  Stephanie Perkins has created a charming, witty, and brilliant treasure that I will make sure to pass on.

B0050VI5SI|5.0|This CD is just awesome in general because not only are you getting amazing indie songs, but it's like each song has its own theme and just makes you do this :D
B004NROYUI|1.0|I received this case today, very excited to put it on my brand new X100, only to realize that the case is a complete knock-off. It looks just like the real thing, except it doesn't quite fit the camera snugly, the 'leather' is much darker than the original, and the strap is much thinner and flimsier than the real thing. Beware.
0812973992|4.0|The main character in Colum McCann's Let the Great World Spin isn't a person but a city. From a book I read several months ago, what still stands out to me is the great New York City of the 1970s. She is a complex character: an unbearably dirty drug-ridden Bronx neighbourhood, given a ray of hope by a young Irish monk who shares coffee and a decent bathroom with the prostitutes who work the streets; a seemingly shallow rich Upper East Side that has been just as devastated by the Vietnam War as anywhere else; a teenage subculture of tagging the hardest-to-reach spots of subway tunnels. And all of this brought together, holding its breath, as a French tightrope walker prances his way, a quarter of a mile high, between the World Trade Towers. I am left with a sad yet warm feeling that alongside war and poverty there will also always be love and art. Overall, a very good read.
0446608955|5.0|When I started to read the book, I realized that something was different in this book. I am actually not a big fan of reading book, but I just need to say this book kept my hand to turn to the next page. It will be quite rude if I tell you what is going on because that will be spoiling the fun that comes from figuring out the scenes from the story. Though, I will definitely say that everyone has to read this book once in a lifetime. The story is mellifluous, touching, and wonderfully created. Trust me, it will touch your heart so deeply that you will never forget the story.
0385535139|4.0|I have just finished \\"The Litigators\\" and did enjoy it.  I have  difficulty \\"getting into\\" some books, but this was not a slow start for me.  Midway it was slowing down a bit, but then it seemed to pick up again and soon it ended.  I have felt that a few of Grishom's weren't top entertainment, but this was worth the read and I was never sure what I would find until I completed it. Interesting tale about a small lawyer on the street taking on big money and a big pharmaceutical company with deep pockets.
0307341577|5.0|This story about a girl who sets out to discover the truth about her family's murder is very tantalizing with unexpected plot twists and turns. Characterization is very well fleshed out and includes superb imagery. Skilled writing and great transitions make it easy to read. This is one novel that I hated to see end. Five stars!<br /><br />Warning: There is a mention, and one longer scene that involves animal cruelty.  But you'll be able to recognize ahead of time when you arrive at those parts, so you can easily skip over those sections without affecting your overall comprehension, if you so choose.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I didn't follow the Firefly TV series until it went off the air and I caught it on Hulu.  I wish I had watched it while on TV - perhaps a larger audience would have kept the show going for more than a season.  At least the movie wrapped up most of the lose ends of the TV show.
1451627289|5.0|I'll admit that I'm biased - I've been a loyal SK fan since the days of \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Salem's Lot,\\" and it wouldn't much matter to me what the premise of the book was; just seeing SK's name on the cover is enough to prompt me to pull out my wallet. Yes, some of his efforts have been stronger than others, but a weak one here and there hasn't discouraged me from feeling a thrill when each new book is announced. I've enjoyed them all.  But this one?  THIS is SK's high water mark.  You'll know from reading the synopsis above these reviews that the story concerns a teacher named Jake who's asked by a dying friend to go into the past to prevent the murder of President Kennedy. Fulfilling his friend's last request might be enough to drive Jake to agree - but he's also got a more personal reason for traveling through time, to undo something that took place half a century ago. It's the very personal slant of this book that made it succeed so beautifully for me: over the course of 800-odd pages we walk alongside Jake as he sets up a life for himself in the more innocent days of the late 1950s and early 1960s, as he finds a new job, new friends, and a new romance. The enormous amount of research that King and his staff did is evident as Jake takes us through daily life in small-town Texas. Nothing rings false, whether it's a reference to popular songs, the slang of the day, or the details of Lee Harvey Oswald's family life, and I could feel the blazing Texas summer heat and smell the stench of the oil refineries as I read.  The one weak spot in the story for me was the final few chapters, when the storytelling moves away from the close and intimate into something that's a bit too...well, enormous. But perhaps that's the result of the chapters immediately preceding them having moved me to tears.  I read recently that SK is being honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award, and I cannot think of anyone who is more deserving. Mr. King has made us laugh and cry, has thrilled us andskeeved us out time and time again over the past four decades. He's been quoted as saying that his work is the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, and that's true - to a point. It's fine storytelling of the kind that's been loved through the ages, something that touches a chord for millions of readers, and this book certainly upholds that tradition. Whether you buy it in hard copy (as I did) or via Kindle, make yourself comfortable in your favorite chair and get ready to lose yourself in Jake's world. You'll definitely enjoy the trip.
B004QIG7CW|4.0|This is a movie about a group of high school students who meet in detention after school. They discover they have two things in common: they all see themselves as outcasts and they all have a love of music. After some discussion, they decide to form a band. It's interesting how they come up with the name Lemonade Mouth for their band's name. Watch the movie and find out.<br /><br />I want to point out that while I do enjoy seeing a Disney movie now and then, that is not what attracted me to this movie. The thing that did attract me to this movie was the fact that it was directed by Patricia Riggen. Her name alone was enough to make me watch the movie. And Riggen didn't disappoint me. There is a certain central theme or thread that runs through Riggen's movies. And that is that she likes to take a group of people who are looked down upon by others and she gives them a face and a voice and she makes them human. Then she makes us care about these people. She did this to perfection in her film \\"Under the Same Moon\\" which is one of my all time favorite films.<br /><br />If you watch Lemonade Mouth, be aware that the movie does start out a little slow. But don't let that deter you from watching. The movie gets better and better as it progresses. I loved the diverse background of each of the students and how they stood up for each other and for their own beliefs. I'm not really big on musicals, that's the main reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead on 5, but this one is a winner. If you haven't seen it on TV, get the DVD and watch it. You'll be glad you did.

With ultraviolet digital copy, you have the choice of streaming video or downloading a copy on your computer BUT you still need internet access to watch it.  So if you want to watch while on a flight, to bad! Have all the other movies in the series that I can watch on my apple products.  I will not be buying this version.  Stay away from Ultra and hopefully it will go away!!!!
B005KDWUFA|3.0|Il Divo has spoiled me for all other types of music.  That said, I was disappointed in the arrangement for this album.  It's as if they are standing too far from the microphone and their voices are drowned out by the orchestra on most of the songs.

After a few listens the only track I keep coming back to is \\"Paradise\\" and sometimes \\"Up in Flames\\" and \\"Every Teardrop...\\" That's about it, the rest of the tracks are just plain bad, highly commercial too  can anyone tell me what tf is Rihanna doing on this album? That track just sounds like a weird mix. I resist to believe that this is Coldplay
0195073401|1.0|This text is the one of choice for micro courses in econ PhD programs. I (and several of my colleagues) almost quit the program because of this book (some in fact did). And it was not because we were mediocre students - some of us went on to become very well-published individuals. It was because the econ was lost in this book, with math taking primary importance (thus making it quite boring!). Ironically, the students who seemed to do well with this book had a very hard time coming up with thesis topics! Of course, this is all anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that it lacks any intuition - it is basically a math textbook with econ terminology sprinkled around. As a first micro course textbook this is unacceptable! There are many well-known economists out there (Jeff Wooldridge comes to mind) that publish widely-used textbooks which are easy on the reader without compromising scientific rigor.<br /><br />I blame this book for the state of econ research today - the increased complexity in models/formulas/derivations without any novel or interesting underlying ideas. In fact, most research papers out there have become like big-budget movies with stories that go nowhere. (A colleague of mine confided that he once co-wrote a paper whose message remained the same, but after a few rounds of revisions got so mathematically complex he could no longer present it on his own). If all econ PhD students are subjected to this text, there's no wonder...but I digress....<br /><br />The only survival tactic to econ PhD students struggling with this book is this:<br /><br />1. Relax! Understanding this book has nothing to do with your future success in the field.<br />2. Pick up Varian's micro textbooks - both the undergraduate and the graduate one. There is no shame is starting easy if that means you will really truly get it. Go over each with a fine tooth comb, and solve exercises at the end of each chapter.<br />3. Take a math course that covers matrix algebra, differential equations, and calculus in n-dimensional space, or just grab a book and go through it yourself (e.g. [[ASIN:0262082942 Mathematics for Economics - 2nd Edition]]).<br />4. Pick up Mas-Colell and see that it is really not as hard as it looked at the beginning.<br /><br />I guess part of the problem is not the textbook itself but that graduate programs use it for intro to micro PhD courses. Without proper priming, this text is torture. Unfortunately, many programs do this. I am mostly aware of the econ programs in Big Ten universities, some other schools of similar ranking, and a couple of leading departments (such as UC Berkeley). It is unfair to use such a sledgehammer of an introduction to micro - it will sort students based on technical skills rather than creativity (because most attrition does occur in the first year). It also sends the message that technical skills are of primary importance, which is not, in my opinion, what economics should be about. Technical skills should be there as an aid to solve complex models, and to make sure there are no mistakes in the theoretical implications of said models. If such skills are indeed the most important thing, then perhaps a math PhD program would be more appropriate.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I watched 50 minutes of scenery with a woman who lost her son saying \\"why god did this happen to me\\" every few minutes. This is one strange movie. There should be a warning something like \\"this movie is not for entertainment purposes\\" on the box.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this DVD, and we had a history lesson in the process.  It motivated me to read other histories about this time period which I borrowed from the library.  So I ended up becoming quite familiar with Queen Victoria's fascinating life and reign.  If my husband liked this DVD, anyone would!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|The cover is perfect for my iPhone 4s. For the price Amazon is charging the cover and screen guard are of very good quality. Had it for few weeks, no issues. Only reason i am reducing one star is the cutout for the apple logo in the back. I understand its purpose but actually the cutout is a place where dirt/dust gets accumulated. Since the cover is transparent even without cutout we can see apple logo.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I have seen many versions of the great novel \\"Jane Eyre\\" portrayed on the screen.  This one, in my opinion, wasn't one of the better efforts.  To me, Timothy Dalton will always be Mr. Rochester, and no one can fill his shoes.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|I love all three of the Transformers movies, but this last one is not my favorite.  Whatever the reason for Megan Fox not being in Dark of the Moon, there is a loss of continuity with a new female lead.  There was chemistry between Megan and Shia LaBeouf that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley doesn't bring to the screen, IMO.   I do appreciate the irony in the government getting outwitted by the Transformers again!  What would happen, if there's a Transformers IV, if they actually get cooperation at the outset instead of having some stumbling, bumbling upper echelon idiot get in their way?  I know it's in the script, and it gives good drama... but it's the same story line over and over.  In the end, however, it's (spoiler alert) the good guys' triumph over evil, the requisite stunts, explosions and stomach churning, death defying drama that makes this movie *almost* as good as the first two.  Definitely worth having, and thanks, as always, to Amazon for the availability of prepurchase!!
1416550550|5.0|\\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was a very satisfying read for the most part.  In the beginning it was a bit difficult to follow because I hadn't yet become acquainted with the characters, and the settings and time periods changed with nearly every chapter.  At first it was a bit like the maze which was described in the narrative--perhaps that's precisely why a maze was included in the gardens of the estate?  At any rate, I became lost in this mystery, but in a good way.  I couldn't put it down, and when I finished I wanted to start reading it all over again.  Some evils were alluded to but not described (which is the way I like it).  And I was able to figure out who the child's mother was, but couldn't for the life of me know why.  I'm sure it will surprise others as well.  I liked it immensely.
B005SAP45I|3.0|Saw this on an airplane. Had high hopes as the original was a really good flick. Oh well, I found this one trite and numb.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I saw the video version of North and South before I read the book.  Both were excellent.  Richard Armitage truly became John Thornton, and Daniella Denby-Ashe did a lovely portrayal of Margaret Hale.  Together, they were magical. I was pleased that one of the violent scenes in the video did not occur in the written narrative.  However the ending in the video was more to my taste than the original.  Either way, book or video, I would recommend both be experienced.  You will not regret the time you spend enjoying these treasures.

B001RIY4WE|2.0|I give this disc 2 stars. The movie is awesome, however this transfer is not. With 8 hours of Extra Features... how much room is left on the disc for the actual movie? Target is blowing this DB out at $5.00. I had it in my had and I had to put it back. I would have bought it if it was a 2 or 3 disk set, but not all on one squashed to fit Blu Ray. Sorry. Save your money and find a better Blue Ray copy than the Sky Net Edition.

B00004Y6NT|4.0|Dire Straits self titled debut from 1978 was soon followed by Communique, which was released in 1979.  As with the first album, this is Dire Straits before they went gobal and thats not an entirely bad thing.  Some keyboards can be heard in the background, however Mark Knofler's guitar and voice provide all the drive and influence behind this understated album.  Top tracks for me, Lady Writer and Once Upon A Time In The West.  Get this one if you want to hear how they moved towards being a world renoun band within the next two years.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|They treat all customers like pirates, they impose this Flixster nonsense on us, and deny users the ability to carry the movie around with them on their chosen devices.  The question is why? And we'll never know. I won't care because I'll pick this one up used in a few months. I'll also rip it from the disc and do what I want with it. It's not right, and nothing will make it right.  This movie is available for digital download, so go get it from the various services if you want. I for one will avoid any Ultraviolet equipped movies, and I hope Amazon will mark them as such.  As far as the movie goes, get it somehow. Watch part 1 and 2 together straight. It's a drearily beautiful movie. Even the epilogue, which should be triumphant, has a twinge of deep sadness to it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really fun game. One of the best I've played on Android so far. It keeps me occupied, I hope the developer comes out with more levels.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|This movie features a stellar cast of accomplished actors, but I found it incredibly disappointing. The script is terrible, and there is a whole sub-plot involving a character's son that should have been deleted. And the ending reminded me of an ABC After School Special: Groan-worthy; the kid standing at the podium in the school gym, and dear-old-dad grabs the mike and starts blithering on about how much he loves his wife. Hollywood loves the public display of emotion, as if it somehow holds more weight becuase there is an audience.  The problem is this film doesn't know what it wants to be: if it's a fantasy/comedy, then it should not try to pull at your heartstrings at the same time. That would require a decent script and a certain amount of realism. Divorces are not done in 1 day, there are issues around money/custody, etc. that need to be worked out, etc. That none of this happens - instead, we see the supposedly brokenhearted husband hanging out in the bar - made me not care about the characters. It is just a silly plot; middle-aged man receives dating advice from super-cool younger guy. Husband works in an office cubicle but somehow makes enough money to buy a massively expensive new wardrobe and pay for bar tabs that amount to $800. It was just dumb, not believable at all. And I cannot understand why Marisa Tomei would agree to take on a puny role, portraying a ridiculous, hysterical school teacher. Kevin Bacon is also wasted here. In fact, all the actors are wasted here. The best performance was by Emma Stone; she was the only reason to watch this dud til the very end.
B00006LLNU|4.0|Sigur Ros uses typical instruments universally associated with traditional rock music that normally unfolds in an organic fashion, and deconstructs our expectations for how bass, guitar, drums, and keyboard have been configured to mesh together in order to pursue a musical direction that plays out in a linear manner. It's not that they're incapable of recording straightforwardly; it's more as if they wish to isolate, extend, and refine a mood rather than create a  conventional song that unfolds in a fluid progression with normal transitional points that we have come to expect after years of listening to music recorded no other way.   \\"Sven-F-Englar\\" and \\"Olsen Olsen\\", two of the strongest tracks from their previous release,\\"Aegetis Byrnum\\", build from quiescent beginnings to a sustained explosive release, often courtesy of an e-bow or bowed guitar, with strings and keys added to milk more tension from each track. This gradual progression toward dynamic, often explosive crescendos, often stretching out for 7-12 minutes at a time, became a hallmark feature that I was hoping they would extend to ( ). Jonsi and company developed a vastly different approach, however. Sure, you'll still hear songs gradually build in dynamic tension and the last four songs, while not reaching the same heights of sustained explosiveness acheieved on \\"Aegetis Byrnum\\", still move toward definite crescendo. But ( ) is even more about isolating, extending, and refining a particular motif, paring down the instrumentation and vocalization and wringing the emotive qualities out of each selectively picked guitar note, plucked bassline, brushed drumstroke,simple keyboard drone, and the bare half-dozen indecipherable words delivered in Jonsi's whale-call of a falsetto.   Something I wish I'd known before buying ( ) was the proportion of dynamic, dramatic moments in relation to the massive length of this release. Most of the tracks unwind at an extremely deliberate pace, with perhaps only \\"Njosnavelin\\" (Untitled Track 4) matching the same level of intensity as any number of cuts from its predecessor. It took probably ten listen-throughs before I could appreciate ( ) on its own terms, and so if you've come to this either from \\"Aegetis Byrnum\\" or \\"Takk\\" you need to eliminate that particular release as a reference point for what to expect here. I recommend getting ( ), but know that it's going to demand that you really be attentive before you can appreciate the transcendent moments you'll find on it.

I pray that her and her family have found peace and can now live a free life.....
B004LWZW7E|4.0|In Time is a retro-sci-fi period piece that uses a dystopian setting to make a political point.  Depending on your willingness to listen to the polemic that one's wealth is directly tied to one's longevity will determine how much you enjoy the film.<br /><br />That one point - money is life - is key to In Time's premise, and it's the cost of entry to watch what amounts to Bonnie and Clyde meets Logan's Run. In this non-future, everyone ages to 25 and then begins paying their dues in seconds off their remaining life, a form of population birth control.  The good news is that they will be young and beautiful for the rest of your days; the bad news is that only the rich can afford to be immortal.<br /><br />And that's at the crux of In Time.  Is it better to live a short, exciting life or an eternally long safe one? On the brutal and short side is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), his hottie mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde), and his best friend Borel (Johnny Galecki). In Time playfully teases us by openly embracing a common movie foible: mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives all look young and beautiful.  The intimate moments between mother and son are uncomfortable for the audience because we can't help but ogle Will's 50-year-old mom.<br /><br />The flip side features the very rich and suicidal Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), over a century old and bored to death. When Salas saves Hamilton's life from Minutemen mobster Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), he bestows a century on him with a flick of a wrist.  In this universe, everyone's time counts down on their forearm and it can be given or taken by whoever \\"has the upper hand\\" - two forearms touching exchanges time to the arm on top.<br /><br />See what I just did there? It's impossible to avoid the use of clich&eacute;s in reviewing this film because the script's dialogue gleefully embraces the absurdity of it all. From \\"cleaning clocks\\" (killing people) to \\"keeping time\\" (policing citizens), no ironic turn of phrase goes unspoken.

0553386794|5.0|I waited too long to begin this series. Now I'm surrounded in George RR Martin books and I've got the television show on in demand. Beautiful, brilliantly intertwined stories with incredible high fantasy and adventure. I can't say it enough... Wonderful!
1451648537|4.0|1) I appreciated the book because it gave me a more complete version of Steve Jobs and his life.  That alone is worth the four stars.  However, the book also created some questions in my mind  2) The power of focus - In every company I have ever worked for, the list of things that needed to be accomplished was in the hundreds.  How was Steve able to focus his team away from the many, and solely on the critical few?  The best story in the book was about the retreats where the senior team put all their projects on a whiteboard, and then Steve would walk up, pick three, and erase the rest.  That is focus.  3) The power of integration - Steve did not allow the divisions at Apple to have their own P&L thus elminating the fight that goes with territory.  How do we help people understand the power that comes with everyone moving towards the same goal?  4) The drive to get the best from people - \\"This is total crap\\" is not something that you usually hear at large companies today.  However, if we heard this more we MIGHT have the start of something neat.  How does a leader get the best from his/her team?  I am starting to hear more about \\"good enough\\" and am not sure that is the answer.    5) Steve Jobs could be cruel and mean, however, people still wanted to work for him.  Whenever I have been around folks who deliver tough messages I have noticed the effect.  The individual who received the message is wounded, and limps around, sometimes for weeks.  How do we help people understand what they could be, while still remaining civil?  This was a very thought provoking book.
0553381695|5.0|This is the book that made me forever fall in love with the series and George RR Martin's work. Amazing story with gut wrenching, absolutely jarring plot. It's been a very long time since I've felt this strongly about a new series. Forever grateful to have found another master to add to my library. Thank you.
B00125WAWS|4.0|I almost gave up on this movie.  About one-third of the way through and I was bored senseless.  There seemed to be no forward movement and the acting felt stagnant.  I knew that Denzel Washington couldn't let me down in this way and Jurnee Smollett is just too captivating of an actress to not keep my attention, so I decided to give it jus a little bit more time.<br /><br />Once we hit the halfway point I was hooked, I do not know for sure what happened, but the storyline started to evolve and I was becoming more attached to the characters and the story they were telling.<br /><br />Based on the true story of Melvin B. Tolson, a professor at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, who inspired his students to form the school's first debate team.  Not just any debate team, but a team from a small rural all-African-American college during the height of the depression.  A team that would one day take on the likes of Harvard in the national championship and would go on to record one of the greatest debate records of their time.<br /><br />I do not know if this movie will appeal to all, but if you stick with it and watch the extra footage at the end of the DVD, you will get a completely new appreciation of the people and the times.  This was an extraordinary group of young people and to see what they have achieved since is in itself remarkable.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Loved the movie, and wanted disc and digital copies for viewing on TV as well as on portable devices.  Astounded to find out that the so-called UltravViolet \\"digital copy\\" doesn't work on iPad or iPhone.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This film is the perfect conclusion to the perfect book series of our time.  5 stars for this movie, and for every one of the films in the Potter series.    UltraViolet as a media platform, however, is HORRIBLE.  Having access to a cloud based file is all good and well.  What if you are somewhere, oh way ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE WITH NO INTERNET ACCESS and want to watch your downloaded movie on the one program that I have on my Toshiba Laptop, my MacBook Pro, iPod and iPad--iTunes?  Can't do it.  The UltraViolet file is not compatible with iTunes, which will prove a grave oversite for Warner and other studios pushing this format.  I do NOT want another media file management program on my computer other then iTunes.  In addition to taking neraly 10 minutes to download The Deathly Hallows (when iTunes would have taken 3 or 4 with my 50 MBs cable internet), I can't even tranfer the movie file to my portable hard drive!  Freakin' crazy.  I had to rip the DVD in order to get a copy I could take with my and watch on my iPad.    Again, good movie, BAD new digital download format.

B005I0DUMC|5.0|This is a terrific cop flick and crime drama with a glittering cast.  And, this brand new blu ray release is far superior to the Canadian blue ray release of a few years ago.  The print has been scrubbed of all artifacts and blemishes.  Well done!

B005D9MUWY|3.0|I used it for a little, and while i liked it, it has some shortcoming, mainly i think tainted because i have been using the samsung default input which i like.  So i had to switch back, but i can see that if you are not a swype fan then this would be a good replacement, for me, i like swype better so i switched back.
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|Was looking forward to this for some time and hoped there would be SOMEthing to enjoy, but my worst fears have been realized. A washed-out print with what looks like video credits - in French; just hit play and you'll get a German soundtrack - has a hard-to-navigate menu which makes it difficult to find the English soundtrack. Trying to watch this on a 110\\" screen was impossible, in all respects. What. A. Disappointment. Where does the line form for refunds?
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Metallica had risen like a Phoenix from the ashes in 2009 with Death Magnetic (see my review); however, they chose about the strangest way to follow up their return to glory in Lulu - their collaboration with Lou Reed.  Let me cut to the chase and say that I absolutely hate it.  If you are like me, you heard \\"The View\\" online somewhere and thought that this might be interesting.  However I think this song was strategically chosen to appear on the web site for this unfortunate joint venture.  It is the only one that gives James Hetfield a decent share of the lyrics.  He has fewer vocals on the rest of the songs combined.  It is really difficult to find much about this that is representative of Metallica.  It certainly doesn't shred like Death Magnetic did.<br /><br />As if that wasn't bad enough, we have the lyrics penned by Reed.  What he wrote is often nothing short of vulgar.  If you couple that with a voice that sounds a lot like Johnny Cash near the end of his life, and Lulu winds up being downright creepy.  It is nothing short of a disappointment for me as a Metallica fan for over 20 years.  If you are into Lou Reed, you might like this.  Otherwise run, don't walk, to the new Megadeth instead.<br /><br />Download this:  The View

B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is the first Sophie Kinsella book I've read - got it on my kindle on a whim for an overseas trip.  I'm always tentative with new authors and I wasn't sure about the first few pages (after the funny secrets, of course).  This book had some hilarious lol moments, sad truths and a little bit of romantic drama, which to me was an absolute recipe for success.  There were no heavy subjects - this was pure escapism at its finest.  I am going to try her other books now... if they are anything similar I have got a lot of late nights ahead!  Loved it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm very happy with this game.  Runs perfectly on my LG Optimus V (Virgin Mobile), and surprisingly doesn't seem horribly greedy with my battery.  The graphics are crisp, game play is smooth, and it's just fun to play.  Definitely glad I chose this one!
0553386794|5.0|hey, got every book except the 1st one.  I need to start on the 5 books, i'm looking foward to the books a friend highly recommended this series
0060174900|3.0|This was a textbook requirement and though the hardcover was a plus (since I really prefer hardcovers) and the content suited the Women's Studies course I took, owning it now after the fact, gives me no resale value, as is always common as new editions emerge. So unless you are a book collector or avid fan of Sylvia Plath, you may not appreciate having this book after initial use.
0062020897|4.0|I've just finished reading this book and so it's all still very fresh in my mind. I know that I was supposed to root for the English, but the author made the German spy, Die Nadel, so appealing that I found myself rooting for him and hoping that he'd at least make it out alive, even if his mission ultimately fails (which I knew would happen, of course, from knowing the history of the WWII).<br /><br />The German spy is a loner, he is mistrustful and relies on logic, not emotion. He is an attractive man, an intelligent and educated German aristocrat, and he calculates his moves with military precision.<br /><br />On the other hand, the English forces trying to capture him are portrayed as mostly bumbling idiots, always a day late and a dollar short. I couldn't muster an ounce of sympathy for Percy or Bloggs.<br /><br />The subplot (Lucy and David on the island) was suspenseful and added a dimension to the story.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I've been wanting to read this book for a while now, but I kept putting it off since it sounded depressing. It was written in such a spare yet sensitive way that, after reading it, I can say I did not find it depressing, but rather, hauntingly beautiful. Hopeful. Heartbreaking. I couldn't stop reading until the last page, and even then I found my thoughts drifting back to it. Although \\"If I Stay\\" certainly revolves around tragedy and loss, its focus is on the poignant relationships and memories that make up a life. It's about those moments when you touch someone's life and they touch yours. The moments, not always beautiful or easy, that connect us to each other in ways that can be almost impossible to explain.<br /><br />\\"If I Stay\\" centers on 17-year-old Mia, a gifted cellist with wonderfully supportive parents, a little brother she adores, a hard-won friendship with best friend Kim, and loving boyfriend Adam. Mia's interview at Juilliard leaves virtually no doubt that her music career is about to soar, although this is forcing her to face the heart-wrenching reality that going to Juilliard to pursue her dreams means leaving behind her devoted soulmate Adam, whose career in music is already taking off with the increasing success of his Oregon-based band.<br /><br />Everything changes when she and her family are in a tragic accident. Critically injured but fully aware of everything going on around her, Mia is able to witness the scene of the accident and its devastating aftermath on her loved ones while she remains in a coma. Brilliantly, much of this haunting story is told as Mia, hospitalized and comatose, tries to process the unfolding tragedy through her reflections. Mia's flashbacks give us a window into her relationships with her loved ones, allowing us to develop a more visceral sense of how each character affects her. The characters and situations are so well-written that they seem tangible and all too real.<br /><br />The idea that someone in Mia's situation can decide their own fate - decide whether to stay or to leave - is introduced by a compassionate nurse, who tells Mia's grandparents that it will ultimately be Mia's decision. This concept captures Mia, who now truly understands the lyrics from a song her father wrote back in his rock band's heyday (\\"I'm not choosing/But I'm running out of fight\\") as she reflects that \\"dying is easy. Living is hard.\\" If she stays, she will have to endure a long recovery and devastating loss. If she chooses to leave, to pass away quietly in the ICU, she will leave behind her loved ones and will never have the opportunity to live the life that has been unfolding before her up to this point. Mia's grandfather gives her permission to let go, realizing the unendurable pain she'd face, in spite of the fact that he is desperate for her to stay. Kim reminds Mia that, in spite of the losses she faces if she stays, the people surrounding her now are family, too. Adam pleads for her to stay, even as he realizes that her losses will transform them both.<br /><br />I was blown away by this book, from the artful way the author alternates between present and past events to the amazing character development. This, in addition to the first person narrative style from Mia's perspective, drew me in from the first page and made me feel like I was a part of it.

B0002V7OI8|4.0|We remembered seeing this movie but since it was a long time ago it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  Very well done.
1466208686|5.0|This book helped me tremendously. I found this book accidentally and found it to be such a gem since it's clearly written with wide selections of questions (on MANY different CS topics) and detailed solutions. It's a great prep for interviews and even an everyday practice/trivia book. It even gives you tons of insider tips on getting a Google/Apple/Microsoft job (The ups being that the author is a previous Googler and interned at Apple and Microsoft, a dream for most CS students).
0891419063|5.0|This is easily one of the best books I have ever read.  It is easy to read with its simple, \\"first-person-account\\" style, yet amazingly rich and descriptive.  Eugene Sledge did an admirable job at documenting his experience and that of his fellow soldiers.  This should be required reading for every American who is too young or ignorant to understand the sacrifices that were made to preserve the freedom many take for granted.
0439023513|5.0|I was reluctant to read The Hunger Games trilogy after reading the reviews for Mockingjay. I wasn't sure I wanted to invest that much time in two books only to be disappointed in the last installment. In fact, I was anything but disappointed. In fact, I LOVED Mockingjay and enjoyed it much more than the first two books. I wasn't an instant convert to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I felt they were violent and depressing, bleak and disturbing, but I liked the characters enough to keep reading. And, of course, the books are all extremely well written. I'm so glad I stuck with it.   Mockingjay is very different from the first two books, but is much deeper and more introspective. The author goes more in depth with some of the characters, and doesn't take the easy, fairy tale way out and come to a nice, tidy resolution at the end of the story. Katniss Everdeen is a complicated young woman in a complicated new world, and the author does a great job of tying up the loose ends in an intelligent, realistic manner. This books stands on its own, and is the best of the three!
B00005QGAX|5.0|Although the Bad album is not as great as Thriller or Off The Wall (in my opinion), its still kickin' and timeless and I see why he kept the singles coming!  This album alone helped launch a movie (Moonwalker) and a video game for Sega Genesis (three years after Bad's release) based on the movie and it won countless awards from after its release up until the decade's end (although none of those were grammys, unlike Thriller).  Although there was a noticable change in Micahel's physical appearance as well as his vocal range around 1987, nobody cared because his swagger was still untouchable.    Bad's tracks stayed true to its musical diversity with some changes compared to Thriller.  For example, \\"Man In The Mirror\\" (#1 pop/R&B hit) introduced his humanitarian expression as a solo artist of which he will contiune to produce on his next two albums.  Simular to \\"Man In The Mirror,\\" \\"Another Part of Me\\" (#1 R&B hit) expressed much on improving the universe of which was a appropriate choice of song based on the Disney's Captain EO short film (of which he was in over a year before Bad's release).  That song tread more closer to The Jacksons' \\"Can You Feel It\\" (the first of its kind for Michael).  Lyrically like \\"Billie Jean\\" and musically like \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Dirty Diana\\" served to be a more grittier and darker version than the both combined(something of which Michael hardly ever records) which was very interesting for its time.  Although \\"Billie Jean\\" emphasizes on a crazy groupie claiming that the singer father her child, \\"Dirty Diana\\" (#1 pop hit) emphasizes more on a cold-hearted groupie trying to sleep with the singer for fame and fortune.  \\"Billie Jean\\" was more based on Michael (prior to the song).  Michael kept that the story/theme-like songs coming with the groovy \\"Smooth Criminal\\" which was the lead song for the 1988 film, Moonwalker.  For the first time (but not last time) in his career, Michael fights the rumor pitching media with \\"Leave me Alone\\" although it was'nt perceive to attack the media until the 1988 video came out to support Moonwalker.    \\"Liberian Girl,\\" and \\"Speed Demon\\" were two of Michael's best from the album, although none of them were singles in the US or reached the charts.  The former was beautiful and the latter was funky.  \\"Liberian Girl\\" was written as early as 1983 and was suppose to be on The Jacksons' Victory album, but Micahel decided to hold on to the song (while making some minor adjustments to the lyrics) until it was time to work on the Bad album.  The title cut and \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" (both #1 pop/R&B hits) had that pop/dance flavor that were the lead singles on the album and their supporting videos (also with \\"Smooth Criminal\\") contiuned the group dance sequences that elevated Michael's status of being the greatest dancer of the world even further.  The title track says it all with good reasoning and I'm glad that it was more street oriented (it was suppose to be a collaborative effort with Prince, but I'm glad that Michael recorded it only for himself).  The album's first single \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" was a beautiful duet with Sideah Garrett (who previously sang \\"Don't Look Any Further\\" with Dennis Edwards three years before Bad) that was also the first of five #1 pop singles on Bad.  It was also known for not having a music video for it, depsite of its success.  The most forgettable track was the Stevie Wonder duet, \\"Just Good Friends\\" was a real funky jam and not the only time he collaborated with Stevie (on the same year, Michael joined Stevie on the simular \\"Get It\\" which appears on Stevie's Characters album and was a top 10 R&B hit).  Another major miss was not originally including \\"Streetwalker\\" on the original 1987 release because that was a jammin' number (maybe it should've been on the original instead of \\"Just Good Friends\\" when it came down to cutting down songs).    All in all, the Bad album is one of his three greatest solo works in his adult solo career because of the quality of the songs and not because of the sales.  In fact, it was the first compact disc (the original release from 1987) that my dad owned.  I'll always remembered where I was when he bought home this cd as well as watching the Bad video premiere on August 31, 1987 on WNBC.
B003L77G6A|1.0|Season 4, is, of course...brilliant, but not so the DVD version.  Watched disc #1 of 3 and will be bringing it back to the store today.  The audio is dull, lifeless, bass heavy and not in sync with the video.  Also, the player rejected the disc at Episode 6.  Tried various sound fields and none worked well.  Even tried to sync the audio with the video and neither the player (Denon A1UDCI), nor the receiver (Denon AVR-4810CI) could accomplish the task.  Tried it on our other audio video system using a Denon 5910CI player and the audio was just as bad.  Fair warning--buy this disc and it might have to be returned, but the video part is fun to watch.  Too bad about the rest.....
B0058WFO06|3.0|I heard great things about this album so I decided to give it a listen.Well It has it's moments but like Porcupine Tree,leave me on the cold side.  Deform To Form A Star is a lovely song which harks back to the prog I love from the 70's.Remainder The Black Dog reminds me of Van Der Graaf Generator mixed with Crimson.  A few great numbers but alot of songs my heart hasn't grabbed hold of yet.Maybe I need to give it a few more listens and take away my dislike of Porcupine Tree which don't connect with me at all like say a Jethro Tull or Genesis ,heck any prog from the 70s.This album get's to those 70's magical places in places but not quite.
B005LJITS0|4.0|I did enjoy the movie, and while it could have been longer to allow for more character development, it was worth watching.

B003XZ4F78|4.0|This is a collection of four short Disney animated features, tied together with a narrative/documentary of a South American tour by Disney animators in the 1940s.  The film is very entertaining, with great puns and gags.  But when I watched this particular Amazon Instant Video version on the Unbox player, the colors were all messed up and most of the details were missing.  Every once in a while you get a view of what the color should be, and then it returns to erroneous color blocks (for examples, substituting blobs of orange for the faces of real people filmed, or making black into white).  I gave feedback on the bad color, and I received the following instructions which fixed the issue:  \\"Generally this type of playback issue can be resolved by disabling YUV mode and DirectX Video Acceleration in the Settings menu.  Here's how:  1. Launch the Unbox Video Player  2. Choose Settings/Preferences from the menu  3. Click the \\"Advanced\\" button  4. Remove the check next to \\"Use YUV Mode\\" and \\"Use DirectX Video Acceleration,\\" and click the \\"OK\\" button  5. Click the \\"OK\\" button to close the Preferences window  6. Exit and restart the Unbox Video Player.  When you play your videos again, you should see improved performance. Problems with color are generally related to YUV mode. Playback smoothness problems, cut video display, or lack of video are usually caused by issues with DirectX acceleration.\\"  If the colors on this video are all wrong when you try to watch it, try these instructions.  They worked for me, and changed this review from a 2-star (fun dialogue, but awful visuals) to a 4-star (fun dialogue, pretty visuals).
B001QOGYFO|4.0|I wasnt sure about this since I had not heard anything - but it looked  intriguing - I was surprised and pleased with this film - very good work  and has its surprises in the mystery.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Buyer beware - the \\"digital copy\\" is NOT a true digital copy, you have to use it via Flixster/UltraViolet. It does not download to Itunes. Its sad they had to end the series by pulling this shady digital copy trickery. I would return this if I could.
055357342X|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the series - I thought the second one was nearly perfect with the build towards the climactic battle.  This had strong moments, but what were minor flaws in the earlier books become the main themes here.  Almost all the characters are drawn in black and white.  The best moments are when following the few morally ambiguous characters, particularly Tyrion and to a lesser extent Jaime.  Unfortunately there are a long list of major characters who read like cardboard cutouts.  Reading about Jon Snow is like living next door to Ned Flanders.  And Sansa - what a waste of pages!  Arya is mildly interesting, but her never ending journey gets ridiculous after a while.  Unlike the second book, the climax of this one feels forced for effect - it did not spur me on to the next one, especially after reading the declining reviews.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is definitely fun, and Wireless great without graphics errors or lag on my Droid Bionic.  Would like to see something new added to it because it was easy to beat and get all achievements.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is fine, the problem is the digital copy is unuseable. Every digital movie I have purchased in the past 5 years has either come with a physical file or an iTunes download, not the case with this product. You are forced to download some lame Flixster software to your computer, it will not play in iTunes at all. Want to watch it on your apple TV you're screwed, grab your family and huddle around the laptop. Want to watch it on your ipad or iphone, you have to download the flixster app, and have an internet connection, because it only plays via streaming. Want to watch it on a plane you are screwed and out of luck.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|Just another incident in a long list of things corporations do to rob people blind. Most companies are nothing but crooks today, and Hollywood is full of the people that are synonymous with the word crooked. Do not get this junky rip off that makes you sign up and get billed and isn't very good anyhow.<br />BEWARE OF SCAM!!!!!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|when i pre ordered this movie I don't remember seeing \\"UltraViolet\\" digital copy in the description. it also has no distinction on the cover of the movie case.(ultraviolet is not the same as Itunes digital download)  Alas... we are forced to sign up for something we don't want in order to view digital downloads. Or i can return it and just buy the digital copy and single disk for home viewing.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|A terrific ending to a wonderful story(series)! I only wish there was more to tell..but alas there is no more;only the memory of the journey we all took for these last ten years.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best games I've played. will give you hours and hours of enjoyment. I suggest this game to all my friends.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I watched the original when it first came out and loved it. I seen reviews and thought will or wont I and then I seen the trailer with the line dance and that sold it on me going to see it in the cinema. I found dennis quaid to be a much better preacher than the original - boy must be a born preacher cause he was good, couldnt believe that they could find someone so close looking to the original dancing dork that I thought they must be related. I like the red boots making a reappearance but could have done without the 80's prom dress - though it is back in style again (too bad - thought it might be a style forever forgotten). I like the way that they changed certain characters like the boyfriend being a racecar driver. For anyone who loved the original this is a much needed see - best remake of an iconic movie that I have seen...............
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I really enjoy the movie I would probably give it at least 4 stars.  But the \\"digital copy\\" is nothing more than a streaming service and it is not compatible with iTunes.  I would not buy the combo pack, just get the movie and then go to iTunes and purchase a real digital copy.
0307460444|4.0|LOVE the way the book is written and styled. LOVE THE PICTURES. Recipes are easy to follow, instructions and ideas for decorating, awesome eyecandy pictures, they're all there. Just tried out a couple of the recipes, not the most amazing I've ever tasted BUT.  1. They're supereasy to make, the book explains it all  2. Instructions are supereasy to follow  3. They look great and they taste good (I like her cookies and cream cupcake recipe. I LOVE OREOS)  4. Fun to do with your kids, friends or just yourself  Great book to keep in the kitchen.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Movie fine..Ultraviolet/Flixster download not worth the time and process.  Another slap at consumer use rights.  When are the studios going to get it that consumers don't want over-arching controls.....when we quite buying and using their junk.
6305972591|1.0|Back in the day I watched a movie called Children of the Corn. Well at less that's what I thought it was called. It starts with a small town. Everyone is put on a spell and fell asleep. After everyone wakes up all of the woman are pregnant. Everyone gives birth to children who want to kill the town. Only one little boy doesn't want to kill the town. He try's to stop the others.<br /><br />I thought this movie was the same as I described. I am very disapointed that it is the wrong movie. I really really want the other Children of the Corn movie. There are way too many Children of the Corn for me to find the one I am looking for. If any one reads this and knows what movie I am talking about message me. I hope there is a way to message me. Well since I was so unhappy with this movie I didn't really give it a chances. I am in the middle of watching it now. And I guess this movie isn't bad.
B001P3SA94|5.0|A must see for Blues fans.  Well done!  The casting was excellent - I particularly liked the way Howlin' Wolf was captured.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I have a thing for Johnny Depp. He is a good actor and very handsome in every movie. I didn't grow up watching the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory like a lot of people did at my age. I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory first and I think this movie is a crazy copy of Willy Wonka. But sooo good. This is a must see for teens and adults.
044024367X|3.0|Come on Lee Child, bring back the Jack Reacher we love.  The last book I read the character was way off of the norm.  I don't even know what to say about this one.  Just no substance?
B000O8OTNC|3.0|yeh know its the strangest thing, I bought it a year ago and havnt even opened it out of the package, collector knives are not to be sharpened. but its handy to have around in a gif, if a bear stops me in my tracks, I'll just wip it out, my two stroke blade sharpener, and take care out business. (Im a two pump chump, Ill be a spokesman for your product).
B005974CNA|4.0|The only dramatic thing was Mike's depature, turn of events... well I don't hear that much. Still sounds as DT's album. Nevertheless, I think was time for Myung to write music again! On the other hand Rudess' work on the keyboards is so prominent and has some beautiful passages all along the album. Now to talk about Mr. Mangini, why didn't he participate in the writing porcess? if happened, perhaps it would have been really worth to hear the real contrubution, but seems like Petrucci & Co. were looking for a good replacement and nothing else.  Besides all written I think is another ordinary DT album with Rudess' cotributions as should be!
B005UG53NS|5.0|What an amazing ending to a wonderful story.  So much action.  Amazing images.  Overall,it was all about love.  I am glad they found a way to redeem one of the main characters.  It was deserved.    And the 19 years after?  Heartwarming.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|at the end of the day there are only a few games you play on a regular basis... this will be one of them.
0553801473|1.0|I started reading this series in 1999.  I read a game of thrones and a clash of kings and waited with anticipation for a storm of swords.  I remember getting one of the first copies of the book and enjoyed reading it.  I had expected that book to be the last book, but it wasnt.  I expected the fourth book a feast for crows to come out in 2002, it didnt.  When that book finally came out in 2005 I was so excited to finally have some resolution to the story.  I was very disappointed.  GRRM says at the end that dance with dragons is almost finished and will be out in the spring (2006).  Years I have waited for this story to end... it just never ends.  It is like the junkie that you keep taking to treatment but keep finding in the gutter.  I am finished with this series and with GRRM. The story has been so watered down now that I DONT CARE what happens anymore.  He will not get ONE MORE PENNY from me!
B004LROUNG|2.0|I have been a long fan of John Grisham and have read all of his books.  This book is such a disappointment--too much legalese and not a single character that actually seemed real.  The basic story, as I read it, is that all lawyers and big pharma are evil--not too many good guys, which is a popular view.  Although, having been a paralegal and court reporter, there are good guys out there.  So, Mr. Grisham, I won't be paying big dollars for your next book.
B00004VY01|3.0|Firelight, with all its initial unrequited passions, is mainly an amoral Jane Eyre but is thoroughly entertaining. Beautifully directed by William Nicholson and acted by the entire cast, especially Sophie Marceau as the governess Elisabeth Laurier and Stephen Dillane as the aristocratic Charles Godwin, individual scenes are certain to stay with the more sensitive viewer.<br /><br />But the happy, hopeful ending -- spoiler alert! -- is based upon the murder of a comatose patient by hypothermia. Why is the window wide open in winter? Who put out the fire? Does anyone care? (The patient's previous ten-year survival is itself most remarkable for 1830s England. For starters, how is this patient fed? Feeding tubes??? The scriptwriter, apparently, doesn't want viewers to think about such unromantic things, but for no-nonsense old me, they are troubling). In fact, the entire denouement is much too facile and glosses over anything that gets in the way of the two stars' raging hormones, including the murder of a comatose spouse and the earlier lack of reaction from a little girl who discovers that her beloved daddy is schtupping the governess.<br /><br />But jumping from the end back to the beginning, the less-than-subtle symbolism is really fun. For example, the aristocrat doesn't rest upon his ancestral laurels but is an avid sheep breeder. This, of course, is what triggers in him the idea of obtaining an heir though hiring a surrogate for breeding purposes. And thus, in a nice, neat Thomas Hardy way, the fun really gets started.
1433209160|5.0|I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.<br /><br />Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.<br /> [[ASIN:1597370037 The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)]]<br /><br />Moving on to the story....<br /><br />It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.<br /><br />Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.<br /><br />Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.<br /><br />That is the story.<br />But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.<br /><br />It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.<br /><br />It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well.ave to read it.  It's very interesting, and well written.

1451627289|2.0|Like chewing tasteless cud. Take me back to the earlier king of It, Pet Cemetary, the Shining, the King with an edge who knew how to drive up the adrenalin and put some fear in the bone. This, the later, windy, blowsy King who has all the time in the world to talk about candy wrappers and movie theater arcades, is a mass tragedy akin to the last few Clancy novels, massive 900 page books with margins wide enough to drive an aircraft carrier through. I got the sense that King was just trying to fill up pages, and dumping in all sorts of &#34;detail&#34; that might better convince readers of some kind of authenticity. It didn't work for me. True enough, if I had a researcher who delivered troves of paperwork to me everyday I too would be tempted to shovel it in. King's narrator assumes that familiar irritating &#34;folksy&#34; voice that is just too easy for a writer to assume, and the casualness of the &#34;voice&#34; accomplishes too much too soon. When Epping time travelled back to the past I never got the real sense that it was much different than his present. Epping's present, which is supposed to be our own, struck me as being sometime around 1965, which is basically the time-world that most King stories and novels inhabit. I was disappointed in this novel, but not surprised. But I think most King fans will love it, and good for them.
B00447G29S|1.0|THE MOVIE WAS GREAT FOR THE FIRST 33 MINUTES THEN TURNS RED THE PICTURE THEN FREEZES.  AMAZON IS  SELLING DEFECTIVE MOVIES.  I PURCHASED BRAND NEW FOR 27.99.  THEY SHOULD SEND ME DISNEY UP COMBO  PACK AS A REPLACEMENT FOR 24.99.  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|When I preordered this several weeks ago the digital copy was advertised as iTunes, wished I had made screen shots. I do not want Ultraviolet streaming copy free for three years and then maybe I can keep it by subscribing or something. I want a true digital copy. I would never have paid for this without an iTunes digital copy!
B005F6NA56|4.0|This album was not what I expected.  And I can understand the negative reviews of disappointed fans, because I was confused when I first heard the album.  I was expecting songs in the tradition of mushaboom--sultry, quirky, fun, and summery, but I was surprised by this selection of cool, edgy, poetic and intellectual songs.  I was so confused that I thought I didn't like the album.  It was only on the second listening, after getting over my initial shock and confusion that I really gave it a good listening to.  In fact, it is a wonderful album and it has grown on me since.  I love it more with every subsequent listening.  There's always so much more to discover.  Metal features twelve unique songs that showcases a contemplative and poetic charm.  The lyrics are all beautiful, and my favorite of the selection is \\"Comfort Me\\", the second last track that features the clever simplicity of a Japanese haiku.  The lyrics of the song suggests a reference to (if not an inspiration from) Haiku.  The tune like its lyrics is elegantly simple.  Like all the wonderful haikus I love, \\"Comfort Me\\" is focused, deceptively simple, clever and carries a tongue in cheek charm.  I can't agree more that this is a more mature and contemplative album.  It was definitely not what I was hoping for, but I think fans of Feist would not be too disappointed with the change.  The fun, quirky and warmth of the Feist songs we love have simply taken a turn for the contemplative, idiosyncratic, and adopted a cooler edge. I read in an interview that Feist had previously contemplated naming the album Mettle but settled on Metals instead.  Both are great titles I think, and this album with its new and surprising sound certainly showcased Feist's mettle.  It seems to suggests that Feist's music is taking a new direction, but it is one that I will follow.  This album has brought me to strange unexpected places, but overall, I say the journey has been really rewarding.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Add our negative vote to the others. This set does not include a *real* digital copy, the kind you can save to your phone or iPad. It requires an active internet connection and a separate account to manage. Really lame. Why can't we just have the content we buy, the way they know we want it? We'll pay for it!
B004LROUNG|3.0|The Litigators by John Grisham is a decent read but it is not one of his best books.  The beginning was promising, the middle dragged and the ending was very satisfying.  I found the book to be somewhat predictable and I found myself annoyed with the endless Krayoxx litigation strategies.  Grisham did touch on one subject that is very relevant today and that is why did so many people require a cholesterol reducing drug...because there are so many overweight people today.  Definitely something to think about there.
B0012GMVG2|4.0|Let's face it; the band Toto often stirs up some negative reactions among serious music people. I believe that I've always had a very broad musical appreciation and for the most part I like a variety of musical forms and genres. If it's good, it's good. The knock on Toto for being over commercialized, slick, pop music band is probably justified for the most part. And, they have put out some very mediocre and even bad music over the years. But, back in 1982 they created a record that while it's admittedly radio friendly pop music; it's still high quality. First and foremost, Toto was comprised of some very well respected musicians of that era. Jeff and Steve Pocaro, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, David Hungate and Steve Lukather are all excellent at what they do. Secondly, they are very good song writers; these are not cover songs. Instrumentation is great and the vocals are first rate considering four of them share duties. The best known songs are \\"Rosanna\\" \\"Africa\\" and \\"I'll Be Over You\\"; all of them were radio hits. But, the lesser known songs are also solid pop-rock numbers that help make this a completely satisfying album. I have a fifteen year old son who seems to identify with 80's music. He's found the song \\"Good For You\\" to be one of his favorites and it's always on his iPod. I have to admit it's an upbeat, catchy tune that you find yourself singing at some point later in the day. None of the music contained here is complicated or thought provoking just songs about relationships done in a mostly positive and high quality way. With the last twenty years of music being often focused on angst and negativity; it's a nice break to go back to some lighter upbeat stuff like this.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The distributor was very professional.  There was a problem with the mail (nothing to do with the distributor).  They responded to my emails immediately and then solved the problem.  Great service and would definitely use them again.
0375847227|5.0|To start, these three books are great. I'm a Christian and was not offended by the book, it's fiction so I take it with a grain of salt. Besides,the books are so well written that I respect the author regardless of his views.<br /><br />Again, these books are very good because the author Phillip Pullman is an exceptional writer. This format (3 books in one giant volume) is very nicely done. The book is solid & it has style. I own all three as separate novels also.<br /><br />I would recommend this volume. The Trilogy is great.
031606792X|3.0|This was my least favorite book in the series. I feel like the book was rushed. It's like she had so many things she needed to get in the book that it all came across with a rushed feeling.  The end of the third book left you wondering what would happen between Bella and Jacob. The forth book, in my opinion, acts as if the kiss between the two of them in the 3rd book never happened. She goes right back to Edward and there's no conflict in her mind on who she wants to be with. Again, I feel like she was trying to rush through it and make sure it was the last book in the series so Bella went to Edward without a second thought.   Don't get me wrong, I love Edward and I wanted them to be together. I just feel the fourth book did no justice to her feelings for Jacob.   Too many things happened in this book. It would have been much better to divide this up in one to two more books and not make everything seem so rushed.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|The title of this movie isn't very attractive and I probably would not have made an effort to view it if I hadn't read that it is very highly regarded by critics and considered one of the best things that Joan Crawford did.  It was better than I expected.  I found it to be one of the most strongly emotionally-affecting movies I'd ever seen.  Very excellent.  No one who cares for excellence in film should miss it.   I think it's best that the viewer comes to it without any knowledge of the surprising plot, so all I'll say is that it's about a mother who would do \\"anything\\" for her daughter.   (If you buy the movie instead of renting it, I think it would be a good idea to buy it in The Joan Crawford Collection, where you can also get Humoresque, which is another compelling drama, although not as much so as Mildred Pierce.)
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|this app is amazing!  I recommend that you have a dropbox account and just upload the pictures to it.  then whatever computer you're located has the file that you want.
0446547654|5.0|Enjoyed the book (Best Of Me) and as always it was hard to put down. Nicholas Sparks books are always a good bet to read.
B005PYZG6E|3.0|This inexpensive Amazon device does fine for keeping a balanced horizon with a lightweight video camera. It gives your video an impression of a floating P.O.V.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Permissions require you to give full access to your text messages ... Uninstalling ... As I don't think an app needs access to my private messages
0596805527|5.0|Very detailed book on every aspect of javascript. It's for all level of programmers and can be used for learning as well as a reference. It talks about ECMAScript 5 in great detail where applicable.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|I share the opinion of other reviewers.\\"Ultraviolet is another feeble, doomed attempt by some dinosaur brain Hollywood execs to restrict the use of your legally bought digital purchase. Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy that resides on a device of your choice to be used on a device of your choice. It is a streaming service, for which you have to sign up and maintain an account, at the expense of your bandwidth, compatible with some but not all mobile devices.\\"   I believe Amazon should be very explicit about what \\"digital copy\\" is being sold. I am pretty sure the \\"Ultraviolet digital copy\\" was not what I was sold as a pre-order. As stated by another viewer it is not a \\"copy\\", it is a service. I will not spend the extra money for \\"Ultraviolet digital copy\\" on any other Amazon DVD. This is a rip off.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Thor is yet another perfect comic book movie adaption from Marvel.  If you liked The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, or Captain America, then this movie is for you.  It has great action, a solid plot, and a humorous cameo from Stan Lee. Hawkeye also has a brief role in the movie, which to Marvel fans is great.  Keep an eye out during the end credits for an extra scene.  I can't wait until The Avengers comes out next year.  The movie on blu-ray looks better than ever, there are some great special features, and a bonus disc with a DVD/Digital Copy (luckily, the digital copy isn't ultraviolet).
1439153663|5.0|Reading a novel of historical value only makes me want to remember history and not let it repeat itself. Characters were real, history accurate, and environment descriptions made you feel you were in the center of it all. Lavinia's childlike thoughts and actions at times make me angry with her. I kept thinking she could have done more to stop what was happening around her. Her actions were at times not well thought out as she put others in jeopardy. The things you think you would never do, make you realize you would if it meant survival for you and yours.<br />Amazing to think of how thought patterns were back then. Lavinia jumping at her first marriage proposal, Meg's strange compulsion to continuing her education, and a young child no matter what the color not needing the nurturing of their  birth mother.I could ramble on here forever. Not sure of the significants of the nest or birds, any input would be great. So much to discuss--guess it was a great read
0307987698|5.0|An all time favorite with my daughter and now her children:)  Love to hear the kids giggle and have it memorized!
B003Q6D2BE|1.0|The special edition is clearly labeled as for sale only in Canada, but no mention of this is made in the listing.  I was able to make it through one of the previews, before the movie froze up, & would not advance.  Several other reviews mention the same problem (freezing up) so if you really want this movie in a hard copy, try buying one from a brick & mortar store.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I was very satisfied with the video and it came in a decent amount of time.  I ordered from someone else before this and the video never did arrive.
0440246008|5.0|There comes a point when you've heard so much good stuff about a book or author that you have to finally give in and read it yourself.  This is my only foray into the world of Reacher so far, but it will not be the last.  Child makes great use of all the tools in his arsenal and the plotting is just brilliant.  So great to know there are like a dozen or more books in the series already I can look forward to.
0375413405|5.0|I have always cooked. Since I was a little girl I helped my mother, especially during the holidays, to prepare something, and she always trusted me with it.  When I came to US, I cooked the same food that I knew of. I was getting a little bored with stuff that I cooked, and then I saw the movie Julie and Julia. I fell in love with her cooking, and immediately felt that I need to know how to cook French food. I am not Julie, so I do not cook everything from there ( sometimes the recipes take time) but I do what seems like a good dish to make.   I have read the book too after the movie came out. I liked it very much because I know how it is to live in NY and have a hectic lifestyle:) So, I kind of felt impressed that Julie cooked every single dish from the 1st MtAoFC. I imagine myself always carrying these heavy bags of groceries, and I do not know how she did it.....)))   So, now I have this book, and do not know how people can live without soooooo delicious food that you can make at home, and feel like you are at the French restaurant. By the way, my husband loves my cooking even more. Every time I prepare something from there we play the game :\\"What's in it?\\" He guesses very little from what really is inside every dish.   Bon appetite:)))
193413712X|1.0|People have raved about Harding's use of language, his story telling abilities and his freedom of style.  I found nothing remotely interesting or insightful in this book about the imminent death of a clock repairer and his memories.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Doesn't actually contain a digital copy as they claim.  Will not work through itunes.  Streaming only, so completely useless for a portable device.

0307891402|5.0|You could beat a dragon's skull in with this guide.<br /><br />The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Collectors Edition: Prima Official Game Guide is immaculate. Meticulously detailed maps, thorough, well-written quest guides both comprehensive and clear, and every item, vendor, and trainer location in the game have been sewn in to this masterfully rendered tome.<br /><br />The details of what comes with this guide are on the page, so an in-depth analysis would be both tedious and unnecessary.<br /><br />I have owned the guides for most of my RPGs including Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas as well as Mass Effect, Mass Effect II, Fable II and Fable III. This one is the best out of them all.<br /><br />This guide took 2000 hours for Prima to complete, and it shows. If you want the most out of this game, if you want explore every nook and cranny, this guide is the perfect companion.<br /><br />For those of you who might be worried, this hard-cover guide is made to last. A Harry Potter book probably isn't as tough-looking as this.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this is an infinitesimally small one, is that the physical map that comes with the guide is connected to the guide itself (which is typical of almost every guide I have ever owned) and must be torn out. This very often (at least for yours truly) results in the edges of the map being torn. However, Prima makes up for this issue raises the bar of game guides by including a code to an online interactive map which may be accessed from any computer.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, well-written, long-lasting and vast guide that is perfect for a game vast enough to call for it.
B005TQACLC|5.0|Britneys' most recent tour is Favorited by many of her fans! She pulls out all the stops on this tour and even succeeds in showing her actual vocal skills while dancing. The negative reviews are uninformed and obviously from haters. I have been to the actual tour and seen the Footage to be released and epix did an amazing job! Any fan will be sure to enjoy this item as i found myself singing along with the Pop Queen doing her thing!! You may not be getting all live vocals but no doubt you will enjoy this even if just a Britney Spears casual listener!! Get it Now!
1400052181|5.0|excellent book.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  It was very educational and informational and providing much information for thought.  It would be especially interesting to someone in the medical field and who did research on cells.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie, like all the Harry Potter movies, is EXCELLENT!  Don't take this as anything against the movies.  The problem is the studio switching to Ultraviolet for the digital copy.  To be blunt, it is NOT A DIGITAL COPY!  It is, instead, a subscription to a Warner Brothers online service.    Suggest you avoid this version of the movie and buy versions which are BluRay or DVD only!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I got this as a free app awhile back, but it is definitely worth paying for. Lots of fun, and some levels are really challenging! Can't wait for new level to be added. Great time waster. Runs great on my Samsung Droid Charge.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|They are sadly right.  On Deathly Hallows Part 1 I was able to download this movie to my computer and watch it on my ipod.  With Part 2 they ripped people off with Warner Brothers invading your computer for marketing purposes. SHAME ON YOU!!!!!  I will NEVER by another DVD with this Ultra Garbage!  I threw the redemtion paperwork in the garbage!!!!  This is another example of hollywood making more CGI movies with 3D garbage, trending further with poor screenplays and a rip off mentality. It's too bad hollywood has moved to wanting money instead of making good movies.  Even though this movie was good, Green Lantern was garbage!!!

B005GVW05Q|4.0|Often diversity brings out the very best in an artist. Ryan Adams has struggled mightily with Menière's disease in recent years. So, if anyone has earned the right to call his new album Ashes and Fire this guy has. Ashes and Fire finds Ryan Adams dialing everything down several notches to deliver a quiet record of profound beauty and home-truths. If this music is soft and nuanced, it delivers an emotional punch time and again. And it won't all hit you immediately; the album gets better with each spin. Witness the pithy, sad opening verse of the title track: \\"As he stared past the fire. The hunger to leave, well it growed. His poor heart alive. Her skin smelled like black cherry blossom perfume. The sailboats they all sailed by. And a river, she cried.\\" Dirty Rain is a terrific opening track. It's probably the greatest song Bob Dylan never wrote. From there it's one lovely song after another, with mostly guitar and voice prominent, with minimal instrumental extras. There is gorgeous violin, viola, cello and piano in support on many of these songs, but what comes through the mix above it all is Ryan Adam's distinctive voice and his guitar. Ashes and Fire was produced and engineered by Glynn Jones. Jones gets it all just right in the production; most importantly Adams delivers the songs. Life has given Adams some immense challenges to overcome. He's clearly up to the task and fighting back by creating this excellent album. Four and a half enthusiastic stars!

0824835921|5.0|Remembering the Kanji is not a grammar book, it will not teach you how to actually read the kanji, nor will it teach you more than one meaning (called a \\"keyword\\" in the book). Despite that, what this book does teach you is incredibly invaluable. Remembering the Kanji breaks down 2000 or so of the most common kanji and teaches you how to remember them and write them. You won't need to write kanji over and over again in order to learn them. Not only that, but even after finishing the book the method used in it remains useful whenever you encounter new kanji.  I consider reading this book one of the best choices I've made in learning Japanese, and I think it is the best way to start learning kanji, or reinforce them if you already know some. Also, I highly recommend that if you buy this book you take a look at a website called \\"reviewing the kanji\\" an unofficial, though recognized by the author, companion website that provides invaluable help and support when going through the book.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|This series of Rod Stewart classics are the most enjoyable and most often played of all my CDs.  I highly recommend the entire classics collection.
B000HF6XV8|1.0|The first thing to note is that this movie deviates significantly from the plot of the book. In theory this could be okay, but the choices of what to change seemed to diminish the joy that is at the heart of the book--making Mrs. Medlock into a mean, vindictive woman; making Master Craven into a man just this side of lunacy; making Mary's parents die of an earthquake instead of cholera and forgoing some of the key delights of the children: their attempts to keep Colin's progress a secret and the presents of food from Dickon's mother, for example. The movie on the whole was a lot darker than it would seem that Hodgson Burnett had intended, but without enough intent to make that darkness a virtue.  Second, the movie itself just wasn't very good. The editing seemed off, and a lot of the lines were unbelievable. Mary's and Colin's characters were played well, but a lot of the other characters weren't.  I recommend trying another version of this wonderful story.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This is a great movie.  I give the movie 5 stars.  The ULTRAVIOLET Digital Copy gets one star.  I would give it ZERO stars if Amazon allowed.  Ultraviolet advertises itself as though it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But in realty, it just plain sucks.  I installed the program (Yes, you have to download THEIR program) and create an account then you have STREAM IT!  What happened to the original DC where you just transferred it to iTunes????  I am really tempted in purchasing the bluray one disc sets instead of the combo packs if Ultraviolet is attached.<br /><br />WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, ULTRAVIOLET?!?!?!?!  You are going to lose a lot of customers!  You are just making people more prone to ILLEGALLY obtain movies by making it so restricted.  **shakes head in MAJOR disgust**

0525423656|5.0|I enjoyed the first book in Condie's series, and especially appreciated the end when the pace quickened.  I felt that Crossed continued the fantastic ending speed in Matched and propelled the story forward in an incredible way.  I loved learning more about Ky and the groups that lived outside of the Society.  My heart ached for the characters when they were apart and I cannot wait for more of their stories.  I appreciate Condie's telling the story in a way that is engaging for both youth and adults without having to resort to inappropriate material.  I love her use of poetry and the character's love for words and their beauty (both visual and in meaning) have made me think about how much I take for granted with so much information around me.  I am glad that Crossed delivered a powerful story and I eagerly await the final book!

0307454541|5.0|I can't say enough about this trilogy by Stieg Larsson. Everything about it, from the writing to the characters to the plot, is original, interesting and well done. While I had read the rave reviews by the Amazon readers, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story Larsson tells and could not put any of the books down.  Any one of which can be read seperately, an art in itself, but I would highly recommed that you read all three for the greatest impact.<br />  This author's death is truely a great loss to all of us. His voice will be greatly missed.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I made the mistake of reading Amazon's reader's reviews of this book and looked forward to reading the \\"old King\\". What I found was a redo of a redo of a redo. There are no new ideas in this book. King is plugging along rewriting his former works with the use of the same formula. The book is split in half with the first half following a lonely boy as he explores the local woods alone. The second half centers on the murderous activites of a parked car. Yes. You read it right. The car is parked and the only way you can be hurt by said car it to stick you nose into its open door. The boy in the first part is forgotten until he shows up in the second part to save the day.     The author seems to have changed his mind in mid-book going from novel to short story. For me, \\"Mile 81\\" was a throw away that was pulled off the shelf, dusted off and sent to the publisher. Very disappointing, Mr. King.

B005LAIGFA|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Once upon a time, Clint Eastwood was a right-wing Republican who churned out revenge fantasies about vigilantes who breathlessly enjoyed taking the law into their own hands. In these 'ancient' times, J. Edgar Hoover may have been one of Eastwood's heroes. As Hollywood has changed quite a bit since then, Eastwood instinctively realized that if he didn't change with the times, he could barely survive in a new politically correct world. Given the new exigencies, Eastwood could no longer ignore all of Hoover's bad behavior, including the iconic FBI director's paranoia and abject pettiness. Fortunately for Mr. Eastwood, he found the perfect politically correct screenwriter in Dustin Lance Black, who could mitigate Hoover's bad points by not only focusing on his private life as a closeted, repressed homosexual but also turning him into a tragic figure who was scarred by a manipulative and overbearing mother.<br /><br />  Mr. Black does far worse in depicting Hoover's public persona than his private one. In Citizen Kane-like fashion, narration and a series of flashbacks are utilized to tell Hoover's story. But unlike Kane, which is told from multiple points of view, Hoover's story comes from Hoover himself, who is seen dictating his memoirs in his office to various FBI agents during the 60s and early 70s. The flashbacks for the early period begin in the early 20s when Hoover recounts his stint as a young lawyer in the Justice Department and how he became involved in that Department's crusade against so-called radicals and subversives, initiated by Attorney General Palmer in 1919 (whose home is shown dramatically firebombed in the beginning of the film).<br /><br />  Black has great difficulty in dramatizing the Director's early career and we see one dubious scene of Hoover participating in a raid where radicals are eventually deported. More interesting is Hoover's obsession with details in the scene where he reveals his new card catalog system at the Library of Congress to his secretary-to-be, Helen Gandy. Black addresses Hoover's pettiness in taking all the credit for the G-men's heroics including his most egregious conduct in that regard, the demotion of Agent Purvis, responsible for the take down of John Dillinger. Black alludes to all of this but we never see the conflict with Purvis successfully dramatized. So desperate for drama, Black spends a good deal of time dissecting the Lindbergh kidnapping, which Hoover was only tangentially involved in. But even the Lindbergh scene fails to flow as Black interrupts the action by cutting back to events from the 60s. Josh Lucas is totally wrong as Lindbergh, as not only doesn't he look like him, but has no dialogue that conveys the famed aviator's dynamism.<br /><br />  Jeffrey Donovan looks a lot more like Robert Kennedy and manages to get the accent right but Hoover's whole conflict with the Kennedy's is reduced to Bobby telling J. Edgar in essence, \\"times have changed\\". Even more sketchy is Hoover's treatment of Martin Luther King. Because we see everything from Hoover's point of view and never meet any of the Civil Rights era characters he opposes, his egregious conduct seems muted. Eastwood must resort to cheap shots such as having Hoover listen to a salacious tape (presumably of a MLK tryst), and receiving a phone call at the same time, right after JFK is shot.<br /><br />  Eastwood and Black are on more solid ground in attempting to humanize Hoover by providing insight into his private life. Since little is known of what went on behind 'closed doors', a screenwriter is obligated to take dramatic license and speculate as to the events that could have unfolded. Eastwood does well in not showing Hoover as sexually aggressive and actually not initiating a sexual encounter with his long term confidante, Clyde Tolson, who he appointed his associate director at the FBI. In Dustin Lance Black's view, it was Tolson who was the sexual aggressor, and fashions a scene where Hoover rebuffs Tolson after he kisses him following Hoover's revelation that he might have had a sexual encounter with the screen actress, Dorothy Lamour. For a good part of the film, Black depicts Tolson as a toady, picking out his wardrobe at expensive stores and indulging Hoover in his forays at the racetrack. Only after Tolson falls victim to a stroke does he seem to muster the courage to confront Hoover, criticizing him for his selfish behavior and paranoid outlook (Tolson's critique is illustrated in the 'correct' flashback where Hoover no longer receives credit for arresting all those criminals he claimed to have taken down personally). Tolson here is really Black's conscience speaking, and whether Tolson would have turned on Hoover in that way, I have no idea. What's missing is any sense of Tolson's intellectual life and ultimately he's little more than an entertaining stereotype of a closeted gay man.<br /><br />  DiCaprio does a decent job depicting a control freak Hoover minus the Kane-like gyrations at the end. Armie Hammer's Tolson is entertaining (sans the bad makeup job as the elderly Tolson) but Naomi Watts has little to do as the secretary. Judi Dench is excellent as the demented mom.<br /><br />  Like Orson Welles, Eastwood falters in attempting to turn Hoover into a tragic figure who didn't really like himself. Welles unfairly criticized William Randolph Hearst by speciously linking 'Rosebud' (Kane's childhood keepsake, a sled) to a miserable childhood. Hoover's mother's dress (the one he puts on after she dies) is perhaps Eastwood's 'Rosebud'--the dress also symbolizes Hoover's inability to escape his attachment to his mother and her disparagement of his sexuality which he must suppress (the mother's 'daffodil' comment is the last straw!).<br /><br />  But perhaps Eastwood and Black's interpretation is all wrong. Perhaps Hoover actually did like himself and didn't have an inferiority complex due to his overbearing mother. If that's the case, Hoover should be seen as far more maniacal than Eastwood lets on here. All the harm that Hoover did can no longer be chalked up to a 'bad childhood'.Tolson after he kisses him following Hoover's revelation that he might have had a sexual encounter with the screen actress, Dorothy Lamour.

0061689246|3.0|I've read the book twice and seen the movie several times, and while the movie is less adult oriented, and the book (as is with all books) more detailed, I find the movie adaptation much better than the book.  The book is good - not perfect - but great. At areas it seems a bit rushed, and the story feels incomplete. The wrap up with the witches, the star's injury, the deaths of the princes - all these elements left the reader thinking \\"Well, that was a let down.\\" The ending is contrived and too \\"pat.\\" Our main characters seem punished, not rewarded. It leaves the reader feeling that Gaiman ran out of ideas. The movie handled it much better - sure it was a \\"feel good\\" ending, but it seemed right - more so than the book. The movie also added more humor with Captain Shakes Spear (who did not exist in the book) - one of the more memorable characters in filmdom.  I'd recommend this book to Gaiman fans and fantasy fans, but if you like the book, you'll really, really like the movie ([[ASIN:B001AQR3IU Stardust [Blu-ray]]].)
B004ZNB12O|3.0|Pink Floyd has resisted releasing a hits package for years. They have piblicly stated that they didn't want the tracks cut up and mashed into a collection of songs. Even the first collection, the ironically 6 track album titled  \\"A Collection Of Great Dance Songs\\" was met with scorn aside from a remade version of \\"Money\\". After the band finally caved, EMI released the two CD set \\"Echoes\\". The album is put together not in order the songs came out but more in flow and pretty much covered everything essential covering the band's eclectic history. They also made tweaks for the same reason. \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" now plays for one continous track instead of being interrupted with \\"Have A Cigar\\" , \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Welcome To The Machine\\". The title track from \\"Echoes\\" is cut down by about five minutes which only diehards would complain about. Still it and curious inclusions and exclusions. The somber \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" stays but the rocker and superior  \\"Not Now John\\" is out from \\"The Final Cut\\". There's nothing from the underrated \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" like the catchy \\"Gold\\". And from \\"The Division Bell\\", the disappointing \\"High Hopes\\" and instrumental \\"Marooned\\" is included presumably for flow. At least the mastering is solid and there seems to be some purpose listening through the two CD set.  So in light of all that, there is now a single CD \\"Best Of\\" collection. But looking at this track listing, the question truely begs the question of is this really the best? By those standards, no. For some on reason, \\"Fletcher\\" stays on. At least the end of Dark Side Of The Moon's \\"Eclipse / Brain Damage\\" are here as well as \\"Have A Cigar\\" which are not on Echoes. But anyone who even remotely has an interest in Pink Floyd or rock music in general should have both \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" anyway. My suggestion would be to buy the new excellent remasters of these two albums along with Echoes. If you like any of these, then branch outand explore more of this iconic band. This one CD may do the job for some, but I personally think this comes up way short of who the band is.
1439192812|5.0|You must teach your kids to think on their own and find their own path in their lives. This book is a perfect start to help them wonder, question and find answers on their own.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is one of those books, either you love it or you hate it. I've seen this novel referred to as literary crack before, and I have to say I agree. This novel grabbed me from the moment the bad boy love interest stepped on the scene. He was amazing. He did things that I didn't expect and I was shocked. SHOCKED and appalled by some of the things he did in this book, which in large part hooked me even more. So many times I find myself predicting what's going to happen in a novel. Most of the time I'm spot on. I've read a ton of books and just about all YA books follow a certain formula ,so to speak, that make them predictable.I couldn't do that with this book.<br /><br />The one thing about this novel is it's self published, so sure it had some things that maybe needed tweaked, but the main plot is about the relationship between the main character and the love interest and it's strong. It was hard to tell at times that this was self published! Not since Twilight have I read a novel formulated around the connection of two people that hooked me completely. I mean, I read this book twice in about a week because I missed the characters after the first go around.<br /><br />I recommended this novel to my fellow reviewers here at READING, WRITING AND WAITING and there are a couple that are Team Travis right along with me and one other I know for sure didn't really like it. So, I recommend this book to be read with an open mind. Sure the love interest is a little heinous at times, and sure there are some parts that are unbelievable and could've been tweaked. But read it if you adore romances that are a little reminiscent of Harlequins with smokin' hot love interests.

0345529057|5.0|I had not heard of George R. R. Martin until HBO aired the Game of Thrones. I decided to look for the book and found the four volume set on Amazon. I notice that the paperback bound set I bought for twenty dollars is now hidden and difficult to find. The kindle version which is more expensive is easier to find.  I had no problems with any of the pages in the books I bought (no falling pages, missing pages, bad printing etc). I read through all the books and went from one book to another like an addict. This wide panoramic collection of novels are more addicting than the Harry Potter series, but the wide cast of characters are so large that you can occasionally get confused. The main characters that drive the story forward you will easily know...it's the smaller characters that you will lose track of. The books are written in the third person but each chapter is written from a point of view (POV) of a particular character and this is an interesting concept that drives the story forward without bogging it down when told as one single narration.  The writing is good - I mean how else could the author have gotten me to turn all those pages! Is there bloat? Of course! You cannot write so much without some bloat, but the story is always moving forward and unexpected things keep happening, which leads to constant shifts in fortune - even major characters die or are maimed throughout the story. No one is safe. This is not a straight \\"good versus evil\\" novel. The \\"good\\" characters have flaws, and some of the vile characters have some redeeming features - some are out and out vile though!  Five months of entertainment for twenty dollars! That's one hell of a deal!
B0053B347M|2.0|I am not sure what I expected, but this lighting kit falls short for me.  It works in the sense that you plug it in and it creates a decently bright light, but it is not bright enough to achieve any reasonable results with my 24' HP LCD monitor, even after modifying contrast and brightness on the display.  More importantly, the reusable adhesive strip used to attach the kit failed a few days in and now I have find it behind my PC and and reattach it every two days.  Short: Not for me, by YMMV

B003X5UFWW|2.0|The movie itself was entertaining, and I enjoyed the fight scenes.  The voice-over was a little distracting at first, but I got used to it and enjoyed it more than having to read subtitles.  I was insulted at the end when it essentially gave China full credit for defeating the Japanese in WWII.  I went on to read several reviews about the historical inaccuracy of the movie, especially the portrayal of the main character.  Ordinarily I don't get too worked up over historical inaccuracy (I've come to expect this from movies, and generally I'm just looking to be entertained).  Between the ending and the subsequent reviews I was overwhelmed/reminded of the horrible things the Chinese goverment has done with its heavy-handed propaganda.  I had watched the movie for free, online through Amazon Prime, and was thinking of buying it for my movie collection until the end.  I wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie a second time.
1451627289|5.0|King hits this one out of the park.  I've followed Stephen King since he started to publish and have always been able to count on his books to hold me spellbound.  This one is no exception.  From page one I was hooked.  King has used the \\"portal\\" to the past premise in other books but never so profoundly as in 11/22/63.<br /><br />This is another of King's famous \\"door stops\\" consisting of nearly to 900 pages.  I say more is better when it comes to books like this.  The time travel hypothesis that this book is based upon is so fascinating and basically historically accurate that at times I just stopped reading, closed my eyes and journeyed into my personal past to recount where I was when some of these bygone events happened.<br /><br />The setup is for the hero of this book, Jake Epping, to intervene in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  The effect on history would then touch a whole alphabet soup.  JFK, RFK, LBJ, MLK, SLA, CIA, KGB and the list goes on.  But what would the unintended consequences be?  That's the big question.  And folks, we're only on chapter 3.  To test the foundation of time travel and the historical aftereffects of making changes Epping decides to have a dry run, so to speak, by averting a massacre on the family of the school janitor by his drunken deranged father.  Here is where the story begins.<br /><br />King is one of the best storytellers that has ever lived, he's a spinner of tales, a modern day minstrel.  His books, in my estimation, range from good to extraordinary.  This is one of the latter that will stay with you forever.
1451627289|5.0|...unless you get the Kindel edition. It's 850 pages long and weighs a ton! Actually, this is what an e-reader was designed for.

B004L35GAQ|5.0|REVIEW:<br />Following in the tracks of Deadmau5's mouse head, AWOLNATION wears it's astronaut helmet proudly.  From cover to cover of the CD packaging, the album also looks out of this world. And it sounds like it, too.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this album is its props to music as a whole. There's something for everyone in \\"Megalithic Symphony\\" - a dash of hip and hop, a punch of dance, a kick of punk, and a burst of pop.<br /><br />Aaron Bruno (the mind and magic behind AWOLNATION, also of Under the Influence of Giants [2000-2008 hiatus]), tributes the synth/keyboard over the guitar, which may surprise or scare away some listeners, but after running through the album, they'll forget all about it. Each instrument (many played by Aaron himself) and vocals (whether it be swooning/crooning or rapping) adds to the festivity in a refreshing way. If there's anything that needs a little work (and I really do mean little), it's the lyrics - some of the tracks have repetitive words, but at the very least, it adds appeal to pop and top 40 followers.<br /><br />Every time you listen to it, it gets better. How many albums can you say does this?<br /><br />Overall, AWOLNATION brings an exciting assortment to the stage of music - creating a truly diverse monster of an album, bringing listeners far beyond what they're used to, and satisfying the album name, \\"Megaltihic Symphony.\\"<br /><br />RATINGS:<br /><br />Appeal: 9/10<br />Originality: 10/10<br />Vocals: 10/10<br />Instrumentals: 10/10<br />Lyrics: 8/10<br />Production: 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 9.5/10<br /><br />Sounds Like (Related Artists): It would be insanity to list all the artists and genres that AWOLNATION incorporates and tributes to.<br /><br />[Published on surgefm.com by your's truly, me!]
B003AQBYUG|5.0|>>> This a review for the Alien Anthology BD collection, ASIN: B003AQBYUG. Please be aware of this. The other version is ASIN: B001AQO3QA, so I can make no anticipations as to whether or not these are, for what ever reason, the same items. Box sleeves appear to be identical. >>><br /><br />Right off the bat, Amazon has this much more inexpensive that it deserves. I'm not gonna play the Price is Right, but it is significant. I will however say I am glad I help out on getting these movies on BD instead of buying the hit-or-missed collections that have swamped the markets. Now, I think we can all say that everyone knows most everything everything about these films, at least the basics behind them.<br /><br />>>> Spoiler Alert Ahead; Please move along>>><br />~<br />~<br />~<br />~<br />Long story short...<br /><br />The main protagonist in the film, Ripley is a genre staple. She goes from being a very skilled officer on a very expensive team to an expert exterminator of this highly aggressive Alien species. This all begins with a mission to land on a waste of a rock to investigate \\"something\\". The team is caught by one Alien, and Ripley is the only survivor. She gets picked up while adrift in space and gets reamed by the government and ends up line line to work a flight deck. Later, she gets called in to escort a group of Marines thinking it 'might' be one of the Aliens. The Marines land and get sliced apart, Ripley finds a survivor, and there are very few survivors including one bad @$$ Ripley (who has apparently turned into an unbelievable merger of She-Ra/Jack Bauer/Sydney Bristo/Wonder Woman). She and the others crash land on a prison planet and one Alien rips apart the personnel and Ripley saves the day again. The final film is, for the most part, ignored by the fans of the movie series. There. Up to speed in one paragraph.<br />~<br />~<br />~<br />~<br />~<br />>>>End Spoilers>>><br /><br />The best, non-spoiler description I can manage is this: The first Alien was a thriller; Aliens is a hard-core action flick; Alien 3 is a drama, and Alien Resurrection should have been an abortion. YMMV.<br /><br />Throughout the intervening years, the name Ripley, has become the epitome of strong and capable sci-fi hero. Every film is amazing, even if it only in the deleted scenes. Since 1979, we've watched and cheered for her. All four films come in two versions - the original or the final director's cut. Both are enhanced amazingly with the digital restorations; one of the best scenes in my opinion is in the fourth film when we see the aliens swimming underwater.<br /><br />Now, we have some great special features for our viewing pleasure. As if the Director's cuts were not enough. We have isolated music scores for the theatrical versions. Audio commentary is included with several tracks. But there is a \\"MU.TH.ER\\" mode which throughout each film can change settings such as audio and visual during the film without the need to restart the film or go back for a few minutes teetering around the menus. Another feature is the trivia track, perfect for first time viewers. There is also a lumbering giant of \\"Never Before Seen\\" footage that cannot be found on any other collection of the DVDs or BDs. On top of that, we have two extra discs that have been collected over the years so that we - our inner film geeks - have it all collected right here.<br /><br />All films are given the standard 5.1/DTS tracks. I think this series needed the 7.1 treatment, seriously. There's a great handful of subtitles, which as some of the readers here should be used to my strong reactions to the small things like subtitles, good sound tracks and the like.<br /><br />To sum things up, if you are a fan you should already have this in your collections. If you've been waiting, pick it up, but be careful: Amazon has two sets for BD and the other doesn't have near the added material. Plus, it's more pricey. This is the one you want: B003AQBYUG (which has a total of 552hours of bonus everything).<br /><br />This is one of those film sets that everyone in marketing should watch and emulate. These films are classics. And in my eyes, they have finally gotten the quality release they've deserved.hours of bonus everything).<br /><br />This is one of those film sets that everyone in marketing should watch and emulate.

B001CDLAT4|5.0|Vicarious visits around the world, Michael Stearns' music, no dialog whatsoever, and the focus is on the spiritual aspects.  A truely wonderful movie with amazing new treatments that enhance the imagery to make it wholly apart from the previous edition.  A must-see.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|great movie, exactly how it was in theaters. This is probably one of the best Fast/Furious movies in the entire series.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I was introduced to Chickenfoot by my fiance some time ago and was instantly hooked.  So for a surprise gift, I bought him this CD and I must say, as good as the last one was, this one was even better.  When you get Joe, Sammy and the others collaborate together, pure magic happens and this cd is evident of that.
B004LUS390|2.0|Love the app, but after while the pen will not work. After zooming, will not draw. Fix and 5 stars.
B005XN3150|4.0|I agree with the other review who said this had a weak opening. After the Pilot, I almost stopped watching. However, now I have watched the first 3 episodes, and it is getting better and better each week. I am curious to find out the identities of the other displaced fairy tale characters, such as the sheriff (who is gorgeous, by the way). It is an intriguing, action-filled, unique take on fairy tales.
014241493X|5.0|Paper Towns by John Green is a novel about the infamous Margo Roth Spiegelman, an enigma in her hometown, and neighbour to protagonist Quentin Jacobson, also known as Q.    After a shared traumatic event as children (the finding of a dead body), Margo and Quentin grow apart as friends, But Q has never gotten over the ever intriguing Margo. One night many years later, Margo appears at Q's window- a night of revenge, adventure and major mischief ensues, giving Q hope for a renewed friendship-or maybe more. However things don't go as planned for Q, and after their night together Margo disappears, though not for the first time. As more time passes and no-one has heard anything from Margo, Q starts to wonder if she will ever come back.    The many faces and eccentricities of Margo Roth Spiegelman are explored throughout the book as Q learns more and more about the girl he thought he knew. With some help from Walt Whitman and clues left by the elusive lady herself, Q sets out to follow the trail of breadcrumbs; hoping they're not just a dead end. Quentin's slightly obsessive (though well intentioned) feelings for Margo make him an endearing lead throughout the story while Margo is a complex and multi-faceted character who is almost revered by her friends and admirers-though as Q comes to learn, she is just a girl.    Paper Towns is one of the most refreshing and interesting narratives out there. Green has taken a fairly simple premise (boy likes girl etc.) and woven a seamless piece of literary excellence. Quentin's honest and insightful narrative, along with laughs aplenty courtesy of best-friends, Ben and Radar, makes for a smooth, and at times hilarious, journey. He has a talent for making a complex plot seem flawlessly simple and this effortlessly genius novel is a fantastic read. I would recommend Paper Towns for anybody who wants a truly engaging, thought-provoking tale of the power (and danger) of human perceptions.    If you enjoyed my review please check out my blog[...]
B00007ELKO|2.0|I gave this film a few chances.Could not get into it. Didn't get the vibe, nothing to do with the history. Didn't understand essentially. didn't see the hype. eventually got to twenty minutes before quitting and I'm a huge Brit alt 80s fan.

B004U52VPS|4.0|My 4 and 6 yr old sons received this as a gift. They had never heard of angry birds before they got this game. Now, they recognize them everywhere. First,  despite the game's difficulty level, they truly enjoy it. However, I would put this for ages 7+ just because it is difficult to create the exact image on the cards with the props and it's hard to slingshot your birds exactly where you want them to go. Be prepared to play with your children if they are younger.  I think it's a great concept. My boys love to play it even though they get frustrated. I just wish the props were easier to build with.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Its a wonderful bag at this price with lots of space. there is still plenty of space even after my Nikon D5100, 18-55mm Nikor  and Tamron 70-300. The best thing about this bag is the adjustable velcro separators which I can easily adjust according to my will.

1416955070|5.0|Clary Fray is just a typical teenager; clashing with her mother, spending time with her best friend Simon and doing what she loves best- her art. That is until a fateful encounter with an invisible world marks the start of a downward spiral which quickly changes her life to something far from ordinary.    Clary is swept up in the darkly glamorous world of the Shadowhunters, and finds herself intrigued by the self-assured, and very experienced demon killer, Jace. The disappearance of her mother and hinted-at-secrets of an unknown past lead Clary further and further into the dangerous (but exciting) realm of the unknown. With her bestfriend Simon unwittingly along for the ride, Clary uncovers her secret past, an uncomfortable present and a future full of endless possibilities.    From the very first page of City Of Bones I couldn't put it down. Clary's world is one where I would love to spend some time!(as will any other fan of urban fantasy) Clare's  work of genius is filled with fantastic characters, most worthy of mention being the arrogantly endearing Jace Wayland, vicious villains and supernatural creatures aplenty. Her concept is a breath of fresh air in the genre and one which I'm glad to have discovered. She spins a thrilling plot filled with shocking twists and just enough humour to leave you wanting more and more even after the last page has been turned.    I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast paced and exciting paranormal story with eccentric and addictive characters. A fantastic example of everything that is great about the fantasy/YA genre. I for one can't wait to get my hands on the next in the Immortal Instruments series. A thoroughly enchanting read.

B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I ordered this set because I wanted the Digital Copy of the movie so I could put it on my iPad and watch it when I travel.  I was extremly disapointed to discover that the \\"Digital Cp[y\\" included in this set is an Ultraviolet Digital Copy and can only be streamed.  I was able to download it to my computer, but I can't import it into iTunes.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!  I wish they had made this more clear and I would have saved the money.  Epic fail for Flixster and Ultraviloet.
B003D83DPA|1.0|This is the biggest disappointment I have had in quite a while.  I own this concert in VHS and I bought this to upgrade the video quality.  To my own dismay the video quality was the same as the VHS tape; actually worse, because it is 4:3, you can't even make it 16:9.  It ought to be illegal to advertise this as BD.  Trust me when I tell you: if you expect BlueRay quality (or even DVD quality), then you are certainly buying the wrong product.  I could not even finish watching the first song.  I took out the BD and played my old VHS, which with the upgrade feature looked better than this disk.
B005LAIGFA|5.0|This film kept my attention throughout, and the treatment of the subject matter was not at all what I expected. The reviewer who described the film as 'mature' and 'well-crafted' expressed the same impressions I came away with.  However, I wonder how it would be experienced by much younger adults, who may be largely unfamiliar with these events.  The sequencing of events in the film would likely make the story line much harder to follow for those who don't have prior knowledge. One reviewer here talked about his objection to 'liberal' influnces on the film's content, but I, personally, came away with a greater appreciation for J Edgar Hoover and his efforts to build an organization that would provide protection for the public in this country from a variety of hazards. The handling of Mr. Hoover's interpersonal relationships felt wise and well-considered to me.
B0053B347M|1.0|Good idea; poor execution.  These aren't nearly bright enough nor are they particularly white.  I would say they're nearer blue / purple.  They're not white, in any case.  I bought 2 for my monitor and they don't throw off sufficient light even paired.  Avoid.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|I love Jamie and his food philosophy!  But ... this app is nothing more than a commercial to buy more, very expensive, sets of recipes.  $2 for 10 recipes does NOT compute when you consider what you get in a cookbook.  And the included videos are so basic as to be insulting. It is very pretty and the pictures of the food are magnificent, but I'd rather spend my money on another one of his cookbooks.  Just my opinion.<br /><br />[UPDATE:  I see that the paid version listed here has 60 recipes.  That's sure not what I got.]
0785139168|3.0|This graphic format may encourage young readers to read the original text. There is nothing wrong with a faithful adaptation. In fact, the covers of the five issues are quite original and enticing for female readers because they make each issue look like the front cover of a magazine for girls. The authors cleverly want to place the old classic into a modern context; they want to make a connection between today's youth with the issues faced by young women back then. \\"How to Cure Boy-Crazy Sisters!\\" or \\"17 Secrets About Summer Dresses,\\" and \\"Army Boys: 34 Reasons We Love Them.\\" You can tell that the editors gave it a lot of thought to these titles. The first one refers to the crazy Bennet sisters, Lydia and Kitty; the second title refers to the importance of choosing a proper dress for a ball; and then third title refers to the fact that Lydia and Kitty went crazy about soldiers, specifically, the \\"wicked\\" Wickham.<br /><br />The weakness of the text lies on the illustrations. Personally, I couldn't tell the difference between the Bennet sisters. Secondly, the illustrations didn't seem strong enough to invite younger readers. The only hit here was Mr. Collins, who resembles the freckled face on the old Mad magazines. Also, the writers and illustrators didn't translate into graphic format Darcy's long letter explaining his behavior to Elizabeth. Readers will just see the image of Elizabeth holding the letter while there is a lot of text placed on each panel. Also, the same front covers that may entice female readers may be harmful because it would suggest that P&P is only for women. Would boys or male adolescents be attracted to this text using these covers?<br /><br />These are the reasons why I give this text 3 stars.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am not a machead, in fact I own no Apple product at all,  but this is book is a look into the life, of a man that was a visionary. It left me wanting more although I know there can't be any. Well written and so good you will want to read again.
B003CN4R74|1.0|I am not a huge fan of Evanescence other than they started me looking for other bands with powerfull female leads.  I did enjoy their 1st and second albums  plus the live album and concert video are great.  When I heard about this new release I was a little excited but now after several listens, my first impression was correct.      It's a bore.  It's like trying to stay awake during a so-so movie that has a few parts that wake you up for a second.  Amy plods thru each song in a almost mono tone repetative way that makes me think even she is not all that interested and once in a while lets the rest of the band have a piece of the action to wake her up.  What a difference from the old Evanesence.  We are the fallin is a far more listenable recording proving to me that the brand \\"Evanescence\\" was not all about Amy Lee.  As much as wide eyed young boys who think she is hot (she is) or teary eyed teen girls longing for their boy friend after a break up, like to tout her to be the best/only female lead on the planet, she is not!  The old band is doing just fine without her.  Better actually, Much better, and using a American Idol contestant cast off in place of Amy Lee. but that is my veiw.  Amy does have a great talent, but it is wasted here.  For those wishing for the genre of true symphonic metal with great/better female leads and with a real grasp of this form of music that truly kicks A; not to mention the willingness to make a solid investment in their work and have genuine talent for the art of composition to produce epic well crafted, longer than 4 minute tracks; I suggest Within Temptations The unforgiving (my favorite album this year)any other WT recording and other bands that pioneered the genre evanescence is trying to emulate such as: After Forever, Epica, Leaves Eyes, Sirenia, Lacuna Coil, Elysion, Delain, to name but a few bands that not only show what a poor example evansence is to the sound they wish they had, but show that by comparison, this late to the game band is not all it's cracked up to be.  This album is a sad lack luster incarnation of the name Evanescence.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This is a great movie, but when I opened my copy I found 1 DVD disc and 2 special feature blu ray discs -- but no blu ray movie.  Clearly a packaging error, but it was very disappointing.  I'll be returning it, and likely will choose just the blu ray version since the digital copy is standard definition anyway (as discussed in other reviews).
B003EV6DBW|1.0|These episodes don't compare well at all with the last series starring David Tennant.<br /><br />This Doctor has a TOTAL dependence on that darn sonic screwdriver...he would be toast without it and that's not cool! The stories are just plain bad and I have started going to my local library to check out older series versions, and watch them on Saturday night instead of this season. I think the Sontarans would wipe out this cast quick, HA!<br /><br />I really hope they change both the characters and writing soon.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very impressed. purchased game bc of all the great reviews and now i see why. its challanging but not overly difficult. recomend to anyone. worth the money!
B000JLTR8G|4.0|this was a great movie done by a gr8 legendary director sydney pollack. never have i seen robert mitchum in a role like this. this movie shows the history of the yakuza. evrything done very well down 2 the letter. similarf to the movie black rain, this is just as fun to watch. i recommend it highly.
B005FMB8X6|5.0|\\"Discipline\\" is practically an audio zoo in the great number of different sounds it uses. This 5-channel remix brings great clarity to the project and shows how much care Rhett Davies and Nigel Mills took in their original recording of the band. I love the way Adrian Belew's voice comes through with great presence in the center channel. His voice has a rich, warm, sound with minimal reverb and I think this new mix shows his talents as a singer much better than the stereo original (I hope you have a good center channel speaker). His kooky lyrics are definitely an acquired taste, but at least you can't accuse him of lapsing into rock and roll clich&eacute;s!<br /><br />Those of you Roxy Music fans lucky enough to have heard the (currently out of print) SACD of \\"Avalon\\" know what a fine job Rhett Davies did bringing that recording into the multichannel universe, but here we have musician/engineer Steve Wilson in the driver's seat. Steve loves to utilize all the channels he has at his disposal, but he fits the mix to the particular song and I don't think he goes overboard here, although there's sometimes quite a bit of action in the rear channels.<br /><br />Highlights for me include \\"Elephant Talk,\\" with its bendy notes introducing the album (Robert Fripp's extensive notes in the accompanying booklet mention that the song \\"Discipline\\" was an earlier pick for track one), the gentle soundscape of \\"Matte Kudasai,\\" and the high-powered madness of \\"Indiscipline.\\" The title track is also a favorite and Bill Bruford's drums (does anybody else sound quite like him?) have never sounded better.
B005EYP8PO|3.0|First of all, achtung baby is a great disc.  More importantly, in regards to this release, the 2nd disc is not worth the money.  The tracks on it are far from great and most U2 fans will have them already.  It would have been good if the extra tracks from the \\"super deluxe edition\\" were on the regular deluxe version.  Or if a few live tracks were on this addition.<br /><br />  1. Lady With The Spinning Head (UV1) - good song which became ultraviolet<br />  2. Blow Your House Down - boring, Good reason not to include on album<br />  3. Salomé - another boring B-side<br />  4. Even Better Than The Real Thing (Single Version) - uninteresting version<br />  5. Satellite Of Love - great cover<br />  6. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses (Temple Bar Remix)<br />  7. Paint It Black - bad cover<br />  8. Even Better Than The Real Thing (Fish Out Of Water Remix) - uninteresting remix<br />  9. Mysterious Ways (The Perfecto Mix)<br /> 10. Night And Day - good cover<br /> 11. The Lounge Fly Mix<br /> 12. Fortunate Son - bad cover<br /> 13. Alex Descends Into Hell For A Bottle Of Milk / Korova 1 - boring instrumental<br /> 14. Where Did It All Go Wrong? - another one that rightly was not included on album
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|off course we all know the last Harry Potter was great. The only thing that disappointed me was Ultraviolet digital copy. i was looking forward to watching this on Itunes or from my ipod but sorry! Ultraviolet just lets u watch it from their stupid a$$ website. it is terrible. so for anyone buying this just for the digital copy i would stay away from this.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have lost far too much sleep because of this book!  What I like most is how accessible and human it makes Steve Jobs.  On one hand, it would be easy to put Jobs on a pedestal due to his incredible accomplishments (really enough for several lifetimes).  But this book doesn't let you get away with that.  It shows the remarkable human he was -- and how he repeatedly reinvented himself over the decades.  While at the same time, one gets a glimpse of how difficult, strange, and prickly he could be.  Oddly, seeing Jobs as fully human makes his life even more inspiring, illustrating the value of belief in one's vision, persistence, and importance of surrounding oneself with people who \\"complete\\" you -- and how utterly essential it is to remain true to oneself and one's vision.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is great - 5 stars.  The bait and switch performed by WB on this product merits a LOUD complaint.  I signed up for flixster, saw what a stupid product it was, and complained online.  The response was rapid - they emailed me an iTunes redemption code to get a REAL digital copy!  Stand up for your rights to a quality product.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie itself is great but I am mad that the digital copy requires this UltraViolet crap.  I bought this thinking that I would get an actual digital copy that I could use on iTunes and instead I got this junk.  UPDATE -  I emailed Flixster and requested and iTunes code for the Harry Potter movie and they very quickly gave me one.  From email to code was no more than 15 minutes.
B0064J6OMO|2.0|As long as you go in expecting nothing, you won't be disappointed.  This movie is kind of funny, but don't expect anything serious, meaningful, or profound from it.  As long as your expectations are set, then you will enjoy seeing it.  Too much gratuitous dirty language, but that goes along with the kind of movie it was.
0385535139|4.0|Litigators or Regurgitators?  How many different ways can you write about the law and lawyers?  So far, John Grisham has penned 19 legal thrillers(?) and counting.  After reading all of Mr. Grisham's law tomes I feel I am ready to take the bar exam-LOL!  The Litigators is a fun, rather predictable, Grisham thriller but A Time to Kill it is not.  Mr. Grisham's earlier legal thrillers had depth and impact, his latest ones are rather shallow, formulistic, and very predictable.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy The Litigators on a superficial, very quick read basis.  The whole book can be devoured during a long trans-pacific flight to the far east.  So beware if you are looking for a lengthy \\"take along\\" vacation beach read--this is not it.  The Litigators is about the epiphany of attorney David Zinc.  A very junior lawyer in a mega Chicago law firm who simply can't do the legal backroom grind any longer after 5 years of financial legal drudgery.  On the way to the 86th floor of the monster law firm of Rogan Rothberg, David realized he just can't do it anymore.  He bolts from the building, gets drunk at a local bar, and finds himself at the boutique law firm of Finley and Figg, attorneys at law to the seamy side of life.  David just wants to practice law the old fashioned way and eventually strikes a deal with lawyers Finley and Figg to work at their firm.  David soon happily realizes law is more than just books, laws, courts, and litigation but it's people too--poor people.  As the story unfolds the firm attempts to strike it rich with a Big Pharma bad drug, class action mega law suit.  But all is not what it appears and David soon becomes the firm's \\"Last Stand\\" litigator in the mega buck world of big law suits:  And the rest is typical Grisham.    Lots of interesting characters but sadly very shallow character development.  This is just another legal thriller with a predictable Grisham ending.  No gratuitous sex, violence or language.  All Grisham's hallmarks.    It may  sound like I am panning this Grisham legal thriller but in many ways I liked it.  It was a very quick read and sometimes sitting down with a simplistic novel is good for one's literary soul.  I expected little, but surprisingly I found myself enjoying this superficial novel.  I would not buy the hardback but get it from your local library or wait for the paperback.  Worth the effort but don't expect anything deep.  The question now is where or what does John Grisham do next?  How many ways can an author regurgitate the exciting(?) world of law?
0307593312|4.0|several times in fact. And by that I mean, put it aside and pick up something else. Even though I am not quite half-way through I am finding it difficult to determine whether I am bored or fascinated. It's almost like I have to keep reading it in order to solve my own mystery.  I agree with the reviewer from Entertainment Weekly: he gives it an \\"A\\" but he never really says that he liked it. The writing makes this book, the ideas take you beyond the page, and the story literally haunts you. I WILL say that without a doubt the folks at Alfred A. Knopf know how to produce a first-class book. 1Q84 has gorgeous design, unique presentation, cover, jacket, loved the smooth-as-silk paper, and the credits placement and numbering of the pages was cool. It may not be one that I will re-read but I'm committed to it now. If you want beautiful prose and mind-wrenching ideas, get this and solve your own mystery. If you don't like it, it will definitely look great on your bookie shelf.
1594744769|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, the photos really drew me in, the main character is likable and for a fantastical plot the real world aspects rang true.  However by about midway through the Young Adult trappings became too apparent for this adult reader, the story and writing lacked any real suspense and I had to force myself to finish it.  A book like this should never be boring, and unfortunately there were a lot of flat moments, especially strangely enough in sections explaining the monster's back stories, which should've been the most interesting parts one would think.  That being said there are certainly clever moments, the photos add a lot, and there are some emotionally touching scenes.  I think younger readers will enjoy this very much.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Revision: I filed a ticket with Flixster about my difficulties and they promptly issued me a code to download the movie from iTunes.  Clearly they are trying to make up for this huge disaster, and aside from my initial aggravation, it looks like I'm going to get what I thought I was buying after all.  (original review:  Wish I had read all the reviews before I ran off to Target and bought my movie last night - I could have saved myself a bunch of misery.  But I guess since I don't have a BluRay player yet, and I wanted the combo pack with the regular DVD too, I didn't have a choice.  The UltraViolet digital copy made me download 2 new apps onto my PC, accept terms 3 separate times, and then it took me half the night to download everything.  When I tried to watch the movie on my computer this morning it said playback was unavailable - whether I was trying to stream it or play it offline from my downloaded \\"digital copy\\".  As far as I can tell, all I have now is 2 gigs of wasted space on my hard drive.  I will be spending more money to buy a REAL digital copy from iTunes.  Thanks for nothing, Warner Brothers.)
0446195529|5.0|Another great suspense with the Camel Club.  This book sheds more light on Oliver's past and shows off his strengths even more.  There are constant turns in this book as with any Baldacci; however, it is a decent read.
1442337966|5.0|This is an awesome product. I purchased The Secrret a few years ago and wondered if there would be anything new I could use or if this one would be more of the same. I was not dissapointed. This is a great tool for those who started with the secret and want to continue on to an amazing life.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I recommend that anyone who purchases a copy of this great movie on bluray gives it a one star review. My reason for this--WB's inclusion of the terrible Ultraviolet \\"digital copy.\\" I bought the 3 disc edition assuming I was getting a true \\"digital copy,\\" where I would have the choice of downloading my digital copy with Windows Media or iTunes. Personally, I own 2 Apple TVs and 2 iPads, so I want my digital media in M4v/itunes compatible. Instead, WB forces you to enroll in Flixter for their digital copy, which can only be played or downloaded through a Flixter app. This product STINKS, and WB needs to get the message. NO ONE I know wants this Ultraviolet product or was asking that it be created. It is a terrible product that wasn't even ready for release. I wrote WB customer service and demanded a iTunes redemption code, and I am removing the Flixter app from my computer. I urge everyone who loathes this terrible Ultraviolet product as much as I do to let WB know through their customer service website, and by leaving them poor reviews here on Amazon--until they get the message and kill this ill-conceived Ultraviolet product.
B004XQO8VO|4.0|Good action movie. A lot of fresh new faces. And a bunch of great one-liners. If you like Stallone you'll like this movie.
B00005J6UP|3.0|A really fun movie from my teen years. So many memorable scenes - however if you are the quiet type, this movie may not be for you. I was surprised how frenetic the whole thing was. Everybody is shouting all the time. A stressful 90 minutes.
1579128149|4.0|Great book about the 118 known elements in the periodic table. Pictures and stories instead of numbers and tables. White text on black background is a bit hard to read. The book is hard to put away.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Even if you have played these two games before, you NEED to play them again. Two of the best games ever made with HD graphics, count me in!
B004LROUNG|2.0|This reads like the work of a (not) long (enough) weekend.  All of the characters are one-dimensional.  The hero becomes an expert on a major drug company's history of litigation at some point between feeding the baby in the middle of the night and the opening of court later that day.  Another lead character has a heart attack at a convenient moment, and even Grisham doesn't manage to pretend this is anything but comic.  The man can certainly tell a story; one wishes he'd spent a little more time thinking this one up.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|...and I don't even own a Blu Ray player yet! (That's how much faith I have in the UK product and as a Harry Potter fan!!!) I've never bought anything from Amazon UK either so this will be interesting.   UK's version is Region Free and doesn't have any 50i encoding so these UK discs will work on all US Blu Ray players (when I finally get one). This is how Warner Brothers makes all of it's Blu Rays.  If you are STILL not conviced this will work on your US blu ray, then you ought to go check out Amazon UKs site on the last Harry Potter Region Free Box Set (movies 1-6). Plenty of our USA compatriots had no issues with the films or bonus material, and reported great experiences buying from the UK. Also it comes with 3 extra discs that the US version doesn't have. And did I mention it's twice as cheap?! Yes, it came out to exactly 30 pounds, which is ~$48. Finally if you are a big Potter fan, youll have the irreplaceable value of telling your friends you bought Harry Potter from the UK. That's hardcore and I guarantee nobody will ever doubt your fanship after they know that.  Let me ask you something now, other than having to wait a couple more weeks for release,  why would you NOT get it from Amazon.co.uk? :D  By the way - Best Buy/Walmart's Black Friday Ads leaked today and I did not see a deal on Harry Potter Blu Ray box sets. Plus even if they were, I doubt they could beat $48. That's why I jumped on this deal today.  Hmmm....Now I need to buy a Blu Ray player and a new TV. LOL.
B005LAIGFA|4.0|PLOT: the bio of J Edgar Hoover head of the FBI for over 50 years.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as John Edgar Hoover who started as a \\"Federal Agent\\" who had little power but alot of drive. Pushing to adapt the \\"Bureau\\" into using modern techiniques with the  kidnapping of the Lindberg Baby~ the FBI emerges as THE most powerful law enforcement agency. Hoover is given the job of HEAD man at the age of 27 and makes sure every agent is up to his \\"standards\\"~ dominated by his overly religious mother (Judi Dench) is also great as his Mother Annie Hoover who's made decisions for Hoover from childhood and who he lived with until she died. After Melvin Purvis shoots Dillinger gains \\"fame\\" ~ J Edgar wants more \\"publicity\\" and make being a \\"G MAN \\" popular. at the same time HONES his life long SKILL  of keeping \\"secret files and wire taps\\" on everyone from the President and First Lady to \\"communists\\" ~ Hoover pushes the FBI into recruiting the best scientists and modern technique~ and actually help CAPTURE the Lindburg Kidnapping suspect Bruno Haumptmann~ and use \\"scientific evidence\\" to help convict him~ Naomi Watts is his devoted secretary who keeps his trust and secrets. As a young Hoover hires a hungry for power young lawyer Clyde Tolson, (FIRST RATE ARMIE HAMMER) and over time it is implied that Hoover and Tolson have a GAY attraction for each other. We also see Hoover in his mother's clothes (Cross dressing)~ Hoovers \\"hold\\"on power as the FBI head~~ is the fine art of blackmail.~ as each new President is elected Hoover already had secret \\"files and recordings\\" and made sure his \\"victim\\" usually a President knew he would keep their \\"confidence\\" for the sake of the amerigan public~ espcially fun is his toes to toes battles with Bobby Kennedy~  from the early 1930s to the 1970s Hoover collected more secrets on many people from actors to newspaper men and espcially any one he considered \\"subversive\\"~ DiCaprio has one of the BEST MAKE UP JOBS ON FILM and has themean \\"HOOVER stare\\" down perfect. Armie Hammer is good as the \\"man\\" Hoover shared his life with and served under him for most of his career.<br />Clint Eastwood shows us a very intersting view of a man who was one of the MOST powerful men in the USA for over 50 years. MAKE UP IS OUTSTANDING~ add the master touch of EASTWOOD in his direction and this view of Hoover keeps us glued for the entire 2 hours 17 minutes. Visually a treat~ and the fun is seeing the secret side of the mysterious J Edgar Hoover. 4 STARS~
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I love this game. It's one of the best Android games that I've ever played. It's challenging without being stupidly difficult. When I get that &quot;aha&quot; moment and beat a particularly hard level it is extremely gratifying. I can also quit at any moment and not lose any progress. This game is worth every penny.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I've purchased dozens of Digital Copy movies. I had this on pre-order. I am super pissed that it came with a Digital Copy that isn't through iTunes, and can't be used with it EVER!!! Amazon were great at handling the issue, but I really wish I could vent my anger at Warner Brothers!!!!!! It's crap like this that makes people pirate your products, and you wonder why it happens? Ultraviolet is not an iTunes copy, and if I had of known, I would have bought my movie through iTunes and not bothered with your sub-standard piece of crap.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought this headset for a friend a month and a half ago and one of the ear pieces detached from the headset hanging buy a thin cord. Then a week later after taping it up to keep it attached the wire shorted out and now only one ear works. I don't recommend buying turtle beach headsets they are over priced and not worth it. The plastic used to make the headsets are cheap and fall apart. When you purchase these headsets you are paying for a name not durability of the product because it definitely lacks that. If you want to spend your money on a expensive headset the pros use the trittons. I'm not saying go out and buy those because they are quite expensive but I'm just saying if your going to pay the expensive price of the turtle beach go tritton. You may even be surprised to find out that there are cheaper headsets that are way more durable then the turtle beach. Sony makes some decent headsets. Just look for other well known names that you know make high quality product and you cant go wrong. TURTLE BEACH = WRONG dont buy them, its a waste of money.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I liked the movie but this is the second time WB has rooked me on digital download. Do not get this if you want to be able to use the digital copy. Ultraviolet is not worth the time or hassle and in my mind is not a true \\"digital download.\\" I am almost of the mind to not buy WB movies that say digital download after this mess.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I'm one starring the movie due to Ultraviolet.  I liked the movie but I don't like that I was deceived when I bought my digital copy only to find that I can't add it to my iTunes library.  (I did not buy it from Amazon where I see a prominent \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\".  it's more subtle when you buy the box.  The top still says the same thing \\"BLU-RAY 3D + BLU-RAY + DVD + DIGITAL COPY\\".  Well guess what?  They lied, It doesn't include a digital copy you can download.  I don't want to sign up for another media streaming service.  You know how many passwords and accounts I already have?  Forget it!  So buyer beware and read the fine print.  Don't blow you money on a fake digital copy.  Make you own digital copy.

B005LZW8FO|5.0|I agree that this was one of the very best films I have seen all year: thoughtful, imaginative and well-acted.  It deserves a larger audience.
B00004RYZT|5.0|was'nt quite sure what to expect by the reveiws i read but this does not disappoint,whenever you get past the typical euro overprocessing and sterility of the sound,which at times seems to be studio recorded over the video clips and the uptightness of the euro crowd,you get an awesome show,while this is an older concert from 98 the film and sound quality are quite good.you cant help but crank the knob to eleven.only wish I had taken german in school.keyboardist is a little bizarre and freaky but rest of group rock on.here again the stereotypical blank expression, dead stare, stand at attention, except for rare occasion make this very euro, in comparison to an all american bouncing off the walls cocert.dont get me wrong this thing rocks and I've watched it more than any other concert I have except maybe alice cooper.gets very rocking towards the end when the crowd finally relaxes and lets loose(must have finally got enough beer)cant help but bang your head.love it,cant wait to watch it again.industrial metal at its greatest,and a nice change from the overplayed american grind.you wont be disappointed.I dont mean to offend any of my euro friends but the concerts I'm used too, the crowd is much more laid back and into the music completely way before the end.loosen up guys and gals,its okay to have fun!!!!
B002VPE1YS|3.0|The item appears to be of good quality, but the dimensions on the web site are not accurate. My case measured 6 inches tall, too tall to fit into the side pocket of my purse. I think this was not really intended for mobile phones...at least not for the iPhone 4s. It would probably work better as a camera case.

B001HN6922|2.0|If you've watched Cars, then the sequel will be a huge let down. The story is slow moving and just irritating to follow. My 5 yr old son will only watch it with the sound turned down. Enough said. Save your money, buy the cars 2 leapster explorer game instead. My son gets far more enjoyment out of that and he's learning to boot.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|My wife and I very much enjoyed this movie, watched it in the theater.  Do some research for unbiased information on Ultraviolet - if you can find unbiased info. :)  Ultraviolet is being launched in two phases. It's brand new, the first step is streaming only. Once phase two is implemented (I think spring 2012) the downloadable portion of it will start working.  So, for now - Ultraviolet is basically useless. You have the disc, and most of the time streaming for a portable device is impractical. However, starting next year, your movie will suddenly become download-able, and transferable between up to 12 devices.   Ultraviolet is the next big thing coming from the movie business.  There will be some amount of 'warring' between KeyChest (Apple/Disney) and Ultraviolet. The big question now is whether this will ever work on the ubiquitous iDevices.  Launching UV in it's unfinished state was a _royally stupid_ idea.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|First of all, I got this mainly so I can hook up speakers to my TV. However, when I hooked it up all I got was strange sounds. I already knew that this would not work with Dolby but I thought my TV didn't use it. I was wrong.   The adapter DOES work with Playstation 3 via the optical out. You just have to go into the audio setting and switch the optical out to PCM only. After doing this the digial adapter works very well.   If my TV( Panasonic Viera) allowed me to switch to PCM then I am sure this would have worked fine.
0385738773|5.0|I have been waiting for this book since I started the series, and it, not surprisingly, has not disappointed me.
030788743X|5.0|This book sucked me in and would not let go until I finished it, less than 48 hours later.  I wish Mr. Cline had more books for me to pore through!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a short-lived but well written and acted series that I enjoyed as much as Farscape. The characters are believable, displaying their flaws as well as their strengths. The stories are a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme. The only negative is that it is only 14 episodes when I would have liked about 60 or more. They do kind of make up for it with the movie Serenity (also highly recommended), which is a nice conclusion to the story.  Your time and money will be well spent on this series.
B001FB5634|2.0|It was probably wrong of me, but I was giggling a lot during this adventure!  That said, I should point out that I also thought this film was no joke.   What I actually thought was this: what a waste of time, why don't I just  turn it off and water the tomatoes instead, or clean out the litter tray?  I'm sure other good folk who saw this oddity can claim to some sort of point  to all this (please don't respond - I'm really not interested) but it really  escaped my attention.  After the 17th father-son kiss and hug I couldn't take anymore save for one final and futile  attempt to decipher Mortenson's words. I think they went something like this:  \\"mumble, grumble, mumble, mumble, protect you, mumble, love, mumble and mumble.\\"  It would have been a brilliant vehicle for Chaplin - as a silent movie of course.  One star for the effects and one star for the unintended comedy.  Oh, and the kid was terrible.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app works great. Any feature I want for file exploring is available here. Now, many people have been complaining about there not bring an exit button but there is actually an exit button now. Just press menu --&gt; exit.<br /><br />The app can sometimes run a little slow, though. Not sure if my wifi is the culprit or if the app needs some attention.<br /><br />All in all, it works like I would expect it to and I don't really see any big problems with it. The picture viewing and media player are handy as well (when you are exploring a folder with media).
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Really enjoyed this album.  Lots of great classic songs, done in a fresh but timeless way.  This one will stand the test of time in my collection.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Firefly was a short-lived but well written and acted series that I enjoyed as much as Farscape. The characters are believable, displaying their flaws as well as their strengths. The story-line is a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme. Serenity is a nice conclusion to the story. It neatly wraps up the main story and leaves the possibilities open for future stories (that unfortunately will never be made). I do think the Firefly series is a pre-requisit before viewing Serenity, otherwise you step into the last 3rd of the story without the details needed to make sense of it all. The video quality was awesome and there are some nice extras for the curious and hard-core.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|The plot was thick and twisting.  It could have been twice as long. It brings the back stories of the evil ones out and makes them clear.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|Here's what the movie does....  1.  It explains why the economy crashed in 2008, and does it in plain English that anyone can understand.  It puts it into context with how the world has changed since the Great Depression, and in the years after Reagan, following waves of deregulation.  2.  It explains how this has corrupted our government and academia.    3.  It doesn't hold any punches.  Reagan, Bush 1 & 2, Clinton and Obama are all justly indicted.    I held off watching this because these movies tend to just rehash what you read in the NY Times/Economist.  I didn't want to get another explanation of Iceland's banking system and CDO/CDS's.    I regret waiting.  This was so much better than expected.  Now I wish everyone could see this.  I wish more people understood who is hijacking their government, and how dangerous this situation is.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|You should read this book if:  * You are at least old enough to take some sexuality in print (in my opinion, nothing gratuitous, out of context or offensive - actually rather well done). Note: my understanding is that there is a toned down version called \\"Racing in the Rain\\" for younger audiences.  * You are not ashamed of openly shedding a tear or two.  * You are comfortable with your faith and can handle concepts that might not dovetail easily with it.  * Are a lover of dogs.  * You are interested in what skill it takes to drive a race car.  * You like a good love story (on multiple levels).  * If you have ever wondered what makes humans keep going in the face of horrendous circumstances.  * You are exhilarated by a creative and unique style of telling a story.  * You have ever wondered what your life may look like to your pet.  If any of the above statements apply to you -   READ  THIS   BOOK  I promise you will like it.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The UltraViolet Digital Copy is NOT a download but a stream option that includes needing an on-line account.<br /><br />I just saw the digital copy for my preorder and did not look carefully - do not make the same mistake I did!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This review is for this media release; I do not recommend purchasing if you want it for the Digital Copy.<br /><br />I just purchased this movie primarily because it has a Digital Copy. I have purchase all previous HP movies in Blu-ray with Digital copies and have never had a problem. However with this version it is not longer an iTunes download code for the Digital Copy redemption. You have to sign up for both Flixster and UltraViolet AND download an app to be able to view it. Not to mention the irritation when the app wants to access your Facebook information.<br /><br />I really loved this movie and am very disappointed with Warner Brothers for this 'new' Digital Copy method. I will no longer be purchasing ANY Blu-Ray from them that utilizes this Flixster service.

B00002EPMF|5.0|The legacy of Chuck Schuldiner will live on forever in the music Control Denied and `The Fragile Art of Existence' was their first and last recording before Schuldiner's premature death from cancer in 2001. I am fascinated with the title of this album - `The Fragile Art of Existence', which in my mind has a very real and spiritual significance to what was going on in Schuldiner's life at the time. I was wondering if Schuldiner had written the music and the lyrics around the time he was struggling with an incurable brain tumour as well as coming to terms with his impending mortality. Even some of the song titles suggest this, like `Breaking the Broken', `Expect the Unexpected' `What If?', `Cut Down' and `When the link becomes Missing'. A strange coincidence either way.   Away from his other band Death, Schuldiner's vision was to expand his creativity by playing an amalgam of progressivey tinged power metal and the vehicle to transport this style would be in the form of Control Denied. Schuldiner was a remarkable musician and those familiar with his style will know firsthand that he was totally dedicated to his craft of creating meaningful music. `The Fragile Art of Existence' first saw the light of day in 1999, and upon its release, was met with mixed views from many quarters. In comparison to Death, Control Denied played a more experimental style of metal that was a detraction from Schuldiner's more technical death metal roots, which so many fans had become accustomed to over the years.   I am a firm believer that the music Schuldiner created was that of a genius and during his career, he was always able to draw upon the talents of some of the finest musicians in the business. We do not have to look too far to find Shannon Hamm, Schuldiner's guitar partner and long-time colleague from Death. Hamm is the perfect accompaniment to Schuldiner's style of playing, both having worked extensively together which has solidified their partnership in Control Denied. Completing the rhythm section is Richard Christy on drums and Steve Di Giorgio on bass, who were two of the hottest players in America at the time. Finishing off this quintet was vocalist Tim Aymar, who Schuldiner plucked from obscurity and clearly saw the raw talent this man possessed.   In essence, the sound that Control Denied created is deeply entrenched in power metal, but they do incorporate many technical aspects that sway favourably into progressive metal territory. I am always open minded towards new styles and ideas, but both genres have been fused impeccably with an element of freshness that keeps the listener riveted for ages. Aymar has a clear, powerful voice that is precise as he explores the different ranges to his vocal register, which is a compliment to the multifaceted instrumentation. Offering a comparison to Aymar's vocals, I would be inclined to say that he sounds remarkably close to the likes of Helstar's, James Rivera in many ways, but also there is an uniqueness about his voice. All the musicians bring their respective talents and personality to this album, but the Schuldiner/Hamm guitar partnership is pivotal to what this band is all about.   They weave a fine tapestry of guitar riffing, but more importantly, the listener must absorb the complicated guitar patterns to appreciate the subtle intricacies on offer here. As mentioned, the guitar work is sublime as it chops and changes from one extreme to another with seamless perfection. Style wise, Steve DiGiorgio is one of the most creative bassists from the last two decades and there are not many that can match his playing ability, but with Control Denied he delivers nothing short of a solid performance. His technical fills are breathtaking as he incorporates many jazz interludes into his playing style. Having seen Richard Christie playing live with Iced Earth many years ago, I am well impressed with the technical proficiency and in my opinion, he is one of America's most underrated drummers.   Like DiGiorgio, he keeps the intensity well and truly up with some innovative drum patterns. Due to the complex nature of the music as it swirls from one vortex to another, I am not even going to attempt to do a track listing, as it would be a futile exercise. The entire album from the opener, `Consumed' to the closing track `The Fragile Art of Existence' is one epic journey of unrelenting music that is euphoric as each note played has a meaningful role to the music. This album is on the technical side of progressive/power metal and if bands in this style are to your liking, then Control Denied might well be a band to check out as they are well worthy of your attention.
0670022411|3.0|There were many moments I loved in \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" but as a finished work, it was lacking.  Harkness' characters, though partially redeemed by interesting traits (e.g., the epicurean vampire), were often not believable.    The problem: more time is devoted to explaining the logistical workings of Harkness' supernatural world than is devoted to the critical elements of story; consequently, plot, setting, and characters come off as half-baked, making the story element that Harkness does focus on (conflict) read as rather choppy.  Even as I write this review, I am 209 of 579 pages into the book, 37% through, and I'm not sure whether I will stick with it.  I do care somewhat about the characters, and am intrigued by how she will resolve some of the plot conflicts, but I'll be honest: the inconsistencies and lack of finesse cause me to believe reading the rest might use up more time than I want to spend on something I don't love, and end in disappointment.  There's another big problem with this book: one sub-plot is the forbidden romance between Matthew and Diana.  However, I don't feel that Harkness has given us any real reasons why the two should be in love.  Again, this goes back to credibility.  Sure, everyone likes a romance, but there needs to be a real basis for attraction.  This is a gaping hole that more attention to character development could have resolved.
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|Celine Dion does herself proud on the Las Vegas strip but...<br /><br />imho the damper was the surprisingly disappointing choreography by Mia Michaels of \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" fame.  Taking tips from the utilization of dancers at a Lady Gaga, Madonna or Cher live concert would have worked wonders for this show.  If Mia had drastically cut the number of dancers and punted more their dancing skills (and highlighted these during Celine's singing) the whoa impact of the show would have taken it several notches up.  Was the thought there that diverting attention from the star of the show might just have diminished its impact?  The winner of SYTYCD Season 2 won the opportunity to dance on Celine Dion's show.  I am now not at all surprised that he turned the offer down.  Guess he must have figured that just running across or around a Las Vegas stage was'nt going to do anything to highlight the wonderful talent that he had or advance his career.<br /><br />Otherwise a sterling DVD concert...figure it has to be since it ran for more than 5 years.

B005UT29Z0|2.0|This film was shot on video, and it really shows! It felt like a youtube project that was thrown together in a few weeks (cheap lighting, jerky camera, soap opera look). I expect more from the visuals especially when top name actors are involved. Also this film was not the least bit a thriller. It's a drama, and the acting was quite decent (espcially Spacey), but the presenation was very amateurish.

B0046W1692|4.0|Conozco la banda desde 1994 con su primer disco en vivo (Maná en Vivo), me gustó y he comprado toda su discografía y videografía desde cuando se llamaba Sombrero.  Este albúm mantiene la escencia de Maná pero nos entrega una apuesta interesante en cuento a sonido y contenido.  A continuación mis comentarios por canción:  1. Lluvia al corazón: Una canción simple y lineal musicalmente ya que todos los arreglos son muy simples, pero esta simplicidad es lo que permite apreciar y dejarse llevar por la letra. Sin duda alguna, es la canción que mejor refleja la difícil situación por la que pasó Fher y la banda en general. Una de mis favoritas.  2. Amor clandestino: Producida para ser un éxito comercial sin duda alguna.  Excelente sonido y arreglos principalmente en la guitarra.  3. Mi reina del dolor: No me gusta mucho pero el ritmo y la energía que entrega es excelente.  4. El espejo: una de las mejores apuesta de la banda en cuanto al género literario utilizado y los arreglos sinfónicos realizados.  Una de mi favoritas. Excelente!!!!  5. Sor María: Es una historia complementaria a El Espejo ya que la moja se enamora de este sujeto que atravesó el espejo.  Hacer el link de esta historia con la anterior fue muy idea muy creativa. \\"Si luz entra en el agua se le olvida el cielo\\".. lo dice todo!  6. Vuela libre paloma: Una canción que es un homenaje que realiza Fher a su mamá. Una canción muy personal e íntima del cantante. Musicalmente no me gusta mucho pero tiene buena lírica.  7. No te rindas: está en dos versiones (bachata y balada). Una de las mejores de la banda con arreglos en guitarra muy buenos pero muy simples en batería y en bajo.  Ambas versiones son muy buenas pero la versión bachata es mejor y hubiese quedado como primera versión y la balada como versión alternativa. Una de mis favoritas.  8. Latinoamerica: Un himno para la comunidad latina en EEUU y Europa.  Un canción rockera potente. Una de las mejores canciones. Una mis favoritas.  9. El dragón:  otra de las mejores canciones de la banda en este disco. Arreglos sinfónicos excelente, guitarra y batería también excelente. El género literario explorado por Fher en este canción es especial en relación a las canciones de los otros álbumes. Una de mis favoritas.  10. El verdadero amor perdona: simplemente excelente en cuanto arreglos y letra. Una historia fatal y triste y, que nos debe hacer reflexionar en las relaciones de parejas:perdono o no perdono? Y si este perdón llega muy tarde? Nunca sabemos cuando vamos a abandonar esta vida por lo que tenemos que tratar de llevarnos bien con las personas que queremos y que no queremos también. Favorita!!!  11. Envenename: buena canción, tiene muy buen riff... pero muy corta en duración.  12. Mi corazón no sabe olvidar: muy buena canción pero no sé por que no la incluyeron en la edición normal.  Tiene muy buena letra y Fher explora otra forma de composición  13. Contra todo: la que me nos me gusta de todas.  No le encontré ninguna novedad u oferta pero está bien. Maná entrega canciones inéditas cada 5 años, de tal forma que mientras más canciones entreguen en un disco está bien... En otros 5 años más tendré canciones inéditas de ellas.. mucho tiempo!!!  En general, Drama y Luz superó el disco anterior Amar es combatir en cuanto a sonido, temas y composición. Es un disco que aborda el amor y la esperanza desde la soledad, desde la dificultad, desde la tristeza... desde una posición donde uno cree que todo está oscuro. En canciones como Lluvia al corazón, no te rindas, vuela libre paloma, el espejo, está este conflicto entre la desesperación y la esperanza. Muy bien logrado el concepto!  Gracias por darme otro albúm más.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Same awesome game, however it is missing the two main things I played it for. The Zen Garden and the Mini games. This game gets old fast when there aren't other options. Iphones got it, why can't droid?
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Movie great.  \\"UltraViolet Digital Copy\\" is terrible.  A stupid proprietary digital rights management system that doesn't integrate with ITunes like every other digital copy Bluray I've ever owned.  Why do I want to keep content you just let me buy on your servers so that I either have to stream it from your servers so download it through some separate app for which I then have to redownload the movie again to the phone should I dare want to switch the movies on and off the device.  Just awful.  I am excited for the day when WB calls it quits/fail with the UV but even then I won't get my itunes download.  BUYER BEWARE!
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|I am so disappointed in this. The movie, of course, is wonderful. I don't have a blu ray player, but I ordered the movie on blu ray because the regular dvd had no special features and I figured at least I could see the special features on the digital copy. WRONG. First of all, the digital copy is \\"unavailable\\" from ultraviolet flixster scamware, and the special features aren't included on there anyway. I've bought every special edition Harry Potter movie and I am hugely unhappy that since I don't have blu ray, I don't get to see the special features. Way to alienate your fanbase!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones. I had been using the ear bud variety, thought that would give the best sound, then I tried these..<br /><br />Not only are they lightweight, but the sound is great... I hear separation in the music I don't usually hear in an MP3 format.<br /><br />Very lightweight, they do not feel like they are even there, and they do allow sound from the outside so if someone needs to get your attention, you're not deaf to the world for all practical purposes.<br /><br />I liked the first pair so much I bought two more, one to keep for myself as a spare, one to give to a friend. At this price why not?<br /><br />And I might start wearing them when I work out and see how they do during some workouts on the treadmill and elliptical trainers...
0446563048|5.0|As the author best puts it \\"This book is not meant to be a comprehensive corporate history of Zappo or any of the previous business I've been involved in. It's also not meant to be a complete autobiography...The purpose of this book is to give some of the highlights of the path that I took in my journey toward discovering how to find happiness in business and in life.\\"<br /><br />The journey Tony takes the readers on is both very educational and exciting. Along the path, he shares great gems of wisdom that he has collected both on  from a personal basis and an organizational perspective. These include but are not limited to: management, leadership, following one's passion, relationship building etc. His passion for vision, values and happiness radiates through and is very contagious and inspirational. Having personally experienced Zappos WOW experience, I can truly say that the material preached by the CEO is truly believed in and practiced throughout the organization. A highly recommended book!<br /><br />Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"One of the most interesting things about playing poker was learning the discipline of not confusing the right decision with the individual outcome of any single hand, but that's what a lot of poker players do. If they win a hand, they assume they made the right bet, and if they lose a hand, they often assume they made the wrong bet. With the coin that lands on heads a third of the time, this would be like seeing the coin land on heads once (the individual outcome) and changing your behavior so you bet on heads, when the mathematically correct thing to do is to always bet on tails no matter what happened in the previous coin flip (the right decision).\\"<br /><br />2- \\"We learned that we should never outsource our core competency. As an e-commerce company, we should have considered warehousing to be our core competency from the beginning. Outsourcing that to a third party and trusting that they would care about our customers as much as we would was one of our biggest mistakes. If we hadn't reacted quickly, it would have eventually destroyed Zappos.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"Looking back, a big reason we hit our goal early was that we decided to invest our time, money, and resources into three key areas: customer service (which would build our brand and drive word of mouth), culture (which would lead to the formation of our core values), and employee training and development (which would eventually lead to the creation of our Pipeline Team).\\"<br /><br />4- \\"We believe that it's really important to come up with core values that you can commit to. And by commit, we mean that you're willing to hire and fire based on them. If you're willing to do that, then you're well on your way to building a company culture that is in line with the brand you want to build. You can let all of your employees be your brand ambassadors, not just the marketing or PR department. And they can be brand ambassadors both inside and outside the office.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"The best leaders are those that lead by example and are both team followers as well as team leaders. We believe that in general, the best ideas and decisions are made from the bottom up, meaning by those on the front lines that are closest to the issues and/or the customers. The role of a manager is to remove obstacles and enable his/her direct reports to succeed. This means the best leaders are servant-leaders. They server those they lead.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"While we celebrate our individual and team successes, we are not arrogant nor do we treat others differently from how we would want to be treated. Instead, we carry ourselves with quiet confidence, because we believe that in the long run our character will speak for itself.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Your personal core values define who you are, and a company's core values ultimately define the company's character and brand. For individuals, character is destiny. For ogranizations, culture is destiny.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"Happiness is really just about four things: perceived control, perceived progress, connectedness (number and depth of your relationships), and vision/meaning (being part of something bigger than yourself).\\"ol, perceived progress, connectedness (number and depth of your relationships), and vision/meaning (being part of something bigger than yourself).\\"
B000007R1M|4.0|Looking back it's hard for people to understand the difference between 1978, 1986 and now.  In 1978 when the Man Machine came out, nothing sounded like it.  By 1986, everything sounded like it...and to this day some songs still sound like it!<br /><br />This is sheer listenable brilliance!
B001UV4XIS|2.0|When I see a redo on some movies I ask \\"Why remake this ?\\" .  With DH2, I don't have to wonder.  The battle scene (essentially 3/4 of the movie) missed EVERY opportunity to bring tremendous scenes to life.  Attack of the spiders?  Missing.  Death of Fred ?  MIA.  Molly Weasley's duel after Bellatrix was easily holding off three people ?  10 seconds.  The battle of Harry and Voldemort in front of the entire armies ?  Not important, apparently -- we get some sort of flying around in a smoke trail.  Voldemort attacking because he realizes Harry is the master of the Elder Wand ?  Oh, was that in the book ?  Harry's other son in the \\"19 years later\\" scene ?  Oh, did he have two ?  This series seriously left the rails in movie 5 and since then has often fallen victim to \\"director's vision\\".  This movie, unforunately, is afflicted with the same problem.   As far as the disk goes....I found myself constantly adjusting the volume because the spoken scenes were too quiet and indistinct while other scenes were Michael Bay-like
0765350386|3.0|Brandon Sanderson is the finishing author of the beloved WHEEL OF TIME series. Those are heavy shoes to fill and he did so reasonably well, all things considered. Because of the challenge, which seems like a losing battle for virtually any author, I gave sweeping allowance to the final WOT books and Sanderson's overall treatment of them. Following those, I decided to see what else Sanderson has to offer and it's a really mixed bag.  First, his books have a definite superficial quality to them. They lack the weight of the other scifi greats like Martin, Goodkind, and of course Robert Jordan (never mind Tolkien). His writing style just does not lend itself well to the major ellipses of a character's rise and/or fall. There isn't enough strength, detail, \\"weight,\\" and urgency to really feel the impact of the plot devices he lays out. I have the feeling there is a better author hiding inside, but he just isn't there yet.  It's hard to say if Sanderson will ever truly be counted among the greats and he is off to a reasonable start, but from what I've read so far (full Mistborn series up to ALLOY OF LAW), I'm less than impressed.
B005O30Y5Y|2.0|I was excited to get the Blu-ray disk so quickly from Amazon. But the image quality is awful. It's not bright enough, not sharp, the details on faces are often lost, and the colors are faded. It's worse than lot of ordinary DVDs I own. Very disappointed.  Really a disservice to a great movie.
0765356147|3.0|As a forever Robert Jordan fan, I appreciated the contributions Sanderson made in realizing the full scope of the WHEEL OF TIME series. He did a reasonably good job of capturing the spirit of Jordan and remaining generally true to the work. I was also very forgiving considering the challenge. But as a stand-alone author, running his own show in the Mistborn books, Sanderson is clearly a lesser author with long way to grow before he'll be one of the greats.  I've spent the last two weeks reading all of the existing Mistborn books, up to the newest ALLOY OF LAW and I consider HERO OF AGES to be the second best of the bunch. In all honesty, that doesn't say a lot. None of the books are spectacularly good. All of them are okay at best, but generally mediocre, middle of the row scifi/fantasy. I really did expect better and I'm a bit confounded by the small but overly zealous fan base. Just what are they seeing?  In all, I give the character ideas a 3/5, the story and general writing a 2.5/5, the plot ideas 4/5, and the weight of the book (emotion and ability to vest me in the characters) a 2-3/5, in its best moments. Not great.
1439102813|5.0|I won't go on about what the story is about as reviews before me have done a wonderful job.  I can only tell you how I felt after reading this exceptional book.  Care givers of the elderly or of people with dementia - should read this book. Rarely does an author let you experience what it must be like for the person suffering from this disease. You could feel the confusion, frustration, and desperation through Alice. It is a haunting experience.  This is a must read.
0765356139|3.0|I hunkered down for a lengthy read through of the Mistborn series to date and besides the most reason magazine-grade release (ALLOY OF LAW), this book was really the worst of the bunch. While the first Mistborn novel started with a good jump, the momentum clearly wore off and we're now in the fantasy series rut, far too soon.  As I've said in my other reviews, I do believe Sanderson is a better author still in development, but for right now, the Mistborn series is clear evidence of his need to develop and grow much more as an author. I'm a little shocked he was picked to helm the WHEEL OF TIME series (one of my favorite book series of all time) and I actually consider his contributions to Jordan's legacy as his best work to date. Sometime I didn't expect when I started the Mistborn books.  While I won't rush out to read another Sanderon novel any time soon, I will keep my eye on his career as it develops and consider future releases.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I preordered this like I do most of my blu-rays explicitly for the digital copy which I import into iTunes and use on my iPhones, iPad, and stream to my Apple TV. When I preordered there was no mention of this Ultraviolet crap. Ultraviolet does not allow you to download to Macs. This is like stealing. Plus the setup is far too long. All I want is to play this on my iPad without worries about finding an internet connection. I'll never but another blu-ray with Ultracrappy until this is resolved.   Oh yeah, I loved the movie. When I saw it in the theaters.

B003ELOQCA|4.0|A few months ago, U2 wrapped up the 360 Tour, a tour that at one point seemed like it was going to go on forever. Stretching from 2009 to 2011, the tour played around the world to mostly sold out stadiums. Not many bands or artists can pull off a truly enjoyable stadium show, but to make sure that this would be a musical and visual experience the fans would never forget, U2 brought along a 5th band member, created just for this tour: the \\"Claw\\". Mounted in the middle of the stadium, it is just gigantic, and an integral part of the show.<br /><br />\\"U2 360 Live at the Rose Bowl\\" (23 tracks; 130 min.) brings the complete show from October 25, 2009 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The set list runs 23 songs, including about half of the then-new album \\"No Line on the Horizon\\". For me, it is extremely important for concert DVDs like this one that the editing doesn't go overboard \\"MTV-style\\" (if MTV actually played any music videos anymore), and on that level this is a decent result. Yes, there are some tracks (such as \\"Vertigo\\"), where the switching of camera-angles every second or so is just dizzying. I was surprised as well that the Claw isn't featured more prominently in this DVD. But overall, this is an enjoyable and pleasant souvenir if you caught U2 on this tour (I saw them at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta just a few weeks before this show).<br /><br />One final comment: I couldn't help but compare this to the \\"Zoo TV Live from Sydney\\" DVD, which was filmed 17 years before the \\"360\\" DVD. Incredibly, even though both sets run a generous 23 songs, there is only an overlap of 4 songs between the two (One, Mysterious Ways, Where the Streets Have No Name, With or Without You). It just shows how much U2 has reinvented itself over the years, and keeps moving forward.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|Ultra Violet is the worst idea ever.  No download file for iTunes.  With so many media server options, this will push purchasers to rent and copy movies.  No to Ultra Violet......
B005RAO0GS|5.0|The much-anticipated follow-up to their first studio album \\"Lungs\\", Florence + The Machine have hit new creative heights with this latest release.  The first thing I have to say about \\"Ceremonials\\" is that it is compulsively listenable.  I rarely come across an album where I don't feel the need to constantly hit the track button on my mp3 player.  I am content throughout the entire listening experience and sure to find new things to appreciate each time I listen.  I already have my favorites that I go to again and again but it's all wonderful.<br /><br />In its early stages, Florence Welch said the album was \\"much bigger\\", even inventing her own genre for it and dubbing it \\"chamber soul\\" (a mix of soul music and chamber pop).  And it is much bigger - \\"Ceremonials\\" is highly theatrical, its dramatic compositions comprised of classical instruments (piano, harp, strings) and beatific choral segments its principal elements.  I feel as if I'm attending an opera or a symphony when I listen to it.  Each song grabs one's attention, with some containing unique and unpredictable transitions.  All of its musical blueprints are one of a kind yet blend seamlessly to create a near flawless collection of baroque pop opuses.<br /><br />Strong, punctuated notes on piano and a twinkling harp make for a strong entrance for Welch onto the album and into its first track \\"Only If For A Night\\".  Though I loathe saying this (and it's ironic, considering I watch the show), I can just see \\"Glee\\" trying \\"Shake It Out\\" on for size; this track has the same playability factor of \\"Dog Days Are Over\\", its chorus perfect for belting (shake it out, shake it out/shake it out, shake it out, oh woah!/and it's hard to dance with the devil on your back/so shake him off!).  It's easy to see after listening to its upbeat and contagious rhythms and lyrics why it was one of the album's first singles.<br /><br />\\"What The Water Gave Me\\" does a PJ Harvey-esque creep into the proceedings (\\"Down By The Water\\" comes to mind), its lazy, hollow guitar riff and slighting droning and moody chorus making it a sound addition to this collection. \\"Never Let Me Go\\"  is a majestic and despairing love song, one that speaks of accepting a love affair's end and surrendering in full to its heartbreak (and it's over/and I'm going under/but I'm not giving up/I'm just giving in).  Welch talks of the ocean \\"carrying\\" her, and the song fades fittingly on what sounds like the glug of brackish depths and the distant echo of whale song.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Down\\" and \\"Lover To Lover\\" are the steadiest and most mainstream pop-rock tracks on here.  \\"No Light, No Light\\" grabs the listener by the shirt collar with its arresting chorals and funereal organ, its hymnal beginnings quickly foraying into a turbulent and urgently paced song.  The foreboding of \\"Seven Devils\\" induces goosebumps with its introductory effects and rolling cymbals, the listener jolted into attention as Welch sharply breaks the whispery atmosphere with a tortured vocal. The song has a certain sense of dread rooted in its eerie assembly, much the kind with which its singer is all too familiar (Welch suffers from panic attacks).  I was instantly attracted to its dark ambiance, in particular its labored and thunderous drumbeat along with its trickling and creeping piano refrain that inspired visions of suspense and horror films, not to mention its theme of the many \\"devils\\" that reside inside us all and threaten to tear us down.<br /><br />\\"Heartlines\\" ascends with chimes, the distant cawing of a bird, and a relentless and commanding drum beat overlaid by an almost primal call of \\"yeah\\" that prances up and down the scales as the song commences into a hammering and frantic pace.  A prolonged and tremulous note from a violin opens \\"Spectrum\\" with Welch coming in softer and lower than is characteristic of her, but it's only seconds before she's trilling in the upper octaves on the song's chorus, beseeching the recipient of her song to\\"say my naaaaame!\\" while she pierces their eardrums with her unapologetic wailing.<br /><br />\\"All This And Heaven Too\\" contains some beautiful and lucid songwriting; it the best track lyrically on the album. \\"Leave My Body\\" is a magnificent and celestial closer, haunting and echoey gradations of Welch's voice fading the record out like sonic screams evaporating into the vastness of space.<br /><br />I find myself agreeing with another reviewer's supposition* (see 3-star review titled \\"Devil's Advocate\\") that a measured amount of restraint on Welch's part would've given the album more nuance.  But it's hard to suppress a voice like that - after all, Welch often got herself into trouble in primary school for impromptu singing, so now that she is an adult and no longer under the thumb of petty authority, why would someone ever expect her to reign it in again?  Despite this one small complaint, I am very much in love with this release, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to friends and fans of the band alike.  One of my observations of this album is Welch's constant references to water, and I use this element to give a final impression on potential listeners by saying that although clarity may not be apparent in \\"Ceremonials\\" (some lyrics are harder to interpret than others - sometimes only the poet knows what they are talking about), fluidity most certainly is there.

B006470HZ6|2.0|Season One was great, particularly early on. Season Two (4 episodes in) is a big come-down. Not enough action, too much talking. Every episode there are around three scenes in which characters have a long, tedious heart-to-heart about their relationship and it kills any narrative momentum. Take a tip from the zombies--stop freaking talking! If it weren't for Crossbow, there wouldn't be anyone (alive) left to like.

Finally it changed direction but that wasn't until the very end. I think it could have been half the length it was and just gotten to the point much faster-I just found it to be so repetitive and drawn out. I did not feel the author (why would you want to hide if you are male or female from the reader?) was not a very good writer. I would hesitate to read anything else from this author-and why would Dennis Lehane who I love, endorse this book-did he read it?  Very disappointing read!

B004A8EI9M|5.0|This AMC series is based on a graphic novel series that follows a group of people trying to survive the end of civilization due to a zombie apocalypse.  The time frame is largely immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travels and drama surrounding the survivors.  The story largely focuses on how the survivors live in this now non-technological world, hiding from zombies who are constantly searching for a food source (i.e., people, animals).  As the group travels the road, they run into other groups of survivors who have banded together, sometimes good, sometimes evil.  Because the show is put together by AMC, it is has high quality actors and is well written.  It is really a drama that involves zombies more than a zombie show that happens to have characters.  The characters in the Walking Dead are fully flushed out and complex with differing motives and objectives.  It reminds me a bit of Battlestar Galactica on the Sci-Fi channel, where the characters and the story took precedence over the setting.<br /><br />This was the most highly anticipated series in my household, as we are huge fans of post-apocalyptic fiction.  My wife and I watched it first to make sure that it was appropriate for tweens/teens, and then went back and watched with the kids (I admit, we let them see violence and gore, but no inappropriate sex/nudity).  The kids love the show as much as we do, but it is not for those with a weak stomach or the faint of heart.  We are watching the second season now, and it is every bit as good as the first season.  We have been, and continue to be, very impressed with this show.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I started reading this on my iPad as a free sample but since I have an Audible account with two prepaid books a month, I opted to continue reading it as an audiobook.  I just finished Part One and am enjoying the book more than I expected.<br /><br />The point of my title, however, lies in the fact that I had entertained purchasing the Kindle edition to read alongside the audiobook--listening while I exercise, reading when relaxing. I would have easily been willing to pay 10 bucks, maybe even $12.99 in order to get through the book faster (reading is faster than listening for me).  However, paying $16.99 for a duplicate edition just doesn't cut it for me.  So, by being greedy, Simon and Schuster has lost a hard copy sale. Silly Simon & Schuster, very silly!<br /><br />ADDENDUM: I finally finished this tome and enjoyed it. As a period piece, it captures the late 50's and early 60's quite well.  However, it is way, way too long, probably twice as long as it should be.  The only reason I slogged through the entire thing is that JFK's assassination was a watershed in US history and, as a high school freshman at the time it occurred, I found it profoundly affecting.  If this book were about any other historic event, I would probably have stopped reading halfway through. And, after all that build-up, the post-11-22-63 portion of the book simply \\"fell off a cliff,\\" ending far too abruptly given the bloat in the middle.<br /><br />So, the 3 star rating reflects the book itself.  If I had rated this on price:value, I'd probably give it a 2 star.  There is no way this book is worth $16.99 for the eBook edition.
0446573019|3.0|My husband is a big fan of Baldacci - me, not so much.  I've read a few books that were okay, but his style does not 'grab' me.  Now Lee Child, he pulls me in just about from the get-go.  This book was slow going at the beginning.  Actually, I didn't get hooked until way at the end when they were in the structure - then it got really good.  But man, it was a long haul.  :-)  As others, I cannot help but comment on the similarities to Jack Reacher.  I mean, come on, one, maybe two similiarities, but so many?    Lee Child does it better.  I would not have read this book if my husband had not wanted to read it.  Can't wait for the next Reacher!

Pretty much every song is nice and heavy, with head-crushing riffs and blistering solos (Chris Broderick really knows his stuff).  Tracks such as \\"New World Order\\" and \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" show what this band is really capable of.  Higly recommended.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|This Spanish epic is not as good as Ben Hur or The Agony and the Ecstasy, but it's still a little surprising how little you hear of it. After all the cinematography and the score are magnificent. Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren do a pretty good job, though Sophia is--dare I say it?--a little wooden at times (always looks great though, with tears welling up in the eyes at appropriate moments). The biggest problem is probably the screenplay, which includes its share of absurdities First of all, Heston as El Cid is a little too noble for his own good. When he is betrayed and falls into an ambush, he decides to spare the one who set up the attack because he wants no more blood spilt on his wedding day. It seems that he has forgotten all the soldiers who had lost their lives because of this treachery. What about them? Don't they deserve justice? Obviously, there is no way a real warrior of the El Cid type would ever pardon this. However, the greatest absurdity comes at the end with a dead El Cid strapped to his horse galloping off into the Moors with everyone fleeing before him. It seems he will just keep galloping on along the shoreline forever, unable to stop--until (presumably) some hard and immobile object puts an end to his forward career.  Honestly though, this is not a bad movie with its marvelous cinematography and great fight scenes. It could have been a lot better though.
B004XUMMJU|5.0|One of the best things I've ever seen on a screen.  If you've binged on the earlier episodes like I did this one will break your heart.    This show got screwed, we all know that, thanks Fox.

B005SZADQS|5.0|I don't watch much cable TV anymore since I canceled cable last year, so I was browsing the on demand stuff the other night and found American Horror Story. I read a few reviews and almost didn't buy the first episode. So glad I did, as I was hooked from the first. The show is like a horror movie that delves deeper into the psyche of the characters. The show is suspenseful, thrilling, and even yes scary at times. I am a new fan, and will be buying the rest of the episodes as they come available on Amazon Instant Video.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I am mystified as to why the person who wrote the most \\"helpful critical review\\" had such a problem with the sound mix of the fantastic Blu-Ray. As Rush has progressed over the years when it comes to releasing their concert video's, they really started to hit the nail on the head when the released R30 a few years ago. Since then, every concert video to date...Beyond the lighted stage, Snakes and Arrows, and now \\"Time Machine\\" has been excellently produced, both in video and audio quality. The video especially is wonderfully done, showing different camera angles that I had never seen in a prior Rush video. The audio mix, is amazingly balanced, a lot of good punch on the low end from Geddy's bass and Neil's drum kit, and the high's of Alex's guitar soar through the video. I don't consider myself an audio file, but I play various instruments, so I feel that I have a pretty good ear. Maybe the prior reviewer doesn't have the greatest sound system, or maybe he has his settings off, but I couldn't really tell that there were any really noticeable audio adjustments throughout the video. For me, it was off the hook the entire concert and as of yet, I haven't found a pause in the video like I have seen in a lot of other productions. Compared to \\"Rush in Rio\\" this DVD blew that one away, as I stated before, that the band and their crew have really learned how to put together a wonderful concert video.  My biggest question is why Amazon is not releasing the Blu-Ray version until late December, when other store(s) have already put it on the market for sale. Unusual, since Amazon always seems to release titles along with their competition at the same time. So that makes me scratch my head a little. But I will continue to use Amazon, since I can find anything here that I need, and usually for quite a bit cheaper price.  In closing, this DVD is a MUST for any Rush fan or casual fan......it just blew me away!! And it is a nice memory for me, since I wsa fortunate to see them on thefirst leg of the \\"Time Machine Tour\\".  Thank you Rush for many years of great music and for documenting this amazing concert. You really out did yourselves this time. I can't even imagine how you could top this show. Everybody enjoy!!!!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|DONT BUY THIS FOR THE DIGITAL COPY - wish I could give this ZERO stars.  I agree with all posters who gave this RIPOFF DVD release a one star rating. What good is a digital copy that you cannot watch through iTunes or put on your iPad, iPod Touch or iPhone? What was Warner Brothers thinking with this? Their packaging does not specify you cannot watch the movies directly from iTunes LIKE ALL THE OTHER PRIOR RELEASED HARRY POTTER MOVIES.  From now on - I buy directly from iTunes, purchase the Apple TV and stream from my device to my TV. No more need to pay for the RIPOFF DVD with a RIPOFF digital copy.  The Harry Potter movie itself is outstanding - the RIPOFF Warner Brothers Flixster with UltraViolet is USELESS for those of us with iPads or any other Apple device.  NO TRUST with Warners anymore. I hope the studio goes UNDER. Were they taking advice from NetFlix executives?

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Let me start by saying I've been one of the biggest Captain America fans since 1973. I was 9 and since then have faithfully collected all his comics, what little merchandise I could pick up along the way and waited faithfully knowing someday he would get his own big budget movie, done right!! As a kid, i did enjoy the corny tv movies NBC made, tried to enjoy the 1991 movie with Matt Sallinger (but couldnt)and I was on pins and needles for this one. Went opening weekend with my son and came out smiling ear to ear!!!  The acting, script, directing all come together in such a way it's easy to forgive the couple of minor story flaws that deviate from the comic history. I am so proud of the movie and I just hope everyone enjoys it. It's not one of the cliched superhero and his neurotic past movies we've been overwhelmed with the last few years. It's truly an enjoyable family action movie any Captain America fan can be very proud of. I'm not going into story details because I don't want to give anything away but I am so thankful for this movie!!! I can't wait to see him in the Avengers movie next year. Good times ahead for Cap!!!!
1451627289|1.0|While I can think of a number of \\"days\\" I would try to erase before the assassination of Kennedy (Sept. 11, anyone?) I thought it would be nice to see Stephen King take a foray into science-fiction using time travel. Sadly, \\"11/22/63\\" is yet another example of a Stephen King who can no longer write, should have retired from writing long ago, and has now turned himself into a left-wing whack-job. It's sad when writers such as he, so disillusioned by his left-wing thinking, has to spew his opinion into ever other page, but it happens here. And, as usual, there's the usual over-writing, usual maddening \\"inner thoughts\\" of the characters and so on and so forth that we've come to see from King since the mid-1990s. Actually, I wish the premise of King's novel could come true in my own house so I could step through the doorway and convince King never to write this bloated novel filled with political-rantings of an old man, but sadly, none of us have that power. So be warned. This is not your beloved, sharp and witty Stephen King from the 80s. That man is long dead. What you now get is a tired, angry (why are all Democrats so angry all the time????) \\"artiste\\" who should have powered down the 'ol word processor more than a decade ago. You've been forewarned.
B005ER6STG|5.0|I just watched A Serbian Film. I can't recommend everyone see it - it is hard to watch, sick and twisted, and as absolutely brilliant as  Gaspar Noé's Irreversible.  This movie (covered in previous reviews) has a story, and a damned good one - I expected to see a flick that was one gross-out after another, and while there are some truly horrific scenes, the story is constructed beautifully and does a great job of showing how the main character falls so far.  In an odd way it reminded me of Boogie Nights - a movie that deals with adult subject matter in an adult way, starts out almost light-hearted, and then takes a dark turn. Of course the dark turns in this movie are very dark indeed.  I'm amazed how many prudes flipped out over the graphic nature of this film when all the sex is simulated. There are 'art house' films that have gotten rave reviews and have actual hardcore scenes and not much story beyond the sex. And as for those who complained about the film's sexualization of children, have any of those people watched any music videos by young female performers lately? Turning young teens into harlots is a booming cash business.  People will watch said art house movies and enjoy them. People will watch movies like Saw and enjoy them. For some reason people get upset when you mix the two together. Let's face it, most of the violent scenes in this film are cartoonishly over the top, and any scenes involving children are implied or faked. Brook Shields appeared nude in Pretty Baby when she was 12 freaking years old and the critics LOVED it. Nothing like that is seen in A Serbian Film.  As for this movie presenting sickening scenes, as I said, it is all fake, it's a MOVIE. The REAL thing is happening every day in every town, all you have to do is turn on the news to see that. You want to complain about something, how about fixing the foster care system where real horrors happen all the time?  The climactic castration scene from Hostel 2 is available for everyone, including children, to view on Youtube. It is THE most realistically graphic violent scene I've ever seen in a movie, and it is on Youtube, uncensored. Where is the outrage over THAT? In fact, the violent scenes in the Hostel flicks are far more grotesque than anything seen in A Serbian Film. Yet people rage against this movie that has a great story, wrenching scenes, a fantastic cast, and brilliant cinematography, and it's a film structured so pictures tell most of the tale and the subtitles are unobtrusive.  If you can handle a trip into the extremely dark side of human nature, you might be surprised by how good this film is.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Amazon comes through again; my package was here the day it was released and the family enjoyed watching it again.  The movie was lovely and a great way to end the series - I always think the battle scenes are too long but that's what fast forward is about.  JK did a great job and it's sad the saga is at an end.  Congratulations to her.  My big disappointment is with the studio not the movie itself.  WB released another form of UltraViolet years ago - a downloadable movie that stayed on your computer...if I'm home why would I watch a movie on my computer? If I can't put it on my iPod classic what's the point?  The web-site is difficult; I am still having problems with my account which they have failed to help me resolve. Universal's digital downloads are delightfully easy and go where I want them to...Guess who's movies I will prefer to purchase in the future?

Part 2 means part 2 not a copy of part 1. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED YOU STOLE MY MONEY NOW I HAVE 2 COPIES OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS ! How can you legally do that?  Why would anyone be stupid enough to buy the same movie twice? You lied when you put part 2 on it. Real rip off do not buy if you have part 1 then you already have part 2  BEWARE potential customers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. SOMEONE SHOULD SUE THE MOVIE COMPANY!

1451648537|3.0|Reading this book helped me process the surprising grief I felt when I heard that Steve had died. I'm glad I read it, but if you've followed his career at all, most of the incidents Isaacson reports won't be new to you. I wish Isaacson had more to say about what he thinks Steve's career meant for us all and more about what made him so unique.   The book is full of the the type of story that nearly everyone who worked with him can tell: Steve was a jerk (maybe even something of a sadist) when he criticized employee's work, but he pushed them farther and higher than they'd ever gone before. This stuff is so familiar now that it's nearly a cliche. I'm no closer to understanding Steve than before. I just know a few more stories. Plus, there's very little about Steve's \\"gap years\\" at NeXT.  Still, it's a start. I'm looking forward to the next biographer, the one who'll go beyond straight reportage and get deeper into meaning and impact.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|IN SHORT:  this album is sappy, crappy pop tripe covered in vomitous lyrics masquerading as \\"creative.\\"  This album really reminds me of RPA & The United Nations of Sound, which is bad because that's one of the worst records I've ever heard.  Save your money.  I wish I had.<br /><br />LONGER REVIEW:  Full disclosure:  I really like Coldplay Live 2003.  Even though the live set is pretty close to the studio recorded versions, I feel like those songs (in particular the first 3) actually have some feeling/heart behind them, and the version of \\"Politik\\" still gives me goose bumps.  But this new album just seems like a sellout -- some standard pop songs thrown together to make money, because it will.  After hearing this album I would NEVER see them live, whereas the DVD on Coldplay Live 2003 is definitely worth seeing IMO.  Honestly I feel like some pop music-generating software just spit out this album.  It sounds so much like other popular garbage music that I wonder whey they even bothered!  What's unique and creative about this album?  Nothing as far as I'm concerned.  We all know what puke tastes and smells like.  After hearing Mylo Xyloto I now know what puke *sounds* like too.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is my first movie with a digital copy and I learned a lot about digital copies.  1.  Digital copies must be redeemed within 2 years of release date for Paramount, Bueno Vista, and Disney movies.  2.  Losing the digital copy slip with the movie was no big deal - scanning the proof of purchase and a copy of my receipt and e-mailing it to customer support afforded me a second chance to redeem the digital copy.  3.  Digital copies are for EITHER iTunes or Windows Media Player.  I picked iTunes so I could copy it over to my iPod.  4.  A digital copy disk is WAY smaller than any Blu-ray disk.  A ripped Blu-Ray is 11-14GB and the digital copy easily fit on my 32GB iPod Touch (1.8GB long.)  Watching this movie on an iPod was WAY COOL and I recommend it anyone who hasn't tried a movie on an iPod should do it now.   The movie was one giant fanfic and it was like there was this contest of who could write a good fanfic and this one won.  That said this will seriously offend any Trekkers (those who know Klingon and worship Star Trek) and probably a few Trekkies (those who watched all of the series but didn't read any Star Trek novels seriously.)  I didn't watch any of Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and half of Star Trek: The Original Series and I would say this movie is mostly for a bad fan like me.

B005LAIGFA|5.0|WOW!    Not sure what I expected when I went to see this today.  By the time it was over, I realized why I liked it.  It was classic Eastwood, if there is such a thing.  Ranks up there with 'Mystic River,' 'Gran Torino,' 'Million Dollar Baby.' The movie is awesome.  It's more than a biopic.  I've seen DeCaprio grow up in the movies and mature since the 'Titantic' and he's fantastic.  All the casting is fantastic and oscar nods for DeCaprio and all the supporting cast, especially Arme Hammer who plays a restrained relationship with J. Edgar, Dame Judi Dench and Naomi Watts.  Eastwood has paced the movie superbly.  The characters draw on themselves and the dialogue tells a story that believable, sensitive, and there is a true almost Grecian hero.  I'm simply awed!  DeCaprio has captured so many levels in this movie, his connection with his mom [Dench] and restrained, touching, and totally sympathetic connection with his deputy, [Clyde Tolson] who made him 'sweat' at just meeting him.  A towering figure, Hammer underplays him role much like Heath Ledger did in 'Brokeback Mountain.'  It is a must see movie and a true homage to what Hoover created, regardless of your beliefs.  Don't miss the credits at the end!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Well, seeing the numerous 1 star reviews here tells me that everybody is in the same boat and opinion as me. I just got this blu-ray today, and as usual, when I saw the word digital copy, I fired up iTunes, punched in the code for it to download the digital copy. iTunes doesn't recognize the code provided in this blu-ray. Apparently WB has decided to not support devices with the largest market share and went with its own \\"digital copy.\\"  To get started, you have to sign up for a Flixster account, then sign up for an Ultraviolet account, then link them together. Are you still with me? Then punch in the code on the website and the movie will show up on your \\"digital locker.\\" How do you watch the movie then? Well, there's a download button, but clicking that will reveal that you have to download and install an Adobe Air app for your computer. Yes, it doesn't support iTunes nor Apple TV. The website shows that it supports iDevices, which is misleading. iDevices are not supported natively. You have to download the flixster app for iOS, and stream the movie via that app, not via the built-in video player.   Now, who would want to go through all that just to watch the movie that you already paid for on your own devices? It's easier to just rip the DVD and make your own real digital copy, free from any hassles. This Ultraviolet method is a complete mess, and only confuses and punishes legitimate users. On the Ultraviolet website, they said there will be official Ultraviolet devices coming soon. Yeah, we'll see when that's going to happen.  UPDATE:  I moved up my ratings from 1 star to 3. If you go to flixster support: support dot ultraviolet dot flixster dot com, request a support ticket explaining nicely how you cannot use this ultraviolet copy with iTunes, you will receive a quick response from WB that will give you an iTunes code (make sure you have your original UV redemption code). Now, don't bother asking support directly from ultraviolet (uvvu dot com), they will simply said it is what it is and ignored your plea. So, added 2 stars for prompt response from flixster and WB, and now I have an iTunes digital copy.  UPDATE 2:  I moved the rating up to 4 stars. The iTunes code I obtained gave me the movie PLUS the iTunes extras! iTunes extras are bonus contents that you would get when you purchased the movie directly from iTunes. Usually on previous iTunes digital copy you get from purchasing blu-ray movies only get you the movie itself, not the iTunes extras. I'm happier now, and glad that WB did the right thing.
0061433063|4.0|It's difficult to think of an author who is more humane, more caring, more simply likeable than Sir Terry. He believes in people, even those he doesn't have much use for. And these traits have made him one of the most popular living authors in any language. Having said all that, it's also nice to be able to say that this is a very good wrap-up to the four-volume story of Tiffany Aching, Witch of the Chalk, Witch of the Hills, Big Wee Hag to the Nac Mac Feegles, and all of sixteen years old -- though she's been a witch since she was nine. At least, I *assume* it's the wrap-up -- but I previously thought _Wintersmith_ was the end of a trilogy. (On the other hand, there're Pratchett well-known medical problems. . . .) Tiffany has had a hard apprenticeship, what with overcoming local prejudice and kissing Winter and all, but now she's got a handle on things and she stays very, very busy, looking after her people. But trouble is brewing in the form of an ancient and evil force of hatred and prejudice, and if she doesn't defeat it, it could make things very difficult for all witches -- not to mention for innocent old ladies who merely seem a bit odd. But if the evil defeats her, it will take over her body and will know everything she knows. And then the other witches will have to kill her, whether they want to or not, for their own protection. As Granny Weatherwax says, \\"We do good. We don't do nice.\\" But Tiffany has a number of uncommon skills she can call on, including her friendly relationship with fire. Meanwhile, she also has to help the old Baron prepare for his upcoming death, and help Roland become the new Baron, and figure out how to deal with the jealousy of Roland's fianc&eacute;e, who is also an untutored witch. Note that this is (theoretically) a YA book, though some people (those who think adolescents must be protected from the world) will undoubtedly object to certain themes and scenes. But, like Robert Heinlein, Pratchett produces books for young readers that will appeal to us middle-aged types as well. And through it all, Pratchett spins his own magic with the language, which he does better than almost anyone. A lovely book.hat will appeal to us middle-aged types as well. And through it all, Pratchett spins his own magic with the language, which he does better than almost anyone. A lovely book.

B0050PYNOY|4.0|Your Highness is as crude and rude as it get. This is low brow humor with little or no redeeming qualities, but it is oh so fun. Me and my hubby just watched this movie and I at times found myself wondering why I liked it so much, only to forget why I asked the next time I started laughing at it. Your Highness is a satire of your typical fantasy flick, you have your medieval like setting populated with wizards, dwarfs and maidens in distress. In one of the nations of this world the noble price Fabious returns victorious from his latest quest with a new bide and the kingdom rejoices as they prepares for the wedding. Unfortunately in the middle of the wedding ceremony a evil wizard show up and kidnaps the bride forcing Fabious and his reluctant ally, his slacker brother Thadeous to go on a quest to slay the wizard and save the princess.<br /><br />Your Highness takes about every fantasy stereotype and makes shameless fun of it and the situations that arises are hilarious. You should be warned though that allot of the jokes in this movie is sex jokes, there are allot of (better not mention what types of jokes of Amazon's decency filter will come and eat me, but I do think you get my drift.) This do get over the top and if you are easily offended this movie is not for you, when I said this movie is as crude as it get I meant it. Your Highness is not meant to be taken seriously, it is meant to provide some laughs, and for what it is the movie delivers beautifully. One word of warning though, many think that everything fantasy is for kids, well this movie is not, trust me on that.<br /><br />Now Your Highness is a satire, it makes fun of the fantasy genre in a way that make us that are fans of that genre laugh with it. I would however say that if you are not a fan of fantasy then you might not enjoy this movie so much, allot of the humor works because it makes fun of known an loved stereotypes and this aspect would not work unless you know the genre. This movie feel like it was made by fantasy fans for fantasy fans. I would also say that as a roleplayer I found this movie extra fun, we have all experienced that D&D session where the group where tired, unfocused or just plain drunk and a story very similar to this movie where the result. Yeah in fact that is a good description of Your Highness it is D&D seen through the eyes of a player that is drunk as a skunk and then made into a movie.<br /><br />The actors in Your Highness do a decent enough job, this is not exactly Shakespeare and the actors have to deliver some insane lines with a straight face. The actors might not be at their best, but they look like they are having fun while filming and with a movie like this that is what matters. The music of Your Highness is forgettable but it do frame the action of the film quite nicely. The special effects looks good and the action sequences are very entertaining. Your Highness have great characters, the very noble price, his lazy good for nothing brother, the suck up servant, the brutal traitor, the stupid and helpless maiden in distress and the perverted white wizard, the strong but insane female warrior. The character who steal the show however is Leezar, the evil wizard, he is the perfect archetype of the fantasy villain who is even so evil that he rip the wings of pixies, crush them and snort their dust as a drug, I just can not get enough of Leezar, he is the villain you love to watch on screen and then cheer when he finally go down.<br /><br />I loved Your Highness and I definitely recommend it, my recommendation however do come with a few reservations, if you are not a fan of fantasy or you can not stand crude sex jokes then you will not like this, also there is nothing serious about this movie, it is not there to teach you anything, it is there to make fun of itself and make you laugh and if you look at it that way then I am sure you will enjoy this fantasy romp.sy fans for fantasy fans.

0446573019|5.0|I've read every David Baldacci Book, and Zero Day is one of his best. Although I'm a big fan, I was getting a little tired of the Camel Club characters, and I was very happy to see him shake things up. The new character, Puller, is a cross between Jack Reacher (Lee Childs) and Sean Drummond (Brian Haig). The story starts with a tough-as-nails military investigator from the CID, adds the requisite beautiful but tough female police deputy chief, and some intrigue in a small town in West Virginia. Yes, there are similarities to Lee Childs, but I think that's a good thing. The book picks up speed as Baldacci expertly weaves added layers into the story, building suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />If you like Lee Childs or Brian Haig, you'll love this book. If you like David Baldacci, you'll love this book. As you'd expect from David Baldacci, it's very well written, thoroughly researched and completely plausible. I hope he writes more with this character, perhaps giving the backstory on his brother's conviction for treason. Just start it early, because Zero Day will keep you up reading late into the night.

The book lacks beauty and imagery; it is evident at least to me that the author is not in love with language. The promised peculiarity is weak at best.  In short, the Harry Potter series offers more charm, and the television series Fringe offers more weirdness. I am sorry I bought it.
0743270754|5.0|As readers of my Amazon reviews know, I have read extensively about Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War (War Between the States to our Rebel friends).  \\"Team of Rivals\\" has to be one of the finest books ever written on either topic.  The purpose of the book is to explain how Abraham Lincoln took a collection of his rivals, all of whom thought that they, not Lincoln, should have been president, and molded them into a team that held the country together and came to respect and love their chief.  Beginning with Lincoln's background, author Doris Kearns Goodwin describes the backgrounds of each of the four other main characters, Secretary of State William H. Seward, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Edward Bates.<br /><br />Seward, Senator from and former Governor of New York, entered the Republican Convention of 1860 as the presumed nominee until the Lincoln operatives upset those aspirations.  Although overcome by disappointment, Seward accepted the post of Secretary of State, expecting to become a defacto Prime Minister to a president who, despite his extraordinary height, was in over his head.  Becoming Lincoln's most trusted advisor, Seward came to realize that he was just that, an advisor to a superior politician.<br /><br />Gov. Chase of Ohio was the champion of the abolitionists who also saw himself as the logical standard bearer whose day in the sun was delayed, not eclipsed, by the Lincoln ascendency.  Although Chase continued to use his position to undermine Lincoln politically with the intention of replacing him in 1865, Lincoln was able to use Chase's considerable talents to keep the war effort financed.<br /><br />Stanton, a Washington insider, who had served as President Buchanan's Attorney General, came into the cabinet with heavy personal baggage.  During their legal careers, Lincoln had been hired as local counsel for a case pending in Illinois.  After venue was transferred to Ohio, Lincoln appeared to participate in the trial. Stanton, upon seeing the Western ruffian, disparagingly refused to allow Lincoln to play any role.  At the end Lincoln returned to Illinois with bruised ego, a large legal fee, but no apparent grudge.  It was Stanton who would collaborate with Lincoln in the prosecution of the war and who would cry at his death.<br /><br />Bates, the conservative Missourian would largely confine himself to legal matters while providing Lincoln with a political balance to the more abolitionist Chase and Seward.<br /><br />On the pages of this book the reader is brought through the victories and defeats of war, the personal agonies and political challenges through which Lincoln and the country passed.  Here we read of mortal threats along the train trip to Washington, Lincoln's skill in playing each appointee off against the others and the taming of the disparate cabinet members.<br /><br />Goodwin has crafted, not just a multiple biography, but a seamlessly weaved history of the War as seen from the Administration's perspective.  It follows the trail of the four years that these rivals worked together through the threats of Bull Run, the frustrations with McClellan, the euphoria of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the Gettysburg Address, the electoral struggles during the war, the discovery of Grant and Sherman, the military team that would bring victory, and the difficult, but ultimately successful, reelection campaign.  At the end the administration would complete the victory and prepare for the peace until it was terminated in perhaps the most elaborate assassination plot in American history.<br /><br />Booth's plot itself deserves mention.  It was not limited to the assassination of Lincoln, but was to include Seward, who was seriously wounded as he lay in his sickbed where he was recovering from a carriage accident, and Vice-President Johnson, who was saved only because his planned assailant lost his courage.<br /><br />This book is a good read that neverloses the reader's interest.  It is one of those books that really enables the reader to understand how the whole story fits together.  It helps us to appreciate the political genius of Abraham Lincoln, who was able to hold things together during our nation's greatest crisis.  It is must reading for everyone who wants to understand Abraham Lincoln and how America survived the Civil War.the reader to understand how the whole story fits together.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King for years, and the only books I did not care for we're the Dark Tower series. What do most of you mean by \\"He's back!\\"? Did he go somewhere or do all of you just felt his writing these past years were not up to your intellectual standards? If you are a true fan of Stephen King, then you know that he was, is and always will be a brilliant writer. For all you whiners that will not shut up about the price of the Kindle version of the book, who held a gun to your head to buy it? As for the long reviewers that decide they are going to explain why they think King is back, I say shame on all of you. It's like you're telling him \\"Hey Steve, your writing sucked the last however many years, but we 're glad you can write a great book again.\\"  Wow. I didn't realize you all were professional book critics.  I mean, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but man all I saw was people giving their review, like they are writing for some important magazine, and reality check! It's just amazon.com guys. Also if you so called \\"expert reviewers\\" could not give an entire summary of the book, that would be great. Leave it to the pros, guys and gals, because when I see a long review like that, it actually spoils the book for me. Why? Because you nearly tell the entire story. If I want to know that, I'll read the book. You all need to get a perspective here. I know it's a free country, and you have the right to your opinon, but man, can't you just say you either liked or hated it and move on? As for the rest of the whiners, if you see a book you like, but not in your comfort zone price range, DON'T BUY IT! No one cares about your economic state. Want to know why? We all have problems too, and they are much bigger than you being angry about getting the audio features and whatever else was included with the book. Bottom line, this was a another great book by Stephen King. As far as I'm concerned, you have always been around writing  great books. Thanks for entertaining me and scaring the hell out of me for most of my life. Revised on November 25, 2011.
B000NDDG3M|1.0|This DVD was one of those single view only movies......thing is, it was already viewed before it was sent to us!  My son could never watch it!  I basically threw money away on this item, to never use it, get mad and throw it away.

1451648537|1.0|That is too funny about Gates and so true!! What about that disaster Isaacson! You can tell he has never worked for a true innovator. They are all the same, almost exactly! Bad manager, Hello stupid, obviously not. Even if you cannot understand why he does what he does. You can understand that he was one of the greatest managers in recent history, perhaps the only one in recent history, at least in my lifetime. Now if you work for a bureaucratic organization you will never see the brutal honesty that was necessary to originally build that company to greatness by a great individual and people defending that...all you will get is the go along mentality and the docile behavior that It encourages! Along with the slow slide into bankruptcy that corporations take once great companies. Unless they have monopoly protection like most industries outside of computer technology.     I have worked as a direct report of someone like Steve Jobs. They act like they do because they realize who they are and what they are capable of because they think through everything with lightning speed. One thing they realize like Jobs did is that they have a very limited amount of time to do an immense amount of great things. That guess what, we all benefit massively from, even beyond our wildest imaginations!  Because they realize this they do not tolerate people who waste their time for whatever reason. Especially people who work for him, either directly, or indirectly as a waiter etc. If they do not care or have no respect for excellence especially when they signed that paper saying I work here explicitly to serve you with excellence as a waiter or coding software! He behaved correctly in every case. And if you look at all great people they were exactly the same as Steve, even Walt Disney! If you look deeper at when a great person goes off on someone for making a mistake, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney or my friend, you will see that it was not the first time they did that and in fact it usually ishappening over and over! Read this to understand better: [...]    The ironic thing about this guy Isaacson is he and the rest of the lefty altruists [...] Steve hung around are the reason he got sick in the first place. Because they were all saying he is evil for being a Capitalist and for running off the greedy douche bags who were just collecting paychecks and did not care about his company! They probably said he deserved to have his company stolen from him by that immoral CEO which Steve hired and by the way just FIRED because he could not keep up and was making mistakes all over the place. That guy had such a lack of morality/ethics that he went to the board of Apple complaining about Steve!!! What??? But like all things, consistent action always shows the truth and that guy drove Apple into the ground. And we all saw what Steve did when he was brought back in!    Steve lived in such a conflicted life because he lived in reality and morality with his company and had idiots like Isaacson telling him he was immoral and wrong for actually doing the right thing!  If you let people like that get to you even slightly by agreeing with them or letting them leave a question mark in your head, it will lead you to massive guilt and unhappiness.  Especially if your married to one! Being unhappy for long periods of time while being under immense stress will cause you to get sick! Read this: [...]  I'm sure Steve, like my friend, thought through those bad ideas and found them to be untrue. But with everyone he loved and trusted saying he was wrong, when they were. Wearing him down, literally sticking a knife in him, whether they realized it or not, bleeding him out to a point where it eventually killed him! He was obviously so incredibly unhappy having to deal with them and not ever knowing for certain that they, were like the nay sayers he could prove so blatantly wrong in the business world, all wrong too! It's amazing he lived so long like that!!    Steve did what he lovedto do, which is probably why he did live so long with all people around him grinding him down. That love is rare in this world and should not be! And it is right that everyone should understand that he did what he loved and it was right! But if they don't then so what! Because some of us do!!! Great people who have given us as a byproduct of trying to make themselves happy the greatest civilization in all known history have been misunderstood and mistreated to such a horrible degree throughout all history. Look at Galileo, Copernicus, Darwin, Frank LLoyd Right, the Wright brother, Ludwig von Mises, Ayn Rand.  Even Steve Jobs, right now just 2 weeks after his death by some ignorant disgusting socialist journalist  who obviously does not have a clue about what true greatness really looks like in person!

I enjoyed the whole story and felt that it was well plotted with interesting characters, particularly Samantha Cole, the local cop in Drake, West Virginia. Baldacci gives life to Drake, a community in decline in the worst of coal country. He creates a credible plot, and brings us some true surprises. I look forward to a revived author creating even better stories, and John Puller may be just the guy we need.

B005F96URI|5.0|Hard to decide what to make of it at first. Be patient it will begin to make some sense after a few minutes into it.  Your initial reaction is like finding an exotic food in a five star restaurant that you're suspicious and wary of trying; because of it's name, where it comes from and the way it looks.   Viewing Guide:  The movie is a collage of the following: pop art (Warhol style); origami; Expressionistic art; stage musical; Italian western spaghetti meets Japanese samurai similar to the TV series \\"Zatoichi\\" - the blind amna, bakuto, warrior; high end graphic comic books of the Japanese manga style. The Art Deco backgrounds contribute a flat contrast to the vibrantly colorful foreground characters; a lot like Asian stage puppetry. There seems to be stylistic elements from movies such as Kill Bill and \\"Dark City\\" with it's background buildings that grow in two dimensional form as you watch.    Very novel use of props such as the get-away car that would make a MINI-Cooper look like a limousine and projectors that were actually old, turn of the century, carbon arc magic lanterns.The dialogue contains burlesque, parody, bombast, conceit phrasing such as: \\"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth will forever make better grammatical balance than turning the other cheek.\\"    Storyline is fairly typical good vs. evil martial arts; cinematography, CGI, set design, directing were great (quite novel/creative); acting was good for all except that Moore was just a forgettable neutral figure piece and Harrelson was miscast, just reading a few lines in his usual way while offering nothing magical in his critical moderating role - he just didn't seem to fit.
0060775858|5.0|This is a fabulous book and let none of the people who gave it one star tell you different. However, some things should be pointed out.  1. This is a BEDTIME book. It is about saying goodnight to the world so it isn't overly vibrant or involved.  2. Newborns and infants are not typically overly fascinated with ANY night time book because they have soft colors and are like a lullaby. When this book will really impact your child is when they are 18, 24, or 30 months. They will hear the rhythm of the poem with the rhyming in place and before you know it, your 2 year old will know that when you say \\"2 little kittens and a pair of...\\" it is time to say Mittens.  3. The book works better once you memorize it. Then you can let your child have control of the pages which they always appreciate, plus you can get the rhyming more in tempo which helps the interest of the book.  4. Yes, there are black and white pages. black and white is engaging to a young child and good for their development also. AND to the person who swears that when they were a kid, they liked it so it must have been more vibrant, doesn't know what they are talking about. My copy is 30 years old and it looks exactly like my sons board book copy other then the size (the paperback is larger in size then the board book version but the content is exactly the same.)  This is a perfect book to read as a last book right before turning out the light and singing twinkle twinkle etc.  I did this just an hour ago (well he \\"made\\" me read it twice) and had a 2 year old fall to sleep right away upon being set in his crib...no crying, no problems.
0061784788|5.0|James Rollins is well-known for his Sigma Force series (as well as his standalone books, Jake Ransom series, and the book based on the movie of \\"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull) and is (in my opinion) the best thriller/adventure author of this generation (although Steve Berry comes in as a close second).  I would highly recommend all of his books but I think his latest Sigma Force book, The Devil Colony, is his best yet!  His books are thoroughly researched and contain interesting facts but also show his great imagination and are fast-paced with never a dull moment.  In The Devil Colony, he takes a fictional idea (that America's beginning was based on a lie), mixes it with breathtaking locations and heart-stopping action, adds a generous portion of well-researched facts and comes up with a best-selling adventure that I literally could not put down.  I read until 3:00 in the morning so I could finish the book.  It's a non-stop roller coaster of action that leaves you wondering what can possibly happen next.  I highly recommend all of his books, particularly the Sigma Force books (which I would recommend be read in the proper sequence, beginning with Sandstorm and concluding with The Devil Colony).  His Jake Ransom series is for younger readers but also appeals to adults (Jake Ransom and the Skul King's Shadow and Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx).  His standalone books are also excellent reads.  Although this is supposed to be a review of The Devil Colony, James Rollins is an author that every reader should read at least once.  I guarantee that once you start reading his books, you won't stop!
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Ok first off want to say that I love the world of harry potter and I give the move 5 starts.    The reason I spent time to do this review was because of how disappointed I am with my digital download.  This is why I spent extra to buy this version.  Why do companies have to change the status quo of things when they worked fine before.  ON all other harry potter movies the digital download came from Itunes so why change it now???  A digital copy to everyone on the planet means ITUNES.  So when you get home and look forward to downloading your movie to ITunes, then find out now you have to use a new special service called UltraViolet and a app called flixter that just burns me!  I was hoping to make everyone aware of this as I bought this on Amazon and did not see the box or description when I preordered this months ago.
B003VS0CWO|4.0|Okay, so what can you say? It's the Rocky Horror Picture Show! Great deal. The \\"booklet case\\" is interesting. Not the best case design- I think a booklet in the case would have been better. There's a sheet on the back that lists the contents and such which is basically stuck to booklet/case and has a flap that goes over the top and overlaps the front cover and has the Blueray Disc logo on it. That flap is \\"taped\\" (sticky, easy peel circular sticker)to the front cover to hold the booklet closed- not the best way to keep it all closed up. But, it does contain the US and UK versions of the show!

B004LWZW7E|2.0|Andrew Niccol's In Time is one of those films that \\"could have, should have\\" been good but for some reason wasn't. It had an intriguing concept at its core - a future society in which time is literally money and going broke brings new meaning to the term 'sudden death'. And it had a very talented screenwriter and director at the helm, Andrew Niccol, who has done great work with similar ideas before, as the screenwriter behind Gattaca, The Truman Show, S1m0ne and The Terminal, and as director in the case of Gattaca and S1m0ne. But what made these earlier films work - the art of creating a different reality and making it believable through the characters and the attention to detail in the world-building - is unfortunately sadly missing here.<br /><br />The premise - the one that had such promise - is a future in which people have been genetically engineered to stop aging at 25.  The day you turn 25, your internal clock - bioengineered to display in the form of a glowing digital string of numbers along your inner forearm - begins ticking, starting with one year of time remaining. And that number is more than just how much time you have left, because time is now the currency everyone uses.  Everything costs - food, rent, bus fare, even a cup of coffee - and you pay for it with your time. And it's up to you to earn more time, because if your clock ever zeroes out, you're dead - suddenly, quickly and finally. So you're always working against the clock for more time, and you do anything to get it. If your job doesn't give you enough, then you beg, borrow or steal to get more. Anything to keep from running out. Rich people don't have to worry; barring death by accident, they have the potential to live forever. But anyone else...<br /><br />Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a working-class guy who, like most people, lives day to day - literally. Through an unexpected turn of events, he is suddenly given a century of time - an unimagineable amount for someone at his level and something that attracts the unwanted attention of one of the system's enforcers, a Timekeeper named Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy in a riveting performance).  Things become further complicated when Will hooks up with Sylvia Weiss (Amanda Seyfried), the spoiled daughter of one of the system's richest men, Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). Both Will and Sylvia end up on the run from Raymond and from a local gang who wants all of the time this pair is running around with.<br /><br />As I said, an intriguing premise and a potentially interesting plot. But sadly, the film fails to rise to the occasion. The problems are myriad, but believability is at the top of the list. Except for a handful of devices - like the glowing digital read-outs on everyone's arms and the way time has replaced money with meters that add to or deduct from your time, this world is - particularly visually - indistinguishable from our own. You get the impression that it should be in the future, especially since the film indicates that the system has been in place for at least a century, but nothing about the look of the film reflects that. Not the clothes or the cars or the buildings or anything else. Nothing in the details backs up what you're supposed to believe. Even more problematic are the people; we're _told_ how everything is different but we're almost never _shown_ that things are different.  Not in the way that matters.  The stilted dialogue and staged scenes have all the emotional impact of an infomercial.  Nothing about the way these characters act makes you really believe that most of them are living in a reality where each day is a desperate chance to earn another day.<br /><br />A large part of the fault for this lies in the weak script. In addition to being riddled with banal dialogue, plotholes and dangling plot threads that get introduced and then completely abandoned, the script utterly fails to make the characters' actions believable. This stands in sharp contrast to the kind of scriptwork that Niccol did in both The Truman Show and Gattaca where the story flowed seamlessly and the characters were developed in such a way that all of their actions made sense. In Time, however, requires frequent suspensions of disbelief as the actions of most of the characters frequently make no sense at all. They do what they do because the plot requires it, not because it's what we feel their characters instinctively would do.  Again, given his past excellent work in script-writing, Niccol's failure here is simply inexplicable.<br /><br />Oh, and on a side note, there's apparently a problem with the origins of the core story idea. Apparently many of the details seem to be drawn from Harlan Ellison's award-winning 1965 story \\"'Repent, Harlequin', said the Ticktockman\\", for which he was not given credit and over which he has sued the production company.<br /><br />Another big problem is in the casting, both in terms of the look of the film and in the quality of the performances.  With regard to the first point, given the underlying premise - that everyone is supposed to stop aging at 25 - it's rather critical to the film's believability that the people in it actually _look_ like they stopped aging at 25. But this is rather hard to pull off when most of the actors, particularly in the key roles, are visibly older than that. In point of fact, only two actors in major roles who are the ages needed are Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia), who's 25, and Alex Pettyfer (Fortis, the gang's leader) who's 21. The rest are all noticably older. Justin Timberlake (Will) is 30. Cillian Murphy (the Timekeeper) is 35. Matt Bomer (the stranger who gives Will the gift of a century) is 34. Johnny Galecki (Borel, Will's best friend) is 36. And Vincent Kartheiser (Sylvia's mega-rich father) is 32. All of which make it even harder to believe in the reality of this alternate future which doesn't look like the future to begin with.<br /><br />With regard to the quality of the performances, while most of the actors involved could be described as adequate, the performances vary between the painfully stilted (Timberlake) and the hopelessly bland (everyone else). I place the blame for most of this at the feet of Niccol as director and screenwriter. It is to Cillian Murphy's credit as an actor that he manages to rise above the problems of the weak script and the haphazard direction to give a truly memorable performance, turning what could have been a bland and cliched role into a riveting presence that dominates every scene he's in. Murphy's Timekeeper is a futuristic Javert, an unbending and relentless enforcer of the law whose integrity is grounded in a firm belief in the rightness of the system and of his role in it. When he's on the screen, the film comes alive around him. When he's not, it just drifts and careens from one pointless and reason-defying sequence to the next.<br /><br />In retrospect, I'd say that Murphy delivers two reasons (besides a memorable performance) that someone might want to actually see this film. If you want to know the difference between a celebrity (Timberlake) and a real actor (Murphy) and why that difference matters, this film is a perfect example. And if you want to see what a skilled and committed actor can do even when handed a lame script and a director who seemingly has gone absent from the set, Murphy's Timekeeper really sets the bar.<br /><br />Except for the core idea and for Cillian Murphy's performance, not really recommended unless you can watch it for free and have nothing else better to do with your time.he Truman Show and Gattaca where the story flowed seamlessly and the characters were developed in such a way that all of their actions made sense.

0316098329|3.0|NO SPOILERS beyond discussion of story structure.  I'll not waste time summarizing the plot; all you need to know is in the product's Amazon description.<br /><br />By the author's own admission, ROOM is told in two very distinct halves.  The first half is harrowing, gut-wrenching, poignant, and heart-breaking, easily worthy of a five-star rating.  It will keep you up late desperate to finish for fear of the characters' plight, and it ends in a climax more tense and gripping than possibly anything I've ever read.  The dichotomy between the horrors Jack experiences and the sweetly innocent perspective he provides through his narration is incredibly effective; it's impossible not to empathize with him.  Even more than him, the reader falls in love with Jack's mother, whose desperate efforts to protect her son from the grim reality of their situation, even at the expense of her own well-being, are amazingly touching.<br /><br />However, again avoiding spoilers, something happens at the midpoint that drastically changes the characters' situation.  Not long after this event, the story becomes unfocused, boring, and directionless.  The narrator's voice, which for the fist half is endearing, just becomes damn annoying; I honestly spent half the time wishing someone would smack the kid (as in *discipline* him, not *hurt* him).<br /><br />While Jack is the story's narrator throughout, the opening act establishes his mother as the story's *protagonist*; it is her actions which move the story forward.  The problem with the second half is that the author seems to lose sight of that, as Jack's mother is largely absent from the proceedings.  With no one to move the story forward through actions, the story literally doesn't go anywhere.  Instead, the reader is left with a passive observer, one still with a unique perspective, but one not doing anything other than commenting on his surroundings, and the social commentary Donaghue oh-so-cleverly disguises in Jack's observations quickly become tedious.  I honestly think the story would much benefited from a change in narrator from Jack to his mother; the two halves are distinct enough that it would make sense, and would be no more jarring.<br /><br />Still, the missteps of the second half are not so egregious to undo the very strong work done in the first.  I recommend this book.  It is worth reading, and some readers may even still enjoy the second half (I would speculate those who have children may more than those who don't, such as myself).  But most readers may want to temper their expectations.y think the story would much benefited from a change in narrator from Jack to his mother; the two halves are distinct enough that it would make sense, and would be no more jarring.

B0039TD826|5.0|\\"Exile on Main Street\\" is considered one of the Rolling Stones' most important albums, which may at first seem a little strange. Rolling Stones band members have on several occasions stated that they did not  consider the album as something special. Moreover it contains relatively few of the group's best-known songs; not least considering that it was originally a double album.<br /><br />The two singles \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Happy\\" naturally are well-known favourites and a handful of the other tracks were concert favorites in the 1970s. Among those are \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Loving Cup\\" \\"All Down the Line\\" and \\"Rip This Joint.\\"<br /><br />Generally, to be real a fan of this album, I believe it is necessary to like horns. The horn section is an important part of the soundscape of the album. I clearly remember that this fact gave me some problem with being really enthuastic with the album.<br /><br />The classic Keith Richards guitar riff fortunately can be found found on several tracks. This appliy for the opening track \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"All Down the Line\\" and of course the album's biggest hit \\"Tumbling Dice\\".<br /><br />My personal favorite on the album is the delicate half acoustic \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" which has fine vocal harmonies. Also the melodic blues \\"Sweet Virginia\\", which in fact could have been a \\"Beggars Banquet\\" song and \\"Loving Cup\\" are favorites.<br /><br />\\"Happy\\", with Keith Richards, is another significant song and also the quiet \\"Let It Loose\\" and the gospel influenced \\"Shine a Light\\" stand out positively from the whole.<br /><br />Some of the very classic blues-inspired songs, I do not find particularly interesting, and although the album may well deserve to be judged as a whole, I believe that some of the less significant blues-influenced numbers could have been left out. In any rate, it is an album you can listen to many times. I have not heard the bonus-tracks, but I thought that the album was long enough as it originally was put together, so I never really considered getting the Deluxe version.<br /><br />The sound on the remastered version has been criticized. I find it difficult to endorse this. On the contrary, I think the sound has become more open and airy.sound on the remastered version has been criticized. I find it difficult to endorse this.

B0055S348W|5.0|I have to say, this app is really easy to use. I had it working practically automatically (which was a lot easier than getting the printer setup on my pc). It recognized my crappy printer automatically on the wifi, downloaded that extra 4mb driver in a flash, and then worked. Couldn't have been easier. I got this when amazon offered it as the free app of the day but honestly, I think its well worth the money if youre considering purchasing.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Last night after fixing a yummy dinner, my husband, Tina and I decided to rent a movie from VUDU. As soon as I saw that Horrible Bosses was on there, I knew that is what we would end up watching. I had seen the previews and the movie looked so funny.<br /><br />I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt.  The actors did such a great job in this film.  The plot was great and I was really glad that it lived up to my expectations.  Truly hilarious!  I added it to my wish list.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|I just watched the movie and am disappointed in it. I would like to have seen more focus on the wider cast of characters including Ron and Hermione. The battle between Harry and Voldemort at the end of the movie was disappointing. It could have been any futuristic movie battle in any movie. The rewrite was poorly done. Part 1 was better.
1451648537|2.0|i was embarassed to buy this book and still am. I found it quite boring and not well written. It definitely seemed rushed.  The best parts of the book are discussed in the widely available interviews with the author. I would suggest looking on youtube and skipping the book
0316056863|2.0|Perhaps I came to this book with too high epectations.  Since Tina Fey brought a feminist sensibility to SNL and was the first female head writer, I assumed she would write much more about how difficult it was to break into that male-dominated profession.  Instead, she ignored these issues and tried to spin the post-feminist blather--that things are different now and gender makes no difference, be a team player, etc.    Additionally, she writes almost nothing about her years ar SNL, which I think would have made a much more interesting book.    But I realize that since she still wants to work in the field. she can't (yet) be truly honest about what goes on behind the scenes.  With that being said, I conclude that this is a mildly interesting book written by someone whose fame allowed her to hit pay dirt while she can.

1451627289|4.0|There are three categories of readers who will gravitate to Stephen's King's 11/22/63:<br /><br />1. Fans of King's extraordinarily popular novels<br />2. Time travel junkies<br />3. Those who can't get enough of anything and everything to do with the events surrounding the assassination of President John Kennedy<br /><br />I actually find myself falling into all three categories.  I've been a Stephen King addict since I first read CARRIE back in the 1970's, I love time travel stories (from Bradbury's wonderful \\"A Sound of Thunder\\" to works by Heinlein, Dean Koontz, and H. G. Wells), and the Kennedy assassination was part of my childhood - I was in 6th grade when he was killed, and even at twelve I knew that something had been irrevocably changed that Friday afternoon in 1963.<br /><br />King fans will undoubtedly love this novel.  It's full of King's very special blend of memorable characters, small-town vignettes, and the idea that something dark and inscrutable lurks beneath the surface of life as we know it.  This isn't a horror novel, but there is something horrible about what happens when a 35-year-old English teacher from a small town in Maine tries to make things right that should never have gone wrong.  In the beginning, these are small things he tries to make better.  By the end, it's a very big thing.  But King never lets us forget that every action prompts an unknown number of reactions.  And it's the reactions that can scare the bejesus out of us!  As King writes in 11/22/63, we live in \\"a universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where morals dance in defiance of the dark.\\"  That's good stuff, Mr. King! And those who've read IT will delight in a particular sequence set in Derry, Maine.<br /><br />Time travel aficionados will like the novel, too.  This is not a science fiction novel (at least not in the technical meaning of the term), and King does little to explain his version of a \\"time machine\\" (which is not a machine at all).  As one of his characters says, \\"Why ask questions when there are no answers?\\"  But King's exploration of what might actually happen to the fabric of our world should we find ourselves capable of traveling back in time is fascinating.  It's all not as easy as it seems.  As King explains it, \\"Time is obdurate.\\"  It will have its way.<br /><br />As for the JFK addicts, I have a slight warning (and if you're absolutely against any form of \\"spoiler\\" in your reviews, you might want to skip this paragraph):  If you're looking for a revelation as to which conspiracy theory King adheres to when it comes to the assassination of President Kennedy, you're likely to be disappointed - and even a little bit surprised (especially in light of such politically charged novels as FIRESTARTER).  11/22/63 includes an interesting afterward in which King explains his take on the events that unfolded at Dealy Plaza.  It won't sway the conspiracy theorists, but it fascinated me.  This is a very different Stephen King.  But if you're absolutely convinced that Oswald did not act alone, you might find yourself frustrated.<br /><br />Overall, 11/22/63 is a well-plotted, satisfying novel that blends a bit of the supernatural with history.  It both celebrates the nostalgic beauty of a time long gone, and forces us to look at the reality of that nostalgia - it wasn't all root beer floats and swing dancing.  Best of all, the ending works - totally and completely.  And that's a big deal for a Stephen King novel (I was not at all happy with the endings of either DUMA KEY or UNDER THE DOME).  But I finished 11/22/63 with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye.<br /><br />Why the four stars?  I have to admit the novel is too long.  There are about 200 pages there in the middle that could easily have been edited down to 20 (King spends an awful lot of time on the minutia of Oswald's life - his various moves, his relationship with Marina, his conversations, his arguments, etc.).  I got a little lost there, but King did pull me back in.  The best parts of 11/22/63 actually have nothing to do with either Kennedy or Oswald - it's the life his narrator lives, both in 2011 and in the 1960's.  I wanted to know Jake Epping (or his alter-ego, George Amberson).  This story is his, and not Kennedy's.<br /><br />I highly recommend 11/22/63.

1577314808|1.0|Tolle claims to have `discovered something new' and to be enlightened with unique information and \\"truths\\" for us, but he does not offer anything new at all. He seems to strut through the book from the very beginning with an arrogance which does not represent the spiritual qualities we would hope to develop. After all the hype and sales I had high expectations and was very disappointed. When an author feels the need to start a book but dissing the other religions and school-of-thought, it should be a red light warning for us all. He starts off misquoting the Christianity, the Buddha and the Buddhist teachings, and bases his own message on the difference between his teachings. He then goes on to repeat, throughout the book, the core messages of other existing spiritual beliefs, teachers and religions. The book and the messages are very repetitive. Nothing new, nothing extraordinary and for me his integrity comes into doubt because of the obvious spiritual plagiarism from beginning to end. The whole premise of \\"stay in the present moment\\" is written about in depth is thousands of volumes of teachings in Hindu and Buddhist teachings. The main premise of meditation practice (well at the very basic level anyway) is to be present and not let the mind wander and there are much better books and teachers out there. Don't waste your time or money.

Normally I like Mr. Koontz over Mr. King for suspense but this is one of his best. It's a long read so get comfortable, build a fire and plan for a long enjoyable weekend.
1416562605|4.0|A very enjoyable and entertaining book which very cleverly reveals the dark and grubby underbelly of Indian society. Even though it has had some criticism for lacking in depth or being superficial but it very cleverly peels away the layers to give a clear indication of the range of characters (and even caricatures) which we encounter along the way. The humour and off handed way of dealing with heavy issues is quite accurate because life does feel cheap a lot of the time in India, and the friendliness and cunning are everywhere in abundance, and sometimes in the same person at the same time. Adiga takes us by surprise on each page, and just as we start to feel that we understand, something is said to disarm us and take our breathe away a little. The story flows well and Adiga proves himself to be a superb story teller.

141690977X|3.0|I remember the episode in the TV series when this scene played out and I was like Miranda where I felt it was like a breathe of fresh air. Yes I think men and women are much more complicated than the book implies, and yes, I know its a generalisation but so many times I have seen myself and my mates agonise about 'will he or wont he' and always give the guy the benefit of the doubt, by presuming that he is sick /busy/ unable to call but the truth is that if he is thinking about you and mad about you is probably going to find a way to call!! It is also good to apply this message to friendships - when we find ourselves doing all the work then that friend needs to step up, or they arent that into us either. Its a fun somewhat challenging book that gets us to be a little more honest with ourselves

B006470HZ6|5.0|TWD is a fantastic series. Despite what some of these over reviewers have shared, it is, in fact, the character development and relationship dynamics that make the show. These are not static characters; they are ever changing. You can't categorize any of them as good or bad because the writers have done such a good job interacting with the complexity of the human condition. Backdrop it all with an apocalyptic setting, awesome cinematography, and (of course) zombies, and you have one of the best dramas on television today. This series easily deserves 5 stars!
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I agree with the other posts,  This is certainly a case of misleading and flash advertising.  There is not an actually digital copy of the movie in the package.  They are playing the consumer.    I only gave this one star because  I had to in order to post this review.  We already saw this move in the theater and know the content is good but this type of bait and switch scam tactic should not be tolerated by the public.  I am returning mine tomorrow.  I really hope someone starts a class action lawsuit against WB for the scam they pulled.  I was going to purchase some other movies for the Holiday Season and gifts but at this point they will not be any of the WB productions.
0670451495|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was purchased for my soon-to-arrive granddaughter and recommended by a friend living in Boston.  If you are from Boston or visit regularly you probably know all about this book.  It takes place in a park in Boston that you can visit.  There's a sculpture of the mother duck and her ducklings inside the park.  The book teaches a nice lesson to children about being compassionate towards animals and it's a very cute story.  Highly recommend it.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|Kelly Clarkson's fifth studio album, \\"Stonger\\" is not as strong as you might like but it's not a total trainwreck either. My first impression after listening to this album was not very good. I thought a lot of the songs were safe and watered-down pop anthems. Kelly is a gifted vocalist but the material on \\"Stronger\\" didn't challenge her or make her grow as an artist. I don't entirely think it's Kelly's fault, I think her record label puts a lot of pressure on her to record songs that are radio-friendly and predictable. Even the songs Kelly co-wrote seemed flat and emotionless. But after a few listens, this album started showing its true colors. I still don't think \\"Stronger\\" is her best album to date. I prefer \\"My December\\" and \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" but I have come to like this album, and the ballads are absolutely beautiful. My favorite track is \\"Honestly\\". Some of the other standout tracks include: \\"The War is Over\\", \\"Breaking Your Own Heart\\", \\"Einstein\\", \\"Mr. Know it All\\", \\"Standing in Front of You\\", \\"Don't Be a Girl About It\\", and \\"The Sun Will Rise\\" featuring Kara Dioguardi. There are only about 2-3 songs that still haven't grabbed me but overall...\\"Stronger\\" is a solid pop album. I just wish the word \\"alone\\" wasn't so overused, gets a bit grating. Oh well, Kelly has the most breathtaking voice in pop music so I'll let that one slide!
0061714402|4.0|It's a great read if you're interested in getting the other side of the story. However I had expected more. Many of the stories ended abruptly, and left me wanting more. Not quite as impacting and detailed as \\"SCAR TISSUE\\", but I enjoyed it none the less.

By far the best rpg i have played thus far on Android. Good work devs!!!
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|An earnest film, encapsulating perhaps the very beginnings of belief, in seed form. This movie probes the question of the afterlife, and although it tries to remain neutral, it seems to offer more positive than negative.
B000FC13E0|5.0|This book is one of my favs, it is definitely NOT for someone who either doesn't understand technology or someone who won't try to understand. There is a lot of technical talk and science fiction nuances in this book but MC definitely combines the tech, drama, and a good story closely together. When I first read it I finished it from front to back in one sitting because I loved it so much.<br /><br />This is a science fiction book so yes, not everything makes sense. Yes, it does combine science fiction with drama with moral ethics but that in my opinion makes the book really good because it is done so well.<br /><br />Again, this is not a book for everyone, you have to read it with an open mind because it is one of those \\"what-if\\" books.
