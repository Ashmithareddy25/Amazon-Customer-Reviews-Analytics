0767802470|1.0|I recall this movie being a most brilliant production and I looked forward to again seeing it. However, it seems I am not alone in suffering the problem of the DVD not being able to load. I had to get my money back, as have many others. Maybe if someone can figure out a solution to this, those of us who would love to own this movie and see it again will be able to do so.
0345803485|3.0|I do enjoy reading this novel.. Iam still on the first novel, Its not bad and as awful as some readers make it seem, however it  feels like Iam reading some sort really long Harlequinn Romance novel. If you want something romantic and idealized this novel is for you. However if you want something darker and edgier this novel totally misses it. I also wonder if the author of 50 shades of Grey was somehow inspired by the movie \\" Secretary\\" which was originally adapted by Mary Gaitskill Bad Behavior which I loved, both male characters have \\" Grey\\" as a last name is that really a coincidence? Iam just wondering. Another thing is I wish the characters in the novel would be more complex I just don't feel the rush I totally felt when I read secretary & watched Secretary, the main characters were disturbing, screwed up, captivating and mesmerizing @ the same time & the beauty of it was because the characters were believable. With 50 shades of Grey I don't feel the characters are real or are believable.. Another thing I don't get from this story is why are they sending emails back and forth, Why can't  Christian Gray and Anastacia Steel text each other on their blackberries like normal people do nowdays? ..

B002I0J5FG|1.0|I cannot believe all of the positive reviews for ICO.  This game is HORRIBLE.  The worst game I've played in a very, very long time.  The controls are abysmal.  The \\"battles\\" are a terribly frustrating discombobulated mess with the stupid kid taking five seconds to get up every time he's knocked down.  The camera angles are a wreck; So are the camera controls.  I got as far as the graveyard before I said F this!!!  Enough is enough, games are supposed to be fun--not make you want to smash your PS3.  I'm going to try Shadow of the Colossus now and then this dog is going up for sale.  HORRIBLE!

I have been overwriting each exercise by flipping the nut around, etc.  Lefties will know what I mean.  I think it would be helpful if there was a notice somewhere on Amazon that brings this up.

B005FDXT32|5.0|While I own the 2 disc Standard Def set that came out a few years ago, I thought I would buy this Blu Ray edition without the Digital Copy.  Very glad to have made the purchase.<br /><br />In past version I often wondered why it appeared so blanched out, especially in the early scenes as Tony Montana, Manny, Angel and a friend were going to do the deal with the Columbians.  The new Blu Ray edition brings back all the color and vitality to the original image and stays vital though out the film.  The Blu Ray version truly has provided a significant improvement over previous Scarface releases.  It's not perfect, there is some grain here and there, easy to see in the sky shots and when the cement walls are in the shots.  However, this grain is not exceedingly so and does not distract, nor is it there in most of the film.  At the end of the movie, as Tony and associates bring Gina back to his mansion after Tony kills Manny, there is a wide shot of the red carpeted staircase.  I did notice some aliasing at the bottom of the staircase, but as the camera zooms in, it goes away.  Red has always been a very difficult color to reproduce which is why it is rarely used in credits as it can cause stair-stepping and aliasing, however, this was the only instance where I saw any and it last but a few seconds.<br />The blu ray transfer is really very, very good.<br /><br />The two disc Standard Def version used DTS 5.1 audio while the Blu Ray provides 7.1 DTSHD audio.  The score is spread very nicely though out the entire speaker system,(mine is 5.1) however, there really is very little use of any of the channels for discreet directionality making the 7.1 possibilities only useful for the music score itself.  Audio always seems to get the short end of the financial straw in film releases and transfers, and Scarface is no different.  There were plenty of opportunities for surround foley fx in the riot at the holding camp as well as the final mansion shootout.  Sides and rears are sometimes used for slight panning of the vehicles and not much more.  The dialogue is clear and properly leveled so once you set your volume you should not have to reset at any time.<br /><br />The video transfer and movie gets 5 stars from me, while the audio gets 3.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankstimes used for slight panning of the vehicles and not much more.

030758836X|2.0|I read all types of books. I read this for a book club with an open mind. After 25 pages, I realized it was not going to be an intelligent book. Fine. After fifty pages I was sure I hated it. Once I made it to Part 2, I thought there were a couple interesting turn of events. Then I started to get bored. I rolled my eyes throughout.<br /><br />The story is weak.<br />The character's are not likeable or memorable.<br />The book is too long.<br />The events are typical cliques.<br />The character names are awful. Rand? Tanner Bolt? Betsy Bolt? Go?<br />The ending is lame.<br />The writing is not good.<br /><br />There were points were I was glad the main character was 'missing' or 'dead' then I realized, as long as she was, the book would continue-- which was not a good thing. I dont see what the big deal is or why this is selling so well. It seemed mysoginistic and the constant swearing seemed put-on to appeal to readers. Swearing and sex aren't going to save a lame story.<br /><br />I won't be picking up another book by this author.

B005LAII6C|4.0|Writer and Co-Director Chris Butler (storyboardist on Coraline and Corpse Bride) has given us a unique vision of a common situation in this 3D Stop-Motion animation film. Judging people can cause you to make bad decisions -because not learning the truth and fearing what you don't know can be harmful. How?<br /><br /> Butler says, \\"I wanted to do a story where there are no real bad guys, just characters making bad decisions based on their own personal fears.\\" His Co-Director Sam Fell (Flushed Away, The Tale of Despereaux) also says, \\"This film is about real characters in an extraordinary situations. We all know of the everyday bully that you fear more than monsters in a scary movie or in your closet!\\"<br /><br />Focus features production, released under the Universal Pictures distribution, of Paranorman is a story about a very special boy who has the ability to talk to ghosts of the deceased who have certain `business' yet to finish before they move on. This makes him odd and different to both his family and his classmates. What he learns in the end, as everyone in the town does, is that nothing is what it appears to be. And making decisions, without giving someone a chance or learning about them, can lead you to make bad and sometimes `deadly' decisions.<br /><br /> The story has a few slow points, but there is great humor between the two buddies Norman, voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In, The Road) and his overweight buddy Neil, voiced by Tucker Albrizzi (Mike & Molly, Brothers & Sisters). Some of the most hysterical commentary comes from Norman's sister Courtney, voiced by Anna Kendrick (Twilight, Up In the Air). Now add your bully/blockhead character named Alvin, voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, How To Train Your Dragon) and you have your typical neighborhood gang! There's even a `Jock' with a twist (at the end) named Mitch, brother of Neil, voiced by Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone, Good Will Hunting).<br /><br /> Norman has his work cut out for himself because he is dealing with a curse from a 300-year-old witch placed on Norman's town. And this witch, who turns out to be exactly something you would never expect - a miss judged little girl - has a surprise of her own. She is voiced perfectly by Jodelle Ferland (Stargate, Seed).<br /><br /> The movie also has such great talents as John Goodman (The Artist, Monster's Inc.) as a `ghostly' crazy uncle; Elaine Stritch (30 Rock, Monster-In-Law) as a `ghostly' grandma with a big heart; Bernard Hill (Titanic, Lord of the Rings) as a regretful `ghostly' Judge from 300 years ago; and Tempestt Bledsoe (The Cosby Show, Dance Till Dawn) as an irreverent but determined police officer - who is not a ghost!<br /><br />Norman's parents, a very supportive mother Sarah voiced by Leslie Mann (17 Again, Knocked Up), and a not so supportive father Perry voiced by Jeff Garlin (Wall*E, Curb Your Enthusiasm), confuse Norman more than help him.<br /><br /> The film is extremely colorful and creative in production design done by the artistic vision of Nelson Lowry (Fantastic Mr. Fox). The stop-motion animation is fluid and fun and the ultimate in greatly detailed set construction and props, including some inside jokes. Look at the brand name of the underwear of Mitch the `Jock' brother of Neil is wearing.<br /><br /> This movie is funny and has some great scenes between the family members and a visually stunning confrontation with \\"The Witch\\" and Norman that ends with an heart-warming resolution of compassion and respect. As the director, Chris also states, \\"I hope people see this film as a fun family adventure....it might not be so scary to the young ones because it's your basic kid vs. bully situation.

0345803485|1.0|I heard this book was about erotica/BDSM. not my usual cup of tea. But I have become alarmed to read that what ACTUALLY occurs in this book is a glorification of domestic abuse. I know BDSM people. The dom/submissive stuff is in context of scenes, not hacking into your emails and controlling your life and being an intrusive creep.<br /><br />seriously, what is wrong with people. If this guy was an IT worker, not a millionaire, this would be stalking and harassment and felony behavior.<br /><br />Finally Ana's own behaviour is so reminiscent of a victim of domestic abuse:<br />feeling confused about the relationship and his behaviour<br />constantly trying to work Christian out<br />uncontrollably crying, feeling emotional all the time<br />not telling her friends everything for fear of them telling her she is being stupid etc.<br />walking on eggshells with Christian as she does not know how he will react to things eg: being scared to tell him abut Jose's show<br />feeling inadequate, feeling that she will not be able to please him in the way he wants and ignoring her own feelings and needs<br />feeling insecure - she is even starting to get jealous of previous relationships<br />becoming withdrawn and a shadow of her former self, which is why her friends and family are starting to ask what is wrong.

B005LAII3U|4.0|There are interesting and visually stimulating choices director Lein Wiseman (Underworld, Live Free & Die Hard) made for this action adventure Sci-Fi film. Taken originally from the Philip K. Dick short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,\\" screenwriters Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Street King) and Mark Bombeck (Race to Witch Mountain, Deception) successfully made a new twist on this remake by making it completely earthbound.<br /><br />The original film directed by Paul Verheovem of the same name (1990) is considered a cult classic and they chose to keep the premise on Mars and have the ulterior motive be a corporation taking control of the Earth through deception.<br /><br /> This film takes the current political climate of corporations creating a society of automotons that will rule in a police state manner and only the affluent will benefit entirely and be in charge of society while suppressing the poor and weak. The underlying message to everyone using the fantasy service known as Recall is - they will never know themselves again.<br /><br /> What shines in this film is the character of Douglass Quaid/Howser who is played extremely passionately by Colin Farrill (Phone Booth, Alexander). His awareness and unawareness is what drives this film. Identity confused and almost not sure who he should believe - including himself - Colin gives an intense performance.<br /><br /> The two ladies in this film are also amazing. His \\"wife\\" played by Kate Beckinsale (Aviator, Pearl Harbor) does a great job in being a determined baddie with a mission to stop Colin's character. And Jessica Biel (The Illusionist, New Year's Eve) plays a person who literally saves him from jeopardy several times, confuses him on his very own identity, and eventually makes her way into his heart.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) plays an excellent heavy who leads the plot against the suppression of society that no one wants to deal with. On the other side is the short but stunning performance which came from Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter) as the leader of the resistance who I felt came to his demise much too soon.<br /><br />Some other notable but stand-out performances come from Colin's best friend played by Bookeem Woodbine (The Rock, Ray) and a small but humorous genius administrator at the Recall facility played by John Cho (Star Trek 2009, Harold & Kumar).<br /><br /> Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, Cowboys & Aliens) composed an amazing heart pound score for the extremely entertaining action sequences throughout the film.<br /><br /> The action sequences involving a very detail magnetic car chase were engaging to the eye. The most amazing feats of stunts and action driven fighting sequences came from an concept where elevators move in all directions at the same time. Making for an amazing chase sequences with fighting, explosions, robots and tons of near misses and hits!<br /><br /> Overall the film is fun and filled with action. The story is fairly simple and yet there is enough there to make you root for the good guys and cheer when the baddies are lost. Great visual effects, visually dark in nature and stunning city views of the future make it all candy-for-the-eye, including a `lift' that travels through the Earth's crust itself!<br /><br /> Fun for the whole family with mild language and lots of great action -although not as good as the original film for me - this remake is still really worth seeing.ormance which came from Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter) as the leader of the resistance who I felt came to his demise much too soon.<br /><br />Some other notable but stand-out performances come from Colin's best friend played by Bookeem Woodbine (The Rock, Ray) and a small but humorous genius administrator at the Recall facility played by John Cho (Star Trek 2009, Harold & Kumar).<br /><br /> Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, Cowboys & Aliens) composed an amazing heart pound score for the extremely entertaining action sequences throughout the film.<br /><br /> The action sequences involving a very detail magnetic car chase were engaging to the eye.

0345525558|5.0|The language of flowers originates from the Victorian era.  When a man gave a young lady a bouquet of flowers, she would try to decode it like a secret message.<br /><br />Victoria, a defiant child who craved solitude, was so hardened on the outside that she was not able to feel love, but able to find solace and communicate her feelings through flowers.<br /><br />The storyline is heart wrenching and intense - a book you won't forget, about forgiveness and second chances - a book with almost unbearable poignance that makes your heart ache.  This is Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel and I'm looking forward to more ... truly a gifted writer.
B008N1LL42|2.0|Really wanted to like this one.  Was willing to over look some silly things.  However, without giving away the story, the scenarios are so completely unrealistic as far as the personal relationships, how the Navy works, and just common sense.  It just ruins it.  Everything Taylor Kitsch touches since Friday Night Lights seems to be just awful - John Carter anyone?<br /><br />Clearly the movie was not reviewed for any concept of common sense.  Even Liam Neeson couldn't keep the stink away from this movie.  A little bit more effort they might have had a decent movie.  Wait until it hits the dollar bin at Wal-Mart.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|The fourth film in the Bourne Legacy series (originally authored  by Robert Ludlum), was written and directed by Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, Extreme Measures), along with his brother Dan Gilroy (Real Steel, City of Light), and has a simple but direct approach to making the entire film about eliminating everything that was set up in the first three films. The entire organization of specially programmed people with double agendas is cancelled and this includes killing everyone involved.<br /><br />Taking the seat front and center now is Jeremy Remer (The Avengers, The Hurt Locker) playing Aaron Cross, a character who starts out with one idea of what his purpose is and then suddenly realizes that he has to avoid the very people who are programing him with drugs. He does a great job as the impartial, intelligent and super-athletic man-killer he is programmed to be while realizing he's now the target of the organizations destruction.<br /><br />Ironically he finds a friend in the very medical community that is inducing him with his super-human drug addiction, artfully played by Rachel Weizs. Her initial ignorance to the big picture of what she is actually contributing too changes abruptly and she soon learns that Jeremy's character is sincere in his attempts to beat the system that built him.<br /><br />The movie is filled with fights, killing snipers, running and car chases of incredible detail but with a wonderful visual flow that makes some of these sequences seem a little too unlikely to actually happen in real life.<br /><br />Some other notable performances include Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legecy) and Edward Norton (The Incredible Hulk, Fight Club) as the people in charge of the agency that decides it needs to shut down its super-spy program. Donna Murphy (Star Trek: Insurrection, Tangeled) put in a small put tough character who realizes Jeremy has figured out that they are after him and he in turn goes after them.<br /><br />The film is completely more action than story and has some good moments of double jeopardy that you really can't guess which way the action is going. Overall the feel was different from the original Matt Damon series of films which, for me, worked better overall. But this film has some interesting and intense moments and, if you like action, it's here!etely more action than story and has some good moments of double jeopardy that you really can't guess which way the action is going.

1936608898|5.0|This book is exactly what I would write about nutrition if I could write about food.<br /><br />I love how balanced this book is. It Starts With Food lays out a fair and practical approach to eating healthy. Their 4 rules to determine a  good food is genius.

I would recommend it to any artist, beginner or advanced. It's filled with wonderful examples of beautiful art and very inspiring. In addition it comes with a dvd which I haven't had a chance to open yet. On top of all this, it's a great price too. Buy this book, you won't regret it.
0345803485|1.0|What can I say that no one else has already? If you took the sex out of it the book would be about 16pages. The sex itself is repetitive as well as a lot of other things the characters say/think. I got sick of reading \\"my inner goddess says/does this/that\\". He touches her and she orgasms. The whole book is so unrealistic. I hate to think there are women out there who idolize Christian and think this is some kind of classic love novel. A real relationship is nothing like this, and I'm sorry there are people out there crazy enough to think highly of this book and idolize it like it's their dream. You'd be better off to just watch a bondage porno. It has very little true content, I only continued reading until book 3 because I wanted to see if he changed for good, but I couldn't do it any longer. I hate this book. The main thing that made me quit is once you get to book 3 you get start to see the characters true personalities. I can't stand Anastasias personality among many other things. She does things on purpose to make him jealous/mad and then he does something similar back and she throws childish temper tantrum. She agreed to let him spank her so he does it and she leaves him and blames him! Don't do things that you won't like to please someone else and then get mad at them about it! You didn't have to agree to anything. I can't stand how immature and childish her character is. I wish I didn't waste my time on any of these books. I like erotica and many different kinds of books, and even the really bad ones I usually finish. Actually, I've never quit reading a book/series this far in. I can't emphasize how much I hate this book, it angers me I can't stand it that much. I'm worried for the people out there who enjoyed it. I did enjoy some of the sex in the beginning before it got old and repetitive, but it no where near made up for how horrible this book is and my lost time reading it.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Some of the covers are outstanding (e.g., \\"Drifter's Escape,\\" \\"Heart of Mine,\\" \\"Ring Them Bells,\\" \\"With God On Our Side\\") and some are quite pedestrian (e.g., \\"Blowin in the Wind,\\" \\"Rainy Day Women\\"). If you get the set at a substantial discount, it's worth it. It was worth it for me just to hear the amazing Bettye Lavette sing \\"Most of the Time.\\"

It has been one month since I watched the movie and the changes I have made not only make me feel better, it is helping my pant size and hopefully will help change the industry. If you like this movie, I would also reccomend watching the future of food.

I liked his character, since he never lost his \\"aw, shucks\\" country boy goodness. The rest of the story, well, it's pretty standard stuff - Indiana Jones probably did Nazis better. But all in all, an enjoyable movie, nice for a rainy afternoon.
0393339882|5.0|This is a biographical history of the development of quantum mechanics. All the personalities involved are here it seems. I've read much on quantum physics but many of the people described in this book were new to me. The story is engagingly told like a novel and the ideas are put as simply as possible for a subject that is so conceptually difficult, but it doesn't go into any detail on quantum physics. Manjit Kumar is a graduate in both physics and philosophy.<br /><br />We begin of course with Max Planck and his discovery of quantum theory at the turn of the century  then move swiftly on to the Swiss Patent Office clerk, Albert Einstein. Danish physicist Niels Bohr is the next to move to centre stage, though many of the supporting cast, like Rutherford, Thomson, and Soddy, are discussed as the story unfolds. And so Kumar works through the cast methodically giving each player credit where it is due.<br /><br />A key feature of the book, as the title indicates, is the different views of matter held by Einstein and Bohr. This issue takes up several chapters in the middle of the book. The EPR thought experiment is discussed, as is its verification theoretically by John Bell and experimentally by Alain Aspect. Bohr's vision of complementarity, and the massive contributions to quantum mechanics of Pauli and Dirac are all explained in simple terms. The amount of mathematics in the book is trivial, for those who find the subject intimidating.<br /><br />You'll learn about as much quantum physics as most high school science students from this book but if you want more detail you will need to turn to other books. Frank Close's little Very Short Introduction for Oxford on Particle Physics would be a good place to start. For more detail there's the Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by A.C. Phillips. Kumar's book is primarily about the scientists involved and he brings them to life very well. There are a dozen pages taken up at the end with a useful Timeline of relevant events, a Glossary of terms, and copious Notes and References. For what it sets out to do, this is an excellent book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0192804340 Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction]], a Glossary of terms, and copious Notes and References. For what it sets out to do, this is an excellent book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0192804340 Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the variety of games in this app. Needing to unlock more makes playing motivating. Good to fill or pass time.
B00004CZIZ|2.0|The product mentioned that it was for all regions but I couldn't play this particular disc in 3 different players, a reg dvd player, a blue ray player and an xbox player.  We tried a regular movie in them and it worked fine.  I'm not saying there was anything bad about the disc but I shouldn't have to change country codes just to watch it then switch it back to watch other movies.  There was no reading material in there either, just the disc which I found kind of odd.  No matter though I'll just find another one.
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|I was so looking forward to this movie. The commercials looked awesome. Unfortunately, the lack of a good script, terrible acting from Kristen Stewart, and funky, creepy dwarfs ruined it. There was no chemistry between Snow White and the huntsman - the characterization was glazed over at best. We're told Snow could inspire people to follow her, but why? Kristen Stewart does her usual fly-catching, mouth-open, blank-eyed gawping about - nothing about her portrayal of the character would inspire anyone to do anything but find something else to watch. I didn't expect or want silly dwarfs, but these guys were just dirty and creepy and weird, like little pedos. The huntsman had the most potential to be an interesting character, but his dialogue quickly ran out of steam. The evil queen and her brother were the best characters, but not enough to pull this stinker out of the hole. I would have been so happy if this was still a flawed but fun movie, but unfortunately, I couldn't wait for it to be over. A big disappointment.<br />Update: I watched this again and bumped it up a star. On the second viewing, I liked it better. I still wish they'd given Snow White a LOT more personality and dialogue, but those visuals are worth an extra star.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|This collection is a powerhouse both of cinema magic at its best and a marvelous tale of why the whole world is enthralled with and desires the \\"American Dream\\".  We never tire of watching.  Thank you Martin Scorcese and the entire cast!  Bravissimo!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games...some very challenging..love the extra bonus cash....great for adults and kids of all ages. Downloaded fast...all games are fun.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|best game on kindle fire. hours of fun for me and my kids, we like to compete to see who is better
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great free app. Kids like it and do so I. Easy to learn. Well worth the free cost. some of the free apps require annoying in app purchases - not this one. No ads or annoying sales pitches for upgrades.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|300 is a very good action movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat & I was able to root for the good guys (unlike many of the flicks coming out oif Hollywood). Free shipping is also a plus - pricing was incredibly worth it for the entertainment value I recieved.
0812550706|5.0|I've seen this book many times in the bookshops I've frequented through the years, and have picked it up once or twice to buy it, always putting it back down. I'm glad that I've finally read it. This is a classic book that should be a must-read for everyone, along with Madeliene L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time.<br /><br />This book is amazing, and heartbreaking. In the beginning, Ender is six years old. I have a 6 year old and I watched her as I read it. I couldn't imagine putting my 6 year old through some of that book. On the other hand, Ender is so far advanced, at such a genius level, so beyond the word \\"gifted\\", that its easy to believe you're reading about a much older child or teen. The way the adults in the book manipulate the children is cruel and heartless...understandable given the situation, but heartless and cruel noetheless.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about Ender, and how he kept his humanity throughout the book, instead of becoming callous and unfeeling. The end had me in tears and wanting to read the next book immediately, Speaker for the Dead.

1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens never shied away from telling the truth - at least the truth as he saw it - and when he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in June, 2010, he started \\"living dyingly,\\" writing about his experiences with the illness. The stoicism with which he wrote, and the lucidity in the face of immanent death (\\"there is no stage 5\\"), go very well with the way Hitchens faced the rest of his life. Having only recently completed a memoir, Hitch 22, and on his book tour when he had symptoms which led to his diagnosis, Hitchens realized that he needed to tell the story of this cancer as he had just told the story of his life.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Hitchens' writings, you'll certainly recognize the trenchant approach here to becoming a resident of \\"tumortown.\\" In this brief book, composed of essays he wrote for Vanity Fair, Hitchens explains what it feels like to be dying, yet doesn't feel sorry for himself or for his lifestyle that may have contributed to his cancer. (His father died of the same cancer as well, so part may be genetic.)<br /><br />You'll read this book in an hour or two, but you'll also want to come back to it from time to time. While the chapters are composed - these are articles, not journal entries - there is a spontaneity throughout them, as his condition worsens, and as hope seems to recede.<br /><br />Hitchens again shows with his words that cut like scalpels that he was one of the finest voices of his generation, and we're not likely to see another like him for a very long time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is not the type of book I normally read, but I found it very well written, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. And it was enticing enough that I have now also finished the sequel Catching Fire, and will be ordering the third one in the series!
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|As it weren't enough that Toscanini, to use that overused word, was a musical ''genius,'' his humanity merits special commendation. He left LaScala and indeed, his beloved Italy, when Mussolini took over and kept his vow that he wouldn't return until the tyrant was gone. Contrast that with the egregious opportunism of Furtwangler and Karajan, in Nazi Germany, who rushed to accept jobs no longer available to Walter and Klemperer, and others. (The Penguin Guide disgracefully refers to the ''poetry'' Furtwangler coaxed from orchestras ad infinitum. I can't imagine how anyone who operated in Germany with Hitler's personal approval can be said to have any poetry in his soul. Same goes with Kempff,a Penguin favorite, who a biographer wrote tellingly, more than just benignly accepted Hitler.)<br />  Musically, what can one say except that this box is sublime. Toscanini loved the war horses, both in opera and the symphonic literature, but also championed lesser-known composers. That his tempi are usually quick bothered some critics but was always historically accurate as could best be determined by Toscanini. Not for him, grandstanding to the audience by staring to the heavens for inspiration. He was faithful to composers' intent and conducted what was on the page.
B004I744AS|5.0|I have a large vocabulary and I read older books like Burton's Arabian Nights.  The dictionary bundled with my Kindle Fire contains none of the words that I need defined.  Without this dictionary I would be chained to my copy of The Oxford Unabridged.  When I am connected to wifi I find the Encyclopedia invaluable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app its so addicting. I play it all the time. so halfbrick you rock with fruit ninja and jetpack
B002VWNICC|5.0|Great movie, great actors.  Debated for a long time about picking this up, but no matter what it is a good movie to see.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ratings convinced me to download (with healthy skepticism).  I consume stories at rapid pace rarely finding great ones.  This is a great one. The series pulled me rapidly into a different world and inspired my imagination.  Alongside the characters, I felt the emotions of determinations, anxiety, elation and inspiration.  Adding another 5 stars to the many.
B0084YAU86|5.0|This episode blew my mind. It's so incredibly emotional and it just so eloquently sums up why I love this show. If the mark of a good tv show (or episode) is that it makes you feel something, then this episode is truly great. No matter how many times I watch it, I still find myself sobbing by the end.<br />This also basically sums up why I love Doctor Who and Sherlock, and therefore Steven Moffat, but also curse Moffat for the emotional turmoil he puts me through :-P
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am always looking for new videos to add to my workouts - since I go to the gym and teach dance 5 days a week I wouldn't use it daily.  The 3 different levels makes it a great workout to rotate - clear instruction - various levels.  I would recommend this workout for those trying to get in shape and to add to an existing workout.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Very difficult to read tiles. Use of bolder/thicker outlines needed. Average play. Nothing stands out to distinguish from all the other basic mahjong titles.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|this game is well worth it. don't miss this one, you'll regret it. makes me remember the old glory days of PC strategy games!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Despite being a Mills and Boon with great sex, it is an educational tool for both men and women. The heroes are idealist and aspirational figures. She is a virgin, a hard working student and good loyal friend to many. He is a successful business person and mega rich; the appearance of the 'perfect man'(ha, ha). Underlying, is the constant reminder of his dreadful early years and how an abused soul becomes the abuser. There is some depth behind this story and it leaves you wanting to read the sequals, which I did.<br />PS It does have a happy ending!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is quite entertaining and difficult to break away from. you ate forced. there. are lots of games to play which the maker strategically coerces you into playing.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|I usually don't write product reviews, but this product just wasn't what we thought it was going to be and I ended up returning it.  The blocks are not cubes like in Minecraft.  They are teeny-tiny and flat.  The box is very small and sooooo not worth the money.  If you are expecting lego's that take on the persona of the game, this just isn't it.  Lego missed the mark.  Very unfortunate considering the whole Minecraft game is a bunch of cubes!  Only reason I gave it two stars is because of the mobs...they were well done, but these are lego's, so without good building blocks, what's the point.
0061726834|5.0|It is well written and I love the idea of the author. In this story, love is a disease. The author tells you the symptom which would terrify you if you lived in the society where love is said to be a disease.<br /><br />Lena, the main character in this story belives it. She is excited to be cured from the disease until she meets a boy and they start falling in love..<br /><br />I can't tell what happens next, because that would spoil whole excitement of reading it but I guarantee you that this is an amazing read :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It plays wonderfully on GS3, I haven't had a single issue with it and I'm on level 72 after playing on and off for the last couple days. Another great game by HB!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game.  so much fun. I recommend this game. is ease to play this game. is always a challenge to create your village
0142420891|5.0|It has been 3 years Mia left Adam. She has went off to Julliard which was her dream. We see Adams struggles and how he see Mia through his eyes. He is a Rock Star in a band that is touring. He still hasn't healed from the hurt that Mia left him with. He has lost her, and doesn't completely understand why. He is angry, lost and full of resentment. Adam kept his promise to Mia, every time I think about his promise to her my heart aches. The lyrics Adam writes is so tortured and full of rawness, you see how much he is holding inside. He loves her, and has never stopped even through all the pain. Mia has been studying at Julliard and is very well on her way to be a famous cellist. She is still learning to deal with the loss of her parents and brother. But the anger she still holds is tearing her up.<br /><br />A chance encounter brings Adam and Mia together. While wondering around New York, they have a chance for closure on everything that happened. Their time together is full of tension and emotions as they open up about what really happened between them. We follow them through their memories of the happy times they had together and a break up that just makes you feel so sorry for Adam, it was no wonder he was so broken. When Mia finally tells Adam why she really left, my heart broke for him. This story just get right under your skin and you just want to fix them both, especially Adam.<br /><br />Where She Went take us though the journey of two young people who have been through hell and back. A journey of loss, love and putting the pieces back together. This is a beautiful story that leaves you breathless and it couldn't have ended any better. They finally have closure and can move on. It's not a picture perfect, or fairy tale ending but one with hope for the future and one filled with love for two people that deserved it. This is a must read.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of cars or racing, Senna's enigmatic story should capture your attention. I love this movie and you will too. The race footage is beautiful and you can truly see the machinations churning in Prost's face in this Blu-Ray classic.
014241543X|5.0|Mia is a young girl with an amazing talent for music. She has an amazing and supportive family, a hot boyfriend that likes music just like her. Tragedy strikes, leaving her in ICU fighting for her life. She is looking at her life from the outside. We watch her go through so many memories of her relatives, her parents, brother and her memories of her boyfriend Adam. Her flashbacks are both raw and emotional. Only Mia can decide whether to fight for her life or let death take her. Adam is an amazing guy, he does everything possible to be able to get in that hospital room to see her. His love for her showed through out this. His time with her while she was in the hospital was so sweet, and heart braking. His promise, oh his to her was the most selfless and beautiful thing I've seen. He is just an all around good guy.<br /><br />Mia's memories of her parents are so sincere, she loved them so much. They were so laid back and supportive of her in every way. Her little brother was the cutest thing ever and he definitely loved his big sister. She had so much going for her. Up until the last page, I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what she chose.<br /><br />This was a hard book to review, it covers of death and loss and that is always an emotional one. This is written so well, that you feel so connected with Mia through her journey. It is full of raw emotions, and you feel them too. This tragedy has brought so many people together, and shows us the strength of family. It is a beautiful story of loss and love. It is one that you'll not be able to put down. I would recommend reading this. But definitely have Where She Went close by.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am obsessed with finding the perfect path. Not too easy, not too tough. The last row on the original Quell was impossible without the clue but it was fun trying.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is, by far, the best book series I've read in a while! I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of reading these books. There was a lot of sex, but at least it was some hot, steamy sex!!! Loved it!
0618918248|1.0|It certainly does make a nice, warm fire.  Other than that quality it doesn't really serve much of a purpose.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I have never wanted to make and eat sushi as badly as i did after watching this movie. Each person's passion of just doing their job made me just a little jealous.<br />A must watch if you like food or documentaries.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i started this triligy because my daughter said it was good. I don't normally read this kind of book but i got hooked immediately. i'm 1/2 way thru the second book and my housework is suffering
030758836X|5.0|If you're reading this review and have not read the book I highly recommend you stop. Not because I'm going to talk spoilers (which I am NOT going to do) but because you shouldn't read any reviews about this book. There's so many plot twists that if you happen to catch one of them in a review you'll ruin reading the book for yourself.<br /><br />That being said- Gone Girl IS fantastic. What starts off as a romantic marriage becomes a missing person case and then becomes something else entirely. A lot of reviews have spoken ill of the ending saying it didn't do the book justice. In my opinion the ending absolutely did the book justice. The last paragraph entirely summarizes the theme of the book.<br /><br />I wish I could write more substantial of a review- but I won't want to go ruining this book for any one who comes across this. That being said, sit down and prepare yourself for an amazing page turner.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using this app 4 years ago. love it. Help to organise my stuff and keep everythings online
B008D28HYS|5.0|If you liked the original, you'll love this one! I really enjoyed the first CrossMe and this one adds the aspect of color which makes the pictures/puzzles more fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I particurlarly like this site because it cuts to the chase! It takes me directly to weather in my area without all sorts of fluff.
B00000ITOY|5.0|This is a great little shape sorter. It helps little ones learn shapes, colors, counting, sorting, stacking...and on and on.  I have seen many kids under 18 months easily master this, so it is a nice substitute for an early puzzle that will not be too frustrating for a little one to do on their own.  However, I have also had 4 and 5 year olds happily play with it too.  We love PlanToys, they are so durable and we are not as worried about the wooden toys going in anyone's mouth.  This toy will easily last to be passed down to even grandchildren, provided you can keep track of all 16 pieces!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an exciting and very challenging game.  love the graphics.  It really makes you a part of the game.
B005FISBTO|1.0|We love this show, and my fiancee and I have been so excited for the release of season 6, so we ran out and bought it the day it was released.  Wow.  I wish we would have waited and read the reviews on here before we popped in that first disc, only to see the entire season finale SPOILED in Showtime's stupid 3 minute long promo for every show that has ever and will ever air on the station.  And of course you cannot skip it, or even fast forward it.  No!  Then how would they force you to watch the final 6 seconds of the season you are about to start watching?  Oh, and it gets better, in case you happen to somehow miss it on the first disc, it's also on the second, third and fourth disc.  STUPID!!!  What marketing MORON made the call on this one?  It's like showing the end of a movie in the trailer.  IDIOTIC! It ruined the entire finale for us.  Thanks Showtime marketing geniuses.  Great job.
B0000024W3|3.0|Bob Dylan<br />Self Portrait (1970)<br /><br />  The first track (\\"All the tired horses\\") points to the trouble ahead: with lush orchestration and some girl group singing the same line repeatedly, with no Dylan to be heard.  The album does get better after that (as Dylan does sing on the rest of the album, well, on most of the album), but this is not one of Bob' best.<br /><br />  This is not a bad album, but it's not a good album either.  This one just chugs' along aimlessly with little energy and little purpose.  Apart from \\"The Mighty Quinn\\", there is nothing here to catch your attention.  This is an album to play in the background when you are busy doing something else.<br /><br />  This would not be the last time that Dylan would make an album during a time when he was fueling up on different genres, which usually resulted in excellent albums afterwards, but the refueling albums always seemed to be lacking the kind of entertainment value that his fans came to expect.  In other words, these refueling times were necessary for Dylan but it was far from necessary to share that time with his fans on records like this.<br /><br />  This is an OK album.  Three Stars (3 ½)
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The best thing is that you can go underwater and its free so I recommend this game to you awesome.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|The game is great and is a very good opponent. And you can always undo a move, which makes it even better for you to step up your game.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|I really and truly loved this book. For me, parts of it were a little hard to visualize in my mind because the world the author creates is quite different from that of our own, but I found what little experience I have from traveling in Southeast Asia were helpful in that aspect. If you enjoy the dystopian genre, you will definitely enjoy this. If you want to imagine what our world could be like a few generations after we've run out of fossil fuels, you will love it. Also, the characters in the book are very relatable, I find myself still thinking about them from time to time.<br />FAIR WARNING: There are some parts that are quite explicit and not for the faint of heart. Personally, I did not think they were that bad. If you could stomach the rape scenes in The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, then you can definitely handle this.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I've owned the DVD for several years and ordered the Blu Ray version just for the improved video and audio quality. I had high expectations and am overall satisfied, however just be aware that the video and audio quality do not match that of a modern day film. It is after all a 47-year-old film and in that regard is very impressive! After watching the Blu-ray version you'll never want to watch the DVD version again. When factoring in the film itself, the best musical of all time, I have to give it 5 stars.
B005LAII58|1.0|Oh how I long for the day that 'sly' stallone and arnoldnator hang their movie careers up. Watching these old farts take out scores of fodder is just absurd and pathetic. I could take out 10x the amount with even better action moves if I directed myself - it's really that easy to do.<br />What is not easy to do is write a good movie however, and expendables 2 has a terrible script. The in-jokes are lame, the plot and characterizations grate on my nerves, and the finale is a complete letdown, between van damme and staOLDlone.<br />Hopefully the box office will drop off enough to prevent a third offering.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Among the greatest books I have ever read.  Jonathan Franzen is a genius.  The characters and story are plausible and highly engaging.  I was overcome with emotion at many points.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love the original cross me and was planning to buy color when it became faotd!  I am not disappointed.  If you like puzzles and logic games you will love CrossMe original and color.  Works beautifully on kindle fire.  I have not noticed any additional permissions.
0439023521|5.0|What a surprise!  I had no idea what The Hunger Games was about before I read it.  As a result, it was a welcome surprise to see the book take such swift turns from the beginning set-up to the city and then into the games itself.  The book is much darker than I expected for Young Adult fiction, but Suzanne Collins' characters and the hope they embody overcomes the darkness.<br /><br />After reading the first book in the series, I had to immediately follow-up with all the others.<br /><br />My recommendation:<br />5/5.  This is a must read for anyone craving adventure, excitement, and relationship building!
B0063IH60K|4.0|@very easy and fun to play. can play this game for hours.<br />practice makes perfect and this game makes it so easy and fun to perfect your game.
0756405890|5.0|A breathtaking, insightful, fantastic adventure. Easily in my top 5 favorite books of all time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I could go on and on about how much I appreciate this book and the series, but I will keep it short; in a word, outstanding.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The plot is good, but it was bogged down with about 200 pages of senseless drabble. I'd often forget what point we were working towards!<br /><br />Example: Matthew spends time with Hamish at a hunting cabin...they have whiskey/wine.....go scout for deer all to sit for hours. The point of the hunting trip, I don't know...no one ate or killed anything. Then we have to read about red, yellow and white billiard balls for Hamish to FINALLY bring up \\"the Witch\\".  Pages and pages of blah blah blah, all before we get to the issues at hand.  This happens several times throughout the story (the blah blah blah).<br /><br />Oh....and don't get me started on the wine!<br /><br />When you muddle through all the unnecessary, the plot was good. It just took a lot of patience and reading to get there.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|finally! they made it!! this is just like the original. AND ITS FREE!!!! I thought it wouldn't be, cause that sometimes happens with the amazon store,  but its not! GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B008BIN9EW|4.0|Nice turn-based strategy building game.  Graphics are good and game play is easy to learn.  &quot;Campaign&quot; mode is really just a tutorial to familiarize players with the three races and their capabilities.  I would have liked to see more of a storyline there and more campaign levels.  I have not tried online play yet.  Overall good game, but could use some more solo/campaign content.
B004J4X32U|5.0|Main conclusions (in Ukrainian):<br />Фізична і соціальна активність - основа для інтелектуального розвитку. Поки дитина ненавчиться ходити по сходам, лазити по деревам, складати кубики і конструктор - їй не потрібно вчитись читати і писати. Дитина повинна навчитись спілкуватись з іншими, володіти своїми емоціями і мати в першу чергу розвинутий емоційний інтелект - розуміти себе, співвідносити з іншим світом.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome. It sucks kindle fire app store only has 2 halfbrick games. 1 game halfbrick should add is Monster Dash because it is 1 of the greatest games ever made by half brick. This game is a great time waster.
055357342X|5.0|The best fantasy novels are the ones that take you on a journey that feels not so much magical, as natural. George R.R. Martin's Storm of Swords is one such example. That is not to say that there aren't strange, magical forces in it or at least strange Middle Age brutality. But it works because it is done in a way that feels real; that makes this world ours. Martin accomplishes through a variety of techniques: modernizing the Middle Ages, colloquializing the royal tongue, and giving readers realistic dialogue. In the end, though, these all just make his series accessible. What makes it addictive is his use of characterization.<br /><br />Martin does three brilliant things with his characters: First, he doesn't limit the narrative focus to one character but instead, captures nine different perspectives. He even ventures down the creepy incestuous route to bring us the perspective of delectable villain, Jaime Lannister. Through multiperspectivism, he does the same thing that in my opinion, made the television show LOST so innovative: in place of one dominant perspective, he gives us multiple narratives that challenge each other.<br /><br />The second is moral ambiguity. He gives us characters that are deeply flawed; that straddle the boundary between good and evil: a murderous little noblegirl, a heroic dwarf, a soldier gone Wildling, a Kingslayer who starts to doubt: all of which is are truly bold, risky moves, and yet we love Martin for them.<br /><br />And finally, the best part of his writing: character development. I love the way his characters change, sometimes for the better, sometimes not, and sometimes where we honestly can't even say what's going on, other than they are sure as hell different. Which is exactly how it is, if you ask me. Jaime, Dany, and Jon come immediately to mind. But then there's also Tyrion and Arya, characters who I felt pretty confident I had figured out, only to have them surprise me.<br /><br />So yes while we certainly have some clear enemies--Lannisters vs. Starks, evil vs. good, civilized vs. wild, the facts is we also have some strange new relationships emerging: Arya and the Hound's bizarre relationship: loathing each other and yet not killing each other, Jaime's respect for and even kind of feelings for Brienne, Jon Snow struggling with his vows and morals as he falls for Ygritte, the Wildling girl, Bran and his journey with these prophetic swamp kids, Dany's bond with her Unsullied warriors, or the bizarre finale with King Stannis and his fiery sorceress seeking support from all places, the Wall.<br /><br />All in all, Storm of Swords is something else. It is living proof that fantasy literature can be more than just clich&eacute;d sword fights or at its best, modern-day Tolkiens. If anything, what is clear is this is not Tolkien. And nor does it try to be. It is its own invention, a blend of history, politics, espionage, slavery, magicality, modernity, and best of all, worlds: a blend of different people's worlds. If getting lost in one story doesn't make you gravitate toward this book, then how about getting lost in several? For one thing is sure: it is not a battlefield Martin is creating, so much as a labyrinth.r enemies--Lannisters vs. Starks, evil vs. good, civilized vs. wild, the facts is we also have some strange new relationships emerging: Arya and the Hound's bizarre relationship: loathing each other and yet not killing each other, Jaime's respect for and even kind of feelings for Brienne, Jon Snow struggling with his vows and morals as he falls for Ygritte, the Wildling girl, Bran and his journey with these prophetic swamp kids, Dany's bond with her Unsullied warriors, or the bizarre finale with King Stannis and his fiery sorceress seeking support from all places, the Wall.<br /><br />All in all, Storm of Swords is something else.

Cuz I don't want my little sister exposed to this…well…shit.<br /><br />do not buy if:<br /><br />1. you hate sex (especially in the media)<br />2. you are smart enough to read words<br />3. you love great books (like the ones by Rick Riordan and/or J.K Rowling) because this will probably be an insult to your integrity.<br /><br />HEY MEYER GET A F$@%*# CLUE!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you need to know what is wrong with the book read the other reviews cuz im not real good at reviews.<br /><br />But parents, use all means necessary to keep children away from the content in this trash!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A little too racey & sexually adverse for my liking. I like real literary works that have well-developed plots. Sex alone, especially deviant sexual acts involving bondage, pain, etc., fails to qualify as serious reading.  I would not recommend \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" to a friend.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is the best Disney movie ever made. Period. Mulan is a girl who follows her heart and is brave enough to carry out what she set out to do, which is to save her Father's honor. The Disney magic is added to the film as she falls in love while learning her worth. Magic or coincidence? You can decide for yourself, but this really is the best Disney movie ever made.

0345802934|3.0|1Q84 was my first Murakami book.  I couldn't take my eyes off the hardcover title in the library.  I'm glad I picked it up.  I love his writing style, the way he takes interest in the mundane things in life, especially cooking.  The characters in 1Q84 are very likable and quirky and the storyline has some fantasy / science fiction, both of which I normally don't read but liked here.<br /><br />This book is absolutely awesome in places and there's enough I think to warrant reading it through. It picks up about 2/3's through when a third narrator (weird disturbing/interesting detective) enters the rotation.  But the book was too long for me and seemed to need a good edit.  Then again, it is very atmospheric and the repetitiveness and day in the life storyline seems purposed to build its own little world.  I have a feeling it probably reads better in Japanese.<br /><br />P.S.  I bought both the hard-cover and paperback (boxed 3-book set) versions before I read it all the way through.  I don't regret it, because not only will I probably re-read it, but the design is absolutely fabulous on both.
B0071BY2OG|4.0|This is the fourth installment of the series pertaining to the Motorcycle Grand Prix racing. The movie is basic enough that my wife can easily follow along while I remain enthralled every time I watch the movie. Yet I know there is more information that can be included in the DVD.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Heard everyone talking about it so figured id give it a try.  Not disappointed in the least. Suspenseful all the way through. Second book also<br />Great. Third one coulda been a little better. Movie was good but lacked the detail and suspense of the books.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|In an age dominated by \\"singers\\" who rely on auto-tune and without it sound like a braying hound, this band really stands out.  The lead singer has a great voice, and they actually do harmony (which is something of a lost art in this decade).  They do use auto-tune sometimes, but it is used more like an instrument than a crutch because they don't use it all the time.  Most of the songs have interesting lyrics.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the harmonies on a few of the songs sound a bit similar.  But most of the songs are very creative.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Definitely would watch again and again. I loved the special effects. Will be purchasing this one for my video library. Hope there is a sequel! :-)
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave is a fairy tale about coming of age, much like Snow White.  Disney's Snow White produced in the Thirty's was a landmark cinematic achievement.  Brave shows that animation is still the ticket for fairy tales.  I love Celtic folklore and the mystical highlands of Britain and Ireland in general.  This movie is perfect for me.  If you enjoy Celtic legends and fairly stories, this movie is absolutely for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A book that keeps your interest and leaves you breathless. You feel like you are there with each character and anticipate the next page and next book.

0761158820|5.0|My 10-year-old daughter worked on this for hours a day, for days on end, until she'd made every single monster. I can't believe how well it kept her attention, and I am searching for more books like this, but I'mnot sure what to look for exactly. It is great and you won't be disappointed.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great product, the battery lasts over 8 hours, the mic is very clear and the sound is amazing for games.
B00006G8HX|3.0|This is for the two-disc special edition, which I would recommend as well worth it for the included bonus features. I just re-watched this film, and it was actually better than I remembered. Not perfect, mind you, but really pretty decent, and at moments even great. What I like the most about Star Trek III is the Vulcan mysticism. Some of it is difficult to rationalize or conceptualize, but I like that about it. They are aliens, after all. This film has a spiritual mystique and beauty to it that I find really compelling. There are also a handful of truly iconic, cinematic moments, both in terms of spoken dialogue and images. While this one does not measure up to its masterful predecessor, Star Trek II, there is a line spoken by Kirk in the final scene that surprisingly and movingly answers the climax of that film, which I consider an ingenious touch. I will also say that I liked the portrayl of Uhura. These movies are always better when more crew members get real scenes for their individual character development.<br /><br />Now, to what I dislike about this film. There are in my opinion a few too many moments of \\"silly humor\\", and some of the Starfleet characters are not as serious in portrayal as I think they should be. Some of the plot elements here and there are a bit hard to buy, maybe a little cheap in terms of storytelling. Christopher Lloyd seems \\"off\\" as a Klingon. He does not disappear into the character, but rather comes across as Christopher Lloyd playing an unusual Klingon. The big disappointment though, for me, is that Kristy Alley did not return to the role of Vulcan Lt. Saavik. No disrespect intended to Robin Curtis, who assume the character for this film, but it is just not the same. Alley's character smoldered with a scene-stealing charisma that made everything around her more compelling; Curtis' portrayal somehow does not achieve the same effect. And my other disappointment is that the incredibly cool starship Excelsior was not utilized in a more dramatic way. It ends up making a cameo; it could have made this film more thrilling as a plot device.<br /><br />Not the greatest Star Trek film, not the worst. Definitely worth owning if you are a fan, in particular as the middle installment of the \\"trilogy\\" of films Star Trek II-III-IV, which are tied together by a nicely continuous story arc.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I would consider this eminems worst album but his worst album is still 5 stars to me. Amazing lyrical talent
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Enjoyed watching Serenity after watching season 1 of Firefly.  I hate that they cancelled Firefly after only one season.  The Serenity video a little dark (filmed without a lot of light)in places.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Please look at the reviews online before you buy this. You have to hold your tongue just right to get charger in the magic mouse.  THen it keeps coming out.  Finally completely gave up. Going back to my batteries.  I do wish the magic mouse had a better battery life.<br /><br />One year later,  tried again with another one.  I got so discouraged with the magic mouse running out of batteries.  The Magic Charger is no better.  Why do people keep buying this?
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am an apple shaped over weight mid to late 40's female.  I have been eating healthy for a couple of years and aside from ankle surgery in 2010 I have been very active.  I spin, I jog, I cycle, I do some circuit training.  Over the past few years the weight has been silently collecting around my mid-section.  I ramped up my workouts, dropped my calories down to 1400 a day and ate more whole grains.  Instead of losing weight I continued to gain. In addition to the weight gain I have been having memory problems lately..forgeting where I put things and struggling for the right words.  I was getting pretty scared.  Last Sunday I downloaded this book to my kindle and read 80% of the book before going to bed.  Monday morning I decided to eliminate grains.  I also decided to lay off the exercise because I figured I would be tired and cranky.  I weighed myself Monday morning and measured my waist and hips.  Today is Saturday.  Since Monday I have lost 4.5 pounds and 1-1/2 inches off my waist and 1 inch off my hips.  By Wednesday I felt like I was in my twenties again.  My mind is clear and I feel at ease.  No other way to describe it.  Aside from a mild headache and some calf cramps I have not had any serious withdrawal symptoms.  In addition, my constant hunger and cravings have gone away.  I feel like I have a new relationship with food.  Food is meant to nourish my body and I am savoring it instead eating to try to satisfy some craving.  I feel like Dr. Davis has saved my life.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater after seeing that it had a 90-something% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  (both Audience and Critic rated it very high)  and it lives up to its promise.  Other people have gone into the details so I won't bother, except to say that the cast and acting is exceptional and everyone should see it.  I'll be getting it myself the second it hits stores and you should too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great way to pass the time if you have the patience!! I really like the frog game! idk why people are giving it a one star.
B004EPZ02A|4.0|I bought this because I actually like the Paranormal Activity series. This is exactly what you can expect from the series and not too far from what we have seen from this genre in the past. They do a good job of creating a realistic family going through some horrifying events. If your prone to motion sickness this isn't for you. I bought this when I moved into my new house, needless to say I was on edge from strange noises for awhile.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got the original CrossMe when it was the FAOTD several months ago. It's become my go to game. I've been eyeing the color version for some time, but just couldn't stomach paying 4.95. Was so glad to see it free today.<br /><br />This is an extremely challenging yet rewarding game. I highly recommend it.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, DVD. This movie is good to watch with the whole family. It does teach a lesson about caring for the world around us and not abusing it for selfish pleasures. Very colorful and fast moving for the younger ones and good comedy too! The kids enjoy the songs too.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The show is great... we all know that... But this season really shows the growth of a criminal mind and what it can be capable of doing.  This season pushes the accelerator and really pushes the limits of what one man with lung cancer can actually take on.  Great show and I can't wait to get the next season for my collection as well.

1476712042|5.0|SYM: Abby is a good girl. She has good grades, and dresses as such. She tries hard to blend in and go unnoticed, until she meets Travis Maddox the bad boy heart throb of their college. Travis tries everything in his power to make Abby notice him. Even though abby notices him, Abby ignores the hottie-with-a-body with everything she can. Until one night Travis makes a bet with Abby she just couldnt refuse. If he loses he'll go with out sex for a month, but if he wins Abby has to stay with Travis for a month. Will this bet bring them closer together? Or break them further apart?<br /><br />REVIEW: Beautiful disaster had me hooked by every cover it has. This book calles to me, it said \\" Stina you want to read me!\\"  And I really wanted to with all my being. Abby is fighting ao hard to stay away from Travis it makes you wonder why. But then again he has a bad temper. To me the story felt real and as people pointed out it might set bad standards for girls and boys. I on the other hand feel it was a story of love that can't help but to fight its way through. Haha....and Travis will find his way. Like i told my sister in law i was looking through the book for quotes and it made my blood boil to think about this imaginary boy! I give this book five***** stars because i can and i stayed up all night reading it and falling in love with these characters. Abby has real situations that some people can relate to. Travis also has elements about him that I can sympathize with. It made me fwel real emotions and its unforgettable.<br /><br />QUOTES: A pair of heavy black boots stepped in front of me, diverting my attention to the floor. My eyes traveled upward; jean spattered with blood, a set of finely-chiseled abs, a bare. Tattooed chest drenched in sweat, and finally a pair of warm brown eyes.<br /><br />\\" Sorry about that pigeon.\\"<br /><br />\\" Ah! A smile I'm not a rotten bastard after all.\\" He winked<br /><br />\\"Would you like to make a wager on that Abby Abernathy?\\" He smiled, his eyes animated.<br /><br />Travis' mouth spread into a wide grin. \\"If you win I'll go without sex for a month.\\" I raised my eyebrows and he smiled again. \\"But if I win, you have to stay with me for a month.\\"

B007URVZJ6|4.0|If you are looking at this (free) Kindle book, then you are likely planning to publish a book for the Kindle platform for the first time.  As an author (or soon to be author), your time is precious and you don't want to be wasting it reading a book that won't get to your end objective.  So let me give you the quick run down.<br /><br />* The book is fairly short.  So while that is great in terms of not needs a few weeks to read (you can read this in a day), it is also very high level.<br />* The book is focused on users who will write/convert from MS Word.  While that is fine for me (I'm an MS Word user), this may not work for everyone<br />* The book is also biased towards Windows users.  I'm a Mac user.  Is this an issue?  Well, maybe.  I had issues with the hyper-linked table of contents (TOC), which is critical in Kindle books, and I still can't get the built in Kindle TOC working (which requires making an NCX file - the book does not tell me that nor does it say how to make one).  However, this is a limitation with using MS Word 2011 on the Mac with Kindle publishing.  I can't completely blame the book for that.<br />* General formatting is the main benefit of this book.  It does a good job explaining how to property format MS Word for publishing to Kindle.<br /><br />So, should you get this?  If using MS Word 2011 on a Mac, I know the TOCs will be an issue for you (at least at the time of writing - who knows when Amazon will fix it).  However, I don't know what resource will be better.  (FYI - to at least fix the internal TOC, first complete your book (using the Headings to mark the sections you want to index, then insert a TOC, and for each entry use the Insert --> Hyperlink function and link to the appropriate Heading).<br /><br />If you are a Word user on the PC then this will likely fix the bill well.<br /><br />If you don't use MS Word, then you may want to find another resource.<br /><br />If you want to preview my poker book, check it out.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can see what all the hoopla is about this book...it's soft-core pornography that you can discuss anywhere. However, in my opinion it is highly overrated. The author writes like a 7th grader and if you won't admit to  reading simply for tittilation you're kidding yourself. Not a fan.
B000QCSA54|4.0|While this is a fairly short book, it is a worthwhile read for anyone who is self-employed and/or entrepreneurial.  Seth explains the difference between quitting when things are too hard (those who don't succeed), quitting when you are going in the wrong direction (a habit of winners), and explains that winners recognize when they are going through a \\"dip\\" and need to keep motivated and work through it.
B00846REIS|3.0|Well, well I was quite disappointed with this book. I had high expectations which were definitely not met.<br /><br />First of all, I could not connect with characters. I did not hate them, I did not love them. I just could not connect with them. Secondly, everything was happening too quickly with not enough explanations. I had a feeling that author did not spend enough time with building the engaging storyline and something was missing all the time. Moreover, I was expecting some really juicy scenes but to be honest, there are so many other books with much hotter scenes out there. But overall, the book was OK, it was enjoyable enough to make me finish it with no problems and I will probably continue with series to see where the story goes.<br /><br />And one more thing. Everyone compares this book to Fifty series. There were definitely plenty of similarities but for me it was only poor imitation of Fifty Shades. And while I liked Ana, I found Eva really irritating and naive. And even though Gideon is described as sexy possesive billionare, he was lacking some charisma from my point of view. Maybe I should not compare this book to Fifty series, but I just could not help.
B00004U45G|5.0|Jimmy Page and the Black Crows made for an extraordinary show. If you want to get your Led out with a twist, this is it! My only regret is that they don't play together more often. This CD is a classic. Don't miss it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is a charming and emotional story with unpredictable storyline. This book is beautifully written and I was grabbed into it right from very beginning. I have never been fond of poetry and to be honest I have never truly understood it. But I was completely mesmerized by slam poems in this book. I got really emotional just by reading them and I wished I could see people perform them too.<br /><br />There is so many powerful life-stories in this book and I had no other choice than to love it. But I have to warn you. Slammed is realistic story and real life is never easy. So do not read this story in public. It is such a moving and touching story that I really had troubles to stop my tears from falling very often.<br /><br />I felt so much compassion for all the characters in this book. Especially, I love Lake's relationship with her little brother Kel. And I liked being in her head. She was a real person with her ups and downs, never annoying and I perfectly understood all her feelings and actions. Also, I had to like Will. He is a true sweetheart and responsible person which makes him a very lovable and good man.<br /><br />There is a lot of heartache in this book. But there is so much more love. I cannot even explain all the emotions that I have experienced while reading this book. All I can do is sincerely recommend this book to you in case you have not read it yet.<br /><br />My favourite quote and wisdom from this book:<br /><br />  \\"Push your boundaries, Lake. That's what they're there for.\\"
B004Q8FTE4|5.0|I have always loved these cd's. Def not music you listen to at the beach or in the car. These cds are for critical listening.  The Box set is pretty cool. Although it is lacking. Not really a problem as I have these cds from the original release. Radio Kaos sounds much better...also the live cd sounds much better with enhanced low end. Pros and Cons and Amused to Death were perfect when they were released...although I notice a bit of an enhanced stereo image. I am listening to these cd's through a Rega Apollo...I guess it just depends on your system...as with most remasters... playing them through my 1994 sony es cd player reaps less rewards.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read various controversial reviews on this book. And since I really liked Providence series by Jamie McGuire I decided to give this book chance and to see myself what all that fuss is about. And I am so glad I read this book because style of writing is amazing and engaging. Beautiful Disaster is exactly that kind of book which you cannot put down until you read it all. Some people were complaining in their reviews that story gives a bad example considering violence and gambling. But this story is fictional and people read fictional stories to escape from reality not to learn how to live their life, don't they?<br /><br />The story was set in college and focused on non-traditional relationship between Abby and Travis. I did not find their relationship dysfunctional and I think that they were perfect for each other. Their relationship was wild, intense, sometimes really crazy but it definitely worked. And it made excellent story which I trully enjoyed. I was never bored when reading Beautiful Disaster and I am looking forward to read whole story from Travis point of view.
1878424319|2.0|It has been about 6 years since I read this, but I have had a few recently recommend this as though it is a masterpiece. My response was \\" I agree with the four agreements but I don't like the book at all.\\" I get some strange looks and responses but its more like common sense to me. I totally agree that you can just read the cover and get the message just fine. Intentionally went to the one and two star reviews because for me it seemed so basic Reminders are good because life can make things feel more complicated  but I do not consider the wisdom ancient at all.

It starts a little slow though, so be sure to at least get to level 10. That's when you can start trading cards.
B0073QYC2G|5.0|This replica is awesome, it was more than I expected when I opened the package. It has a cool kind of rubberish feel to it. My son loves him and has been played with (it always beats the other ones). It has a very cool paint job that makes him stand out from the rest of my son's dinosaurs. It is pretty big too, which is accurate because this dinosaur was very big. Overall this figure is all around awesome!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I am completely addicted to the first version of this game and was hoping this would be just as good. I was not disappointed, I am now addicted to this one as well, great faotd!
B001AQO3XS|5.0|This movie has me hooked from the beginning with two great actors (Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery) who both provide an amazing performance throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />This movie is about a group of people around the world who are, for reasons unknown, immortal unless their head is cut from their body. This gives that immortals \\"power\\" aka strength to the victor.<br /><br />One day their are called to do battle in a far away land until their is only one remains, and the winner gets supreme knowledge and an unkown power which can spell doom if it were to fall in the wrong hands. So Connor Mcleod (played by Christopher Lambert) is fighting his greatest challenge. The Kurgan, an immortal Connor met in the 1500's who activated Connor's immortality.<br /><br />This movie is just a feast for the eyes, and was very impressive in the mid 1980's and is still very impressive to this day. The video quality is amazing and this picture is highly enjoyable.

B008TRUDAS|2.0|I bought this book after all of the 5 star reviews and this is what Amazon recommended for me.  I honestly thought maybe the recommendation was based on the books I buy for my 12 year old sometimes.  I have read some excellent books in my life this is not among them.  Its not among the good books.  I gave it two stars because i thought maybe a 13 year old would like it as I beleive that is the level it is written to.  I wish someone would have said it was YA or juvenile.  I kept reading thinking it was bound to get better.  It doesn't.  Save your money or buy something by Laura Llippman or someone, at least you will be guaranteed a good read.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Why would anyone choose to chase away her doubts and demons with such a bruising and dangerous trek? As I followed along with her, I realized she was not only getting rid of that self-doubt and angst, she was crafting a new career as writer. The book more than held my interest. She is a very good writer, and I really look forward to reading her next book.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|The original Matt Damon BOURNE trilogy is probably the only trilogy of films I've ever seen that got progressively better as the films went on. Doug Liman's THE BOURNE IDENTITY is pretty darn good, and Paul Greengrass' THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is excellent, but Greengrass' finale, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, has become one of those films that I will watch every time it's on. It's just that good. But the unsung hero of all of those films was writer Tony Gilroy, who wrote (or co-wrote) the adaptations to all three previous films and is the co-writer/director of this film. He was smart enough to adapt the books for a more modern era, and make Robert Ludlum's novels cohesive and spry enough to work on the screen by stripping them down to the essentials. When the finale of the BOURNE series hit theaters in 2009, it seemed like a shame since A: star Matt Damon said that he would not return to the role if it wasn't directed by Greengrass and B: Universal would be losing a very lucrative and critically-pleasing franchise. Now, whether doing a Jason Bourne-less BOURNE film was something of a studio decision, or if Gilroy felt that there was more story to tell about the shadowy government programs that birthed agents like Bourne. Either way, we were given THE BOURNE LEGACY, a film that does what it proposes to, but not what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />From the opening moments of the film, we are given a recognizable image: a figure floating in the water, immobile. But it starts to move and swim and we are introduced to Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), an agent of Project Outcome, which is either the progenitor of agents of Treadstone or Blackbriar, or is one of the newer kids on the block. While he is at a training facility in the wilds of Alaska, all hell is breaking loose at the CIA. Eric Byer (Edward Norton), the head of Project Outcome is looking to destroy all evidence of his program due to the chaos that Bourne unleashed on the agency at the end of ULTIMATUM. This leads to several agents of Outcome being killed, but Outcome isn't just deep-cover agents; it's science. Via gene therapy, each agent takes \\"chems\\" that alter their intelligence and strength; it doesn't make them superhuman, but it does make them better than your average agent. All the research involved is done at a secret facility within a pharmaceutical conglomerate, and one of those doctors is Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). When the call comes to remove the evidence, all of the researchers are killed except Shearing, and all of the agents except Cross. If we just look at the formula of the BOURNE franchise, it's obvious that these two are destined to meet and form a reluctant partnership based on the mutual needs of the other. With Shearing, she needs Cross to protect her. With Cross, he needs Shearing because he needs his chems so that he can remain strong enough and smart enough to protect himself and her. This leads her to a crash course in Tradecraft 101, leads him to see how he dreads becoming what he used to be, and leads everyone on a collision course.<br /><br />From here on out, there's going to be some SPOILER territory, so be careful.<br /><br />As I was watching the film, there were a great many small moments I appreciated; the nail in the fire extinguisher, whatever Cross was doing with the electrical wire and the passports, the use of the laminant on the airline safety cards to create a fake ID, etc. I also really liked the people in it; I think that Renner did a terrific job with what he had to work with as a character. When we see who he was before, it's easy to understand why going back to his previous level of intelligence scares him. He's an effortlessly physical actor, and I appreciated the way that both he and Gilroy differentiated his character from that of Jason Bourne. Cross is inquisitive, talkative, charming and allows himself to be fun, as opposed to Bourne's eternal ennui of identity. Same can be said of Weisz and Franka Potente, but where Marie wasmore or a free spirit and a passionate woman, Marta is more rigid, a little colder and more fearful because she knows who's out there and I daresay gives her a stronger arc than Marie. Sadly, while I love both Renner and Weisz, I didn't feel a great deal of chemistry between the two. Norton, while still being very good, sadly is very underutilized in this film. He's basically a less screen-active David Strathairn from ULTIMATUM; eternally frustrated with his plans going awry but still calm and seemingly a step ahead. He has no room to breathe, performance-wise, but that's less to do with him and more to do with the script.<br /><br />The script isn't bad, but it's not good either. Gilroy is an extremely gifted writer and perhaps an even more gifted writer/director as evidenced by the phenomenal drama/thriller MICHAEL CLAYTON and the breezily entertaining espionage rom-com DUPLICITY. But this, co-written with his brother Dan, while exposing us to some new ideas also doesn't bring us many new things. It also lacks the big moments. I liked the introduction of the idea of people like Bourne and his ilk actually being medically enhanced (there's a moment early on where it's pointed out that Bourne was actually the first agent of the program to go as long as he had without the chems, but it's quickly glossed over because this isn't his movie any more) and that the science behind all of this doesn't seem so unreal. The scene at Marta's home is extremely well-done and executed. It had genuine surprises, real tension and some very deftly choreographed action. I also admire the way that this film tried to get away from some of the formula of this franchise, but in doing so, it abandoned some of the things that made it so successful. The first is a lack of a formidable physical antagonist. Where all the previous BOURNE films had that one BIG fight that may have only taken about four or five minutes of screentime, you were breathless for those moments. This film doesn't have any of those; it just has the mini-moments where Cross is fighting multiple opponents, and while that's neat, it doesn't have that impact. You do get something like that in LEGACY, but it becomes a motorcycle duel, and it's just kind of blah. Second, it lacks a mental antagonist that Cross can effectively match wits with. Third and most importantly, it lacks any real emotional journey. Bourne has three films with at least three different journeys of the soul: With IDENTITY, it was literally identity-driven; with SUPREMACY, it was vengeance; with ULTIMATUM, it was the search for truth. With LEGACY, we have fugitives-on-the-run complex where the film gives them the reason to run, but it gives them no place to go to, and that essentially ruins the ride. Does that make the journey entirely not worth taking? No, but it doesn't really give us any reason to want to see what happens with these characters either after the credits start to roll.<br /><br />Where the film also trips itself up is with all the new ideas it introduces. There's a lot of story they try and pack in to this one film to get it to where they think it needs to progress, but none of it really seems organic.<br /><br />While there are certainly worse ways to spend an evening, THE BOURNE LEGACY, while having some really good ideas, has far too little to offer the brain and the heart to give you the satisfaction of a good film.<br /><br />2.5/5 starsmore or a free spirit and a passionate woman, Marta is more rigid, a little colder and more fearful because she knows who's out there and I daresay gives her a stronger arc than Marie.

B002RI9SC4|4.0|I dont know why everyones saying its easily the worst book they read.I wish someone would just give them fifty cent and tell them to ring someone who cares.If youre interested in things a little gorey and romantic, then youll like this book.But I do admit, Jacobs chapter half bored me to death.The rest was fine though, I didnt find it gorey at all.Meyers' writng could have been better though, more vivid discriptions etc. All things considered, I thought the book was quite good.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I must say I was 50 shades of addicted, however I must admit that it is no literary masterpiece. It is not very well written, but the story line kept me turning pages. The biggest flaw is the repetitivesness in not only the word choice, but the nature of the sex scenes. The best thing about it is the characters and their development throughout the 3 books. I would reccomend this book to my friends.

It was fast, inexpensive, and convenient.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie is overall the best summer i've seen all year. I went and saw it twice just so I could grasp everything it was trying to say. It has been awhile since I've seen a movie with such depth. It's dealing with questions of who we are, and where we come from - and it's not preaching religion to you, it's dealing with deeper ideas, so that was refreshing. Fassbender as the android was one of those characters that only comes around once and awhile, and that you're blown away by; he was perfect for the role. I thought it was the best film of the summer, yes, even better than Batman. The CGI is unbelievable; I saw it in IMAX 3D, and good lord, I had goosebumps due to a couple of the scenes.<br /><br />TLDR version: deep questions, yet easily accessible; great characters, especially the android; marvelous CGI - i'm talking about the best in a film to date; and a story that indeed leaves some questions unanswered, but I think that was the point - i'm just crossing my fingers for a sequel. I can't wait until October 11th!
159562015X|1.0|I can't believe that I paid $25.00 for this when you can take the Myers-Brigg's test for free online. It didn't tell me much that I didn't already know. And it is frustrating that you can only take the test once. I wanted to take the quiz again just to make sure that I got the same results. I also wish that they provided you with more information about your secondary strengths. Especially as four out of five of my key strengths seem to be synonymous with one another (i.e. Input - you like collecting information, Intellectual - you like thinking about big ideas, Learner - you like learning new information, and Ideation - you like coming up with big ideas.) Yeah, that's real helpful. This book is a RACKET and a WASTE OF MONEY. Google \\"Myers-Brigg\\" test instead, and save 25 bucks.

0679746048|1.0|Terrible book.  I have yet to find ANY other book to say this about...but it was the first time I have ever preferred a movie over a book.  Although the issues introduced and were varily touched upon...they are very serious and important issues.  The problems with the book starts with the fact that the \\"writer\\" writes at about a fifth or sixth grade skill level.  Although she varily goes in to depth about any of the issues including the main characters issue...what makes it even worse is that it was not spell checked nor grammatically checked.  No...I can not find my comma's...etc..we are talking misspelled words as simple as depression.  I have to say I was Very Surprised to see any positive feedback...unless it is by someone under the age of nine...the skill of the \\"writer\\".  The movie is wonderful...I know some of it was casting but most of it was because they added in depth information about each illness as well as other issues diseases and much more intricate details in general.  Do not waste your money unless you are very young and suffering...then ask your parents to watch the movie with you.  God Bless

1455502758|5.0|Other reviewers have already made comment on this book's overall structure. This is a fine reprinting of Hitch's award-winning essays as he approached his final hour, so there is no new information in most of the book. In his inimitable way, he draws you in not only with his fine prose, but his humanity. You can't help but feel pathos in this work. And where the emotion ends, he lines up the last words and wisdom of so many other literary figures as evidence for his case on \\"dying livingly.\\"<br /><br />What makes this book worthy to add to your bookshelf is the final chapter, the unpublished scribblings of Hitchens which give us a window not only into his final thoughts, but perhaps how the master crafted his essays...first as an idea, then a polished quip or two. For me, these classic one-liners and Hitch-slaps are worth the price of the book. The final tribute, by his wife Carol, gives us more insight into the private man than he allowed himself in his memoir, Hitch-22. If there is one error, it was made by Hitchens himself, who lamented that he might not live to write the obituaries of his villains--Kissinger and Pope Benedict. In fact, he had already done so in his canon of work, from \\"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\\" to \\"god is Not Great.\\" In these works, he managed to in fact, have the final word on Kissinger, Catholicism, and many other sacred cows that are \\"dead enough\\"--as he might have quipped. He now joins the pantheon--pardon the word--of past great critics, from Twain to Mencken. For the literate, he will always live on. Overall, A moving, swift read that will linger in your mind long after the last page.

B003JTHXOK|2.0|I was reminded in reading this book that being a best seller does not guarantee a quailty read. The story, characters and writing were pretty superficial, simplisitic and predictable. If you like good writing (as in a real art form)and character development, skip this book.

B0065GC0BA|4.0|I probably would never have picked up this novel had it not been highly recommended to me - admitting that I normally prefer a good thriller over most blurbs containing the phrase \\"a love story\\". However, I am really glad that I did, because the story grabbed me after the first few pages and drew me into its spell until the very end.<br /><br />The story is told mainly in the first person through the eyes of Louisa Clarke, a spunky and very likeable woman in her late twenties who has recently lost her job in a caf&eacute;. Living in a working class household with her parents, elderly grandfather, younger sister and nephew, money is always tight, and Louisa's newly unemployed state sends the whole family into a panic. Undaunted by the fact that her employment prospects as an unqualified worker are very poor, Louisa sets off with her usual positive spirit and humour to hunt for a job. After several failed attempts at different positions and now desperate for an income, she reluctantly takes on the position as carer for a young quadraplegic man from a wealthy family background, Will Traynor.  As an unlikely friendship between these two very different people slowly develops, it will challenge both their beliefs and boundaries and in effect change their lives in ways neither of them would ever have expected.<br /><br />I found Louisa's voice refreshing and engaging, and could picture her vividly in my mind, wearing her bumble-bee socks and bright green shoes. It was impossible not to like Lou, and her positive outlook on life and humour offset the more serious undertones of the novel. Seen through Lou's eyes, the issue of euthanasia became a wake-up call rather than a cold and remote headline in some newspaper: \\"Hey, this could happen to me or to someone I love.\\" Humanised in such a way it challenged any pre-determined views I had on the subject, despite having been exposed to this issue in real life before. And whilst I did not really like the few chapters in the novel where the voice briefly changed from Lou to other characters in the book, Will's mother's perspective really touched me. What if Will was my son and I was helpless in the face of his suffering?<br /><br />I felt that Moyes tackled the issues in this story with great sensitivity and understanding - whilst they will not reflect everyone's point of view they will challenge the reader to critically examine any pre-formed prejudices and gain a deeper understanding of human nature and the tough choices we may have to face. If anything, the book reminded me not to be a judge, but to always  strive for empathy - we can never fully comprehend what another person goes through.<br /><br />There were a few points in the story which did not really work for me, like the event in Lou's late teenage years which made her abandon her plans for the future - to me this seemed artificial and unnecessary and didn't fit with her personality. I also thought that Will's sister Georgina was a little bit short-changed in the story, and could have added a bit more to the whole euthanasia debate. However, I am nit-picking now ... I loved this book and will fully recommend it just as it was recommended to me.the voice briefly changed from Lou to other characters in the book, Will's mother's perspective really touched me.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|I have to say that Prometheus was one of the biggest let downs in film for me in years. I was expecting it to be a true prequel to Alien and was beyond disappointed after the film ended. The horrible acting, numerous plot holes and general lack of scares had me leaving the film with to many unanswered questions and a general feeling of being let down by what i was hoping to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies in years.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Seriously, this is not about food, s much as it is about the qyalities required for excellence.  It is an excellent interview with a man who is credited with being Japan's number one sushi chef.  It is very well presented.  The cinematography is excellent.

B00006L90T|5.0|I just watched this movie again on IFC and checked with Amazon, (of course!), to see if it's in DVD format.  I can't believe there is a version available in color!!  That wrecks the movie!  I really enjoy this movie because it's one of the only 'horror' films made in the late 50's/early 60's, (this one in 1962),that didn't involve something to do with radiation.  Don't get me wrong, I love them all but this one was a refreshing difference.  I will most definitely be ordering a copy!
1933633867|4.0|Conventional wisdom about money and debt is shattered with this book.  Elaborate credit systems have been used for more than 5,000 years.  Arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates for centuries.  The book deals with current trends and events that revolve around individual and national indebtedness.<br />The history of debt is a must read for anyone who wonders how and why debt is created.  A surprise may be in store for the reader
B005LAIHGI|5.0|This is my favorite Sasha Baron movie. It is foul, gross and packed with tons of toilet humor. All the ingrediants we have expect from a Baron movie. This is not a movie the critics will love but I thought it had some funny scenes. If you loved Borat, your going to love this one.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm really not sure why this game has gotten so many bad reviews. I have had no problems with it. Let me make something clear: you do not have to spend real money! Acorns are something you can earn and collect. Save them up to buy something in the game! Also, it is not necessary to shut off your kindle to exit the game. All you need to do is press &quot;Stuff&quot; and the bottom bar will appear. From there you can click the home button. It seems as if most of the people writing the reviews got frustrated and and never really tried to figure out the game. That's really too bad because this game is actually quite fun. I have been enjoying it thoroughly :)
0439023491|4.0|Fascinating how and why so many middle book in a trilogy are a touch disappointing. I experienced that feeling with the second book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy, as well as with this book -- though I must admit that Larsson's book ended with a bang, as does Catching Fire.<br /><br />I read The Hunger Games after I saw the movie, and I liked the book even better. But I usually make a point of not reading reviews which give away important plot points, and so I deliberately didn't read any reviews about Catching Fire or Mockingjay, so that I could come to the books without knowing much about what was going to happen. I much prefer that: it allows me to experience the story as the author intended me to experience it. So, what I expected from Catching Fire was threefold: (1) I thought we would learn more about the other districts in Panem; (2) I thought President Snow and the Capitol would, in order to get rid of Katniss, force her to participate in the Hunger Games again, then arrange to have her killed off by the other tributes, or by the Gameskeepers; (3) because we got to know Peeta in the first book, I expected that we would get to know Gale in this book.<br /><br />How did my expectations compare to the book itself? Expectation #1: we learned a tiny bit more about the other districts, but in reality not much. We did learn that they were rebelling. I wanted to know more, but I can accept that Katniss and Peeta were closely guarded and not permitted to speak to people from other districts.<br /><br />Expectation #2: I was finding the first third of the book interesting but not riveting: much summary, not much action. And then the author met my expectations about Katniss having to fight again, but on a much higher level than I anticipated, and so I was very pleased with this plot development because I thought it reflected what an entrenched privileged power would do: try to smash every last hope the people have, so as to quell any spark of life or rebellion. Collins' plotting exceeded my expectations, and I was thrilled with the developments. I also liked the unexpected sea-and-jungle setting of the games this time around, and I liked the alliances being formed. However, the game action seemed perfunctory, something to happen quickly, and in a way, off-stage. This slowed the pacing of the games section. I did like getting to know some of the other tributes, and thought their introduction and their roles were well done.<br /><br />Expectation #3: I was disappointed that we didn't get to know Gale in any depth at all, and I was even disappointed that Peeta remained pretty much the same as he had been in the first book. We see that Gale has changed, but I didn't see a change in Peeta. There's a slight change in Katniss as she comes to admire those who defy the Capitol outright by speaking of revolution. But Katniss herself is a touch disappointing here: she comes across as more naive than she should be for a 17-year-old who has lived what she has lived. I would expect somebody in her position at this point in the plot would be a bit quicker on the uptake, a bit more able to intuit and reach conclusions (as when Plutarch showed her the watch with the mockingjay).<br /><br />These disappointments aside, I still enjoyed the book a lot. It flows quickly and in a very logical (and dire) direction. The people of the districts are heroic in their resistance against the draconian Capitol which enslaves them. I am looking forward to the final book!otting exceeded my expectations, and I was thrilled with the developments.

0062197258|5.0|What turns a carefree, club-hopping girl with lots of friends into an anxiety-ridden, OCD-driven loner?<br /><br />Meet Cathy Bailey, still recovering from a horrible relationship with Mr. Wrong, otherwise known as Lee Brightman.  He swept her off her feet in 2003, when she first met him working as a doorman at a nightclub.  Four years later, she is unable to leave for work or come home without obsessively checking and re-checking her doors and windows. She no longer has friends, and she's even reluctant to go to work functions.  When Stuart Richardson, a clinical psychologist, moves in as her new upstairs neighbor, a tentative friendship begins - one that may help her overcome her anxiety and beat her OCD.<br /><br />This novel shifts from past to present, but not in a jarring fashion.  As we read about Cathy now, we learn about Cathy then, when she meets a charming, handsome man and falls for him.  As he begins to turn a bit creepy, we see how she almost gets out of the relationship, but allows him to charm his way back to her through her friends.<br /><br />This novel perfectly captures the terror and helplessness of domestic violence -  the man who appears so charming to others and is a monster at home.  As a former battered woman turned counselor (for a period of time), I can say from personal experience that the horrific picture painted by this novel is so very real and true-to-life.  That niggling voice that's telling a woman that something just isn't \\"quite right\\"?  So easy to overcome - you must be over-reacting, especially because your friends are SO wishing that THEY had such an attentive boyfriend.  Does it feel as though he's invading your space?  Checking on you too much?  Is he actually FOLLOWING you or did he just happen to be in the same place at the same time?  Maybe you're just being selfish and paranoid.<br /><br />Until the day you realize that you weren't.  You weren't over-reacting, you weren't being selfish and paranoid.  But now it's too late -you're trapped because trying to leave is much more dangerous than staying and you only have one chance at escape.<br /><br />I wish I could say more about this novel without spoilers.  Lee is a horribly creepy, believable, deserving-of-hate villain.  Sadly, there really ARE people like this in our world, and the damage that they cause goes much more than skin-deep.<br /><br />Reading this novel is more than just getting lost in an absorbing story - more than page-turning - more than an \\"OMG .. what's going to happen next?\\" experience.  It is also a psychological thriller that will leave the reader with a better understanding of the issue of domestic violence and hopefully a better understanding of its victims.<br /><br />QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy):<br /><br />Some weekends are good; others, not so.  Certain dates are good.  I can only go food shopping on even-numbered days.  If the 13th falls on a weekend, I can't do anything at all.  On odd-numbered days, I can exercise, but only if it's cloudy or raining, not if it's sunny. On odd-numbered days, I can't cook food, I can only eat cold things or heat stuff up.<br /><br />\\"Catherine,\\" he said, his voice low, shockingly calm.  \\"Don't make me do that again, okay?  Just come home on time, or let me know where you're going.  It's simple.  It's for your own safety.  There are some really dangerous people out there.  I'm the only one who's looking out for you, you know that, don't you?  So make it easy for yourself and do as you're told.\\"<br /><br />I'd always thought that women who stayed in abusive relationships must be foolish.  After all, there had to be a moment, a realization that things had taken a wrong turn and you were suddenly afraid to be with your partner - and surely that was the moment to leave.

B008645YEE|4.0|Some of the tracks are insanely short.<br />My favorite tracks are 3 Gotham's Reckoning, 7 The Fire Rises, and 13 Imagine the fire. Most of the rest of the tracks come and go without me paying much attention to them.<br /><br />I don't think the soundtrack is Han Zimmer's best work, but it's decent and even wonderful at certain points.<br /><br />$10 is a fair price to pay for a CD like this, but if you can get the individual tracks for a cheap download, that might be a better option. 3,7,and 13 are worth checking out.

B00138FAZ8|5.0|Love this beautiful score by Rachel Portman. However, I am really getting sick of Amazon posting original movie soundtracks \\"without\\" listing the composer's name anywhere in the credits. This is the third soundtrack this week that I've come across on Amazon that did not list the composer. I think the composers deserve visible credit for the beautiful music they've writen, don't you Amazon?
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Very good movie. One of the best in my opinion. Have watched this at least 15 times already. You would deffently want this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|By the third book in this trilogy, the reader's attentions and affections are still tightly focused on the main hero and heroine, Peeta and Katniss. The action and the intrigue never wane, as this story is as captivating at its' end as it was in the very beginning.

Great book for 'sheltered women' or old fashioned women. But I do have to say that I will still continue the series, because the psychological aspect intrigues me, but the rest I could really do without.

0439023513|5.0|From reading other reviews, people just don't understand it appears.<br /><br />First, for those that haven't read the book, it's a very good read. The entire trilogy is great. The third book was actually my favorite. I'd give the trilogy 5 stars as a whole and say read them. You won't regret it, even if you don't agree with my 5 star rating at the end.<br /><br />--- SPOILERS ---<br /><br />For people saying they weren't a fan of this book because of how she basically all but removed Peeta from the story, it gave the book a whole new meaning. It was pretty clear, at least to me, that she was going to pick Peeta all along. From the very first book, I knew it would end like that. Well, once I flipped over the cover of Mockingjay and started to read, the author was actually able to fool me into thinking Peeta was really done and Katniss would either die, kill him, or end up with Gale instead. Peeta really was the hope throughout the entire trilogy. He was the reason Katniss looked so great and he was the reason she even mattered at all. You take that away and it actually leads to a really good read. It left me holding my breathe as I flipped through chapter after chapter.<br /><br />As for Prim dying, it signifies she actually fails, so the ending of the trilogy isn't really meant to be too happy. The whole reason the plot to the story developed was because Katniss had to save Prim from the games in #1. She eventually did save her and kept her safe all the way up until the finals bits of #3. You actually felt like her main goal would be accomplished, but she falls short in the end, which I doubt many people saw coming. So, yes, she does kill snow and overthrow the capitol. She does end the games and district 12 semi returns to normal. But her goal from the beginning was to save Prim and she failed.<br /><br />I thought the author ended the trilogy in an almost perfect fashion. Made you really believe Peeta was finished, only to have him come back at the very, very end. We all knew she couldn't keep both boys, and Gale not even being in the same district with her in the end signifies that as being all too true.<br /><br />So, to finish it up, the story ended on the right emotion. Defeated, yet hopeful. She seems incredibly depressed, because she is. She ultimately failed her first mission, to save Prim. The book did end in a darker fashion, but it gave the reading that little bit of hope for Peeta and Katniss as you close the final page.<br /><br />I loved it and people should look deeper into the book instead of just writing it off because Peeta doesn't get as much mention in this book as the other two.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|The people that came up with the idea to make this movie the way it was made are geniuses. Playing with colour, shadow, etc. Totally cool and brings out the awesomeness of the movie, scenes, actors, actions, etc. Bluray is so freaking clear, I finally know what black really looks like.

B004EPYZQ2|5.0|The kids in this movie can act WAAAYY better than most of hollywood actors/actresses combined. The scene with Elle Fanning made my jaw drop when I watched it in the cinema.  The train wreck scene alone is worth buying this bluray for. To me, this is not a kids movie. As for special features, they made it so fancy that it became annoying. They should have included a \\"play all\\" function so I dont have to keep selecting clip after clip (each clip is only a few minutes anyway). In the end I just gave up and continued with another bluray (Platoon; which I also wrote about; awesome movie+bluray). Buy this bluray (Super 8). Platoon too.
0061120073|5.0|Hi Jayne,<br /><br />I recently reread \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" and as I closed the back flap of the well worn cover, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. This book is at the top of my Book List of Favorites and is perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.<br />I don't want to spoil even one page of this miraculous novel for the new reader, so I won't divulge any particulars. (I find the less I know about a book, the more charming and surprising it's potential is.) I will say it is a young adult novel about a girl and her family in the poorest of New York neighborhoods around the turn of the 20th century. Mrs. Smith parlays feelings of innocence, yearning, grief, love, loss, hope, beauty, joy, childhood, family dynamics and how it feels to live in poverty so deftly, one can never forget this book.<br />In our current \\"recession culture\\" this book is more timely than ever. Families are being ripped apart and children are growing up faster than before due to economic strains. While this book is set almost one hundred years ago, and some of the situations seem slightly archaic, the feelings are all still the same. The ability to protect a child and provide them with a happy and safe childhood is every parent's aspiration and the inability to do so is devastating. But as with any good book, it shows the the dark and light sides of any situation. Simply put, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.<br />Read this book as soon as you can. It is the bitterest of sweet and sends the message that hope, as symbolized in the tree, sprouts eternal.

For me it's any CSI show that has come out in the past few years on steroids, and I am not a huge fan of the genre. Cumberpatch (Holmes) and Freeman (Watson) were excellent choices for this series, their acting is superb and they are great modern day versions of this dynamic duo. I cannot wait to see and hear them this holiday season 2012 in The Hobbit! Sherlock is a must see!

B000MQC9H4|4.0|Two young women on different continents, eager to get away from reminders of their just-concluded love affairs, find each other on a home exchange web site and decide to switch houses for 2 weeks over the Christmas holiday.  --But don't worry, it's not about Christmas.  Kate Winslet is Iris, a society columnist at a London newspaper, of modest means and plain appearance (not that Winslet could be anything but handsome; but her hair style was deliberately unbecoming).  Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a Type A producer of movie trailers in L.A. who makes loads of money, lives in a multi-million dollar house, and dresses to the nines.  Of course Amanda couldn't possibly have fit all those clothes in the bag we see her dragging down the road to Iris's house (they were gorgeous, though).  Iris is really on holiday, ecstatic over the swimming pool and huge dvd library, while Amanda is too much of a racehorse to calm down in Iris's quaint little stone cottage at first.<br /><br />Jude Law was sweet as Graham, Iris's brother who knocked on her (now Amanda's) door to use the loo late one night, and found love.  Didn't care for the way he and Diaz were directed.  Even Law overacted in spots.  Jack Black was actually pretty good as Iris's love interest Miles--when he remembered to act.  I've never much cared for his shtick, but his likableness is undeniable. If he would just learn to control his eyebrows.<br /><br />The two actors I couldn't take my eyes from were Winslet, and Eli Wallach who played the ninety-year-old former Hollywood screenwriter living next door.  Not that these were Academy Award caliber parts, far from it.  But you could just see the quality these actors brought with them.  They couldn't help it.  Gemstones glowing amongst the costume jewelry.<br /><br />It's a fairy tale.  Introduced with a voiceover by Winslet in a sad-sweet soliloquy on love at the year's ebbing, it ends with four very nice people loving the ones who deserve them, at the start of a hopeful NewYear.  Fairy tales are always pat; that's why we love them.  I liked these characters and wished them well.

Don't buy until your toddler has very clear idea of different objects. This book can be used only as a reinforcement tool, not as an instruction book for first timers.
1596912863|4.0|\\"...I don't usually read much contemporary romance, but I can't resist one that's centrally themed around Austen's novels and characters, especially when basically it's a book about people LARPing (and paying out the ass to do it). It's fairly short (I intended only to begin reading it last night, but ended up staying awake and reading it straight through), and about as fluffy as I expected, but I enjoyed it. Once Jane gets to Pembrook Park, it was a lot of fun guessing which characters from Austen's novels were being represented, and at one point, they stage a theatrical similar to the one put on by the young people at Mansfield Park. There were a lot of moments where I laughed out loud, like when a new guest shows up, making the gentleman-to-lady ratio a little uneven, and Jane declares emphatically that she refuses to be the Fanny Price. If you've read Austen (or at least seen the film adaptations, I guess), then you'll probably guess a lot of what is going to happen long before it takes place, but that didn't really ruin the story for me...\\"<br /><br />For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:<br /><br />[...]
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I read this book to see what all the fuss was about and if I have to be honest, i was a little disappointed. Was it a book that I couldn't put down? No. I could easily wait until I sat down to read at the end of each day. Aside from the fact that in our perfect world we would all love to be married to a sexy billionaire, it is poorly written and very predictable.  It was the subtle changes undergone by both the main characters, Ana & Mr Grey, and not the detailed sex scenes that finally hooked me into the storyline. I fully intend to read the next two 'Grey' books as I always like to finish a series...and as I mentioned above...am now hooked into the storyline, although I have already made my predictions as to which directions the story will take.
B008D28HYS|5.0|The tutorial was a tad confusing, but once you start playing the game you quickly get the hang of it. In fact the first easy levels make you think oh this is too easy, who couldn't do this and you zip through the puzzles. Then they get harder and that's where the strategy comes in and you have to figure out what squares need to be marked in the row so that the columns also turn out right. It's fun to see what picture develops as you play the game. Often part way through the game you know what the image will be but even then you are left wondering how to complete it.<br /><br />As for permissions I believe the developer has explained what they are and do above and beyond the call of duty and I'm frankly tired of good games being unjustly rated by paranoid reviewers. I'm more concerned with what CVS and the grocery store chain do with the data they collect from my rewards card purchases than if a game developer is capturing my mother's phone number or tracking how often I play Tetris.
B004BBDHEK|1.0|Words cannot explain my dissatisfaction at how very unappealable this album has turned out to be. I honestly gave it a fair shot- turned it on daily for a month, but I no longer feel like I'd want to listen to this again. I had huge expectations given what was advertised on yanni.com only to turn out to be totally disappointed. Very subpar.
B00005JPMZ|4.0|TMNT is a somewhat underrated kids animated movie. It resembles the style of the 2003 series and at the same time it is a loose sequel to the \\"live\\" 90's film trilogy.<br /><br />I grew up on the original cartoon and movies, and I bought the this DVD to go with my collection. I have only watched it twice. The movie is cute for younger kids, but older fans may not like it as much. There should have been more action at the ending fight scene. Overall, the movie felt like an expanded episode of the series. It should have been made direct to DVD instead of on the big screen.<br /><br />The movie is not a complete letdown as it is fun to watch.
1933633867|5.0|I found this book while searching through Amazon and have been very pleased with the scholarship.  The thesis has been properly described already.  The account is fluid, well researched and challenges many of the presuppositions currently in play in economic theory and political theory.  The last section of the book details a historical analysis of several underlying principles in play in free market economics.  This part of the book is really for scholars because the level of detail often is very dense.  I would recommend this book for anyone, especially in the current political and economical climate.
0439023513|4.0|This review contains vague spoilers<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />SPOILERS<br /><br />My thoughts on this last installation in the series are mixed.  I could nit pick fine details, but for me there are only two key issues (although they arch through the entire book) that plagued my overall enjoyment of this book, padded with some very strong moments.<br />Primarily, the pacing of this book was off from the beginning, though it took me a while to pin that fact down.  At first I chalked the difference in voice and pacing up to Katniss' addled mindspace.  About a third of the way into the book it hit its stride and I finally hooked into the story. In the second section the pacing is even if not brilliant, then in the third section seems to stretch out laboriously and somewhat needlessly.<br />It isn't that I thought the book needed to be shorter; rather, it needed to be smarter, tighter, more consistent.  The first two installments of the series were very economically composed, artfully, even. This book just doesn't have that care and crafting in its telling, and I missed that.  I needed that poignant voice to cope with how dismal Katniss' circumstances were.  Sadly, that wit never came.<br />The other aspect of the writing that lost me was in the waning development of Katniss.  Three books of her exploring her emotional capacity and whether she can open up enough to feel safe and intimate with another human being are sealed with a two-paragraph resolution.  Mockingjay builds an interesting study to see if the stoic Katniss of The Hunger Games can determine for herself if she is indeed that emotionless.  Despite her ambiguity in feelings, we have shared her every thought, every suppressed emotion from the beginning.  The story isn't about whether Katniss gets revenge, or whether the Capitol or Rebels prevail, it's that she comes to some sort of internal peace.  Regardless, we don't have that epiphany with her.  After taking this long journey inside Katniss' perspective, instead of getting to feel it we're told what her life became.  That's an omission that leaves not just this last installment, but the entire series unrequited.<br />At the point that everything goes badly in the Capitol's streets, I emotionally disengaged.  I knew by then that as grim as things were, there would be no resolution worth me staying so wrapped in the story.  That was the real tragedy for me.  I wanted to be with it til the end, but I found no ending to stay with.<br />It isn't that Collins left the ending ambiguous.  I'm fine without happily-ever-after.  In fact, I don't find those kinds of partings fulfilling.  I buy that Katniss' life could have turned out as described.  What I can't buy is that Collins abandoned the ending, leaving it lifeless and uninteresting.<br />A few random comments:<br />If you like tension, it's copiously doled in the third book.  No, the writing isn't on par with the other books and it isn't as cleanly developed, but when it comes to suspense, Collins still hits her mark.<br />Considering that Katniss' life first derailed at her father's death and ensuing emotional absence of her mother, that relationship went intensely undeveloped.<br />Collins made great, subtle use of Prim.  This was a wise move, and while Prim was never a major character, her impact was profound.<br />The realization that by being conscripted into the Games, Katniss becomes part of the system is intense.  By undergoing PTSD and having to kill to survive, she can't escape the system.  The only way out is to break the system, which means to some degree becoming what she's hated.  Accomplishing this level of mature theme in YA is impressive, and something that no other author in the genre has.<br />While this particular installment didn't strike me as polished as the others, the series is amazing, powerful, evocative.erspective, instead of getting to feel it we're told what her life became.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is the FM transmitter for the car I've tried. I like the ability to use a USB drive. The signal is stronger and clearer than the last two brands I used. The ease of access to the controls and viewing of the display can depend on where your cigarette lighter is positioned. On my Subaru, it is difficult to see the screen with the lighter to the right and positioned low. On my Ford Focus, viewing and access to the controls is excellent. I have had one experience with MP3 files converted from CD that skip (played from USB drive). I did not convert the files, so I do not know what might have happened, but they do play OK on an MP3 player. It seems to be related to the MP3 encoding. Other than that one instance, all files have worked well.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not as erotic as book 1 but good.. Learning more about the characters. Sexual antics still very accurate. Should be required reading for all men before they get married. Required reading for women so they can properly set bar for their men.

0553582038|4.0|First - a warning. It only seems fair. I'll not be putting spoiler tags around so if it happens that you do read this review you might stumble upon something you didn't want to know anything about. Nevertheless, do not fear kind reader - eventual spoiler or two isn't gonna be anything major. Even I can shut my mouth when it's necessary. So, with that thought in mind, you may proceed. Or not. Whatever gives you pleasure.<br /><br />  \\"A feast for crows\\" was published in 2005. I purchased it sometime around 2009. and I read it just now, couple of months after paperback \\"Dance of the dragons\\" finally hit the stores. If you're interested in reading this book at all (especially it being 4th installment in a series) you're probably aware of the breakneck speed of Martin's writing. If it weren't for HBO series, I sincerely doubt that \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" would ever see its end - Martin looking like he does at all. Not wanting another Jordan to happen, I paced my reading of this series. It seemed pointless to read an 800 pages book full of details just to wait 6-7 years for it to continue. As I write this, \\"Dance of the dragons\\" sits somewhere on my shelf and I doubt I'll open it before 6th book comes out.<br /><br /> There are people quite unlike me and they've been reading these books as they were coming out. Gossiping all the way up to a point where you couldn't be in certain companies without hearing this or that about one of the books. Almost everyone agreed that \\"A fest for crows\\" was boring peace of crap in which Martin totally lost it. Having stopped with \\"Storm of swords\\" I was inclined to agree. Couldn't really imagine that Martin will be able to outdo himself (\\"SoS\\" being the best one he has written 'till then) and you know what? He didn't. Though \\"A feast for crows\\" is far from boring or crap.<br /><br /> Maybe it was just me. Having been gone from Westeros for quite a long time I was really glad to be back again, revisiting old places and old characters and everything seemed fresh, new and exciting like it was the first time. Maybe if I was reading these when they were coming out, maybe the effect would have been different. One had waited for years after finishing \\"Storm of swords\\" to see what happens next and when he finally could, he saw that Martin wrote one giant filler with focus on scheming on different courts. It was like switching your ride from horse to a turtle and this tends to piss people off. But, as I have said - for me it was quite different. Daenerys wasn't around (praise the Lord - I can't imagine how I'll manage to plow through the 5th book - her being focus of the narrative there) and all was well (though lack of Tyrion was kind of a downer).<br /><br /> As I was reading, Martin's intentions became quite obvious. He was setting the stage for things to come - introducing the organized religion and militant faith (though he kinda did it earlier with Mellisandre), introducing the actual support (political of course) for Targaryens, introducing gender issues (succession within the male line, women struggling for power and right to sit on the throne)  and further developing certain key characters. What wasn't there, and this will prove to be quite difficult to work around, was passage of time. Sure, time does go on, but it does so rather slow and I can't imagine how will Martin manage to offer any plausible solution to the events with just two books left (since 5th one happens within the same time frame as the 4th one). I fear that whatever he does will be some sort of \\"pull-it-out-of-your-ass\\" solution which is bound to be anti-climactic.<br /><br /> Trouble with \\"A fest for crows\\" is that more often than not it feels badly structured. While it does offer significant events in the lives of certain characters, for a world in general it seems almost pointless. Dornish and Ironmen storylines (especially the Asha one) feel unmotivated - or better - overwritten (within these Martin introduced certain key elements, but if he needs 100+pages just to mention two ingredients of the saga one fears of the length of the books that are coming). It is obvious that Martin enjoys world-building. Every other page has some different Lord and some different coat-of-arms explained in details, political history of Westeros is discussed at length and so on. While these things can be cool to certain people, they don't really contribute to anything other than personal obsession with details. There is a notion out there that fantasy should be like this - with rich and detailed worlds - but I'm more inclined to the approach that general idea is far more important than the type of mortar used to build castle walls.<br /><br />Look at me, pulling Martin on Amazon, avoiding what I actually want to say.<br />If you're not a fetish-fan of Martin and his series be aware of the length and meanderings of this book. It could have been shortened for 300 pages or so without losing anything of significance, it could have been more of a spot-on type but you can't do anything about that can you now. Bear in mind that, despite the scribomania, there really is a sense of purpose within these pages though you'll have to dig for it and bear through some quite tedious parts. It could've been far worse than it actually is, but it's far from awful or uninteresting. Suffice it to say that I'm still interested in what's going to happen next and how will all of it finish and that's something that rarely happens to me whenever I do pick some series to read. Martin is far from the best fantasy author out there, but he's still an interesting one. In a world of today that is almost as good.nts, but if he needs 100+pages just to mention two ingredients of the saga one fears of the length of the books that are coming).

0061906220|5.0|A GREAT book for preschoolers, kindergarteners, 1st graders...heck, I'll admit it!...even ADULTS!  The Pete the Cat books, Eric Litwin has THREE different Pete the Cat books out, are WELL worth reading AND showing the videos for the songs that go with the books!  The songs are so appealing to children (and adults) that you will be humming them long after the book has been shelved...but shelved only for a little while as you will HAVE to do a re-read and a re-read and a re-read...well, you get the picture!  Love this book!

B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This game is addicting. One of the best for android. My ONLY issue is that when I finish a mission/collect coins, then proceed to exit thru the main menu (the correct way), I return to play the game and my achievements haven't been saved :(<br /><br />I also lose head start/double coins if I exit. So in turn I have to re-do everything and I don't get what I won on the spin tokens.<br /><br />Please fix this bug or add a save option please! I will be MORE than glad to give the 5 stars this game deserves!
0553582038|5.0|I'm enjoying this book.  Great background information to previous books in series.  It took me time to get use to point of view format but now I like it!  Martin doesn't sugar coat the past albeit set in a fantasy world (his research of the dark and middle ages is thorough enough for the story).  He does a great job at presenting relevant and believable insights and motivations behind his characters without giving everything away.  I've come to appreciate this book and can't wait to start reading book 5.  I know it will be some time before book 6 and 7 come out but I'm patient.

019280264X|4.0|It was a really captivating story, and I could not put the book aside. By the middle of it I had a sensation that the story was rounding in circles and getting nowhere, but it still held my attention. Then, things start to happen and I could see that all that had a purpose, which didn't justifies the lenght of it however. In the last pages everything I was almost forced to like and accept is trown away and so fast concluded that I felt like Austen had got tired of her writting and hastily put an and to it. With all the faults it is still wanderfull and worth reading.

0345803485|5.0|I so enjoyed the author's way of sharing the character's conversations within her head. She managed to create perspective with depth of the mind/ subconscious and a twist of humor. I longed for my next opportunity to continue reading the novel further each day. The story always left me wanting more, even when the story was outside of my day to day life style. The trilogy has been the talk of radio, mother's gathering at functions, career women around the the watering cooler, and even the most unsuspecting are reading this series. I do hope the author will share more with her readers. I know I , as well as many others, are looking forward to her next book. Til then...

B006FO3ERQ|1.0|The shear number of words got in the way of this story. At times, I wondered if the author was getting paid by the word! Revealing what happens in the novel before the event comes to fruition set my expectations high for what was to follow. Those expectations were met with disappointment as I followed the long, long journey of words to sort out, set aside, and find the plot. I couldn't connect with the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I completely fell in love with this book. I got a bit annoyed that prims death only lasted a page. Maybe two. Other than that it was amazing. It shows you what war is like and what it will do to a person. I say everyone over the age of 12 should read this book.

B005LAIGKU|4.0|\\"Premium Rush\\" mixes elements of movies like \\"Vantage Point,\\" \\"Breaking Away\\" and \\"Fast and Furious.\\"  If this combination appeals to you, then by all means race to the theater or buy this movie now.  There is not a moment wasted in this taut thriller as it starts at 6:30 P.M., jumps back to 4:30, brings us to 5:45, then jumps to a different character earlier at 1:30 that afternoon.  All of these pieces come together to help explain what happened at the critical 6:30 juncture of the movie, which then propels us to the ending.<br /><br />All the actors are fine, but the real star is the cinematographer who takes us whizzing through crowded NYC streets on the heels and wheels of the bike messengers that are at the heart of the movie. Do we need to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levit is really riding the bike in long scenes?  Of course not!  Did we really believe Christopher Reeve was flying?  No.  Do we really think Sylvester Stallone was getting punched in Rocky 3?  No.  Do we really think Sharon Stone wasn't wearing....Yeah, we do.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fun movie, and doesn't pretend to be anything pretentious.  Let yourself enjoy this ride.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have been waiting for this app on the fire and sooooo glad it's here!! pretty goood app but lacks the 'scroll up' button and the option to 'pin it'.
1400069181|4.0|This is an inspirational book, for sure, and a testament to the power of working hard for a passionate goal and for having one's life in balance with one's values. For many of us it is difficult to look beyond the paradigms of large companies and the governments having all the power and, instead, realize we are able to make a difference. This book helps change that outlook and so can inspire us to try what we'd love to do.<br /><br />The writing is good, but not great, but the story and subject mostly makes up for that. My only gripe is that it is a bit polyanna. That is to say, it is easy to say big government and old business models are bad and look at the success of this new outlook, based on hard work and passion. But there are many passionate and intelligent people who work very hard and are inspired to do great things, but don't achieve them. There is some element of good fortune, but more importantly there are some elements that separate the successful from the unsuccessful and it isn't just passion. I would have liked to seen more comparison with similarly intentioned companies that didn't make it and, given you are passionate and working very hard, an assessment of what are the pitfalls.<br />Overall a good book.

B004LWZW7E|4.0|Wow lots of negative reviews. Almost made me pass on watching this but was flipping channels & the movie had just started & I ended up watching all of it and am very glad I did.<br /><br />OK, I can see the points of the negative reviews but c'mon folks, this is a movie..made in hollywood...it aint supposed to be 'sensible'.<br /><br />But, if you turn off your brain, I think you'll enjoy this movie. I did. Sure, there are tons of stuff that make no sense. Too many to list, but this again brings me back to the point of 'this is a movie...made in hollywood...& thats how many movies go...'UNREALISTIC'...'..But 'unrealistic does not mean unenjoyable.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, I do agree they could have done alot more with the premise of this movie. After all, the premise is quite interesting...Everybody stops aging at 25 & then has 1 more year. TIME IS THE CURRENCY used to buy things, live & die by.....Awesome premise & if they would have turned this in to a 3 - 5 hour movie/mini-series they really would have had ample time to really expand on the premise...but having to fit everything in at a bit under 1 hr 45 min, they did the best they could & although unbelievable with lots of 'plot holes', this was thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />Anyway, no spoliers so let me just say when it comes to movies everybody has different tastes & this movie is no exception.

B007G8SET8|5.0|Saxon, what more can you say.  The live \\"cd\\" is my favorite part of this package.  The CD hi-lights tracks from \\"Call To Arms\\" probably my favorite release since \\"Unleash The Beast\\".  DVD is great also...It's Saxon...
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Well its a cute case. Bought it in pink. The back of the case is HORRIBLE and cheaply made. Definitely not worth 80 bucks.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|Good release but not as good as Mechanize.  It's the same Dino/Burton mix that wins for me but probably won't attract a new listener.  I gave it a 4 (4 star) just for the fact that they stay consistant.

If you like old school thrash with a touch of Accept you will absolutly love this CD.  It's catchy and brutal all wound together.  Every track is good, you can listen to Phantom Antichrist without skipping a track.

B00000DGUY|4.0|DIRE STRAITS-SULTANS OF SWING/THE VERY BEST OF DIRE STRAITS: MARK KNOPFLER's DYLAN-esque talk-sing vocals and intricate six string workouts gave DIRE STRAITS a truly unmistakable sound...the introspective pub rock saga SULTANS OF SWING was a blast of fresh air during radio's late 70s/early 80s' fascination with punk and new wave. KNOPFLER, whose material was covered by everyone from THE EVERLY BROTHERS and THE JUDDS to TINA TURNER and MARY CHAPIN CARPENTER, had a knack for languid, low key excursions such as ROMEO & JULIET and PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS. These were occasionally tempered by a feisty rocker like TWISTING BY THE POOL, perhaps the band's most effervescent number. All three biggies from their commercial juggernaut BROTHERS IN ARMS...MONEY FOR NOTHING, with its STING cameo and built-in MTV plug, WALK OF LIFE's rollicking roller rink pulse, and the stark ballad SO FAR AWAY...are spotlighted here, alongside lesser known followups CALLING ELVIS and HEAVY FUEL. Fans could rightly grouse about the lack of subtly shaded signature tunes DOWN TO THE WATERLINE and SKATEAWAY, but overall, SULTANS OF SWING is a decent sampler of a band that virtually defined &#34;adult contemporary&#34;.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR MURMERS
0743298039|5.0|As a previous reviewer said, this started out slowly for me and in fact I had put it on my bookshelf for a couple of years.  I picked it up again the other day and didn't stop reading until I had read the entire book. After I had finished, I set it down and said to myself, \\"What an interesting book\\". It is worth reading.

B007LB1O3I|1.0|I've been listening to Madonna for a long time, and as a fan, I can truly say that her best days are behind her. Beginning with 2000's Music, there has been a slow, steady decline in the quality of her music. Don't get me wrong, \\"Music\\" has some great songs, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is probably one of my favorites from Madge, and even \\"American Life\\" and \\"Confessions...\\" had some decent moments. But with \\"Hard Candy\\", Madonna hit a turning point, essentially making a joke out of herself in the process. Why would you, The so-called \\"Queen of Pop\\" need to have featurettes of stars that the younger generation adores? It would be because you are no longer relevant....<br /><br />MDNA made my stomach turn from the moment I knew it was going to be released. Let's start with the fact that she has airbrushed the hell out of herself in the artwork (Google \\"Madonna un-airbrushed to get an idea of what she's really looking like these days), and used a concept she ripped off from another artist for the cover (google \\"Sergio Lagos, Solo\\"). Hmmmmmmm thats really innovative, to plaigarize someone else's ideas, then turn around and diss Gaga for doing the same. I am no Gaga fan, but let's face it: A lot of Madge's career has been a rip off in the first place...<br /><br />The actual music contained is a waste of time. \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" is garbage. Again, if Madonna was relevant, there would be no need for guest rappers and cutesy-baby talk lyrics. \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" is a joke. C'mon? You know its bad when you have to start ripping off stuff from your own back catalogue. It's basically a remix of \\"Act of Contrition\\" from \\"Like a Prayer\\" album with a bunch of other crappy lyrics tacked on. \\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Superstar\\", \\"I'm Addicted\\" are all notable for their awfulness. It's all eurotrash dance mix garb, which Madonna has played out for going on six albums now. This music is tailor made for people with absolutely no mind of their own who will buy anything that their \\"idol\\" throws at them,for the sake of commercial appeal. At 40, with \\"Ray of Light\\", this act was fresh and innovative. At 54, it's played out as hell and we need you to stop, Madonna. You can make so much money off of your name in other ways, I wish that you would stop believing that your music is one of them. Fund your daughter's career. At least people wont be barfing when they see her dancing around on stage in hot pants (hint, hint)<br /><br />Maybe there are people out there who still buy Madonna's music. Good for you! Im just glad I didn't spend any of my own money on this mess. Madonna: Im glad your album tanked, im glad you had the biggest 2nd week sales drop in chart history. Maybe you can take the hint and spend more time with your plastic surgeon (Who btw made you look terrible!)
B008F5QQI2|5.0|The original version isn't bad but the two mixes are worth buying this cd. They are awsome and really bring out the lyrics.

0345505387|1.0|I don't know whether it was just my copy (I doubt it) or the entire run, but the book's pages are bound out of order. I'm very familiar with the story and found myself not being able to follow it, and after looking ahead in the book I realized that a rather large section was inserted in the wrong place in the book, rendering the plot nonsensical. I'll be returning the book, but won't take a chance on reordering it by mail. If you buy it, buy it in a bookstore and check the pages first!
B006RED4GA|1.0|I didn't find this entertaining at all. The characters were annoying, the acting terrible. A lot of it didn't even make sense. Worst of all, it just wasn't scary. No atmosphere, no tension. There was ONE single shot (not even a whole scene, just an image, really) that I liked---very creepy---but definitely not worth having to suffer through all the rest.
B001K3K5MO|4.0|I'd never seen this movie, but decided to give it a viewing in honor of the passing of Tony Scott.  The story here's a bit predictable, but the action sequences are stunning.  Visual artistry.  RIP Tony Scott, thanks for making the world a better place.

B003ZZAXNG|3.0|Everyone whom is familiar with the music of Pink Floyd and of the group's history, is most likely aware that in the beginning it was driven not by Roger Waters nor David Gilmour(even though David replaced Syd), it was the promise and wonderous imagination and talent of Roger Keith(Syd) Barrett. Syd's talents are profoundly apparent within Pink Floyd's stunning debut record Piper at the Gates of Dawn and unfortunately, Syd's penchant for psychedelic drugs in LSD, specifically, would document him amongst the first of drug casualties and one of the sadder stories in the history of rock. After leaving the Floyd, Syd was persuaded by then manager Peter Jenner to enter the recording studio and cut some songs for a future solo release to keep him active and relevant in the music world. Though Jenner's intentions were admirable and kind, it took 3 different producers, including former Floyd mates Waters and Gilmour, and over a year and a half before Barrett finished his debut solo album. With his mental state being extremely fragile and inbalanced, the post-Piper Syd had drastically changed within his songwriting skills, as well as his musicianship which on certain tracks such as Terrapin and Golden Hair feature little more than his acoustic guitar and vocals, and are the album's best tracks showing that Syd still had some wealth of talent shining through. Once he attempted playing with a backing rhythm section such as with the Soft Machine(former Floyd rivals) on No Good Trying and Love You, or the quirky and upbeat, yet somewhat ramshackled Octopus, his sense of time and rhythm was interrupted, jarring and ragged, another indication of the damage from substance abuse.<br /><br />Most of the tracks on here have a sense of structure, but its obvious and apparent that there contains a hollowness within the music itself and its creator is still reaching for his muse, with tracks like If It's In You, Feel and She Took A Long Cold Look, Barrett at times, seems to lose his attention span and general motivation towards his performance and the songs feel blunted in the process. Madcap is not without its dark beauty of quality on songs like Late Night, Here I Go, No Man's Land(which at the end has Barrett offhandly chattering against the songs refrain), Terrapin and James Joyce's poem Golden Hair set to music by Syd; again as mentioned Terrapin and Golden Hair are the real moving moments on here and had Barrett not opted for first take only cuts, some of these songs with a little more care in being arranged properly, could have made a deep recording of stunning and marvelous material. Some people in their reviews here, believe that Barrett's solo records are genius and extraordinary, good for them. I've owned Madcap, Barrett and Opel for quite some time and they are not discs I listen to often, but they display some special moments, and other times, more often, the inner workings of madness taking hold. For Pink Floyd aficionados, Barrett's albums are definitely worth owning, but as to the degree of artistic merits within them, there's at least a disc worth from all 3 that's worth compiling, in my opinion. Madcap gets 3 curious stars for effort in its few moments of brilliance, and at times is awkwardly appealing, but this is for the die-hard/collectors' interest, basically.

B005F96URI|3.0|In a violent, dystopic, gun-free world two strangers arrive in a crime-ridden city looking for revenge. One is a nameless drifter, the strong, silent type who wields his fists like bullets. The other is a young samurai, concerned with honor above all. With the help of an insurgent bartender the two strangers join forces to take down a shadowy crime lord and his group of 9 deadly killers.<br /><br />As you can probably tell by the description, this movie holds to every western/samurai/revenge flick cliché you can think of, but it does it with style.<br /><br />The heavily stylized visuals and sound effects are the stars of this film. The movie opens up with a Japanese puppet show (bunraku) which sets up the world and gives background for the lack of guns. The movie, which was filmed entirely on a sound stage, is full of elaborate sets that look like they came straight out of a pop-up book. The visual style is quite gorgeous. The fight scenes (of which there are many) are choreographed almost like a dance. Every move is planned and graceful. This especially applies to Kevin McKidd's Killer #2 who looks like a cross between Alex DeLarge and Gene Kelly.<br /><br />The cinematography provides even more visual flare. Rather than cut from one location to another, the camera races over the landscape, the city being constructed along the way as it arrives at its destination. I really enjoyed this technique, which reminded me of Moulin Rouge's camera trekking through the streets of Paris. One scene that particularly stood out for me was The Drifter infiltrating a multi-level prison. He travels from level to level, knocking out guards as he goes in one continuous tracking shot that was reminiscent of an old Donkey Kong game. I do love a good long tracking shot.<br /><br />The story plays out in a very predictable way. There are no surprises or shocking twists, this is a by-the-book revenge tale.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is solid. Josh Hartnett seems born to play these mysterious stranger roles - he's got the look and the voice and I even believed all his fight scenes. Japanese superstar Gackt played his samurai role well. Woody Harrelson was right at home playing a bartender and provided most of the movie's laughs. Ron Perlman has the size and intimidation factor down pat. Kevin McKidd had the most interesting role to work with and performed admirably.<br /><br />The weakest part of the movie was Demi Moore's character, Alexandra, the crime lord's woman. It wasn't the acting, that was fine, but the character itself was poorly thought out and completely superfluous. She  attempts to bring some emotional depth to a couple of the male characters but it really doesn't work. She's brought in, given a couple scenes then disappears without any resolution to the plot-lines she introduced. This attempt at story-telling adds nothing and actually gets in the way of the movie. The whole character could have (and should have) been cut out. This would have had the added benefit of cutting the film's slightly bloated running time (118 minutes) down to something more reasonable.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of Bunraku will depend on your expectations. If you're expecting fresh story-telling and well developed characters you will be sorely disappointed. I appreciate it for what it is: a good old-fashioned beat'em up with an exciting new visual style. What the movie lacks in depth it more than makes up for in entertainment value.

B007UW9VWO|4.0|I've been curious about \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" from the time of its release.  It intrigued me enough for me to add it to my Wish List. I dropped it from the list after reading the 1-star review on it.  Despite my reluctance, I was destined to have the Blu-Ray edition because I won a copy after answering an on-line survey for Sound & Vision Magazine.<br /><br />You've likely already read previous reviews.  But in a nutshell, it is about a sushi master's lifelong dedication to making sushi as an art form.  He convinces his two sons to follow in his footsteps.  His sons and staff develop the same obsessive dedication to the art form.  The documentary covers every facet of Jiro's life from his upbringing, career philosophy, work ethic, a glimpse of his opinion on parental guidance for developing children's work ethics and discipline as well as the complete process of obtaining food from specialized vendors, food preparation, presentation, and his way of accommodating customers.<br /><br />If you've read the 1-star review of this documentary, you might expect to see an old cranky man snapping at everyone around him (his sons, staff and customers) while vendors are bowing to him.  This is not the case at all.  In fact, the special features section will provide a lot more incite about Jiro's character, a soft-spoken man.  His relationship with his sons is good (there's some humorous exchange in dialogue between Jiro and his sons).  Despite Jiro's statement about not being much of a father, as the less-than-stellar review references, the special features section reveals that he was always finding ways to take his sons out to have fun when they were young while his wife wanted them to stay home and concentrate on studying.  Another reviewer commented that Jiro's oldest son was waiting for him to retire so that he can take over.  Wrong.  It is, in fact, a tradition for the oldest son to take over the business so Jiro actually expects him to.<br /><br />Buy this documentary and you will not be disappointed.  My one-star deduction is only due to my wish that the documentary was better organized.  Chronological order of events work best for me.  I felt that the topics of the documentary were somewhat scattered.  Otherwise, it is quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended.

The DSS that I also purchased stopped working after 5 months.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was violent and funny; this may seen paradoxical, but the director made it work. Nicholas Cage's character, \\"Big Daddy\\" seems to be spoofing Adam West's \\"Batman\\" from the original TV series. Uh-oh I may be dating myself a bit. If you listen to how Cage talks, he seems to be aping West. This is basically a romantic comedy with the superhero stuff superimposed over it. Great directing.
1476712042|5.0|Firstly, you must know that I literally didn't sleep in order to finish this beauty. My coffee I.V. was slid in at 6am after completing BD at 5:30. But the lack of sleep was SO worth it! This book was emotional, honest and gripping - and the characters are ones that I've been thinking about since I put the book down.<br /><br />Abby is a good girl with some bite. After leaving Wisconsin with her best friend, America, to outrun her past, Abby is set on turning her life around. And if you think you know what Abby's problems are - you're wrong.<br /><br />Travis is a super sexy bad boy with a temper, and this good girl couldn't wait to take a bite out of him! Travis is used to having girls throw themselves at him, so when he meets hard-to-fall Abby, he gets thrown for a loop.<br /><br />With the entire college watching this bizarre friendship flourish, Abby and Travis must learn to trust their instincts - which neither of them have done for a long time.<br /><br />Although the premise of this book seems like something you've read before, let me tell you, it is so very much more. There is so much depth to the friendship built between Travis and Abby and their supporting characters, America and Shep - Travis' roommate and cousin who is dating Abby's best friend. I enjoyed all of the tears fallen through this book and really remain connected to these characters.<br /><br />As someone who has experienced a toxic relationship (as I think most of us have) I could really relate to both sides of the story...even while wanting to smack our characters in the back of the head and get them both to do the \\"right\\" thing. Although what's right may not be what we all hope for...<br /><br />Familial loss and bizarre twists of fate and luck connect in this story to give us a relationship too good to leave, and too painful to stay. Excellent book - MUST BUY!

030758836X|3.0|I really enjoyed this page-turner of a \\"marriage-gone-wrong\\" mystery until very close to the end.  I won't spoil it but, what a disappointment after a wild ride of psychological and relationship twists and turns that kept creating different impressions of the two main characters.  In the end, however, I realized that though the portrait of the husband was never clear enough, the sketch of his character didn't fit with the resolution of the plot.  Such a shame, because I can think of several better approaches and began doing so as the plot began to falter.  Well-written and fast moving, but ultimately, disappointing.

This is an amazing book along with the stretch, and core anatomy books, the combination of all three will give you the ability to do a full time work out and do something different pretty much every day! must must must have!!!!!!!!!!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|If Amazon would let us give half-stars, this would actually be a 4.5. I'm just very picky about those 5-star ratings.<br /><br />Everything about this book was beautiful. Well, except for the kids having cancer, of course, but Mr. Green even managed to turn that into something beautiful by giving these kids such amazing perspectives on life, on love, on loss, on humanity. At the risk of sounding clich&eacute;, Hazel and Gus (and Isaac too) are those kind of people who, just by knowing them, make your life more interesting. And even though they are just characters in a book, I'm glad that I got to spend a few hours with them.<br /><br />There was a point in the book, about 3/4 through it, that I cried like a baby and just.could.not.stop. So brace yourself, don't read it in public, and have some tissues ready.
B002GHHHL0|4.0|Scientists are working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease and they think they have found the answer.  They use some unique processes to genetically enhance the brains of three Mako sharks.  This process enlarges their brains and makes them immensely smarter and more dangerous to handle.  Corporate sends down an executive to check on the progress and to see how the tests are going.  Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) comes to the facility as the team is preparing harvesting brain protein complex fluid from the biggest of the sharks.<br /><br />The experiments are taking place on a remote sea based submarine station to provide the proper environment for the sharks.  They are trying to get the test done quickly as a large tropical depression is moving in and they will soon be isolated by the storm.  Just as the test proves successful the shark attacks one of the scientist....<br /><br />This movie is a combination of Jaws and a Sci-Fi horror film where mankind is dabbling in genetic mutations that they should leave alone.  Trapped in the base, the people now face sharks that want them dead and will go to any means to achieve that goal.  This is a good movie and I enjoyed watching it for entertainment purposes. I wonder though why take one of the top predators in the world and enhance its brain power to make it smarter by what appears to be 10 fold.  Nothing good will come from doing that and in the end....  Well you will just have to watch the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie and good entertainment and I like the film.

Disrupt everything that is run by computers....<br /><br />This is a fast paced and high tech film about modern terrorism and its effect on the USA who is dependent upon computer control of all of our major operating systems in our country. The government is trying to get ahead of the problem but John Mc Clane is one of the key answers to help solve the problem with Matt Farrell, a genius computer hacker.<br /><br />I love this series of movies with Bruce Willis and this is one of the best ones made. The acting is very good in this one and the action scenes are spectacular. I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you!

B00786XVOG|5.0|Wow... as always this magical orchestra proves the edge of abilities of Yanni to communicate his musical soul to me. I was stunt...<br /><br />The location \\"El Morro\\" the unmatched backdrop in combination of the powers of Mother Nature blends the music and I felt the magical mystery of underlying power of the orchestra.Newly added music with excellent vocals takes your breath away.<br /><br />The \\"Storm\\", though was a natural, it teaches you how as a strong person would come-around more stronger than ever before. I really like Greek proverb that Yanni tells to the audience soon after he started performing after the storm; \\"Wet man never fears of rain\\". Isn't it true fact in our life ?<br />The whole orchestra at \\"El Morro\\" for me is not only music, but power, love, togetherness, harmony, and insight to your own soul.

B006NYQAJM|5.0|First off, this set costs $39.99, and NOT upward of $60.  You can find it for $39 at the lego store (lego's website or physical stores), and for $49 at toysrus. At the time of writing this review, Amazon itself does not sell this set.  Amazon only has third party vendors selling the set for unreasonably high prices.<br /><br />This set is excellent.  Includes FIVE main character minifigs (Joker, Riddler, Harley-Quinn, Batman, and Robin).  Multiple fun functions on the set for long lasting play appeal.<br /><br />The downsides to this set: stickers, and a lack of \\"new\\" or \\"special\\" pieces.  Almost all of the set is constructed from common pieces, which is a factor in keeping the ($39) price of this set down.  Additionally, most of the decorative pieces in the set use stickers, rather than printing on the pieces themselves.  The minifigures do not use stickers though.  Stickers can be annoying to install on lego sets, but these stickers are mostly all rectangular and fit their pieces properly, making installation easier.<br /><br />Bottom line: do not hesitate to buy this excellent set, but not for the prices charged by sellers on Amazon.

B0058ZPNOK|4.0|An excellent boy film, film about a boy at the sorrow and sad age of twelve or something, when the boy is confronted with real life, that is to say mourning and a boy that age does not know how to deal with mourning. Death maybe, but mourning no. Death is simple. It comes and it is finished. You stay behind and the real thing is starting: mourning.<br /><br />Imagine an accident and you lose a parent and the car. You can mourn the parent or you can just accept the death of that parent and mourn the car. Mourning is a form of love that attaches you to an object or a person that no longer lives or exists. So mourning for a child of twelve is dramatic because he does not see beyond the present and because mourning is for him eternal.<br /><br />He can get attached to a stranger who is going to create havoc around him, that's Hesher, or to a nice young woman who is going to become the substitute of the dead mother, and all the time he is going to be attached to the car in which the mother died, him in the back and his father at the wheel. He does not know what he is doing of course, but he has become a fetishist of the car. And that is sad.<br /><br />And one day another dramatic event will happen and that will bring the crazy friend around and that will bring the world upside down and that will bring the world back onto its feet because it was standing its feet in the air before. And mourning will be finished and closure will be reached and life can start existing again, but unluckily the friend who created that havoc will have disappeared though he will present you with the cadaver of the car on your doorstep.<br /><br />And you can keep that cadaver for ever and ever in your front garden or your back yard, next to your swimming pool if you have one or behind your cherry tree if there is one in your back garden.<br /><br />That's why this film is interesting because it tells you how a boy of 12 years of age or so will find closure for the dramatic event that has sent his mind right upside down under his knees and next to his soles. There is a tremendous empathy in the anger it expresses, I don't mean tell, just your empathy of anger you get out of the story, if you have ever experienced such a loss at such an early age. If you haven't you will never ever be able to really get any event to closure because it will always be foreclosed before it happens, since foreclosure is always before the term of some said period of time.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUhis mind right upside down under his knees and next to his soles.

1475143389|5.0|This book by far is one of the best books at teaching you everything you need to know to succeed in building your dream body. I have never actually opened a book and read it all the way. I got this book In the mail mondy evening and finished it by Wednesday afternoon. That should tell you something. It is amazing after knowing everything anytime someone says something completely wrong about nutrition it really drives me nuts and I say to them get this book and you'll understand everything. Absolutely a book you must have if you don't know how to eat, or work out right without quitting all together.

I really liked the narration style where different characters told their separate stories but the characters were all interconnected.It is a great fantasy read with lots of action and some very unexpected events. Often, the story is left on a \\"cliff-hanger\\". It is exciting and makes you want to keep reading.
1594744769|4.0|This was a fairly easy read, so take heart. It's witty, charming, imaginative, and intriguing.<br /><br />The humanity of the main character, Jacob, seems typical like any teenage boy. As he find out more about his heritage and the ones close to him, he learns more about himself. Sounds like a typical fictional story, huh? Not at all. I was happily surprised that this story was original and you get lost in the creativity from mixing real life with the seemingly fantasy life, that it makes the worlds collide as unique and thought-provoking.<br /><br />It's a story that sucks  you in from start to finish. Perhaps not an intense page-turner, but a light read that keeps you turning the pages. The ending left me wanting more, but what, I'm not sure. It's not a cliff hanger, but as with any decent fictional story that has mind-bending qualities... there's always room for more.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|\\"A Clash of Kings\\" is book 2 in the series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". I didn't enjoy it as much as \\"The Game of Thrones\\". However, it was still very exciting and readable. I tended to get confused with all the knights and \\"Houses\\" and their respective alliances, as they seemed to change frequently as the story evolved. As with book one, the tale of each character occasionally finishes with a \\"cliff hanger\\" and there are sudden and unexpected tragedies. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is a great read and continues the story of the Seven Kingdoms.
0812993292|4.0|I found this odd little book difficult to get into, perhaps because I was ill, or perhaps because I couldn't get over the desire to slap some sense into Harold Fry.  He's a mousy Englishman whose major desire is for no one to notice him.  He feels he has failed everyone he has ever known, has nothing to offer the world, and that most likely everyone else either despises him or feels sorry for him.<br /><br />Harold and his wife Maureen have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for years, and she only speaks to him to complain about something petty.  In fact, a rare funny moment in the book is when Harold has gone on his pilgrimage and she doesn't want to do household chores anymore.  It's no fun, she thinks, without being able to slam down the basket and complain endlessly about how much work she has to do.<br /><br />Their life changes drastically the day Harold receives a note from a woman he had worked with years earlier.  She is in a hospice 500 miles north of his home and wanted to thank him for his friendship before she died.  He remembers that they were indeed friends, and that she had done a huge favor for him for which he never adequately thanked her.  On his way to post a letter back to her, he decides he must go to her, that as long as he is walking toward her, she will live.  And so he sets out - without cell phone, enough money, decent walking shoes, anything.<br /><br />As he walks, he remembers and he thinks.  We learn why he is who he is.  He learns about people he meets along the way, and to appreciate nature.  He becomes aware of plants and buys a guidebook to learn about them.  He watches the sky change and he walks in rain or dry.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at home Maureen is so lonely without him she doesn't know what to do.  Finally she becomes friends with a widower across the street who is a great help to her.  He manages to take her out of her malaise a bit.<br /><br />The whole story has wonderful messages, and the characters he meets are the kind of ordinary folks you might meet anywhere.  There's even a dog he calls Dog who travels part of the way with him and gives him the love he needs so desperately.  I still had the occasional desire to slap Harold silly, but for the most part I admired his dogged dedication to his quest.  I felt sad for him, Maureen, Queenie who is dying and many of the people who helped him.  It isn't an easy book to read, and yet I'm very glad I did read it.<br /><br />Source:  Random House<br />Recommended readingof ordinary folks you might meet anywhere.

1936608898|5.0|I read a lot of Paleo books, I think I have read them all. I have long looked for the perfect blend of science and readability that will get a new Paleo eater into the topic without scaring the pants off them. I think this one is it. It has a nice blend of topics covered. It addresses both the how to of this style of eating, as well as some really good psychological angles of our relationship with food. This book is really really really good. It covers all you need to know about a thirty day trial into good health, as well as being a great new way to think of one's individual, unique relationship with food. I have already loaned it out to three people, and have a wait list in my office.

The first scene kind of through me off, but after that I fell victim to the pages on my kindle. This book was addicting and emotional. Every page had me either laughing, smiling, shaking my kindle in aggravation, crying, and I even pulled my own hair a little out of frustration. This book deserves a five star in my opinion. I absolutely without a doubt loved it! I can't wait for the next book and will definitely be reading more by Jamie McGuire!!!

B008JAFXOQ|5.0|[Spoiler alert: Maybe you should watch the movie first, THEN read this.]<br /><br />This is a great film about loss. Loss of life, loss of virginity, loss of youth, loss of innocence. But as Cormack McCarthy said, \\"Beauty and loss are one,\\" and there's a lot of beauty in this movie. It's title refers to a poem by Gerard Manly Hopkins, which is read by a teacher in one of the classroom scenes:<br /><br />Margaret, are you grieving<br />Over Goldengrove unleaving?<br />Leaves, like the things of man, you<br />With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?<br />Ah! as the heart grows older<br />It will come to such sights colder<br />By & by, nor spare a sigh<br />Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;<br />And yet you w&iacute;ll weep & know why.<br />Now no matter, child, the name:<br />Sorrow's springs are the same.<br />Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed<br />What h&eacute;art h&eacute;ard of, gh&oacute;st gu&eacute;ssed:<br />It is the blight man was born for,<br />It is Margaret you mourn for.<br /><br />In another classroom scene there's a free-for-all political \\"discussion\\" in which one of the students says she thinks teenagers should run the world because their ideals haven't yet been jaded by experience and disillusion. In other words, their hearts have not grown colder. This is what the movie is about. Lisa can't accept Monica's death or her own guilt in causing it, and is struggling futilely in a grown-up world which doesn't care. Not until near the end, when Monica's death has been translated into a $350,000 lawsuit for the relatives who wanted nothing to do with her when she was alive, does Lisa stop blaming the bus driver alone. \\"I KILLED HER!\\" she shouts.<br /><br /> Anna Paquin was 20 when the movie was shot in 2005, and she does an amazing job as the 17-year-old Lisa Cohen. The final scene takes place in the Metropolitan Opera, where Rene Flemming is singing the Barcarole from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann. The courtesan Giulietta (at the behest of a guy who has promised her a diamond) is seducing Hoffmann. \\"Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour,\\" she sings--<br /><br />Beautiful night, oh night of love,<br />smile on our exhilaration,<br />Night sweeter than the day,<br />Oh beautiful night of love!<br /><br />Time flees and does not return<br />bringing our tenderness<br />Far from this happy stay<br />Time flees without return....<br /><br />But it's all a sham. Lisa has lost her virginity but has not had her night of love. Her life is beginning, her childhood is over, time flees and does not return. Finally, while Flemming sings, Lisa breaks down weeping in her mother's arms. But her grief is not just for Monica.

B008D28HYS|3.0|When you get to the larger games, it's just too difficult to hit the correct square on the screen. This game is just not meant to be played on a small tablet. Even if you try to enlarge the playing field you either can't see the  edges that you need to work from or you contact the field when you move it leaving marked squares where they shouldn't be. Good game, if it were on a computer screen.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book in this series is a bit of a departure from the first two, but not in a bad way.  It remains that true to the story.  Some of my friends were not as pleased with this book because they felt it was a little slow, but I totally disagree.  There are questions that don't get answered for most of the book, but isn't that how the world is anyway?  The story develops mostly from the point of view of the main character, Katniss, and so you only learn things that she makes discoveries; it takes time to unravel mysteries.<br /><br />I really enjoyed and highly recommend this entire series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|my sister told me she loved this book ...I purchased for my new kindle....could not put it away and even took it to bed just because I could not get enough, and read into early morning.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games, but was skeptical how the story was going to continue.  I just didn't think the author could possibly top or even equal the first book.  The point of the story was that kids are sent to fight to the death, and that already happened in the first book, so what was going to happen now?<br /><br />Good news is, the second book is AMAZING.  Maybe I was just enjoying the ride and didn't see all the twists coming, but the second book does a great job of continuing the story set up in the first book.  The character development continues brilliantly and I couldn't put it down.  Just like the first book, I finished this one in 24 hours.<br /><br />I highly recommend all the books in this series!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Good read lots demand lots interest read the next two books<br />Author lucky  will she write more<br />Mills and boons may be better
B008602KQI|2.0|Before there were \\"Hunger Games\\" there was \\"Battle Royale\\" and before that there was \\"Death Race\\" and \\"Surviving the Game\\" and probably a dozen or so movies/shows that have come before with a similar theme of humans killing other humans as some sort of game.<br /><br />What makes movies like this compelling despite the theme is the attachment the viewer gets to the \\"Hero\\" or \\"Hero's\\", the attachment draws them in and by the time the action starts the viewer is invested in the Hero because they either excel at something (like rooting for your favorite sports team member), or the viewer can easily place themselves in the shoes of the Hero and imagine what they would do under the same circumstances.<br /><br />So it is surprising that the movie is unable to be compelling.  It just seems so rushed.  Relationships between the main hero, her family, friends and other relationships are left un-developed, rather than seeing interactions between the hero and others a punch line like \\"I love you\\", \\"Don't die\\", or \\"You have to win\\" is given that supposedly sums up all their feelings into a few words which you are supposed to listen to and take to heart.<br /><br />Then there is the story which spends the majority of its time swimming around at the shallow end of the pool.  Perhaps for a PG rating, or perhaps there simply wasn't enough time to develop the characters, the relationships, the backstory or to even delve into why \\"The Hunger Games\\" are important to their society and why the districts haven't flat out revolted.<br /><br />In short:<br />If your looking for a great action movie: This isn't it.<br />If your looking for a great drama movie: This isn't it.<br />If your looking for a great movie that you can relate to: This probably isn't it.<br />If you have a thing for watching movies with akward teen moments and bad acting but looks visually impressive: This is it.

0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is one of those books that makes you contemplate what you might do if in a similar circumstance as the family that's central to the story and pray that you never find yourself in such a situation.  Fourteen-year old Jacob is accused of murdering a 14-year old classmate.  The author takes the reader on a journey that shows how such an accusation upends every aspect of a family's life - regardless of the legitimacy of the accusation or strength of evidence associated with the accusation.  Once accused, there is no undoing the tears in relationships that follow or the scars that are created by the accusation - the question about the accused's guilt or innocence never goes away. Did Jacob murder his classmate?  To prevent giving away any of the cliffhangers or shocking moments, I'll conclude by saying that the author didn't take the easy way out with the ending. Defending Jacob is one of those books that I'll think about long after I read the final page.

I found it hard to follow at first as I am not used to his style of writing or this kind of crime/thriller<br /><br />It was a bit disappointing about the story line as I thought it may have more to do with the trial and conviction of Danny Padgitt, but it was more about the town and the people in it. (this was nice though as I feel like I know the characters well).<br /><br />It is a very slow paced book and wraps up the story at the last 80 pages or so.<br /><br />I read this 360 page long book in 3 weeks as i found it hard to get into, however I will buy more of Johns books as i know a lot of readers who highly recommend him.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|By no means will I start out and tell you how beautiful the cinematography is or how the plot was captivating or Oscar Worthy. This movie falls in that category with movies like Ong Bak, Supercop & The Transporter... films made for action junkies. I got it from the Redbox after seeing a trailer for it months ago. The trailer looked brutal maybe to the point of being too brutal but happily the film never goes over the line - it draws near in some scenes but never fully crosses that line where you say \\"Now I didn't need to see that.\\". As a fan of action films of the last 3 decades, I don't ask for much. Give me a decent villain, a great henchman, good guys getting their a** handed to them only to barely win and no outrageous, preachy rhetoric or messages and I am a fat, happy slob. The movie was just what I wanted and more. I have to say the fight choreography was some of the best I've seen in a long time (maybe since the first Ong Bak or Who Am I?). Watching this maybe me feel like I was watching one those great 80's action films. Simple, fun and jaw dropping. It may not be Shakespeare but it was no less entertaining. A definite buy for me at some point or at least a rental for anyone who likes these films ($1.29 is as low risk as it gets).

0525478817|5.0|I have come to believe that John Green never disappoints. Ever!! This book is the most serious of his books that I've read before and that is saying quite a lot.<br /><br />TFIOS had all the things that I have come to love and expect from Green's books: very smart teenagers who read and have impressive vocabularies, parts that make you laugh out loud, and Venn diagrams. I love Venn diagrams.<br /><br />What I liked the most about the book was that Hazel and Augustus though having to deal with cancer, were just like normal teens; hormones included. That being said, I loved that Hazel had some hesitation when trying to decide whether or not to date Augustus. I hate instant love in YA. Big Pet Peeve. And yes, there was insta-love on Augustus' part, but he's so romantic about it that I forgive him.<br /><br />Peter Van Houten is my favorite secondary character in a way. Though I do kind of hate him at times. He's an eccentric and a creeper of epically humorous proportions, but he's less of a jerk once you get to the bottom of his story.<br /><br />The descriptions of Amsterdam are so beautiful that I want to pack up and go there right now. I don't even care that I don't know a word of Dutch.<br /><br />The bottom line, I loved these characters as if they were real people. They are so thoughtful, funny, and I was deeply moved to the point of tears. This book will get you. You will feel like you know these characters personally.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I saw an interview with Nicholas Sparks where he told the audience about this book. It is not a love story, nor is it a Sparks type of read. It is about a DA trying to defend his own 14yr old son.  Very quick read. I will look for more books by this author!

B007JU5HSO|4.0|This release contains several CDs I already own but has THE ORIGINAL version of EPSILON IN MALAYSIAN PALE, which I've not been able to find on CD (the recent re-recorded version of E.I.M.P. of a few years back is not very good in my opinion) This set also has many alternative versions of tracks from the albums I do have. (AQUA, AGES, STUNTMAN, PINNACLES) The one glaring omission is not including MACULA TRANSFER, an album I have on the original vinyl but like E.I.M.P. can find nowhere on CD... that omission is the only thing that keeps this from being a truly excellent compilation of the great Edgar Froese's solo work outside of Tangerine Dream... but what is here is great stuff. Four CDs for an affordable price. Not a bad deal at all.
B001NFNFIK|2.0|Being an avid fan of James Lee Burke I was honestly looking forward to viewing this particular movie.<br />In anticipation of watching the movie I had invited 4 friends, all \\"hardcore\\" fans of the Robicheaux<br />series.  After the scene featuring Dave's conversation with The Colonial the CD player was turned off,<br />no point in going forward with this abomination.<br />For the longest I could not understand the shortening of the title, dropping the \\"With Confederate Dead\\"<br />portion.  Now I would imagine it was an attempt to seperate the movie from the book.  If one had not<br />read the original book they would find it difficult to follow the plot of the movie.  The actors all<br />appeared to be reading their lines, there is no emotion shown, and a awful lot of mumbling.  On the<br />back of the CD box it states that the movie is based on the book, they should add LOOSELY based on<br />the book.<br />As much as I look forward to James Lee Burke publishing another novel I truly hope there are no more<br />attempts to bring them to the screen if this is an example of finished product.<br />So in ending this I'll say buy the books, they are all excellent, great entertainment but stay away<br />from the movies.  They are not only a waste of money but they are a waste of time as well.
B0086QS7N2|1.0|As a \\"casual fan\\" of over 30 years now, I must admit Rush are one of those bands I can take it or leave it with. This new cd is another one those I can \\"leave it\\". FYI, I haven't liked much since 1982's Signals.<br /><br />You're better off going to Youtube & sampling the uploads, then deciding which ones you like, then come back to Amazon & purchase what you want. If one were to do that with Rush's last 3 releases, you could come up with a much better product.

0140120416|5.0|I'll not lie, I bought this book based largely on the hype that surrounds it. So many reviews and recommendations that it simply wasn't possible for me to pass it up. On first arrival, having little more than knowledge of Cyrillic, I wasn't impressed. I didn't appreciate the EXTREME lengths the book typically went to towards explaining grammar. Out of fear of mispronunciation I didn't like the almost total abandonment of transliteration from chapter 5 on (and then only appearing occasionally or on words that don't sound as they are spelled) coupled with a lack of audio backup. I tried several other resources, none I'd call bad, but ended up sticking with this one. It honestly probably is the best.<br /><br />Of the grammar - yes, it can get VERY intense and thorough; at times it seems overwhelmingly so. I soon gave up and moved on to other books, but still had a large problem - I could not form sentences correctly. After talking with several Russian friends on Skype, I found them correcting large parts of my Russian speech. Almost always simple mistakes, such as the endings of words (\\"ends with -y in this case\\", \\"this word following в ends -e\\", etc.) and I couldn't wrap my head around it. My knowledge of English, even as a native speaker, has never been from a highly grammatical viewpoint. It is my native language and despite not being an English teacher am quite capable of submitting a quality report. As an adult with no other known languages, I noticed one glaring flaw in my approach to Russian - it is most emphatically NOT English and, from my age anyway, requires heavy study of grammar. When I sat down, studied hard and completed some of the drills, things began to make much more sense. Sure, I still have to think about what I say before I say them, but mistakes are being made far less often.<br /><br />Of what some reviews cite as being dated vocabulary - honestly? I haven't encountered many issues when speaking with friends. By and large it would appear (based solely on conversing with friends) that most of the vocabulary is accurate and few is obsolete. I tried Pimsleur (and Rosetta Stone, as well as many others, and most certainly don't recommend RS) and noticed something in the first eight lessons, totaling four hours of study - it does contain dated references and only addressed, \\"Вы\\" conversational. I suppose if your goal is pure travel this is not an issue, but to make friends? Could be an issue. The friends I spoke with also found it very amusing that it made many references to, \\"Mr. and Mrs./Miss\\" of which I was told even in polite Russian have almost entirely fallen out of disuse.<br /><br />I suppose if I had to be critical in any way of this title, I would cite lack of audio. Really, I think this book could have served as a student textbook had it included more drills/exercises or had an accompanying workbook. Even then, seeing as we all have access to the internet it's a minor issue at best. Find a Russian speaking friend with a bit of English background, pick up this book and enjoy yourselves!
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game used to work nicely, but when my phone updated to ICS and lost flash player the videos would not play. but that is only a minor inconvenience.

159420229X|3.0|I have two primary complaints with this title.  The first one is how much time the author spends on talking about his own life and going into a great amount of detail describing the people he interacts with.  He spends a lot of time talking about the mannerisms of the people he meets, what they are wearing, what their backgrounds are, and what their goals in life are.  For instance, he spends a whole chapter talking about a memory champion/\\"prodigy\\" that apparently might be a fake.  He goes into great detail about this person's early life and the author's own interviews with him.  The whole time I was hoping he would go back to talking about the art and science of memory training and I was consistently disappointed.  Furthermore, the author also spends a lot of time talking about himself and his own life.  Once again, he devotes many pages discussing his own dreams, aspirations, and personal life.  No offense to the author, but I didn't purchase this book to hear his life story.<br /><br />I bought this book to learn about the art of memory retention and how to increase your memory.  I was also expecting the author to break down and summarize relevant scientific studies in the field.  Don't get me wrong, he does in fact do this but he devotes, at most, 60-70 pages to the interesting neuroscience and psychology behind it.  He talks about memory experts and the scientists that study them.  He describes scientific theories on what actually makes an expert and what is different (physiologically and non-physiologically) about them when compared to people with average memories and average talents.  The author also gives specifics on how to train and improve your memory.  These sections of the book were VERY interesting to me and I was hoping this is how the majority of the book would be like.  Unfortunately, it wasn't, hence my 3/5 stars instead of something higher.<br /><br />If you are expecting a largely scientific book that discusses the topic of memory, you will be mostly disappointed.  If you think you will enjoy the great amounts of useless autobiographical detail then this book might be for you.ostly disappointed.  If you think you will enjoy the great amounts of useless autobiographical detail then this book might be for you.

1936608898|5.0|It Starts With Food is the is the single best nutrition book that is written. The book is organized logically and written in a style that is both informative and friendly. Phenomenal book for anyone, whether you are interested in starting to eat better or have been eating Paleo / Primal for years and want the wisdom of Melissa Dallas. Phenomenal!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like that it is powered by accuweather, but I wish it had some other features. Overall, it's a gorgeous, very useful app. :-)
B005EGXTL2|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy and was eager to read this one. The first half was great but the plot slowly degenerated. It was as if the writer wasn't sure where to take the story. Fantastical creatures, an unrealistic mission and the resolution seems too sudden after three books. Too many questions left unanswered. Ms Collins lacks the control demonstrated in the first two novels. Perhaps she simply ran out of ideas. Read it if you must know Katniss' future - as I did - but be prepared to be enormously frustrated with the rest.
1451629192|5.0|Contrary to one (moronic) review: Jaycee's book is real. It's not edited with publisher \\"saleability\\" fluff; it was never meant to be. It's simply Jaycee's story, written in her OWN words -- a stream of consciousness. Anyone who expects her to be a novelist is a moron. (Hello?)  She's telling you what freaking happened to her and it was horrific! It'll take you about 10 seconds to become engrossed in her telling. You immediately will feel as if she's telling you her story and its horrific details while sitting at a cafe. (How dare *anyone* criticize her writing ability? Eff you, please.)  Jaycee was unfortunate to have lived a nightmare; yet, found ways to keep her sanity. Her book not only details her nightmare, but her personal way she processed years of abuse and uncertainty.  She is a heroine -- not just for herself, but for her children and, I imagine, any other person who has been dealt a truly bad hand. Bless you and your family, Jaycee.
B008RTE066|5.0|If this is that which I think it is, I've been awaiting it since the first VHS from the 80's. I first saw it in NYC at the Philharmonic in '69. Seems that it's due to be restored with care. Yay!

Don't waste your money like I did in the theater with my wife and 12 year old daughter. This movie has a terrible story, why would anyone want to see it or recommend it to a \\"friend\\", after sitting through this we all said the same thing, why? and what is the hype? Terrible Terrible Terrible ...
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|I can't say I really feel cheated like others are. I bought a CD for 9.00.  It just happens to be my favorite band has been since 1983.  I preordered and I really considered canceling it since their was nothing on here I have not heard before. I'd say its a neat package but as someone else pointed out they should have made the back match the front. I really like the Sweet Pain remix. It sounds alot better. Not because someone else guitar solo is on it. I don't care about that. The song sound more modern and clean. I never really liked Sweet Pain before, I like this remix version better. For the CD overall if you can part with 9.00 it might be worth your while. Its nice to have a clean version, however you can't the rawness and hunger heard in the original.  I would like to see Ezrin put his efforts into remixing the elder. I think the elder could rock harder just by taking all the vocals and un flanging them. Lift the guitars. Put more punch in the drums like C.O.T.N.  Just my opinion. For all of you fans who always want more, I want more too. However kiss is just a business now, so if they don't think they are going to make money off of it.  Its not going to happen. The KISS we are learned to love is dead.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|at first I fir not think I would like it cause its not really the kind of game I like to play. now I cant put it down. its simple to understand the concept of the game play.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app. Its really useful. It provides a lot of useful information. I was overall surprised. I definitely recommend this app.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I received the order promptly and the movie series is fun to own.  I don't own any other DVD's - I'm usually not a repeat movie watcher.  But with Harry Potter it's something else - I've also read the books 4 times - and I'm 44 years old, but don't feel like growing up in this situation.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this ap works great when you need to know how much time you have until it starts raining with its radar in motion feature
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Digital format worked out well. Good movie. I was able to start it one day and end it another with no problems. Enough said.
0316781657|3.0|A Suitable Boy is an intriguing book with many different story lines going on at the same time.  It would help to have knowledge of the Indian culture, the different religions, knowledge of Hindu words to understand the story better.  It is a very in depth novel that I would have enjoyed more if it had been condensed some.  The author did do an excellent job of pulling one into the story though so that one cared about the characters and their different outcomes at the end.

B0083GPDBO|1.0|My time could have better been spent cleaning a toilet.  What a waste of money to make this, it had potential to be a great story but the writers must have been drunk, high or both.
030758836X|2.0|I loved this book. Until about three-fourths of the way through. By then I'd had enough twists and turns to make me carsick and enough development of a bad marriage to make me heartsick. I was left feeling worn out and disappointed that two people could manipulate and malign each other so much that neither one is left with integrity. Instead, what we have is a thriller turned into a travesty. Instead of scary? It's so sad.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This story picks you up on the first page and takes you on the crazy adventures of two insanely different small time attorneys from a small \\"boutique\\" law firm in Chicago. The depth of character that John Grisham has rounded out these two men with, shines through on every page. A delightful read as they take on the most difficult case of their lives. Wonderful!

B005LAIGSC|5.0|I'm an action buff and enjoy a good 'who's the bad guy' story and this movie met all my expectations.  Two of my favorite actors did not disappointment me.  I prefer non-stop action because you can watch it over and over again and see scenes you may have missed.  Very pleased.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just could not put this book down. If you want romance and adventure this book definitely does the trick.
B003OHSFR6|5.0|Friends had read the girl with the Dragon Tattoo and raved about it, but had a hard time explaining why it was so good.  Then the movie came out so  I watched the movies the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and thought the movie was excellent.  Now I had to buy the Millennium Trilogy, and I could not put them down.  Let me put it this way, the Movie was just an appetizer, while the trio of books is a feast, and opens up the whole depth of the story.  Strange, captivating, goes off into dark areas but each book keeps you reading and wanting to turn the page and learn more about Lisbeth.  My friends were right, it is hard to explain exactly why these books are so good.  I  can only say that if you want to spend some time reading and getting deep into a character and her life, this trio of books are the ones to buy.  Even if you have seen the movie already, trust me read the book too.
030758836X|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book. Amy is a psycho & should be be in a psycho ward with no recourse.

B003VS0CYC|4.0|What more can you say, than Aside from Terminator, Robocop is another Badass to the Action Movie scene. Peter Weller Never lets you down as Alex Murphy, he totally nails the character and Now Icon that is Robo. Laugh and cheer on his performances as the metallic Cop from OCP in the crisp and excellent quality of Blu Ray. This Trilogy is worth the price even if Robocop Part 3 was a let down.
B008AWBQGW|4.0|This album offers very little in the way of sounding like cassic Lynyrd Skynyrd. Once or if one is able to get passed that, there's plenty to like here. I think this is the best album song for song that they've recorded since 1993's The Last Rebel. If you're wanting highlights, I'd recommend the following tracks: Last Of A Dyin' Breed, One Day At A Time, Homegrown, Honey Hole, Life's Twisted, Start Livin' Life Again and Do It Up Right (only available on the deluxe edittion). I listed 7 songs and I don't think I might have liked about that many songs in all between their last 2 studio albums (2003's Vicious Cycle and 2009's God & Guns). Oh, and about the criticism they've gotten for appearin Fox & Friends...get over it people. If Springsteen, The Eagles and countless other leftist artists can do fundraisrs for liberal candidates and not incur your wrath, then Skynyrd should be afforded that same respect.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My nephews loved this toy! My sister has said numerous times that the boys play with it all the time in the tub. They are 3 and 4. Great present for them!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read a lot of science fiction, including works by many of the finest writers who have graced that genre over the last several decades. Howey's work in the Wool series is an excellent story, built around a good concept. He explores a fasinating new setting and gives the characters some real depth. He's got a lot of room for additional stories in this setting, which I will be very eager to read. It's such a pleasure to discover new authors like Howey!
B006YTYIXG|5.0|this cd is awesome it gets you charged up and gives you something to think about at the same time. this is one of the best albums to date. and atleast it is not pop bs. wish i could give it 10 stars. max is awesome. wish there were more bands like this. death blow to pop
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is terrific. Of course.<br /><br />I didn't get around to immediately activating my Flixster/UV digital copy, PROBABLY BECAUSE the process was so bug-riddled and ridiculous when I did it with Part 1. It was infuriating and took days and their dubious technical \\"help\\" to complete, oh, and the process would work ONLY in one of my 3 browsers. Fail.<br /><br />Tonight I tried to do it with Part 2, and the required code is nowhere to be found in the Blu-Ray box. Yep, I was terribly irresponsible with a piece of paper at some point. And guess what? You can't just BUY a digital copy of this movie. Not here, not from iTunes, not from anywhere I know of. To get the damn movie on my iPad, I would have to buy the entire disc set again. Why in hell can't I simply buy a digital copy??? (Oh, and the region-free disc/digital combos being sold in the UK specify that the digital copy will only work there, not in the US.)<br /><br />This CRAP cannot die soon enough. Flixster/Ultraviolet has a complete monopoly on certain digital movies, and it ISN'T UP TO THE TASK. Somebody should buy Warner Bros. a clue. I would've grabbed the digital copy right away if I hadn't dreaded the whole process from the previous time. Oh, and while I'm ranting, the MPAA/RIAA wouldn't have such a problem with piracy if they stopped making it so completely impossible for people to USE WHAT THEY LEGALLY OWN.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game the only problem is that it is addictive.<br />it is awesome people.  A must get,!love it
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is a great series! I love the way the zombies are portrayed. Can't wait to watch season 2 and then go onto season 3.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game a little gory but still awesone note this review is by a13 year old. so of course gory is awesome
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Loved it! This movie has the action, adventure, suspense, romance and everything. This makes me want to read all the books. Now that Harry Potter is over [which it will always be my # 1]...this is my new book/movie fad!
0307949508|5.0|Larsson by far is one of the best author's that knows the art of transitioning the reader to the finale.  I checked this book out of my puclic library, because I was in the process of buying a Kindle.  This book tought me that even when Lisbeth Salander does less, it is more.  From Mickael to the newly introduced characters, Lisbeth brands her oddly and bold way of being on everyone.  You would think that through her problems in this book she would need an army to save the damsel in destress.  Please, Salander is a damn hornet and of course she does not need anybody, but in this case she only needed the loyalty of a little acquaintances she has.  The one thing I loved about this book is how Salander had about five people on her side, when she only saw one of them as her friend.  The ending made my teeth grit and had me cursing at Larsson with a twisted smile on my face.  He really knows how to tease his readers to pick up the last book The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Downloaded this app and it set off a threat warning in my security app. I immediately uninstalled it. Leaves too much open for unauthorized access.
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|If you check the details and email the specific sellers, you will find that despite being made and such in the UK, some copies are region free. I bought mine and it plays well here in North America! Totally works on my bluray player, and its a very good movie. I waited for years for them to make it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Only issue I have is I would like to 'pin' it.  Doesn't seem to want to stay.  I haven't had the problems noted by other KF users.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I just got this app so I'm not entirely sure how it works. I hope that it does what most reviews say it does. tell me when it needs to be charged and for how long I also hope it alerts me when its done charging that would be amazeballs! sorry but for now I'm gonna leave it at 4 stars. excited!!!!!!!!!! this is going to be good.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app is feature full and does its job well. There are many different widgets and screens. I rely on it for my weather information.
145210655X|5.0|Hilarious! Any true Star Wars fan, especially a parent, should order this book now. Short, but cute and worth the price.  Very highly recommended.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is a good time pass game. Fun to play with another person. Playing the computer gets boring quickly. The sound effects and video effect are good on a tablet.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! I read it over and over again. I cannot wait till walking disaster comes out. Jamie is such an amazing writer.
B0057UD49M|4.0|Why? Because many of the pages have text that, in the Kindle edition, is too small and dim to read. Even with a magnifying glass! Unfortunately a lot of indecipherable passages come late in the book and make the ending--to me, at least--incomprehensible.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|works great on kindle fire. like being able to change battery colors. keeps history of kindle as well... great app
B00005Y6YB|5.0|One of the best westerns, for that matter one of the best movies EVER.  The actors truly bring the characters to life and there is an on-screen chemistry between all of them.  EXCELLENT! Be sure you have plenty of time to watch it all--you won't want to stop until it's over!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Incredibly unique, pleasant surprise. The characters had such depth and presence for such short books.  I want to stay with them in their story.
B004FOA84A|3.0|not as fun as other fire maple games but worth the dollar.  hints aren't helpful and puzzles are weaker than their other products.  but a relaxing entertainment nonetheless.
B004FQX59I|2.0|It looks to me as if Mike Rooker is in the same boat as James(Beverly Hills Cop, Extremeties, We're No Angels)Russo. Bad Guy Bad Guy Bad Guy. Only with Micael Rooker it's, Mississippi Burning, Sea of Love, etc. It really wasn't neccessary to (In this Version) expose The Character of Bill Brousard of being linked to The Conspierancy It Self. I Really Disliked that Airport Scene where Kevin Costner was giving holy hell to Mike Rooker. At least in the original version, Bill seemed to Genuinly be on the same side as Jim Garretson. Bil Brousard was the one who found out that Clay Shaw was Clay Bertrand, wasn't he? Also, it was clear that the FBI was Blackmailing Bill. Remember the scene where Bill is holding the umbrella, and the FBI guy approached him and told him to get in the car? \\"Oswald diddn't pull that trigger, Castro Did. But if that comes out, there's going to be a war. Millions of people are going to die\\". Remember that line? I also don't believe that sentence in the credits claiming that it was discovered that Bill Brousard was working with the CIA from the get go. In my opinion that was just a bunch of Political Sour Grapes by Oliver Stone. This Movie was based on conjector not facts. And don't ever get me started on that Dick Cavett Movie on Elvis. That was a classic example of \\"Diarrhea of the Pen\\" Anyway,is there anyone out there in Holliwood, come Christmas Season willing to give Michael Rooker a roll of Santa Clause. And lets see James Russo playing some aging detective. Bottom line, I don't know who i sympathised with more, The character himself or the actor playing him.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|I bought this device about a month ago and have been using it to transfer old family tapes to digital format.  The device is definitely a bit flimsy but I found it very easy to set up and use.  So far I have transferred about 15 tapes and have not encountered any problems with it.  The Audacity software is pretty self-explanatory and you can download it off the web for free without having to use the enclosed mini disk. I would recommend this for anybody who needs an easy way to transfer a few tapes.  It is probably too flimsy for anything too heavy-duty, but so far it has held up well.
0670827592|5.0|I loved this story when I was younger, so I naturally had to buy it for my daughter who is 4. I told her she had a book coming in the mail and we checked every day to see when it would get here! She was so excited to read it and was not disappointed! She told all her extended family about how she loved the book and made them listen to her version of the story! Very cute! I think she'll appreciate this book more when she is older because it still appeals to me!! My transaction on Amazon.com was super smooth! The seller that I bought this book from, wasted little time shipping it! Everything about the transaction was a delight! And the book is a treasure!
B00846REIS|5.0|One of my friends suggested this book weeks ago.  Like many, we have both read the Fifty series.  She had nothing but wonderful things to say about this book.  I finally bought it yesterday morning and by 11:30pm the same day, I had finished it. I was totally enamored with Gideon's character from first meeting him. And,like the Fifty series I realize that despite the sexual components of the book there IS an underlying story.  We have Eva's story, now we need Gideon's.  I have my suspicions but I am anxiously looking forward to the next book.  Can two people with similar painful pasts find each other...yes?  After reading some of the above posts, realistically, I don't think either gender expects this sexual behavior out of each other. But, I would hope that finding unconditional love, trust, and honesty are general expectations of a relationship between two people...and, I believe that is what Gideon and Eva are eventually searching for.  We all have our demons, as do they.  Wonderful story, easy read!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|As a Wicked groupie,this CD feeds my inner Elphaba!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE the songs!!!  Original cast. Can't wait to see it a third time next month!  Couldn't find this CD in stores.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game..... easy and hard levels; you really have to think first before you move..... super brain tease!!!!
B00474GUEA|3.0|This is a message to the 1st reviewer.  Dude, more like 25 years too late!  You're giving this WAY too much credit for what it is.  It's rip-off rendition redux of 3 & 4 chord 80's synth pop.  There is NOTHING groundbreaking about it.  You really need to stop being lazy & use your internet to search out & listen to the groups that actually pioneered this stuff.  I'm not trying to bash you or your tastes.  This album is OK, but to say it is ahead of it's time is insulting.  Why didn't it \\"blow up\\"?  because it's been done 10,000 times before.  Sorry man, but I'm rating this for what it IS and not for the hype.  There is barely any substance to this.  If you'd like a jumpstart then maybe start with the Cocteau Twins & go from there.  Hope this helps.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best best best best game.when I play it ;it make me fill like I'm in the game the end.
B004LROUNG|4.0|For those early morning cross country flights,  knowIng your overbooked, when sleeping is not an option.<br />This story allows you to avoid conversation, by taking you into another Grisham journey.
0738735027|5.0|This Tarot deck is a welcome interpretation for feline-loving fortunetellers like me.  The symbolism follows the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, with nature images and cats added, so non-Pagans won't be uncomfortable using this deck.  I like the handy size of the mini-decks, so useful for carrying in a purse for on-the-fly consultations.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Very fun. its one of my favorite games by gameloft. helps you pass a lot of time.<br />e f s
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I play this all the time. I have other Manning games but always come back to this one. I find it very challenging.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this film and it was a fun twist to the original Planet of the Apes idea.
B006M6NUBC|1.0|I admit that I like dumb films. Corny humor, hammy acting, gratuitous sex and violence, it's all good. In fact, I don't like arty cinema at all. Movies are made for our baser instincts and trying to elevate them is just pretense.<br /><br />However, this isn't a movie -- it's violence porn. There's a little bit of set up so that you can get the lotion and tissues out, and then about a half-hour of solid pointless and unrealistic violence. While the violence is well-choreographed and like a good ballet is fascinating for the eyes, it also makes comic book characters out of humans who survive things that no human could, and then get up and do it again.<br /><br />If you thought the movies of the 1980s where Chuck Norris blasted his way through a whole island with two clips from his M-16 were dumb, this movie will peak your dumb-o-meter. It's not bad, it's just stupid. The plot makes no sense. The characters are one-dimensional and even not believable. The interesting fighter, Jet Li, gets treated like a 1900s Chinese laundry stereotype and is totally underutilized; in addition, they turn Jason Statham into a chav and make him act out junior high school drama as if he took it seriously.<br /><br />I hope the actors were really well paid. I hope no aliens above earth see this thing, because if they rain death upon us on the basis of this artifact of film, it will be a justified death. You must turn off your brain to watch this movie, and in fact, it's better if you just shoot yourself through the frontal lobes. That might make \\"The Expendables\\" believable, but nothing can take away its earth-shaking stupidity.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I bought this book for my 10-yr. old son since he enjoyed all the Percy Jackson series in the past.  Presently he is reading this book and tells me how he likes the story so far.  It's easy to identify with the characters who are of his age with similar problems and sense of bravery.  It's always encouraging for kids to see how friendships can defeat hardship.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like the display of the battery it helps keep me informed of how much is left. I like this app .I recomande it.<br />enjoy this app
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|5&#9733;s I would rate more no glitches and its amazing id pay millions for this it rocks its the best app on the market
B0083GCK5G|5.0|After 50 years, a long list of legal battles, two tragic deaths, and a lot of music the Beach Boys have released a collection of music that, to me, is their best since Pet Sounds. Lots of co-writes (Jim Peterik of Ides of March and Survivor), Bon Jovi, and others add to the quality of tunes presented here. No filler tracks here.<br /><br />There is a bittersweet feeling throughout the disc.  A realization that life is moving on, but a celebration of all that has been. Perhaps it was not coincidence that Brian turned 70 just a few weeks after this disc was released.<br /><br />I would urge the listener to go straight through the CD top to bottom, as it is a concept disc. While the title track is a lot of fun (it even had me nostalgic for that old am radio in a Ford station wagon), it is the final three songs, From There to Back Again, Pacific Coast Highway, and Summer's Gone that bring me back time and again; perhaps because I'm older too.
1935670913|1.0|There is a key piece of advice crucial to his success that he left out of this book: pay readers to leave fake reviews. In an interview with Locke in today's New York Times, he admitted that he paid for 300 reviewers to heap praise on his books,  a sleazy promotional technique that  seems to have worked for him. Locke admits to buying reviews because \\"Reviews are the smallest piece of being successful, but it's a lot easier to buy them than cultivating an audience.\\" I have some advice for Locke on a more honest and ethical approach he might want to try: Actually write good books. That's how to build an audience. You do not gain readers, or recognition, by swindling readers into buying your books with fake praise. It's unethical and shows a startling lack of respect for your reader.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I can edit pica well,  just cant save them,  put them on facebook,  so what good are they.  Sorry, have to remove already,  great idea,  just need some work.
B004HU6YZ4|5.0|If you want Heaven and Hell then put in Heaven and Hell, but considering the age of members and the progression of their music and polished recording quality, I think it's pretty darn good. Take the album for what it is, don't hold it to standards and compare it to their previous releases. It's not Sex, Love, and Rock 'n' Roll part 2. The dude has been pumping out rock for ages, let him be old and do his thing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this every night. this helps me so much when I'm going to sleep. I told my neighbor about it and she uses it for her kids.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoyed the thrill of having to unlock games by playing other games. my only complaint is the controls. In some cases it was just stiff. Using a touch screen my finger would be in the way at times making some games a lil difficult.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the lifestyle section of this app it tells you if your  arthritis is gonna act up and if your wife's hair is gonna be horrible. the radar is clear and precise and the hour by hour forecast lets you see if you can put laundry on the line.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game is nice but the ads are a pain in the neck. But if that is the only way I. can get the game for free, then so be it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I drift off to sleep so peacefully with this app. I find my rest to be better than I could have imagined.What a difference!!
B0086700CM|5.0|i think this game is awsome on ipad and kindle fire and the ifhone 4 s and ipodtouch and my best score was 9897653211
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I initially rated this app very poorly but I discovered a supplemental app on the google app market which allows ezPDF Reader to import files from the Google Drive. Now it works perfect and is only hindered by the ability to write on a tablet screen with a stylus. The program is excellent and works just as it says. It allows Android users the same ability that IPad users have been bragging about- the ability to save edit files saved in PDF and make handwritten notes. Easy to use. Well worth the price in my opinion.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|My micro usb cable that came with my kindle has fallen apart.  I have never seen a cable completely disintegrate like this one did.  The white plastic coating just fell off.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I was a late comer to this series. I randomly decided to buy the season 1 dvd, because I had a gift card to Best Buy to use up. Since then, I have obsessed. I own all of the first series figures, all of the novels to date, 30+ of the comic books, have a dual photo pic of me, Jon Bernthal (Shane), Norman Reedus (Daryl)...always looking to add more stuff. Enough about that, this is the best zombie show made. You get the character build up, the actual way people would deal in a situation had it actually happened. Hell, I even got a Zombie Survival Kit. This show takes a hold of you, and doesn't let go. I highly recommend this series if you love suspense.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|I did not know much about Frida Kahlo, so I decided to watch this movie.  I did not have much of an opinion of her; her body or work was okay, she wore long, traditional Mexican dresses and she had been married to Diego Rivera.  The movie did a good job of depicting her story in a way I could understand.  Now when I think of her artwork I know to look a little deeper and can better interpret her emotions.  The miscarriage explains a lot.  It is also interesting to see the development of political ideas and the passion that comes with it.  The exposure to another culture in helpful, in this ever smaller world we live in.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|Yes, this is a comparison type review.  While there is a lot to be said for the production design of the American production (gives more of a sense of chill), miscasting was a total disaster.  The Swedish version reigns supreme.<br /><br />I just had to stop watching this DVD at the point when (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) the investigative reporter beds the mysterious young Miss Salander.  Oh, GAWD, like we needed that to move the story?  To justify to moronic Americans how the reporter could possibly want to help her?<br /><br />With way too much obvious and dull dialogue, this American version has no subtlety.<br /><br />The writing of dialogue is not the only wooden object in this waste of money.  Hollywood's Rooney Mara delivers none of the charisma and fascination turned on by Noomi Rapace.  Daniel Craig's pseudo Swedish accent sometimes gives way to working class London at odd times.  It's incredibly distracting (far more distracting than dealing with English subtitles over the Swedish).<br /><br />And you just can't cast Christopher Plummer in anything like this, because all you're seeing is Christopher Plummer the icon.
B007L24T52|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favourite authors and never fails to impress me.  This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  Non stop action; would make a really good movie!
B004AUGJS8|3.0|The first half of this film is compelling, well acted and well scripted, all with some first class production design to really bring alive 1970s New York. Kirsten Dunst was exceptional in her role in the movie and brings warmth and depth to the love story and some subtleties to explain why the relationship fails.<br /><br />Unfortunately, once she leaves the story, it falls apart dramatically. Ryan Gosling's character - the protagonist until the mid-point - quickly becomes unlikable and fairly boring. The film then starts to focus on his involvement with a second-tier character that overshadows the real questions raised in the first half. And then there's a really dull trial that provides an excuse for voice-over at the beginning but becomes the focal point at the end.<br /><br />Ultimately the story offers no real insights or answers about a man who destroys the lives of so many around him. It might have been better to drop the \\"inspired by true events\\" title card in favor of some creative license to offer the audience some sort of satisfaction in the way the events play out. Still, this is not a bad film by any means but by the end it feels like a missed opportunity.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Uniwar is a strategy game that reminds me a bit of good old Dune II from twenty years ago.  It's fairly complex, so I expect to be learning a lot, but it's fun.
0465068367|4.0|An excellent book on a much under studied/reported part of WWII.  Well resourced and documented.  Provides great insight into one of the darkest atrocities of the Pacific Theater.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I love Justin bieber but everytime I go on The Belieber radio it never works its okay but it doesn't always work.
1780221355|5.0|This is one of the best fiction books I've read in a long time. Flynn has a wonderful command of tone, pacing, and language. I was sucked in from page one and I could not put it down until the end. Definitely worth reading and discussing!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a minimal calculator this is definitely an excellent app.  From the first use it requires little effort to operate. The look and feel are very aesthetic and User friendly.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|Prior to \\"Banga\\", I was a casual Patti Smith listener, more interested in her place in Rock history than in her actual music. Sure, I got \\"Horses\\" and I loved \\"Because The Night\\" along with her occasional appearances with her boyfriend (at the time) Allan Lanier on Blue Oyster Cult albums (notably Vera Gemini).<br /><br />That's all changed with this recording. WOW, WOW, and WOW a hundred times. This is a record of incredible depth and beauty. There's such a breadth of focus and style that I haven't heard in a long long time. There isn't one bad song; from the wonderful April Fool and the epic Constantine's Dream to the tasteful Neil Young's \\"After The Gold Rush\\" as the perfect CODA to a perfect record. I AM FLOORED. Constantine's Dream, while not something I'm going to be whistling to while I shower, is astounding piece, especially given that Smith is singing this off-the-cuff: stream-of-consciousness. It's A LOVE SUPREME meets Rock.<br /><br />Again. WOW. DO NOT MISS THIS!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another Grisham masterpiece.....lawyerly accurate and very fuuny at times...you can see the characters, if you close your eyes!!!! A little predictable, but a great read nonetheless.
B005LAII6C|5.0|While maintaining a steady sense of humor from beginning to end ParaNorman is a many layered, very profound movie, that, quite frankly, is a masterpiece! The only movie this year, as of August 2012, that I will purchase to add to my film collection! Towards the end of ParaNorman, it was so moving tears were coming to my eyes! What an incredibly pleasant surprise!<br /><br />I have to admit that I was concerned that ParaNorman would lead to insulting or trivializing the Wiccan/Pagan/Spiritualist/Paranormal community! But just the opposite happened! If you are Pro Healing, Pro Courage, Pro Forgiveness, Pro Spiritual, Pro Witch, Pro Gay, and Pro Paranormal, like I am, then make sure you see this film before it leaves the theaters. Films this good don't usually last in mainstream theaters for very long. For example, the only other great film that I've seen this year - [[ASIN:B008220AGC Beasts of the Southern Wild]] has been showing only on single screen in the Baltimore City & County, an area of over a million people!<br /><br />Thank you Hollywood for sticking your neck out by making a movie for grown-ups, while at the same time making a film you can take the entire family to see!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:1565543467 Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History]] and [[ASIN:1401064116 Nothing Better Than Death: Insights From 62 Profound Near-Death Experiences]] and [[ASIN:0870498134 Halloween Other Festivals: Death And Life]]
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|The story of a man who hunts grey wolves for hire in Alaska and then becomes hunted by the wolves himself. The main character has recently lost his wife and suffers deep depression over it. The story unfolds with believable characters and suspense.  Some of the behaviors of the wolves is less believable. Good acting, beautiful scenery, and a surprise ending add up to worthwhile entertainment experience.
0393061310|5.0|I read this book over two years ago and still lean on it as a point of reference in my mind.  This book is unique in a sense that this is history written from the point of view of an anthropologist.  I didn't find this book to be biased in a political sense, although Mr. Diamond certainly has and is entitled to his own professional bias. I also didn't find this book anti-Western in any sense. Mr. Diamond doesn't deny that Westerners deserve credit for the advancements they made.  He simply seeks to explain why these advances happened in one locale and not another, by one set of people but not by another.<br />Although I read a lot of history books, here, for the first time, I read a comprehensive account of the origins of food production and basic agricultural technology, and how they impacted the development of civilization.<br />This is a thick book but it is worth your time if you are intellectually curious.
B007F7QG0Y|4.0|Keith Richards' autobiography evoked hugely contradictory responses in me.  Yes this is one massive roller coaster of a read and wow, he is a smart guy who can write beautifully.  But when I came up for breath about halfway through I began to ask what it was all about, really.  The early part of his story is very interesting reflecting the grim realities of postwar England.  The creation of the  Rolling Stones and explosion of youthful excesses in Swinging London is also fascinating cultural history.  And when Keith shares his passion for music, it is clear that his is a prodigious talent. All well and good.<br /><br />But then it just goes on and on - the excesses, the hedonism and the self absorption.  I can recall one account of altruism when he saves the life of an early girl friend, but thereafter it is just me, me, me.  Brian's death barely rates a paragraph.  Mick Jagger only features when Keith wants to attack his ego, insecurities or other personal dysfunctionality.  Yet it is Mick who gives Keith's son his first ever hamburger after months on the road with Keith - the boy serving effectively as his dad's keeper.  And aside from the pharmacy that accompanied Keith everywhere, there was also a small armory he took with him.  What was that all about, Keith?<br /><br />So in the end, I stopped reading.  I felt compromised by it all.  Perhaps he redeems himself in some people's eyes through this book.  But for me, enough already.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|One day they will put out a 3D version w/extended Blu-ray scenes and special features about the making of the movie.  That's when I'll buy it.  This multiple edition crap only goes to show the greed involved with this movie.  No respect at all for the fans!  Five stars for movie itself and 3 for this edition.
B005FISBTO|1.0|So I've waited about a year to buy season 6 of Dexter.  Disk one has a bunch of previews for Showtime that you cannot forward through.  One of the previews is the last scene of Dexter season 6...the one I am watching...it basically ruins the whole season, I would say what it is but i dont want to ruin it for anyone else.  If you buy this, do not watch the beginning showtime previews or the whole season of Dexter (6) will be ruined. So friggen aggrivating!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is awesome and very challengeing at time but. make boredom go away very fast and I love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a great family or individual game. Even if you dont know the movie, its still fun. You can buy extras to complete tasks faster but you dont have to spend real money.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|It is refreshing to see how sushi is properly prepared, and this presents it in a very informed way. Most westerners tend to think that sushi is just raw fish. Jiro and his colleagues show that this isn't the case.<br /><br />The film provides an insight into Japanese thought as well as culture that goes much deeper than strangers of Japan are aware of. This isn't just about sushi; it's about a man's entire life, the way he has built it and spent it. It presents a strong sense of continuity and dedication, as well as the need for change (in the the way that fishing industry is affecting nature, producer, and consumer).<br /><br />The way \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is filmed is pleasantly different from normal documentaries. The camera techniques are unique among this type of film and it is all presented with music that keeps it moving and absent of boredom.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought this was an amazing book. Once i started reading i was hooked. I could not put this book down. Normally i can't get myself to enjoy vilolent stories but this book i liked.<br />  One thing that really helped me get hooked to this book was that these were kids my age. Then als to kow that the were fighting for the capitol. When i heard that one of these kids had got killed i really felt sad. And i started thinkin about how these peoples brothers and sisters acted, after there brother/sistr got killed. Then i thought about it from the parents view on it is the capitols fault that my kid has been killed.<br />  I really like readingg books that i can have a connection to. I plan on reading catching fire and mockingjay.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Love this movie. It's not quite an \\"indie\\" film but it wasn't a big budget blockbuster either. The acting is good and the concept and way the movie flows is absolutely great. Even if you're not going to buy it, I would definitely recommend finding some way to at least watch it if you haven't already seen it.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|MOST OF THE DEATH ROW, NAZI SCIENTIST, CHILD MOLESTER FREAKS ON EARTH WOULDN'T FIND A LITTLE 13 YEAR GIRL GET HACKED UP BY A MUSCULAR 19 YEAR OLD MIDDLE LINEBACKER ENTERTAINING.  YET THIS MOVIE EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE A TV AUDIENCE OF MILLIONS AND THE RULING GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ENTERTAINED BY THIS INSTEAD OF REPULSED.  THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT GOVERNMENT RUN DEATH MATCHES AIRED ON TV FOR ENTERTAINMENT.  FOR NO LOGICAL REASON, THE RANDOMLY SELECTED GLADIATORS ARE TEENAGERS. THESE HAPLESS KIDS ARE THE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE WHO OPPOSED THE GOVERNMENT IN A PREVIOUS WAR.  THE GLADIATORS IN ROME WERE GROWN MEN FIGHTING EACH OTHER.  EVEN THAT BARBARIC PRACTICE OF ROUNDING UP BEGGARS AND THIEVES TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR ENTERTAINMENT DOESN'T APPROACH THIS.  I CAN'T STAND MOVIES WHERE THE BAD GUYS ARE PURE EVIL WITH NO REDEEMING VALUE.  IN THIS THING, VIRTUALLY EVERY CITIZEN AND THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL VILLAIN.  WOULDN'T IT BE MORE ENTERTAINING TO SEE TRAINED, POWERFUL MEN FIGHT TO THE DEATH ON TV THAN TERRIFIED LITTLE GIRLS?  EVEN MOST HORROR MOVIES TODAY DON'T SHOW LITTLE KIDS GETTING HACKED UP; AND MOVIES AREN'T EVEN REAL.  THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE REAL.  DON'T THE PEOPLE IN THE TV AUDIENCE OR GOVERNMENT HAVE KIDS OF THEIR OWN.  WOULDN'T THEY FEEL COMPASSION FOR THE KIDS IN THE GAMES WHO REMIND THEM OF THE KIDS IN THEIR OWN HOMES?  OF COURSE THEY WOULD!!!!!!!!!! THERE WERE SOME GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE; BUT THE CONCEPT IS JUST TO RIDICULOUS FOR ME. WHY PICK 13 YEAR OLDS INSTEAD OF 25 YEAR OLDS?  IT MAKES NO SENSE!  PEOPLE SEE CHILDREN AS INNOCENT.  THEY AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PARENTS CRIMES.  ESPECIALLY NOT A CRIME LIKE TREASON!  THERE ISN'T EVEN A RACIAL ELEMENT TO THEIR DEHUMINIZATION AS THERE WAS WITH THE MASSACRE OF NATIVE PEOPLE OR AFRICAN SLAVERY.  THEY LOOK AND TALK JUST LIKE THE KIDS OF THE PARENTS IN THE AUDIENCE.  WHY WOULD THE EVIL GOVERNMENT PICK KIDS FOR THIS!  IT MAKES NO SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I received my watch this past Friday and subsequently used it during a 10K this morning. Right out of the box the battery was 2% so I stuck it on the charger and three hours later I had a full charge. I am unsure how long the charge actually took to reach full, I'll have to explore that later. First, right out of the box was a simple venture. I changed the band right away to the larger velcro band, which was as easy as the Garmin video illustrated. The tools are provided as are the pins; just make sure to use the correct pins. I took the existing band off first and mixed up the pins. Even so, it only took five minutes to change it up. Next I registered my Garmin and signed up for Garmin Connect and configured the watch to my personal profile. Again, easy to do. No offense intended, but my 74 year old father picked up his Ipod and immediately had control of it and this watch is no different. I am NOT comparing the bezel to the Ipod per se, but it is very similar although it requires more touch than the easy finesse of the Ipod. In less than five minutes I was configured. You need to go on Garmin Connect to refine things like weight (it only excepts 5 lbs increments in the watch menu) and to input your resting heart rate. The software took less than two minutes to install and the watch was recognized immediately. I am using Windows XP SP3 on a 2005 Gateway computer. The heart rate monitored was detected instantly and I was amazed at how quickly the satellites get you up and running. In 30 seconds I had a full line of satellites and my accuracy was down to 18 ft. Not bad for a watch with a small antenna in a neighborhood with houses and large trees on both sides. I get a good signal in my house as well. I have found that in order to select one of the four options around the bezel I have to touch the bezel firmly. Navigating the menus in each section are fairly straight forward and the touching the bezel to select things is easier than the initial selection of the section. The dual finger touch required to illuminate the backlight is a nice feature as that is a battery hog. I have found the backlight to be bright and crisp. Using the watch during the 10K was easy as well. Instead of setting up an activity in Garmin Connect I chose to hit the start button when I crossed the starting apron and stopped it at the finish. What I really love about this watch is that it alerted me as I hit every mile and it defaults to start a new lap every mile. That way you know the exact pace you had during each mile of the race. It was also nice because I knew where I was, but if your one of those people who doesn't want a reminder that you have x-miles to go you can change the alerts to almost any customization you want. Me, I like the mile counting and the pace. I used the default screen with time, pace, and distance. I love the summary screen under history. When I got to the recovery area, I selected history and it had my total time, average pace, distance covered, max heart rate and calories burned. Those are the most important things to know right off the bat and the display was such that I could see everything. I kept it on HR to cooldown and monitor my recovery so I drained the battery a bit more. Two hours of use and the battery drained 25% so not bad because there were inadvertant illuminations of the backlight while I was tinkering prior to the race and I kept taking it out of standby mode to play with it. The standby mode is excellent. I can say for myself that it saves the battery from a user like me. When I got home I went straight into the office and in less than a minute had my race downloaded in Garmin Connect. I love all the maps, the graph of heart rate, pace, elevation etc. Phenomenal amount of information. You have each lap displayed, which you can also do on the watch itself, but it helps to see all the info on the computer. I have been a GPS user as a military aviator and research scientist and I trust Garmin. When the race organizers mark a race they are very accurate because some of these qualify for national races. A 10K is 6.21 miles and my watch registered 6.16. An overall accuracy rate of 99.2%. The course ran through downtown Youngstown, OH where we have tall buildings that will definitely wreak havoc on a gps signal; running in a big city like NY all bets are off, but I had a great signal even in my house. The park the course went through also has substantial tree cover so I am stoked with the accuracy. To recap 1) easy to use out of the box to include setup and transferring data, 2) easy to use on a race course with good information being passed to you right out of the box, 3) excellent transfer of activity results from the watch to computer, 4) outstanding accuracy and battery life. I sweat and the temperature was not very hot so I didn't experience the crazy watch, but unless your constantly touching the bezel then you should not have a problem. Also, the bezel lock feature works well. I will detail more of my experiences as I use the watch. One thing I am going to enjoy is doing my intervals on a local trail now that I can configure the watch to alert me to recovery periods and rely on it to know my distances. You can't get easier than that. My days with a timex watch and the local high school track are done. Additionally, I didn't even know it was on my wrist. It is slightly larger than an Ironman triathalon watch and weighs little more. The band was comfortable and the alerts were loud enough that I heard them along the course. I think my calorie estimation was pretty good given Garmin's method for determining calorie burn, but you never know.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|I just wasted a couple hours of gameplay on this free app of the day because I accidentally touched the two buttons that restarted my mission. How can it be so easy to erase such progress? I had already lost another hour (these are guesstimates) because the game could not resume from where I had left off when I did not exit the game each time I went to do something else.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a fantastic turn-based game that reminds me of why I loved Warcraft and Red Alert, almost two decades ago.
B0058WFO06|2.0|I'm a big Porcupine Tree fan, and I have to say I greatly prefer PTree to Steven's solo work.  I gave this a couple of listens, but I'm sorry, to me this is just boring. (although there's some good playing on it).  It's nowhere near as good as the King Crimson that he's obviously heavily influenced by these days.  Luminol (from the upcoming DVD) sounds pretty good, certainly better than anything on this album in my opinion.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Despite that it was poorly marketed (the main reason I didn't see it on the big screen and now wish I had!), John Carter (of Mars) is a charming movie with the same hopeful message that I experienced in the book by Edgar Rice Burroughs which I enjoyed as a boy.  The aliens were entirely believable--perhaps occasionally more-so than their live acting counterparts but visually it was appealing and the action was character driven AND there was plenty of it.  They changed the storyline to make Burroughs' original epic more modern in terms of real-world knowledge without destroying any of the innocence about alien worlds that existed when he wrote it in the early part of the twentieth century.  Sadly, the title should have remained true to the book for die-hard fans and the absence of \\"Mars\\" in the final title seems to reflect ignorance on the part of the marketing team/people in charge, but if you enjoyed the book series for what it was (idealistic hero type romp) then you should enjoy this movie.<br /><br />And I give two thumbs up to the creators/animators and voices of the four-armed green-skinned martians who made the movie amazingly fun! (They should have earned a five out of five rating alone, but there were a couple of live-actors who could have used with some animating themselves, though even they were passably good.)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love my Kindle and got it second hand. I doubt if the person left this out intentionally, but it is a must. Love it.
0316743305|5.0|This is the best behind the scenes book I have read. We as a people of this wonderful country I love have no idea what our people in the military go through to protect us.We have no idea what goes on in the upper echelons of government and our military leaders and the defense contractors who think up all these cerebral things to act and counter-attack our adversaries. Great book that puts a whole new light on the importance of having an astute commander-in- chief.<br />I could hardly put the book down.

0812550706|5.0|I read Ender's Game when I was young and a few days ago I decided to read it again. I was maybe 11 when I first read it, and I remember feeling that Card understood how an intelligent child thinks and how they perceive the other less intelligent children around them who enjoy preying on the weak. I'm not sure if the reason why children seem cowardly and cruel is because as an adult you can choose your company, or because people who have these traits lose them as they become adults. I think that educators would be well served by reading this book, and I agree with Card that Ender's Game asserts the personhood of children.<br /><br />In the introduction to the book, Card explains how the idea for the zero gravity Battle Room was his starting point for the book. The book isn't centred on the Battle Room, but once he thought of it he could then come up with a character who used it and build a story around that character. Card is a good writer and I enjoyed and benefited from reading his introduction to the book.

1936608898|5.0|One of the best nuts and bolts books on eating there is today.  The concepts are simple (you may not want to believe that at the beginning of the 30 days, but they are) and they are effective.  Eliminating from your diet all things that could be causing you problems, and then reintroducing them into your diet to see what they ACTUALLY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE is a basic concept that most people have simply passed over in their quest for better health. If you get out of this book what you should you will realize that it is YOUR responsibility to eat what YOUR body processes well.
0425263908|2.0|***Normally, I NEVER leave reviews.  The similarities of this book with Fifty Shades was too much to ignore.  I wanted others to realize it before purchasing the book.<br /><br />I just finished the Fifty Shades Trilogy a few weeks ago.  Bared to You was the next book I started reading.  I know that sometimes, after reading a very good book (or series of books), starting a new author/book is difficult.  Based on my interest in Fifty Shades, I decided to give Bared to You a try...<br /><br />Immediately, it was like reading a slightly different version of Fifty Shades.  I continued reading Bared to You, deciding to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I am now slightly more than half-way through the novel and there are just TOO MANY similarities.<br /><br />Here are a few that I have noticed.  This list is not exhaustive:<br /><br />1. Gideon Cross vs. Christian Grey  GC vs. CG (same letters in initials)<br />2. Cross Industries and Grey Enterprise Holdings (last name for company)<br />3. Eva vs. Ana (similar sounding names for leading lady)<br />4. Gideon has one brother and one sister, just like Christian<br />5. Gideon says \\"Mine\\" in intimate situations with Eva, just like Christian and Ana<br />6. Gideon uses \\"bedroom boys\\" like Christian (I'm not to the point in book where this is explained - if it is)<br />7. Gideon makes sure Eva has a cell phone and tries to pay for it, Christian purchases a phone for Ana<br />8. Gideon appears to have an interest in spanking, although I have not reached this in the book - if it happens.  Christian is very into spanking<br /><br />I understand some of these similarities may be attributed to the history of abuse.  For example, the use of bedroom boys and a need for security/possessiveness and stating \\"mine\\".  If that is the case, then I think the author could have spent some time thinking of a different way to introduce these similarities.  I actually found myself expecting certain things to happen based on what took place in the Fifty Shades novels.<br /><br />I also felt that Gideon and Eve's relationship went too quickly.  In less than a week they were saying \\"I love you\\" and spending the night with each other like they were a couple.  Gideon frequently expressed his NEED for her to be there.  Even with a history of abuse, I expect some caution in relationships.  I did not expect them to fall into a relationship so quickly with their histories and their complicated needs/anxieties.<br /><br />Christian and Ana advanced quickly in their relationship as well but it was evident how unusual and uncomfortable it was to Ana.  With every next large step their relationship took, Ana spent a lot of time considering and worrying about it.  That seems more likely a process than just becoming a couple like Gideon and Eva.  It just does not seem logical for Gideon to change his whole lifestyle after ONE DAY of meeting Eva.  Christian made significant changes to his lifestyle, but it was not all at once. Christian still tried to implement certain aspects of his old life into his life with Ana, until he realized that it did not work with Ana.<br /><br />On the brighter side, Bared to You is a fairly good book.  I have continued to read it in hopes that maybe it will differ enough towards the end to justify the purchase.  Maybe, after setting the framework for the storyline, the second book with be significantly different.<br /><br />My intention is NOT to keep others from reading this book.  I just want others to realize the similarities, especially if they have just read Fifty Shades.  It is honestly like re-reading Fifty Shades over in some instances.  Not nearly as exciting and mind blowing as Fifty Shades (since this is the second go around).  If that is your intent...then I suggest you look elsewhere.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The smaller initial puzzles train you for larger, more challenging ones.  And there challenges!  Very nice play that works perfectly on the Kindle Fire.  Very addictive!  You can skip puzzles and come back to them later.  Very, very nice for a free game.<br />--<br />Eric

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I really didn't know anything about Joe Bonamassa.<br />I saw this at a friends house the other night (non-blu ray). Without a doubt in my mind Joe is the best known rock - blues/rock guitarist of the day. I had not realized how well he can sing also. There are some simply stunning moments. His duet with Clapton on \\"Further On Up the Road\\" is just incredible and Bonamassa plays as good as the master. There are many, many other standout performances here. He's the real deal, a very rare talent, enormously gifted. What comes across is that this guy is very humble and extremly  hard working. He's not a virtuoso Diva who takes his talent for granted. I kook forward to hearing more from him<br />My buddy had the audio piped through his stereo and the sound was pitch perfect.
B000UJ48O0|3.0|The packaging for this product is TERRIBLE. Whoever designed it, did not take into account the banging it gets during shipping. The disks are slipped into a slot on a piece of cardboard (think a children's book, with slots in the pages) which do not hold the disks well enough to stop them from moving around during shipping. If you order this product, be sure to open and inspect it IMMEDIATELY. Five disks in my set had slipped out and were scratched to the point of not being playable and had to call for a replacement.<br /><br />And just to note, there's nothing Amazon can do about it. The fault is all in the manufacturer's packaging.
B004J4XGN6|1.0|Eric Ries is overly self absorbed and talks more about his company and himself more than any useful startup principles. I'd honestly have to say this is more of a biography of a company and, unlike the title leads you to believe, is aimed at changing large corporate American business ideals than actually helping startups. Another annoying fact is that he mentions his own concept \\"Lean Start-up\\" more than anything in the book - tooting his own horn.<br /><br />2% helpful, 98% fluff. Not so much a \\"must-read.\\"
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Well like most I went into reading this series because of all the hype surrounding it. I got through the first book and was like damn! I gotta keep reading this! So like most I went and bought book two and three. HUGE mistake!! What started out as a fairly decent book turned into......crap. I was really disappointed in this rushed crazed relationship between these two characters. I know this is a book but damn! Who gets married in a couple of months to someone who is clearly messed up? Book three was so bad I wished I had stopped at book number one. Should have read the reviews on this book.

1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now<br />By Eckhart Tolle<br /><br />While the subject may appear to be controversial on many aspects, Eckhart Tolle walks the line and draws everything together, bringing the prospect of spiritual enlightenment in to the realm of possibility. Tolle challenges one of the most argued words being God, by defining the word in enough different ways that any reader can find acceptance. In this book God is not \\"the guy upstairs\\" nor is God the guy that will judge you. God exists within that inner voice that seems to have been separated from you by your ego. And keep in mind we all have an inner voice. Tolle helps you understand where that voice comes from. Now I struggle with ego as the \\"bad guy\\", where as Tolle qualifies ego as your false self. I had to work through that conflict through out the book. There are other potential conflicts that you may find yourself having to work through. So the two characters in this book are your \\"god self\\" and your false self named ego for efficiency. Tolle describes time as continuums in both a horizontal and vertical directions. The past and future are on one continuum separated by NOW, which expands vertically. So what one does with his time is the subject of this book.<br /><br />From an enlightenment perspective Eckhart spends a bit of time illustrating how the ego is apt to construe the world by collecting past experiences and projecting them into the now and future. He helps the reader visualize that ego is constructing thoughts from the outer directed world and allowing them to impose not only on the present but also the future. Letting go of the false self, ego, allows a person to experience Now un-obstructed from the constructs of the mind and fully experiencing the moment. This is where time goes vertical. He suggests that in doing so one is connected to the knowledge of the universe, the all knowing, often times called God. He describes the mechanics of the process and the rewards found in the experience.<br /><br />I can appreciate that the preceding paragraph is not sufficient for the average bear to grasp or buy in to the concept. Hence the book must be read, which is a very easy read, and can even be found on Oprah's Book Club list. So let me share a couple of the dog-eared pages to shed at least enough light to compel you to pick up the book.<br /><br />· Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your life, don't give 100 percent of your attention to the external world and to your mind. Keep some within. I have spoke about this already. Feel the inner body even when engaged in everyday activities, especially when engaged in relationships or when you are relating to nature. Feel the stillness deep inside it. Keep the portal open. It is quite possible to be conscious of the Unmanifested throughout your life. You feel it as a deep sense of peace somewhere in the background, a stillness that never leaves you, no matter what happens here. You become the bridge between the Unmanifested and the manifested. This is the state of connectedness with the Source that we call enlightenment<br />· Hence, the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but in transcendence of the world. Just as you would not be conscious of space if there were no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to be realized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying, \\"if there is no illusion, there would be no enlightenment.\\" It is through the world and ultimately through you that the Unmanifested knows itself. You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are.<br /><br />I had dog-eared other pages, which speak to relationships, love, and death. All are worth reading. Keep in mind that the two bullets above were separated by many pages of illustrative concept to help with comprehension. Tolle uses the major religions, science and just good sound logic to bring his message to the reader. He challenges the reader, but offends no-one. He allows all walks of life to talk about spirituality and not get tangled up in religion. It is a refreshing bridge for humanity, and at the same time a bridge for ones inner self.

0375758992|3.0|I was really excited to read this book. I encouraged my book club to read it, but it was sorely disappointed by the end. I was disappointed due to the lack of description in this memoir. I really hoped that there would be a broader picture of what Africa and growing up in Africa was really like. I felt that there where a lot of holes in the memoir. I never understood why Fuller's parents came to Africa in the first place. What were her feelings about colonization?<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like this was a documentation of her drunken family. It was a series of events without much feeling or description attached to it. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone. If anyone asked about it I would say, \\"Meh, it's passable.\\" I will continue to look for better memoirs.

B006DICWUE|5.0|It took a few listens. This CD didn't knock me out the first couple of times I played it. I started to worry. I'd absolutely loved everything else this band had recorded before, so I was really looking forward to this new album. But, after a few dozen plays, I'm now totally in love with this album. More well-crafted hook-laden songs that make me smile, and dance, and sing. This music just fills me with overwhelming joy, something that so few new bands seem capable of doing nowadays. If you've enjoyed previous Nada Surf albums, give this one a chance. It may not be your favorite, and it may not rank at the top of my list either (at least not yet --- give me a few more months!), but it's a mighty fine batch of songs. This band is one of the best going.

B007R21JJK|1.0|So.... I've researched mbs for my new PC platform. I am a maniac when it comes to researching. I read millions of reviews, do a comparison sheets, excels with reviews etc. Insane! I hate it, but I want to make sure I make the right decision when purchasing a product that is necessary for my work ( graphic design ).<br /><br />I got this board, I installed i5-2500K put 32gb ram, with graphic card ( nvidia ) and x-fi. Of course first issue with the silly USBs. If you want to install windows from USB stick or USB drive, and have mouse and keyboard on USB - this will fail. The MB has only 2 working USBs for system installation. You have to get non-usb keyboard so you can use mouse / DVD combo in the remaining slots.<br /><br />Once installed the system, my sound card X-FI will not detect under windows. I tried multiple PCI slots, check all bios settings, researched forums - it seems like this mb has PCI issues ( read on! )<br />Quite often when cold booted, the boot goes nuts. It locks itself in a boot loop, flashing 15, 4F, 72, 96 > reboot. And 96 has to do with PCI resources!<br /><br />Sometimes the mb won't boot at all. You need to go and clear CMOS to get it to boot, but then it is a pain in the rear, since you have to manually adjust RAM settings, as the board doesn't detect RAM settings correctly.<br /><br />Lastly, only 2 out of 3 HDDS were recognized. My WM Raptor 300 shows under BIOS but it fails to show under windows ( yep, disk management doesn't see it either ).<br />All in all, save yourself a trouble and SKIP this MB. Sorry Gigabyte, but this is an epic FAIL. Never Gigabyte MB again.

0451205766|5.0|If you are a big fan of the movies, then this is an absolute must read. Most fans of the movies have always wanted to know more of what the Godfather is thinking, his reasoning .  The book gives you that and SOOOO much more!!
B004SEUJNM|3.0|Just like the film content, this movie was an underdog story in of itself when it came up against \\"Network\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\" and even in a year which featured the great Eastwood classic \\"The Outlaw Josie Wales\\" and won the Best Picture Oscar in 1976 and yet you can't say that the award was unjust for as great as the other films were this film does indeed hold its own.  As the ultimate underdog story very few films can claim to be its superior.  If you are like me and didn't want to get the whole series and just wanted this film, you now have it in a very nice digibook format which is eco-friendly too as the only plastic here is the disc itself.  The picture quality is much better than the 25th Anniversary Special Edition standard dvd that I have but it is by no means a reference quality blu-ray as the picture quality has some sub-par frames and some obvious DNR work where parts of the frame are not as sharp as the rest of the frame.  The sound quality though is good and again while not reference quality the DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround option is perhaps the best this film has ever sounded on disc to date.  As this disc is obviously taken from the complete box-set you get nada special features which may bother you so be warned!  As for me, I am content as I don't really rate the Rocky sequels as much as I do this the first film of the franchise.  While this is not a reference quality blu-ray by any stretch of the imagination, it is still much better than the standard dvd and the digibook is a nice to have as well despite no special features.<br /><br />Acceptable 1080p visuals, better but not excellent sound quality, no special features but a great story and a nice digibook packaging makes this somewhat of a mixed bag and so is recommended for the not-too-picky collector or the casual fan like myself.  I suppose if you are a massive fan of the franchise you would have gotten the complete collection anyway and so you'd have had all the special features that you could care for.  And so for the rest of us, recommended but only just..  And so for the rest of us, recommended but only just.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Pages and pages of sex.  It got boring so i skimmed thru most of it.  Same stuff over and over it was hard to pick the story out of it. reminded me of the saying...Once a king always a king but once a knight is enough!!!!!
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE heroes of Might and Magic games! 3 is my ultimate favorite. When I saw the price for it here on amazon I had to buy it. I hadn't played in so long, not since I was living with my parents. But now that I have my own copy I play all the time! I love it soo much! :))
0307200477|1.0|My one year old loves this book, but the plastic spiral binding is really awful. It came unbound the first time I opened it, before the baby even touched it.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I caught \\"Longmire\\" on cable and decided to buy the book.  I thought it might be worth the Kindle price of $12.99--I was mistaken.<br /><br />Overall the story is well written, moves forward at a consistent pace, and has the occasional flash of brilliance or clever turn of phrase.  The main character is likable enough, if slightly misanthropic (think grumpy old man with a badge) and the secondary characters come across as cardboard rather than having meaningful depth.<br /><br />If, like me, you enjoy a plot-driven novel and are willing to overlook a few shortcomings then by all means jump right in.  Just remember this is a detective novel, not Hemingway.<br /><br />This is a novel I enjoyed while reading.  Once finished, however, I found myself looking back and asking if it was really good or if I was trying to justify the price I paid.<br /><br />At $12.99 for a Kindle book the publisher is definitely banking on the TV series pulling in new readers--and I guess it worked on me.<br /><br />Had the price been around $6 for the Kindle edition I may have been more forgiving.  This has been the most expensive Kindle book I have purchased and I will not be making that mistake again.<br /><br />Overall, 3 stars for quality and value.
B002PVFYW6|4.0|\\"Imagine waking up not knowing who you are & then discovering people are trying to kill you\\".<br /><br />Jason Bourne is the exact opposite of the typical spy. The Bourne Identity shreds away every stereotypical clich&eacute; in the spy/espionage genre to create a brilliant paced tale with wonderful layers of action, adventure and thrills to keep you entirely focused on the screen. The Blu-ray contains a memorable film with plenty of extras and suburb video & sound to make this the definitive release of Identity.<br /><br />Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, a man stricken with amnesia; he can't remember his past, only that he can speak different languages, instantly fight off several men and swiftly evade the people attempting to kill him. This film proves Damon can act & fight as a lost spy in a post 9/11 world, his pleasant, though serious personality makes it a delight to root for him as he discovers his questionable, violent history. Marie, played by Franka Potente, is more than the common girl in distress as she joins in helping Bourne elude a CIA operation called Treadstone, run by Conklin (Chris Cooper), an operative that's not afraid to get his hands dirty. Brian Cox & Julia Stiles round out the supporting cast but don't take up too much screen time, shame as Cox's Abbott seems to be very involved in Bourne's precedent.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman brings the Robert Ludlum novel to life, updating the story and bringing forth some elements while keeping most of the direction on the characters and main plot. The fight sequences are very realistic and excellent choreographed, matched with a thrilling Mini Cooper chase scene and nail biting final confrontation scene near the finale. The entire picture takes place in the snowy landscape of France and Switzerland as a classical score plays in the background.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has excellent picture, showcasing the cities at winter time and few explosions in the action centered scenes. The audio matches the picture in excellence, especially to those with a sound system. Plenty of extras such as deleted, extended and alternative scenes, interviews on Robert Ludlum and all the Bourne novels, custom commentary and making of scenes, all the same special features brought over from the DVD release.<br /><br />Last Words B+, a strong story minus computer effects & common action formula turn the spy genre upside down.cellence, especially to those with a sound system.

0061801313|5.0|I brought this book for my daughter and she really enjoys reading these books. She is already into the series on TV, so the book just helps her to enjoy it more.
1469984202|4.0|I came across several references to the Wool series over the last year but was always a little skeptical as it's just not my typical sort of read. Then when I saw the omnibus edition decided to check it. What a nice surprise it was! Howey really has a knack for capturing and keeping a reader's interest. Well developed characters with some depth, mysterious circumstances, challenges and conflict. All the ingredients are there but most importantly the writing skill and craft to make you want to keep reading. Give it a try - even if you're not a dyed in the wool (pun intended) post-apocalyptic/dystopian lit fan.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Have watched it multiple times since buying it.
0439023491|5.0|I loved the first book, reading last one now.  This book is very well written.  A lot of twists in this story.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am  no movie critic by any means, but what can I say, I love this series. As a Persian Gulf veteran myself and a huge military history buff, I have nothing but love and the utmost respect for our WWII vets. The fact that the actors in the series are portraying real men, is very cool. I will always walk up and shake the hand of a gentleman wearing a WWII veteran hat, and sometimes they will talk about their accounts of the war, I'll just stand there and listen in awe. That's what we have here. Real accounts of what these brave men saw and went through.<br /><br />Much respect to the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne infantry. I can't even imagine what that must of been like on their first jump into France. Episode 2 shows this, terrifying and amazing.<br /><br />All in all, this is the best movie on WWII, that I've ever watched. Acted very well with pretty good effects as well. My hat off to Mr. Hanks and Mr. Speilberg. Definately a must see for any history buff like myself, and any true red blooded American.<br /><br />If any one ever questions why there is war, and ask why do our service members do what they do. Just watch episode 9 and you'll have your answer. So if you're ever out and see a veteran of WWII, thank and respect them. There aren't many of them still with us, and each one of them carries their own accounts of our U.S. history.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app.  It is very helpful..  I think one of the best features is the amount of time it will require to get a full charge.
1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa have hit the nail on the head with this book. I was challenged by my cycling coach to read the book and do the Whole30 plan, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. The book was fun and interesting to read. It's well written and interesting, down to earth. It boils down everything you need to know about eating paleo. I highly suggest this book to anyone interested in living a full, healthy life!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Thank you for fixing the puzzle tray.  Now you can have more than five puzzle packs.  But the game was really great until you updated.  The puzzle pieces are too blocky.  Too easy to put together.  Took away size from 288 to 216. Please bring back the puzzles as they were.
B0068FYZ9S|1.0|My first order was missing the Universal 100th Anniversary Slipcover (see item description picture), got a replacement sent the very same day and received it before today but still this one also was missing the slipcover... So this one will go back for a refund.<br />Too bad, Amazon has a great price and my two other Bourne discs that I ordered from Amazon did have the Universal 100th Anniversary slipcover.

0525478817|5.0|The story follows a sixteen year old girl called Hazel who is a cancer patient as she tries to get on with her life even though it's gone way past normal. She's constantly hooked up to an oxygen tank which has to go everywhere with her otherwise she can't breathe. One day she attends a Support Group and meets this handsome cancer survivor, Augustus. We join them as they learn to love and live life to the absolute fullest.<br /><br />I actually feel like John Green ripped my heart out of my chest and stomped on it. When I first opened the book, I never expected that the story would hit me so hard, but it really did. This is a new type of story to me. I never usually read books about real life, I'm more into the Fantasy world but this is one book I can see myself reading over and over again without ever getting bored.<br /><br />John Green definitely has a way with words. I was drawn in nearly from the very beginning, hanging on every word he wrote. His writing alone just made the plot beautiful. If it was any other Author, the book wouldn't be half as good. I can't really explain it, but if you read this book, you would know immediately what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I found myself being extremely attached to these characters Green has created. Hazel was such an inspirational character. Being diagnosed with Cancer at the age of fourteen would have been torture, I can't even begin to imagine. But she pulled through as best as she could and done everything in her power and willed herself to stay strong, not just for her, but for her family too. There were many times in the book where she pushed herself just so she would be able to accomplish something, like in the museum with the stairs. She willed herself to keep going even though she could hardly breathe because she needed to do it for herself. I felt my heart break for her many a times, especially at one part in particular which I'm not going to say because it will completely ruin the book for you. I definitely won't be forgetting about Hazel Grace Lancaster any time soon.<br /><br />My favourite character in the entire book was Augustus Waters. His story was beautiful and heart breaking all at the same time. Honestly, I cried reading about him. I'm not even going to go on about him because I'll probably just rant and cry again and write an essay about how much I love him, but he is most certainly one of my all time favourite fictional characters.<br /><br />Overall, it was a heartwarming story with the ability to make you think about how important life truly is. The book has become one of my new favourites and I will definitely read it over and over again. I know there's a huge hype around it right now but it really deserves to be well known. and I think everyone needs to read this incredible book.won't be forgetting about Hazel Grace Lancaster any time soon.<br /><br />My favourite character in the entire book was Augustus Waters.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jet pack joyride is a fast paced game that keeps your attention and makes you want to play it again and again! This game has so many twists and turns that you will want to find every secret, from tokens to catch in mid air while jetpacking to a mechanical dragon.  I have played knockoffs for a long time (terrible games fyi)  but finally amazon you have given me and thousands the holy grail, and for no cost AT ALL!!!! :)

B00000IZOR|5.0|I bought this for my 11 month old daughter and she has not stopped playing with it since I gave it to her.<br />She loves playing with the rotary part and hearing the bell sound it makes. The cord between the handset and the phone isn't very long at all, I'm pretty sure I will have to cut it when she actually tries to start holding it up to her ear like a real phone. Other than that I'm so glad I bought this for her. I honestly didn't expect her to like it this much!

B001GXF2YY|4.0|I love the Harry Bosch series. I couldn't read/listen to them fast enough. I commute and finding the text-to-speech enabled option is a major plus for me giving me the opportunity to \\"read\\" anytime. I was frustrated to find Trunk Monkey, Angels Flight and newer releases don't have this option though all of his previous books have it.<br /><br />I'm holding out on reading this one since I have to be able to actually sit and read them which I don't often have the luxury of doing. So Harry keeps on going while I'm on pause...alas the reasoning for only giving it 4 stars.
1419703692|3.0|I think that this book lacks in picture quantity compared to Marvel's \\"The Art of .....\\" books. I bought both \\"The Art of Marvel\\" and \\"The Art of Avengers\\" book and that's the first thing i noticed. Coming from this point of view, i could understand why this book will have a rating of 1 star. Don't expect the art to equal that of Marvel's \\"The Art of ...\\" books. But considering the depth and detail of the textual content on how the movie was made, i will add 2 stars and give it a rating of 3.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it is the BEST FREE GAME OUT THERE! it is super fun and addicting! I've been waiting for this game to come out on android, and it is FINALLY OUT! you NEED TO get this game right NOW!<br /><br />:-)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is the best ever for relaxation and peaceful sleep. TUrn the thunder up and urban rain to half. Only improvements. would be making the thunder louder and more often.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|I am almost done with the game and have no other peoples scores to compete with. It is a good game but needs more suits and jetpacks that actually match with the suits.

B008D28HYS|4.0|Really great picross game.<br /><br />I like how as you draw a full line (by pressing and holding) it tells you how many squares you do.<br />Undo is really useful.<br />ability to x and 'dim color maybe' a spot is really useful.<br />Dynamic crossing out of clue numbers is really useful.<br /><br />A huge failing of this game, however, is when you zoom in on a large puzzle, you can't see the hints anymore!<br />They should -always- put the hints on the side, even if you are viewing the middle of the puzzle.<br />It's a nightmare to zoom in, and have to constantly scroll back to the left to see what the clue is for that part of the puzzle.<br /><br />Fix this and it's a 5 star app.<br />I don't do the online scoring stuff.<br /><br />- Frank
B004EPZ034|4.0|My kids, especially my seven year old son, love this movie and have watched it dozens of times since we purchased it.  I haven't been able to sit through it all the way, yet.  For me, the Chipmunk voices get on my nerves, and it is a little hokey.  My seven year old is never tired of it, and tells everyone who will listen about the characters on the movie.  I don't regret this purchase, because I let him watch it when I am not wanting to sit down and have family movie time.  He is never tired of it.  I recommend this movie.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|ya its just purr awesome in every way if u get it ur going to get addicted. omg Omg omg omg
0805047905|5.0|Of course you probably read this book already, if you are buying it.  As with most Eric Carle books, they are so timeless I can nearly recite the whole book in my head.  My children love this book, and still ask me to read it again and again.  I recommend this book.
0982743726|3.0|Book Review: The Bone Sword by Walter Rhein<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a free e-copy of this book for the review.<br /><br />Warning: There are spoilers and hints of spoilers in this review.<br /><br />Bone Sword is a fantasy novel focusing on two children and a swordsman.  The swordsman, named Malik, is something of an antihero who is on the run from his powerful mentor in an elite guard.  Malik manages to also anger the local nobility and church leadership as he tries to find a place where he can sell his skills with the sword.  The two children are local peasants.  Jasmine and Noah start the story tending to their sick father; when Jasmine heals him using her divine powers, she comes to the notice of the local priesthood.  They see her abilities as a threat to their rule.  When Malik and the two children are caught up in the same prison, they help each other to escape--but soon their plans take them further than that.<br /><br />The Bone Sword is a fun fantasy story with well-actualized characters.  The world is well-defined with clear rules about how magic works in the world.  It's a fairly low powered world, with only two people possessing magical abilities.  As I mentioned, the characters are very strongly defined, particularly the three main characters.  Malik, Jasmine and Noah in particular are three-dimensional characters.  Malik's flashbacks do a good job of establishing the PC, setting up the final confrontation nicely.  The book is written in a style that is engaging and easy to read.<br /><br />My issues with the book/story revolve around the choices that the characters make.  The story has a very definite plot and it achieves that story even when it maybe shouldn't.  The best example of this is when a character is deemed to be worthy of ruling for reasons that aren't really supported.  The character hasn't proven that they're worthy to rule but it's remarked that the person is worthy and several people swear fealty before they've proven their worth.  Characters also make foolish decisions--all of the villains are either overconfident or mad.  The good guys make some foolhardy blunders from which they have to be rescued.<br /><br />However, I should emphasize that I still enjoyed the story.  The story is tight and stays on focus, and even if that sometimes feels forced, it means that the story doesn't deviate from its course or wander into unnecessary arcs.  The final scenes come together well in the end, drawing on elements throughout the story to reach the emotionally satisfying conclusion. I would recommend this book for a fun fantasy adventure.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|What a load of trash. So many similarities to Twilight with the main characters and I could find the same stuff at the local adult book shop.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book is well written and was entertaining to read.  I haven't seen any of the movies yet so it will be interesting to see how closely my imagination is to what the screenwriters depict.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am 53 years old and LOVED this trilogy! I read it slowly as I did not want it to end...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app because it helps you and tells you how much battery you have.and when you have low battery it goes straight to the app
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and addictive will recommend to friends. love love love love this game. I play it constantly. love the game. a lot.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its an amazing game... a lot like Mario but I love it you can collect acorns and shoot them out at the snails and little bug things....
0783231032|1.0|This movie was just plain stupid despite all the great talent involved. I thought so in 1980 and seeing part of it again last week hasn't changed my mind.
B007FH22VQ|5.0|Practically perfect!  Some of the songs on this CD could have sold the album entirely on their own accord!  They are THAT good. This is one of those albums that you know will have a 25th anniversary edition.  If the Emmy awards recognized metal the way they recognize formulated pop music, this album would be in the running for album of the year.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love using it! the numbers are big enough and all the functions i need are on it. better than the one on my phone!!!!!
1416914285|5.0|Heard a lot about the series so I thought I'd check it out and ordered City of Bones. Needless to say half way through, I bought the rest of the series. I couldn't wait to find out what happens next in Clary and Jace's adventure
B007Y5IAV0|5.0|This is a great follow up to his first solo cd, I highly recommend buying it if your a fan of Srej.
B008602KQI|4.0|Huge fan of the books and the movie didn't dissapoint. One of the best book to film adaptions iv seen. Can't wait for the next one
030746363X|4.0|This diet book provided me a diet tnat  actually worked.  In three week, I lost almost 20 pounds.  It was very hard to get used to eating different beans at each meal, after a few days, it didn't bother me.<br /><br />Try it, it works and it great to see the results.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I really enjoyed using this browser, initially, but it's constantly trying to initiate voice control.  I'm sure that I  inadvertantly got it staryed, but I haven't been able to stop it.  So, bye-bye Dolphin...
B008BIN9EW|4.0|the game reminds me of starcraft with a similar look and 3 races to compete.  since it is turn based, the play is more like a simplified version of civilization. there is room for improvement, such as upgrading units, or them getting leveled up for successfully  winning a battle.  my biggest complaint is the battery usage is huge.
1400069289|5.0|I read J. McGuire's review... I am sure he didn't read the book, just scanned it.<br /><br />The best chapters are past the second.<br /><br />The very best was his analysis of the 12-step programs and why they work.<br /><br />The steps he teaches in this book are actionable, and you can actually change some habits (I already have!) and help others to change their habits.<br /><br />It has given me more value than some of the thousand dollar courses I have taken.
B007N8RULO|5.0|It is a classic game but is very well done. Options are provided, play is smooth, there are no delays. I  have not experienced any hang ups or freezes. I am enjoying this app.
B007CMD5EC|4.0|John 5 is a great guitarist and if you haven't given him a listen, do yourself a favor listen to this album.  More conservative listeners are likely to blow him off because he has been the lead guitarist for both Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie.  For others, that may be the attraction.  For you conservative listeners understand that he grew up watching Hee-Haw.  He loves playing country, blue grass... want to hear a Chet Atkins tune, he'll play it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books. I hated to finish them because they were so intriguing. Everybody should have a Christian to cherish them.
B006G7ZGS2|4.0|I am a big fan of Neil Gaiman and I'm pretty sure that I could sit and listen to him read the phone book and enjoy it.  This audio book has some good short stories, stories that provide insight into some of his more notable works.  It's good and I would recommend purchasing it, but it's not up to the standards of the Graveyard book or Neverwhere.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this book to be published. Flynn is easily one of my favorite novelists and I have been obsessed with her work since \\"Sharp Objects\\". I flew through this in a day, and although I wasn't sure how I felt about the ending at first, as I look back, I feel that it was the right one.<br /><br />I also feel like she has a way with her writing of seeing right through the good and dark parts of the psyche. I am someone who watches a lot of Dateline and 48 Hours because these things intrigue me, this book held the same effect and really is a wonderfully, dark twisted tale.<br /><br />If you have never read her, and you like thrillers, she is for you. If you are the type that reads Jennifer McMahon (sp)books and flys through them only to be down right mad at the ending, I assure you, you will find in Gillian what McMahon lacks. There is the same feeling of crazy storytelling, but in Flynn's books, it's mixed with a trained novelists eye and talent for plot writing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game. it is fun. has a lot of different games to choose from.  I would recommend this game
055380684X|5.0|I thought this book offered some fantastic insight into learning and human motivation.  With a strong emphasis on the science behind what it takes to build the \\"circuits\\" necessary to master chess, the piano, or tennis, it makes clear how one can work to truly become great at anything, regardless of preconceived notions of \\"talent\\".
B006H5120E|1.0|The best thing about this movie is the first half hour with the under water special effects then it goes downhill from there....
B002PJ8BE6|5.0|I wish I had the words and the time today to convey just how extraordinary this recording is.  However, I am still too shaken by what I just experienced that I will let ClassicsToday speak for me:  their rating is 9/9 and after lavishing praise on all the soloists, the orchestra, and the conductor, Pappano, who conducted it with great sensitivity, subtlety, and heart-breaking power,  ClassicsToday concludes this recording takes its place among the best.<br /><br />I wept throughout.
098357670X|5.0|I have searched for years to find a book as complete as this one.  Tom Richmond has put together very comprehensive how-to book. I do not need to search any further.  Excellent!!!!
0671510991|4.0|This book basically offers a diplomatic history lesson to state department diplomats contemplating what America's foreign policy should be in the uncertain period following the end of the Cold war. Its author is not strictly speaking a historian, so the book should not be read as such. Rather it is a reflection on key periods of history through the lens of one of America's leading diplomats and arch-realists. Its author believes that history provides a guide for the future. History does not repeat itself, but teaches by analogy. Some of the lessons that come out of this volume is the perennial tension between interests and ideals, especially in American foreign policy. While many parts of the book are a fairly conventional recounting of historical events, the book's most memorable sections are those in which the author offers his evaluation of particular great power leaders of the past -- Napoleon III, Bismarck, among others. One cannot help but think in many instances that the author is actually reflecting on his own experience as national security advisor and secretary of state under President Nixon. It is ironic that the book is dedicated to foreign service officers given the author's undisguised antipathy towards the state department bureaucracy during his term of office. This volume offers a \\"great man\\" view of history, as though national interest can only be gleaned by the truly inspired statesman. Domestic politics are at best a distraction, social forces part of the background noise with which the statesman must contend. Sometimes achieving true greatness requires going against the fashion of the times, and not being governed by opinion polls. One can almost sense that this is the author's critique of the Clinton administration's foreign policy (remember the book was published in 1994). Obviously, a lot has happened since, but that does not diminish this book's importance as a distillation of key lessons of the past from a preemiment practitioner of Realpolitik.
B005GHN2GG|3.0|**********<br />Content: Fairly explicit sex, some violence, a dozen typos. IMO, this is erotic romance cloaked in fantasy.<br />**********<br /><br />3.5 stars.  Some parts were superior. driven kept my attention through most of the book. Its main flaws are repetition and a surfeit of sex (plus the typos). Because the beginning felt like a fantasy-driven plot line, I expected something with less erotica and more action adventure, more like UF.<br /><br />Below, I explain the flaws and highlight the parts I liked. There were several great parts!<br /><br />++++++++++  SPOILERS BELOW  ++++++++++<br /><br />Draven immediately hooked me into the fantastical aspects of the story -- dire straights in ancient days when an evil god called Corruption blights the earth, causing rivers to run with blood and crops to whither, parched and dry.  Corruption, through slithering promises of riches and power, tries to take possession of his avatar, our hero, Silhara, the Master of Crows. Silhara is a mage who dabbles just a bit in dark arts (but only to protect his precious orange trees).<br /><br />A slave girl, Martise is sent to spy on the master of crows, pretending to help him. She is a woman of integrity, but she agrees to  practice deception in order to regain the part of her soul that her master has imprisoned in a hunk of crystal. Martise is not pretty, but she has an almost magical speaking voice. She is smart, good with languages, and has an incredible memory. On top of all this, she has a magical gift, but no one can figure out how to release it.<br /><br />Her magical gift is revealed in one of the better scenes, involving a soul sucker. I thought this scene was nicely done!<br /><br />So the fantasy plot grabbed my attention. But then, very little happens. Besides the one scene with a soul sucker,  we mostly see Silhara et al. tending the orange grove, drinking tea, practicing magic incantations, going to market, and falling in love.<br /><br />Lots of complaints throughout the book about how much the dog stinks. Too many repetitions of that. Just bathe him already! If Gann's kitchen were really so spotless, a filthy dog would not have been allowed under the table for every meal.<br /><br />Even more disappointing from a story perspective, the author kept interrupting the plot with sex. It got irritating, because I wanted to hear the story.  Silhara or Martise were either THINKING about sex or ENGAGING in it, even as Corruption was destroying the earth and slowly sucking the life out of his avatar, Silhara. Sex on the floor, the bed, and in various positions, all described in fairly graphic terms.  The author used the word \\"cunnus\\" at least a dozen times.  Moreover, Martise has a voice so seductive and enchanting as to \\"make a man come\\" (repeated references to the voice).<br /><br />Sex and rumors of sex, but I never really sensed passion. The intense bond between Silhara and Martise just did not seem authentic. I could not buy into it. Not sure why. Maybe Silhara was too cerebral.<br /><br />However, a few scenes of devotion stand out as quite memorable. In the market one day, Martise's first and only prior lover starts boasting of his conquest of her, and putting her down as an ugly hag, only worth bedding in the dark. Silhara beats him up. I liked that part. A LOT. Excellent bit of writing.  But note, it does nothing to further the fantasy plot.<br /><br />In another superior scene, Silhara asks his manservant to bring him a houri. When the beautiful prostitute arrives at his home....no spoilers here, but the scene was VERY well done. Even so, this section does nothing to advance the fantasy.<br /><br />Silhara was repeatedly depicted with his hookah (sp?). He constantly smelled of tobacco. (The author said so, at least 10 times.)<br /><br />In several evening scenes, after smoking the pipe, we see Silhara resisting the seductive Corruption, telling him to go take a hike. In one intense scene, Silhara is nearly possessed, andhe....no spoiler, but that scene was scary enough.<br /><br />So, too much repetition. The smelly dog. The enchanting voice. The hookah at bedtime. The tobacco-scented Silhara. The sex. The cunnus.<br /><br />Secondary characters were pretty cool. I liked the dog and the manservant a lot.<br /><br />Most of the potential for fantasy plot got smothered by romance, but the final battle against Corruption was well drawn. Vivid. I felt like I could see what was happening inside the mind of the god.<br /><br />I really liked the very end. Silhara made some great choices. No instant riches. All that was lost is not instantly and easily recovered. They will work for it. Sweet.<br /><br />There were at least a dozen errors. I noted some misplaced commas, a semi-colon where a colon belongs, and a misplaced quotation mark. At another point, the word \\"conversed\\" is used when it should have been \\"conversing.\\" Some typos, for example, \\"too\\" for \\"took.\\"  At least one sentence just did not make sense unless I inserted a word. Some anachronistic vocabulary. For example, the author described a crushed melon drink as being \\"like a slurry\\" (slurry reflects a contemporary setting, so this pulled me right out of that ancient market scene. How would Martise know about slurries?).<br /><br />With so many typos, I was especially glad the book cost only $3.00.<br /><br />This author shows a lot of promise.he....no spoiler, but that scene was scary enough.<br /><br />So, too much repetition.

B000BYA4JM|5.0|Some years ago I was at the renowned Movies Unlimited superstore, now a dollar store, standing behind a guy who purchased \\"Who's That Girl\\" for the retail price of $79.95 on VHS.  I was intrigued why somebody would purchase at such an exhorbitant price a movie that was critically lambasted and had mixed commercial success.  Did I rush out to rent the film? Nah, the first I saw it was yesterday at home with my wife.  It's cheaper than seeing Madonna at her sold-out concert where tickets now are for a kings ransom.  Is this a funny movie?  For the most part, yes.  Does Madonna in her third feature film have the acting mustard to carry the load of a starring vehicle?  There's a few rough patches but the force of her personality compensates for any shortcomings.  Will it make you forget \\"Bringing Up Baby\\"?  Definitely not but this is an analogy made by the film's critics.  The makers of the film have concocted a valentine to screwball comedies of yore and do not have the pretense to compare it with other films.  I'll conclude by stating this probably isn't a five star movie but I liked it alot.  It isn't the BOMB that Leonard Maltin's movie guide has assigned to it either.

B0070NSPCU|3.0|This is the first book review I've ever posted on Amazon, although I have been a consumer of them for many years.  I've just never felt like taking the time to write a review.  But this book, or rather the other reviews of this book, have pushed me into taking action.<br /><br />It's not that this book is particularly good or bad.  It's just ok.  But based on the Amazon reader reviews, you'd think this was one of the best books ever written.  I don't understand how this book gets so many 5-star reviews.  It's just not that good.<br /><br />I'm obviously not an experienced reviewer, so forgive me if this review doesn't provide a good sense of what I liked and didn't like about the book.  Some of characters are interesting, and the action is good at times.  This isn't a traditional fantasy book (the glowing positive reviews got that right).  It's kind of a mix of a coming-of-age tale and a war story, with the book following the protagonist from his youth in an elite military training school into his adult years on various military campaigns.  But the plot is confusing.  It's difficult to explain this without spoilers.  I can only say that I found myself wincing at some points as various plot twists ruined the story to some extent.<br /><br />And another thing that some of the less favorable reviewers have already pointed out: this book is filled with grammar and syntax errors.  I expect better editing than that.  Errors like that are not the end of the world, but they do indicate to me that there are some problems with the overall quality of the work.<br /><br />Again, this is not a terrible book, or even a particularly bad one.  I just can't believe that it got so many 5-star reviews.  Maybe I was naive when I bought this book.  Maybe I should have known not to trust the reviewers.  After all, I don't know these people.  How do I even know if the reviews are honest?  I guess I just thought that so many people couldn't be bought.<br /><br />If I sound upset, it's because I am (a little).  I'm not upset at spending a few bucks on a book that was just ok (I bought it on Kindle).  I'm upset at spending a few hours of my precious time on a book that wasn't worth it.<br /><br />From now on, I'm going to read the negative reviews before I buy any book on Amazon (or anywhere else), rather than trusting the majority.  I suspect many others are already doing the same, or will start doing so very soon.

Sorry, Sylvia, but you don't even come close to being the writer E.L. James is!! Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel is nothing but a porn book!  I kept hoping the writing would get better but it never did! And forget about any kind of a love story...writing about a relationship and throwing in porn just doesn't make this a good book!!!  Needless-to-say I am EXTREMELY disappointed!

B002UXRGLG|5.0|I'm a biologist by training.  This series reminded me how little I know, and that as strange as we believe nature may be, actually it is stranger still.<br /><br />The storytelling and cinematography are beautifully done, to the same high standards as BBC's \\"The Human Planet\\", which I also recommend.<br /><br />If you have a young child who is curious and patient, you could do much worse than introduce him or her to science by watching this series together and talking about what you learn together.  But watch it alone if you must; it's superb.

B007STBUIW|4.0|Jaws on Blu-ray is one of the best transfer of the film yet (until the next Video format hits) 4 Stars. The picture is superb. The audio fantastic. The fully restored 1975 version? not so much. it means picture and sound only, but if you are a die hard film buff you will know this is an edited version used for the first transfer on DVD. It cuts a part of quint's death scene and the line Smile you son of bitch was reduce to  Smile you son of a, before the Shark explodes. This for me changes the emotional impact of the film's ending. I would have gave it 5 star if it was the original 1975 version. Hollywood Filmmakers STOP! changing films we remeber or release both version on the same Disc set, and let us the fans choose with one to watch.  Thanks.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The Night Circus is a nice read, and written in a way that keeps you active and guessing. The events are not all in chronological order and the speaker changes to another person every now and then. Its not what I expected either from the blurb on the back cover, with the romance being less direct and the characters not together like I thought they would be. Overall I enjoyed the read, it is not my favorite but it was a good book.
B008W14ZD2|3.0|This is a pretty good cd, the songs are all pretty catchy. I just noticed that the cd is also listed on Amazon without the \\"Digital Booklet\\" for a $1 less. So if you are not interested in having the pdf version of the cd booklet, you can get this one for a buck less (at least it was at the time of writing this post):<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008UUPOVM The Midsummer Station]]<br /><br />Another thing that is frustrating is if you buy the album in iTunes, you get a bonus song and if you bought it with a Japanese iTunes account, you get a second bonus song. I am not a fan of all of these pricing differences and songs only being available in specific countries or music stores. Other than that, I think it is a pretty great cd.
B004I2K4DY|2.0|This is probably me being ignorant of these types of things, but I would have liked a more visible warning about the region code upon purchase, as it makes it impossible to play the DVD in Norway. The concert is probably fabulous though.
0345803485|4.0|A privilege to review, chapters of 20+/- pages make this light reading enjoyable; although engaging text is hard to interrupt as a persistent story adds continuity to changing scene. High-flying heuristic balances a sophisticated pursuit in this libertine affair. The character Anastasia is charming for her genuine inexperience and sincere naïvet&eacute;. The persona of Christian Grey might be the most interesting man in the world... with an unlikely inclination. The articles of a salacious contract between these two guarantee a fulfillment of the indulgence that has made this title a best seller. I would recommend this volume to anyone looking to surprise themselves with a little audacity and intrigue in the world of modern fiction. I plan to read the rest of this series, and satisfy a curious desire. A-Grade romance with flare! In a class all its own.

0345803507|4.0|It was still good and concluded the series in a matter that I was pleased with. Full circle for Mr. Grey. This one was not my favorite because I felt like she had so much she was trying to put into the last book - she ended up skipping a lot- you would read little paragraphs about one day or one event and then off to the next.  The other books did not do this or if they did it was only a few times.  The sex scenes are less in this book, again she is trying to fit and conclude some drama and a lot are skipped over.  I just felt like she had left gaps and rushed this last book.  Perhaps somewhere there is a full edition without all the cut outs.  BUT ahhh- I hate that tease at the end of the book from Christian's point of view- is it just me or would that book be better than from Ana's??? I hope she finishes it... I feel like all those times Ana doubted how Christian felt about her that left me as the reader hanging would be explained by his point of view because it is obvious in the teaser that he was infatuated with her from the beginning. Heres to hoping! I read that she is editing a book like 50 shades so I hope to read something soon.

0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's reminded me of a Russian matryoshka doll -the nested dolls that hide within each other. On its surface, it's a surprisingly old-fashioned adventure story (those who love Carlos Ruiz Zafon or a better-written Dan Brown will find much to enjoy in this book).<br /><br />The \\"hero\\" - Clay Jannon - is a 20-something who recently lost his job when the company he worked for, NewBagel, imploded. On a whim, he goes to work for a 24-hour bookstore, owned by Mr. Penumbra, a man as musty as the ancient books he sells. It doesn't take him long to realize that the bookstore isn't what it appears to be; in reality, it's a secret society of old book readers who are striving to solve a puzzle as old as life itself. With his new girlfriend Kat, who works at Google, and his lifetime friend Neel, who owns a tech company called Anatomix, he attempts to solve the mystery.<br /><br />A divide is set up rather quickly. At one early point, the author describes a certain data visualization model and adds, \\"If this sounds impressive to you, you're over thirty.\\" This reader has left thirty behind a while back, and I must admit to feeling a little overwhelmed at parts when the technology kicks in.<br /><br />The nested theme does have to do with technology, though. At one point, Kat says, \\"Each big idea...is an operating system upgrade. Writers are responsible for some of it. They say Shakespeare invented the internal monologue. But I think that writers had their turn and now it's programmers who get to upgrade the human operating system.\\" In another instance, a fellow Googler refers to old books as \\"Old Knowledge\\". \\"Imagine if we could make it so that OK/TK (traditional knowledge) was available all the time, to everyone All of it. On the web, on your phone. No question would ever go unanswered ever again.\\"<br /><br />This novel puts that theory to the test: can the new knowledge on Google co-exist with Old Knowledge and can it illuminate life issues that OK cannot? It's an inventive and creative premise and the author, who writes very well, handles it beautifully. My ratings reflect my personal enjoyment with a book and since I'm not much of an adventure reader, I'm rating it 4 stars. I would not be surprised if most readers rate it even more highly. One more thing: I don't think I'll ever look at Google quite the same way again!tive and creative premise and the author, who writes very well, handles it beautifully.

B007ZZKWHY|1.0|I saw \\"Iron Sky\\" recently. I have not seen it on Blu-Ray or DVD, so I can't comment on whether the \\"special features\\" make it worth the \\"bargain\\" price of over $35, but I can tell you what I thought of the movie.<br /><br />I give the movie one star just because the CGI effects were not a total disaster but it's all downhill from there. I know it's meant as a parody of sorts but even as that, it fails. The film is utterly unfunny and un-American. I can't decide what I disliked most: the bastardized version of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" they played during a scene showing President Sarah Palin (that's not a typo) beating U.N. delegates with her red shoe, the African-American actor that played a white man during the majority of the movie or the fact that, in the end, they try to portray, as sympathetic figures, not the Americans, but the Nazis.<br /><br />If you remember only one thing from this review, let it be this: I watched \\"Iron Sky\\" so you don't have to.

B0017HMF6W|4.0|I purchased the single disc  Anniversary Blu-Ray dvd. The cover clearly advertises sub-titles; yet none were available on the disc I received. After the disc loaded, there was the FBI  warning and then the screen with the special features. The normal opening screen with the set-up options was not there and could not be accessed. It was as if this were the 2nd disc in a 2-disc release or the flip side of a disc that had been recorded on both sides with alternate versions of the film- ie one wide screen the second full screen with special features, which is what I received.<br />That noted, the transfer was excellent; the movie looked beautiful. And the features I watched: a documentary on the life and career of Cary Grant and a documentary on Hitchcock and the making of this movie, hosted by Eva Marie Saint, were both interesting.
B005LAIGOQ|1.0|Having read the book twice, and seen the BBC 1989 movie version several times,I was entertaining high hopes with this new version of one of my favorite Gothic-horror stories.I was hoping that a more generous budget would do full honors to this little jewel of  the Gothic-horror genre. Although the 1989 version proved that intelligent choices in directing can overcome many obstacles, including a low budget. On the other hand I also was a little fearful about this movie falling prey to today's curse on horror movies:succumbing to the temptation of drowning the story in computerized, cheap special effects, resulting in tons of cheap-gore and gallons of blood, and Disney-like ghouls and monsters.<br />As it has been mentioned here by other critics, changing the story a little is not a crucial problem when the essential elements are kept,and respected.The 1989 film version did a few changes, but the story plot was there, and it could be followed at a real pace.The script was intelligent and it worked.But this is another story...<br />I went to see this new movie at a classic movie house from the 50s,restored and with a big screen.I wanted to do full honors to this new version.But,as the movie progressed,the horrific truth was evident, my worst fears were materializing in front of my eyes.There was no real story-plot to follow.I was in for a Blackberry generation version of The Woman in Black. It was to fast-paced to be nothing but a video-game,the scenes kept moving forward,as if slashed with a machete,unable to create a story line.And finally, when I was confronted with the exaggerated and ridiculous \\"house on the marsh\\" of this version, I knew I was watching a pathetic blend of 'The Adam's Family meets Stephen King' for the blackberry generation.From there on it was downhill, a movie predictably drowned in unnecessary and exaggerated special effects such as the bleeding-bed, and a woman in black so unsubstantial that it looked more like a Japanese-anime figure runningamok the Adam's family house.The end was not only too much of a travesty,but a corny and childish idea,unworthy of Susan Hill's work.<br />For those unfamiliar with good literature, or a good reading, this 'video-game' version might do.But for those who are familiar with real stories and good scripts, my recommendation is:AVOID this waste of money and time like you would the plague.For me this was THE WASTE OF A GOOD CHANCE...<br />If you want your intelligence to be respected, stick to the 1989 BBC version.It might be too slow for those whose attention span can not survive anything beyond 60-seconds bytes,or nothing deeper than a video-game plot,but for those able to enjoy true suspense and a good literary build-up of the plot, the story IS THERE,and its good!<br />If you like classic Gothic horror stories, with well written scripts and literary style, I recommend movies like:<br />The Changeling,Haunted!The Reincarnation of Peter Proud,The Uninvited,and even The House Where Evil Dwells. And the wonderful literary ghost stories of Japanese films like KWAIDAN and Ugetsu,

0439023513|1.0|Whether you were rooting for Gale or Peeta and whether your upset that about specific characters deaths, there is one simple fact. The ending just drops flat.<br /><br />Maybe you expected Katniss to one day rise to be a true leader, or maybe you were hooping for the dreariness and depression to wear off, and maybe an argument could be made that this is a story about a girl who was never meant to be a real leader in such a terrible world, but...<br /><br />This book starts out dreary and stays dreary clear through with only short bits of action or hope. By the end things are simply skipped over, important deaths are ignored as if they didn't happen. Katniss never seams to rise to anything more then short bouts of vengeance and self loathing. Still its the terribly undescriptive ending that ruins the book.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />After hours and hours of reading the conclusions literately falls with almost no explanation. Prim some how makes it from nearly complete safety in district 13 to the front lines of a raid in the capital. Without her mom or anyone stopping her or even being mentioned as trying.<br /><br />Katniss's trial is not described at all so your only left guessing as to why she was just locked away and no one hardly speaks to her about it. Her mom and gale simply go live elsewhere. Katniss even seams to simply give up and just marry Peeta and have kids she can't even remember the names of.<br /><br />All of this happens in basically one chapter. After so much detail of every little element of the story the ending lacks every detail you could have wanted.<br /><br />You read for so long clear up to the point that Katniss is running through the capital during a rebel raid and needs to get into the Presidents manor. Gale just got captured. Peeta is somewhere with a nightlock pill thinking of killing himself because he has been programmed to kill Katniss. Prim and her mom are in district 13 working as nurses.<br /><br />There are so many questions like what will happen with the power struggles in the districts? How will they rebuild? When will Katniss finally know what she wants for sure and rise up to be the MockingJay for real? It is even clearly mentioned that president snow has more then one way out of the mansion and only an assassination could really stop him.<br /><br />Then in the space of not much more then one chapter, prim appears gets killed, Katniss is set on fire, recovers shoots President Coin and is stuck in a room. A trial is briefly mentioned then she is sent to her home in district 12. Greasy Sae makes her food, Peeta shows up and marries her. Gale and her mom never come back. 20 yeras later they have kids. Katniss continues having nightmares and thinks one day she will have to explain this girl and boy as to why.<br /><br />That's it and yes that fast... A COMPLETE DROP OF THE BALL ON THIS ONE<br /><br />Even if you accept Prim's death and Petaa's marriage and that Katniss was not tortured or executed and never became a real leader. Why was all of this glossed over?<br /><br />You will set this book down feeling cheated.<br /><br />I for one would like to have had the story actually come to cover:<br /><br />Gales escape, what Peeta did in the capital, how did Peeta stop wanting to kill Katniss, how did Effie survive, What was done to honor Prim, such as a memorial or Katniss grieving, Did the public ever discover who bombed the blockade of children, how did the districts establish their new government, how did they survive afterwards, how did the citzens of the capital cope, did anyone even think of ordering the nukes dismantled, how will the general population remember Katniss, why did Greasy Sae become Katniss's personal cook, was it even her idea, Did Katniss teach her children to hunt, what were their names,<br /><br />I could go on and on, seriously.<br /><br />This author wrote such a detailed an elaborate world to simply give up on it and leave the reader feeling confused andlet down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such a great book - kept me hooked and guessing all the way through and had me on an emotional rollercoaster.  Great character development.  Without spoiling, I just wasn't thrilled with the ending.  However it's still one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Free &amp; fun!  The ads aren't that bad, though I tend not to complain when I get things for free.  I love that the games are more like mini games.  Fun app for when you have some time to waste.  Some of the games are pretty addictive!  I just don't understand the 1 star reviews.  They tell you outright that there are ads and that you have to unlock all but 10 of the games.  I think that makes it better.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|good game to play when board I have a lot of fun playing it and the best part is that u don't need to spend any money to play
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First off, I have to tell you that I never completed a trilogy. I normally get bored with books.  Since I got my Kindle Fire, I started reading the Hunger Game Trilogy. I loved the first book. This book relates to all people. If you are young or old, you will love this.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|Surprise!  If you are like me and did not know there has been updates to BluRay software, you will not be able to get this or other new BluRay disks to work.  since this is not a  3D movie, save yourself a headache and get the DVD instead of the BluRay.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought this book when it first came out.  I usually love finding an author I've never read before and this book offered everything I like in a book.  So, what went wrong? The beginning dragged on and on and I just couldn't get into it.  I've tried 4 different times to read this book but it bores me to sleep.  Should I try to get farther into the book? Does it get better or should I just drop it off at my library?
B008MEM24S|4.0|Love this game because it's simple enough for adults, but challenging for kids.  My kids are enjoying simply rescuing Perry, while the adults work through getting all of the gnomes.  Kid most interested is almost 5.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the calculator is extremely easy to use and has great big buttons to make usage easier. .... .... ..... ..
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Oh my goodness. I have had this on my kindle for months now and I can't get through it.  Let me state that I am not a prude.  I enjoy romance, love stories, sex, etc.  But this is ridiculous.  It's like a porno -- all sex no story.  I simply can't stand it.  They have sex a million times a day. He degrades her and hurts her. He has major issues and needs to grow up.  She needs to get a backbone and get the hell of of there.  I really don't care how this story ends.  Every few days I read a chapter, roll my eyes, scream in frustration and then read another book.  I can't believe this is going to be a movie. Why?  And all of the hype it received?? Everyone said how great it was so I thought I'd try it. Boy, are there are a lot of horny old ladies out there.  Sorry.  I know it's \\"to each his own.\\"  I will keep my mouth shut now so all of the Christian Grey lovers don't want to beat me into submission.
B003IN7YPU|5.0|The whole process was slick and easy and the package arrived before the due date. People in South Africa need to remember that VAT is also due on receipt. The quality of the new discs is awesome and is imperative for anyone interested in history or would like their kids understand what happened in the second world war. This is a real keeper.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I feel dead inside. That's what reading this book has done to me. I. feel. dead. inside.<br /><br />Background information:<br />Earlier this year, I stumbled upon an incident--I lie, there were several--that inspired me to create such shelves as not-for-me and authors-behaving-badly and add this book with all the other books accredited to Jamie McGuire on them. This explains the first comment on this review thread.<br /><br />I was angry and I rated the book poorly. Then I got over it and removed the rating, and for a while, forgot this book existed.<br /><br />Ah, those were the happy days.<br /><br />Then came summer and Simon & Schuster announced their massive brain fart of acquiring this novel and reprinting it. They made the choice to enhance their marketing campaign by allowing free review copies distributed through NetGalley. This was my one chance to read the novel for free and rate it in exchange for this simple tag:<br /><br />***I received an Advanced Readers Copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. ***<br /><br />In this case, the Advanced Readers Copy means the superficially edited self-published version.<br /><br />Actual review:<br />I hated it. Contrary to popular belief, I didn't want to hate it. I don't enjoy reading bad books for fun--I don't like tormenting myself with bad literature--but neither do I start a book expecting to find something positive or other redeemable qualities. I don't artificially skew my perception just so I can lie about what a good book this is.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />Though McGuire seems incapable of using simple he said/she said dialogue tags, there were moments, bits of dialogue, and a set up most promising that in the hands of any other talented or even a competent author could have been solid gold. It could have been the the story of two flawed people falling in love and perhaps changing for the better even if not transforming utterly normal people instead of romanticised description of abuseand misogyny. There were things Travis said or did that in any other setting and context would have been touching, sweet, deliciously heart-rending--but this was Travis and those things were anything but.<br /><br />McGuire's simplistic writing is readable, even likeable at times, but it's also uneven. There are good bits and then there are horribly bad bits. There were times when I'd forget to stop and think what made sense and what didn't, and I'd just plough through pages without even realising it. Then the only recollection I'd have was having felt something. If I wasn't paying attention to what it made me feel, I would--could, possibly, perhaps--understand why some people would think this a good book.<br /><br />But I didn't just plough through the pages. I read them slowly, carefully taking notes and always thinking of what made sense and what didn't--very little, as it turns out.<br /><br />Can a story be character driven without characterisations?<br /><br />Apart from Travis' tattoos--those tattoos are mighty important since they define what he can study and what his future career is going to be--not a single character in this book is given a proper, layered, characterisation. Not all characters are given physical descriptions, even Shepley, who as Travis' cousin-slash-roommate and America's boyfriend is prominently portrayed secondary character, is never given a physical description. To this day I don't have a clue as to what he looks like. I know Abby and America are both blonds, I know Travis is tattooed all over and has hazel eyes, I even have a vague impression of Parker, but other than that I do not know. It's never revealed.<br /><br />What I do know is that Shepley is the lapdog enabler. He exists to be America's boyfriend and provide a link between Travis and Abby. He exists to among others to make excuses for Travis' behaviour. He doesn't have any other function in this story.<br /><br />America is Abby's best friend the Weathervane. Depending onthe scene she's either trying to keep Abby and Travis apart or trying to get them together. She's always dreamt of her and Abby dating brothers or cousins, so they could become real family or something other. America exists to drive Abby around and to scold her either for resisting Travis or not resisting him enough.<br /><br />Parker is the token third wheel, a secondary love interest option paper doll. He's rich and a hardworking student, but ultimately he's just another jerk and not a viable third corner of a triangle--and that honour he has to share with Jesse, the ex-boyfriend. Parker exists to flirt with Abby and to make Travis jealous when the mood strikes. He also exists to prompt a casual date rape scenario.<br /><br />Finch is the token gay guy. He exists to provide Abby with alcohol and a shoulder to cry on whenever America is lip-locked with Shepley and too busy to notice.<br /><br />Kara is the roommate who we never see. She exists to make a handful of accurate comments and remains the sole remotely likeable character in the book.<br /><br />Abby giggles. She studies high school level biology in college and sucks at it. She apparently likes numbers but hardly ever talks about those classes. She has a dark, dark past that's never talked about until it's all that's talked about. She likes to drink and plays a mean game of poker. All these details and I still don't know what drives her. I don't know what her inner passions are or how she thinks and the book is written from her perspective in the first person limited voice.<br /><br />Travis prizefights for money. He's a genius and he doesn't need to study. Travis has a short temper, cocky attitude, a dead mother, four brothers and a father who taught him everything he knows about beating other people up. Travis has tattoos. Travis has a six pack--such a shame it's not a twelve pack--and he's never met a speed limit he couldn't break. Drunk or sober.<br /><br />Travis doesn't hit Abby. He comes into the bathroom when she's in the shower. He comes up with a bet to keep her in the house with her. He talks her into sleeping in the same bed as him, because he's never brought a girl he's f****d there. He forces her to change her clothes when she dresses up too sexy. He grabs her to keep her safe. He stalks her. He buys her a puppy to stop her from leaving. He scares her when she is in the car kissing another man. He trashes the house the morning after they have sex because she leaves and refuses to talk to him. He beats up several guys for simply touching her.<br /><br />And she lets him.<br /><br />Worse, she's manipulating him right back. On one occasion Abby tells Travis to teach someone manners, and he beats the guy to a pulp. There aren't any repercussions or a fallout. Several of these unprovoked attacks happen outside the illegal prizefighting circles with plenty of eyewitnesses around. Yet, Travis is never detained, arrested, or even confronted by his friends. They're all making excuses for him.<br /><br />Abby's reactions to Travis' behaviour make no sense. She's either blaming herself or acting irrationally and manipulating the situation to her end. She's playing with Travis just as much he's playing with her as evidenced by the events of the night they first sleep together. She tells him he's a virgin, he tells her he likes it rough, they have sex--one of the few times condoms were used--and in the morning, she leaves. He trashes the house. America the worst friend who ever lived, comes to get Abby to talk Travis down. Not to make sure that Abby is safe and sound and far away from the psycho as possible, but to fetch her to the house so she can talk to Travis and calm him. So she can understand him.<br /><br />The abuse, the antifeminism, the misogyny, the casual slut shaming, rape threads, girl-on-girl hate, it's all omnipresent. You can't avoid it.<br /><br />Character driven stories rely on one essential idea: That the main character learns something. That all the pain and heartache, all the adventures that they experience within the story enrich them as a human being and make them grow as a person. Not necessarily for the better, but simply more aware. On some level the characters do need to be conscious of their actions and choices they make in the end of the book in a way they weren't at the start of it.<br /><br />In this, Beautiful Disaster fails.<br /><br />Travis does forsake all others but he isn't any better taking into account Abby's feelings in the end of the book than he is in the beginning of it. As for Abby, life is still a huge poker game she'll bluff her way through like it was before she met Travis. Well, maybe not bluff, but she's always had a talent of manipulating the cards in her favour.<br /><br />Instead of bare boned characters who apparently learn nothing within the four hundred and twenty odd ebook pages, I could be talking about the overall plot of the book. Except, there isn't one:<br /><br />A girl goes to see a fight. A girl meets a boy. They skip time and become friends. They make a bet and end up living under the same roof. They dance around each other and a girl tries dating another guy. The boy gets jealous and they sleep together. The bet has ended and the girl leaves. Boy gets angry. Girl comes back. They fight and the girl tries to leave. The boy gets her a puppy to make her stay--<br /><br />This isn't a plot. This is a list of consecutive events describing a dysfunctional codependent relationship. Of course, we could call it a relationship drama, but we'd also have to redefine words relationship and drama. There's no internal conflict. Nothing is addressed and nothing is learned. All obstacles are external ones and easily cast aside.<br /><br />But this is a romance novel about two people finding love together, you say.<br /><br />No. It's not.<br /><br />This is as mislabelled as a romance as it was mislabelled as a young adult novel. There is absolutely nothing romantic about this book. It's the author's ode to Travis' character. A controlling, abusive, stalker is in the centre of everything and the reader can't escape him even when Abby is on a date with another man. The conversation always quickly returns to Travis and stays there.<br /><br />I'm bringing up the Twilight connection:<br /><br />This book reads like a Twilight fanfiction or work heavily inspired by Twilight.<br /><br />America behaves as bipolar as Alice, and Travis is set upon a pedestal and worshipped just like Edward was. Travis shares Edward's penchant for speeding. Travis and Abby's first date is in a restaurant where the waiter flirts with him and he starts questioning him over the food. The biology lessons and the absent parent figures. Abby likes to bite her lip almost as much as Kristen Steward in her portrayal of Bella Swan. Parker Hayes reads like a distorted Mike Newton. etc. etc.<br /><br />There isn't any proof that I'm aware of to show that this ever was posted and labelled as a Twilight fanfiction. I'm going to have to go with the \\"inspired\\" by Twilight theory and keep my opinions to myself...<br /><br />It looks like I failed too.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is incredible!<br />I saw this on television one night and I was so enthralled with it that I just had to buy it. This was the first time I saw Les Miserables and I can honestly say that I see what the fuss is about. I was always a Hunchback of Notre Dame fan but Victor Hugo honestly outdid himself with an amazing story and the composers are pure genius.<br />Alfie Boe...I love you. I'm a twenty-two year old girl and I am in freaking love with you. YOU ARE AMAZING! Your voice, especially in Bring Him Home/ Bring Me Home was astounding. <3<br />Evil captain guard guy, I love you too! Your voice was incredible also and I love your songs! Especially when you and Jean sang together. Pure awesomeness on stage.<br />Fantine, you were my favorite female character. Wooo child do you have some vocals on you. Your voice made me almost cry. It's so beautiful.<br />Young rebel leader, I loved you too!<br />Cosette and Epoline, you both were amazing.<br />Nick Jonas, can't stand your songs normally but you were great in your role.<br />And everyone else, you all were superb.<br />Really you must try this dvd out. If you like musicals I can't imagine why you wouldn't like this.<br />My only complaint is that no one in the audience threw a rose at the cast. They deserved it. Especially Alfie.
B0090EIILU|3.0|This movie had the potential to be hilarious on the level of borat++, however it was watered down, and instead a cheezy \\"love connection\\" occurs.<br />Written almost with the standard \\"date movie\\" formula, it's predictibility was disappointing.<br /><br />Basically - You trade the awkward social tension style comedy that \\"borat\\" is known for, and invert it.<br />It would make a pretty lousy date movie IMO, but it meets the criteria.<br /><br />If you are expecting comedy like borat, you will be sadly disappointed.<br /><br />Not bad - I'd say a 2.5/5
B004QL7K6G|1.0|It's hard to know where to begin with this movie.  From a technical standpoint, the entire production has a home movie / reality TV feel.  As if the production used a single Best Buy videocam with just the built-in microphone, and was filmed in the diretor's back yard.  Music is added in an amateurish and perfunctory manner.<br /><br />But the script is really what distinguishes Wanderlust ...and puts it into the 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' realm of badness.  There was not one funny scene  (not one; it was an ordeal to sit through) ... the movie waddled from one embarrassing situation to the next (I felt sorry for the actors, though Jennifer Aniston seems increasingly to be involved in such doomed projects).  Perhaps the scriptwriter and director are so in love with the 60's and the arrested development commune life depicted that scripted situations seemed funny (or maybe you need a toke to see the humor) but for the rest of us there was no irony ... the script is stupid, uncomfortable and just awful.<br /><br />The DVD cover picture seems to suggest this is a comedy - but there is not one laugh in the entire movie (not one, I tell you, unless you think a hippy's impaired memory is a hoot ... in which case you would be better off with Cheech & Chong's or Harold & Kumar's classics).  I was truly convinced that there were no retakes in the film, and that most of the dialog was ad libbed.  But outtakes were shown during the credits (maybe these were the only retakes) indicating that the cast seemed to think that much of the script was funny - I guess there really is no accounting for taste, is there.<br /><br />When the ordeal of watching Wanderlust ended for us (all 1 hour and 30 minutes of it) we were left wanting to see a real movie (or take a toke) just to get this out of our heads.  We downloaded 'Get the Gringo' with Mel Gibson.  Now there is a great script with the right actor, and super comedy ... but that's another story.

B005LAIGF0|3.0|This film is two and a half hours about an inmature and mean-spirited teenager called Lisa. I don't have a problem with the cinematography or the acting, which are very good (Ana Paquin's peformance alone is worth watching, thus the three stars); I just have a problem with the plot.<br /><br />Paquin's character, Lisa, lies to the police about an accident that she is almost entirely to blame, and then she gets upset and does whatever she can to get Ruffalo, the bus driver, fired because she feels guilty for causing the accident. I don't mind watching films about such characters, but to make her look as if she has nothing but good intentions and trying to get the viewer to feel for her and understand her? That's just absurd. More absurd is when she goes to the police to change her statement, and the police instead of dismissing her for being not only a minor but a liar, pay attention to her all along and tell her they will see what they can do for her. Are we supposed to feel sorry and sympathize with Lisa? What kind of police department is this? She admitted she lie and then wants to tell the truth and the police don't even bother making her see what's wrong about this?<br /><br />In addition, what's the deal with all the random and forced class discussions that have nothing to do with anything? Class discussions about September 11, the war in Irak, and the Nazi and the Jewish are thrown in to make the movie thought provoking despite the fact that none of this has anything to do with anything. Or I guess that the film is trying to make Lisa look as if she is somebody who cares about current events and history and has a brain and an opinion of her own. Or the writer is trying to compare Lisa's own guilty feelings and justification for her acts to those of people involved in WWII, the war in Irak and September 11. I don't know, whatever is the case, I found it random and forced. Without this, I probably would have liked the movie better.<br /><br />There's also an array of characters that are far from being likable, and which makes you understand why Lisa is the way she is. Culkin taking her virginity, Reno's boring personality, Broderick feeling threatened by a student who has a brain, Lisa's self-absorbed and selfish parents, Monica's mildly deranged friend, the Mickey Mouse Law school young lawyer who seemed to have missed class that day to meet Lisa and Monica's friend at a coffee shop to talk about the trial, etc.<br /><br />I only liked Monica's friend, for a moment, when she tells Lisa to stop thinking the world is a tragic play where she is the star and tells her to grow up and get out of her appartment. Finally, somebody showed to have some sense at least for a couple of minutes in the film.<br /><br />Matt Damon's character being seduced by Lisa is the icing on the cake. After Lisa has sex with him, her math teacher, she approaches him when he is, I am assuming, with his girlfriend or another teacher, and tells them she just had an abortion, obviously hinting that the baby might have been Damon's and trying to get him in trouble. Of course, she didn't have any abortion, but this is good-spirited Lisa, once again, with her good intentions trying to sell sympathy while trying to get other people in trouble because she feels guilty. Again, are we supposed to feel sorry and sympathy for Lisa? She should've been run by the bus instead of Monica.<br /><br />I repeat, if a movie about such a character is going to be done, don't try to sell sympathy for her. This movie is about Lisa, a detestable character that makes you end up loathing this film.ay of characters that are far from being likable, and which makes you understand why Lisa is the way she is.

B008E374PO|3.0|To give you an idea about this reviewer...<br /><br />I've made it a point to collect whatever Adam puts out.  The only things that have slipped by me are a few tracks that are essentially download-only or that only appear on import CD's like SHY VIOLET and LONELY LULLABY.<br /><br />I'll explain why I've rated this short of five stars.<br /><br />Score one star for being an active artist, instead of just dropping off the face of the earth with the popularity he's achieved thus far and resting on his laurels.  The man is keeping his creative spark alive.<br /><br />Score a second star for being an open-minded artist and allowing others to join in the creative process.  Instead of ADAM ADAM ADAM all the time, we get a healthy taste of collaboration.  I would think that takes courage.  What if all these other people botch it?  Didn't faze him.  He still went exploring with his musical style, letting others lend guidance in the process.<br /><br />Here's what COST stars in my view...<br /><br />Knock off one star for the fact that the new style is the same old same old we hear on the radio.  I realize that this is the style of Euro-Pop which is a notch better than straight Pop, but it's not enough of a difference for me.  A step above, yet a step down for an artist who had an original style that superseded all in the first place.  What was pure has been tainted and the new mixed color isn't all that vibrant.<br /><br />And knock off a second star for the lack of vivid and imaginative word pictures.  Oldschool Owl City is as much about the lyrics as it is about the sound.  When I sit down to do my watercolor paintings, I listen to everything from OCEAN EYES Deluxe Ed. back to OF JUNE and also the SKY SAILING release, and even some pieces from ALL THINGS B & B.  Adam's vision of a bright and whimsical fantasy world rubs off on me while I paint.  It's a creative voice that speaks to the younger me where the magic possibilities and youthful wonder resides.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but that spark is nowhere to be found in Midsummer Station.<br /><br />Now hold up, I'm not saying this is a BAD album.  I dare say that I'm glad I bought it.  It has it's proper place in my OC collection and I salute Adam for his hard work in bringing it to me.  I will listen to it from time to time.<br /><br />But it's not on the radar if someone asks me what a good starter CD would be for getting acquainted with this artist.<br /><br />Anyhoo, I look forward to whatever Adam puts out in future.  I'm not dismayed by this little experiment.  If he decides to go off in another different direction, I'll follow along to see what he finds.e to say it, but that spark is nowhere to be found in Midsummer Station.<br /><br />Now hold up, I'm not saying this is a BAD album.

B000KIPT30|4.0|Great mini amplifier, enough power for headphones with no distortion, which says a lot about this little device. Very small size, great size.<br /><br />It feels strongly built, like it's going to last a lot, from the buttons, the metal case, everything feels solid enough.<br /><br />The only thing missing is an on/off switch. I feel this is an important feature missing. That's why I giving it four stars.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|It is based on a Dr. Seuss book. This should tell you something about the movie. I thought the movie was done well. The story line and voice actors were good. It is a tree hugger's movie, but it was not over powering in the movie to make it non enjoyable.
B000FC1192|5.0|There is nothing else like it. This is a have to read book, I realy do sugest you read this book. I also am starting to think that buttons are scary. If you like mystery books than this is your book!!!!!!
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|A lot of reviews out there already. Personally I thought the actor who played John Carter, Taylor Kitsch, was a joke. Even angry people have more than one emotion. The story line was OK, but wasn't developed. Something you would expect from Disney a good idea but poorly executed. An example is that he is not willing to fight for anyone, but he does anyway. There is a lot of materials I could tell you why I did not like it, but it is not worth it. I am glad I waited for the price to drop for it to rent, because it was not worth more than 2 dollars to watch. This movie is good for people who don't care about details in the stories.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Good clean fun. Mr. Grisham starves for new material, however, somehow comes up with slightly new stuff that I still enjoy.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ebook was delivered with ease. The availability of the trilogy made it possible to continue the read without interruption.  Loved the triology.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|Here we have season 4 of the great BREAKING BAD on blu ray and it is indeed a gift for fans.  Not only is season 4 the best so far but the video and audio presentation with the blu ray is spectacular.  The black/white ratio is perfect and colors are vibrant and pop when necessary and subdued when in need.  The picture always has superb clarity and detail.  The beautiful outdoor shots which are a big part of this show look amazing.  Flesh tone is always realistic.  And the audio is perfection.  From hearing a pin drop to a gun shot the sound is always strong, clear and direct.  Dialogue is prominent and comes from the speakers strong and central.  The surround speakers are put to amazing use with this season.  Each episode here varies from dialogue driven scenes to powerful dramatic action scenes and the DTS 5.1 audio makes it even better.<br /><br />This is one show where the blu ray provides a far superior viewing experience to the dvd.  And that is saying a lot for the dvd also looks excellent.  BREAKING BAD is an amazing show with an overall plotline that crosses over so many different emotions and varying subject matter.  And the acting is excellent.  The entire cast from Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn just to mention a few continue to meet the high level of expertise this series demands.  It is surely one of the best drama series to ever be on television.  And the season 4 blu ray comes with amazing bonus features.  There are over 15 hours of them from an extended version of the amazing season finale, interviews, deleted scenes, alternate takes and a gag reel.  The list goes on and on.  Bottom line, BREAKING BAD season 4 is a must for fans and the entire series is a must for fans of high quality television.  There is no waste in the extras.  It is a feast of information and background on this amazing series.  As I said, every season of this series is exceptional and highly recommended but with season 4 the show reached new highs.  And the blu ray is the best way to view it.he best way to view it.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down. After reading the first, 50 Shades of Grey, I just kept reading to find out more and more about the characters. It is truly a wonderful love story for adult reading. You must read all three and then you will wish for more.

1606863622|3.0|I had heard of a couple of Nicholas Sparks's book titles as movies before I realized they were books first.<br />I haven't seen the movies, but I was interested in the books since they were popular enough to be made into films.  Sorry to say, when I saw \\"Dear John\\" at a used book sale, I didn't even remember that I had read it until I started reading it again.<br /><br />To me, the writing was neither very good nor engrossing;<br />I just read it because it was something to do.  The story contained a kind of unnecessary secrecy that perhaps is supposed to seem noble, but I didn't like or admire it.<br /><br />I think part of the strain I felt in this story and in the writing could be related to the fact that one of Sparks's children has the same name, Savannah, as his main female character.<br /><br />This book was better than a typical phony-sounding romance novel, but didn't do much for me.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app has been a lot of fun! It's concept is a little different and I like the increasing difficulty as you move up levels. I would recommend it highly.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|Tower Heist had promise.  Make that a TON of promise, but it ends up disappointing mainly because of the slow-moving and unfunny storyline.  It's about a group of people who team up and break into the upper room of a hotel to take back the money that was stolen by a Wall Street businessman played by Alan Alda.  They come up with a rather unspectacular and unappealing plan to search for a safe hidden in the wall that supposedly contains millions of dollars.<br /><br />Really, if it wasn't for Eddie Murphy starring in the film, I'd have turned it off before the halfway point.  The first 40 minutes are really THAT boring.  In fact Eddie Murphy's character never really saves it either despite playing the role of a crook who's good at stealing things.  His character and communication with Ben Stiller are actually highlights and they aren't even anything particularly memorable.  That just goes to show how unpleasant the movie is.<br /><br />The only worthwhile scene is the one where Eddie's character gets released from prison and while in a shopping mall he makes those who are planning to go through with the robbery prove they have what it takes to succeed by stealing 50 dollars worth of items throughout the mall.  This was actually funny and a rare example of good writing, especially when Eddie walks away with all their wallets.<br /><br />I guess the ending is satisfying enough, not to recommend, but to feel like I didn't totally waste my time.  I won't spoil it, but everyone who had their money stolen receives surprise package deliveries and well, let's just say they're quite surprised alright.  I wish I'd gotten my money back for watching Tower Heist.  A disappointment that misses the mark in the legendary career of Eddie Murphy.

B0090EIILU|1.0|This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  When I saw the trailer of this movie, I was expecting maybe a couple of funny scenes... but in reality, this whole movie is so bad I was so tempted to turn it off and watch the Kardashian show (and thats pretty bad).<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie to anyone, even if you are trapped in a shelter, with no cable, no radio, no Internet and the only thing you have is a dvd and this movie? not even there, I would recommend you to watch it.  It is a waste of time.
0807014273|5.0|Book was purchased as a gift.  I have been familuar with it for years and have found significance from the ideas so simply expressed for my own life. Seller shipped promptly and book was as described.
0380730405|5.0|My mom had recommended me reading this book because she said it was her favorite. Let me tell you, I am so glad I read it. This book is full of suspense and drama. Despite what another reviewer had said, I loved the main charater, sympathized with her, and rooted for her all the way through. The only thing I wished DuMaurier had done different was name the new Mrs. De Winter. I wish I could put a name with such a great charcter. Then again, it adds to the sort of mystery of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I am so glad I finally found my favorite book, Rebecca.<br /><br />P.S. I am a freshman in highschool

B005K17RU0|2.0|works sporadically at best.<br />the location function stinks. would not recommended to android users. wish there were more weather application to choose from.
0345803485|1.0|This book was really poorly written. A few parts were entertaining and amusing, but the majority of it was extremely annoyingly juvenile. The main female character gets angeringly annoying.. she seems to have the emotional and intelligence level of a 3 year old. The book reads like it was written for and by an immature, naive, sheltered little girl.<br /><br />I am so shocked that this book is so widespread... they must have had one absolutely incredible advertising campaign. Maybe they advertised it to young girls who've never read an erotic novel so the sexual descriptions were enough to excite them and make them oblivious to the massive amounts of garbage the book contained. I am going to have to talk to a girl who liked it to try and figure out wtf was going through her head...

0345803485|1.0|Naturally because of all the 'hype' around this book I wanted to read it. I read it in one sitting. The reason I could get through it in one sitting is it was so damn repeditive. You could scan over pages. There was no development you had to pay attention to.<br />I was waiting for more. More to the story. Something that gave it some depth and not just laughable sex scenes and lots of biting lips (which drives Mr Grey crazy....yes I got the point).<br /><br />To me it seemed like an adult version of Twilight.<br /><br />And I hate Twilight.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert has done it again. His songs show emotion and they give you a sense of brotherhood. His songs are relatable and different. They show he is not crazy, but really has a lot in common with everyone. Even though \\"Cuckoo\\" is about being crazy, it's more of a song about how others view him. Even people who typically don't like him will most likely find enjoyment in this lovely CD.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun to play, easy to follow and the graphics are pretty sharp. I could see in time though once the village is set up,  it could get boring unless ur willing to pay for extra.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|I agree with a reviewer from Aug. 16 who said the game play slows down quickly after the first day.  Future game play at any rate quicker than 5 minutes per day will cost me real money.  I wont be paying and will soondelete the game.  Cute though when I could Do things!
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Having seen the Showtime series, I decided to read the books the show is based on.  The interesting thing is that the characters are the same, but the plot in the book was a lot different than the TV show.  I found this book very captivating and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries with a little horror thrown in.

B006470HQ0|3.0|*****WARNING - SPOILERS*****<br /><br />This episode is a bit slower paced than the previous episode. It still has a lot going on, but it doesn't have the quick twists and turns and surprise plot twists that I have come to expect of the Walking Dead. It has a bit of \\"filler\\" in it and a lot of dialog scenes. I won't go over every single point; I will just hit some of the highlights.<br /><br />The group sets up at the farm where Carl Grimes is recovering in order to try to find Sophia, Carol's daughter. They have a funeral for Otis, the hunter who supposedly saved Shane's life (according to Shane). Shane is asked to say words during the service and he does: all lies. Shane asks Lori if she meant what she said about wanting him to stick around and she says yes, not realizing that he is thinking that she means permanently. Big mistake leading Shane on, even if you only mean it as a family friend!<br /><br />The doctor asks everyone to give up their guns as long as they are staying on the property. Daryl goes off to look for Sophia. I used to think Daryl was the crazy one but now I think it's Shane.<br /><br />I see the group's structure as follows: Rick as the main leader, with Shane and Rick as sort of co-leaders, but with Rick mainly in charge although he defers to Shane on some decisions. However, Shane is dangerous because Rick trusts him, he is psycho, and he has access to Rick's wife and daughter.<br /><br />Rick asks if one of the group can keep a gun as a lookout, and the doctor agrees, so Dale gets to keep a gun. While exploring the property, Dale finds an well with a zombie in it. They have to get the zombie out so it won't contaminate the well water, but the zombie won't go for anything but live bait, so they tie Glenn onto a rope and lower him into the well. (!) This turns out to be a bad plan, as you will see.<br /><br />They end up getting half the zombie out, so their plan of not contaminating the well by not shooting the zombie doesn't work. They stillcontaminate the well and have to seal it off or else all of the farm's water will end up contaminated.<br /><br />Carol is despondent because they haven't found Sophia yet. On one of Daryl's treks into the woods, he finds a flower, a Cherokee Rose. He brings it back to Carol and tells her the story behind it. On the Trail of Tears, when many Cherokee women lost their babies and cried for them. The elders said a prayer and asked for a sign to uplight the mothers' spirits and give them strength and hope. The next day, this rose started to grow right where the mothers' tears fell. They called it the Cherokee Rose. Daryl tells Carol he believes that there is a flower for Sophia as he thinks they will find her.<br /><br />Rick negotiates with the doctor regarding them possibly staying on their land after Carl Grimes has recovered from his gunshot wound and after Sophia is found, and the doctor says maybe. He had said they would have to definitely leave.<br /><br />While in town gathering supplies, Glenn gets a pregnancy test for Lori, who takes it and learns that she is pregnant. Since she looks very upset, my first thought is, who is the father? Is it Shane or Rick?<br /><br />Overall, the tone of this episode is much different. Past episodes in Season One have been extremely action-focused with a tense plotline packed with lots of story, twists and turns, and something new happening continously. This episode almost seemed to drag. In my opinion, they have 13 episodes in this season, and already the writers are seeming to almost luxuriate in having 13 episodes.<br /><br />I want to see the writing remain as tight as it was in Season One. I am seeing signs that isn't going to be the case. That is unfortunate. We will probably still get a pretty decent series out of it. The characters are likeable, and the plot is entertaining. But the first six episodes of the series set all of us up for the ride of our lives, and we were all expecting so much more out of this second season, so seeing something like this is a bit of a letdown. It is overall okay, just not as good as I had hoped.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game I ever played. the creators really thought this game out. if your deciding whether to buy this game get it.
B0061IMJ2W|5.0|*****Contains SPOILERS*****<br /><br />One thing I like tremendously about this series is the camera work. This is very evident in the opening sequence of this episode. A man is cutting his hair in a mirror. It is done in extreme close-up. We find ourselves trying to work out time and place. Is it present day? Is it in the zombie apocalyptic time? Is it a flashback? Is it Rick Grimes? Is he having a shower at the doctor's house? ... The shots of the soap, of the cut hair, of the razor, all are too close to tell when or where this haircut is or even who the man is.<br /><br />Finally, the camera pans back a bit and we are able to see that the man is Shane Walsh. His hair has just been all shaved off. It is somehow a very disturbing scene. We watch as Shane looks at himself in a mirror. We are left not knowing anything about when this has taken place.<br /><br />The opening credits begin to roll.<br /><br />Already the tension for the episode has built up!<br /><br />The opening scene in the high school in which Shane and the hunter have to escape from the zombies is very good. Shane escapes but it doesn't look good for the hunter and we are left not knowing his fate.<br /><br />Back at the farmhouse, I am enjoying this episode until Lori gives a speech about why maybe Carl is better off dead. Shane isn't back yet with the supplies and the doctor has not yet operated. But it doesn't seem in Lori's character to give such a speech. To me, it seems more like \\"filler episode\\" type stuff that writers stick in to fill in more time and it doesn't seem realistic, either. What mother wouldn't want their son to survive an operation like this? But she does explain that their friend who is dead now doesn't have to go through any of this ordeal anymore.<br /><br />Now we are back at the school where Shane and the hunter have gone to pick up supplies so that the doctor can operate on Carl. Shane is about at the end of his rope. It looks like he is about to be overrun by zombies when the hunter shows up to save him. Nice work. Will they get back in time with the medical supplies?<br /><br />Carl wakes up and his parents are thrilled until he starts going into seizures. He doesn't have a lot of time before the doctor needs to operate to remove the five remaining bullet fragments, and the doctor needs more transfusion blood. Rick undergoes a third transfusion at great personal risk (death) to himself.<br /><br />Shane has injured himself. He and the hunter are still running from the zombies. Shane is having a hard time because of his leg. He keeps falling. He tells the hunter to go on ahead and leave him. The hunter refuses.<br /><br />Back at the farmhouse, they have waited too long. They have decided to go ahead and operate without any of the necessary equipment needed to save Carl. The operation will probably fail. But there is no time left. Carl will die if they wait any longer. As they begin, they hear a truck. It is Shane. He has returned with the equipment. But the hunter is not with him. Shane is clearly upset and beside himself: we are under the impression that the hunter has saved Shane's life and gave up his own life for Shane's and Carl's.<br /><br />But then we return to the shower scene, the one from the beginning of the episode. And we see what really happened at the school yard, what really happened when Shane and the hunter were running from the zombies. Shane shoots the hunters leg, shattering his kneecap, and fed the hunter, live, to the zombies. He murdered the hunter in cold blood. It was chilling. It was a reminder that we cannot trust Shane. He is not a friend to Rick. He covets Rick's wife and child, and he is a psychotic killer. The guy is deranged. Sure, we could say it was all for some supplies, but this is beyond that. Shane is certifiably nuts, at least that is what I think.<br /><br />The last moments are Shane looking in the mirror at himself like a completely deranged psycho. Chilling.<br /><br />Great episode with a surprise twist ending.
031620157X|5.0|This book didn't me disappoint at all-it was even better than I've expected-the plot is original and so well written.Chris Colfer brought me to a different world and it didn't happen to me since Harry Potter.<br /><br />I reccomend this book to everyone,not just to a young audience-everyone should have a copy of this book at home.
B005YVSFT8|5.0|*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />I like the pace of this episode. It is quicker than the last episode, and things just seem to keep moving. There are a couple of spots where the dialog bogs down a little, but mostly things keep moving forward with very little filler.<br /><br />The episode begins with a flashback: Rick Grimes' wife is discussing her marital woes with a friend in what is pre-apocalyptic times. In this case, it is the day Rick Grimes was shot and is right before Lori Grimes finds out her husband has been shot. Shane Walsh drives up in a squad car and tells her. Then she has to tell her son that his father has been shot. After this emotional interlude, the episode begins.<br /><br />Rick Grimes is running through a field as fast as he can, carrying his bloodied son who has been shot. Behind him are Shane Walsh and the hunter who shot him, also running toward a house in the distance, where there is help waiting. Rick runs toward the house and there is a doctor inside, a nurse, and other people who first want to know if his son was bitten or scratched (standard procedure if you are in a world with zombies) and then proceed to operate on Rick's son Carl Grimes. Rick stands by helplessly watching, but knowing that these people are competent doing the best they can to save his son.<br /><br />Rick staggers out to the porch. Shane Walsh runs up, sees Rick's face covered in blood, and tries to wipe it off. It is the first sympathetic gesture we have seen coming from Shane in awhile toward Rick and it is actually touching and believable, as I have thought for awhile that Shane might murder Rick if he had a chance. It is hard to tell these days what Shane thinks of Rick.<br /><br />We learn that the hunter, Otis, did not see Carl. The hunter was aiming for the deer, and shot at the deer. The bullet passed through the deer and then hit Carl. The doctor informs us that the bullet is in six pieces. Rick is beside himself, wailing, \\"Lori doesn't know.\\" She and the rest of the team are in the woods still looking for Sophia.<br /><br />Lori and the team have heard the single gunshot, however. And Lori thinks it is suspicious. You don't use a single gunshot to put down a Walker, she argues. That is too risky. Her husband Rick wouldn't do that. So what was that single gunshot that they heard? It is bothering her, but they continue to look for Sophia.<br /><br />The doctor gets the first of six fragments out of Carl and uses blood transfusions from Rick. Rick is weak from lack of blood, but wants to go find Lori, who doesn't know her son has been shot. They send someone to bring Lori to the farm.  Lori and Rick learn the doctor operating on their son is a veterinarian.<br /><br />The doctor needs proper medical equipment to get the other five fragments out of Carl, as they are deeper. This equipment can only be gotten at a local high school, which was turned into an emergency FEMA shelter, but it has last been known to have been overrun by zombies. The hunter and Shane go after the supplies.<br /><br />The main action sequence is stealing the equipment from the high school, which is a very tense scene. In the last moments we are left in a cliffhanger with the two of them barricaded in the high school surrounded and outnumbered by zombies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we watch as somehow things just don't seem quite right with Theodore, who is in the RV on the highway with a bad cut on his arm. He has developed a high fever. The rest of the gang has regrouped there. Is Theodore about to turn into a zombie?<br /><br />We have to wait until the next episode to find out what happens to Shane and the hunter at the high school, whether they get the fragments out of Carl, whether or not they find Sophia, and why Theodore has this suspicious high fever!
B001I0T92Q|4.0|I really enjoyed my PhotoFast adapter but when I received it I realized that they sent me a Neo Flash adapter, PhotoFast has it's logo and what type it is while Neo Flash doesn't have said things and it's words aren't smushed on it also being a little bit stronger so it doesn't bend as much. All in all I love this product but for people who are using this for PSPs lie I am I would recommend getting a Class 4 Memory Card, you'll only receive some slow downs during auto-save anything higher and you should be just fine. Once again thank you PhotoFast for sending me this product and I hope to buy some more things from you!

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I am in love with all Sir Webbers works. This is the post Phantom musicial. Was done in London and not received well. Australia took this and reworked it and than taped it. Lots of plots and sub-plots. This is the way the 1st POTO should have ended but than we would have missed the 2nd one. About 4 of the songs will make it out of the show. Most are up to his usual excellence. The actors/singers are superb. Very well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|a good game to pass time when you are bored on the couch looking at the wall or the window.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It does not seem like 25 yrs since Les Mis hit Broadway. The music is timeless though. Bought for my 38 yr old daughter. I took her to her first Broadway show for her hi=school graduation. This is an anniversary performance and not the stage show but you can still follow the story without all the sets. Very well done.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a very addictive app.  It's very easy to lose track of time when playing.  Very similar to Where's My Water but with the cool factor of Perry the Platypus.  Would somehow be cooler with a Phineas and Fern tie in.  Or maybe Candace to somehow mess things up.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Both my wife and I enjoy this story.  It is outrageously funny.  A whole new twist on the boss misusing their authority.  I again used one of Amazon's related retailers for the purchase and, as always, things went very smoothly.

B008P9M614|1.0|I have waited eight years to be able to buy the complete series set. The only thing you get with it that you wouldn't get by buying them individually over the years seems to be a cool box to hold them together. Seriously?! Where are the extras that should be released with the complete series set? An extra disc or two? SOMETHING?!<br />LOVE the show though and will rewatch lots of the episodes but am reconsidering buy the series set like I always planned. :(

B008F5YDRI|4.0|This is a well crafted movie. My wife and I enjoyed watching it. The human conditions were something most who look for companionship can relate to. Great acting by Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor. All in all a good movie to relax to and enjoy with your significant other.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Gives a nice graphic to show battery charge, as well as run times for different phone uses. It's very handy, being free is just icing on the cake!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone I spoke to who had read these books enjoyed them so much that I had to see for myself what the fuss was all about.  I started by borrowing The Hunger Games from a friend, in case I didn't like them as well as they all seemed to.  After only a few chapters, I was hooked!  I purchased all three books in the series for my Kindle and read them straight through till I was done!  Loved them!!  I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys futuristic, young adult adventure.  Even though I'm way past that age group, I could relate to a lot of the story re:  family, friends, loved ones, and fighting for what's right.  Great job by Suzanne Collins.  I look forward to reading more from this author.
B008602KQI|5.0|As an avid Hunger Games fan (I've read all 3 books multiple times & saw the movie in theaters twice), I knew I had to purchase this DVD for my collection.<br /><br />The coloring is perfect (when compared to a Bluray) & the price was even better. I've already watched the movie twice with friends & plan on having more movie nights in the future.<br /><br />The special features disc is an added bonus too! I haven't watched them all yet, but what I have seen thus far makes the combo pack (movie + special features disc) a great buy.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B00008PBZW|3.0|This movie runs a fine line between the true story of the wind-talkers and the story of a soldier with shell shock and the horror of war... It seems to be all over the board as far as what it's really about. Wind-talker? Shell shock? The horrors of the war in the pacific? But it kinda seemed to border on a story that was \\"Iwo Jima\\" esk... I know you can't talk strictly about the wind-talkers or it just becomes a docu-drama, but there is really little focus on them at all and more on a soldier with shell shock.<br /><br />I do have it as part of my collection, and would recommend it to people who want good movies about WWII and what \\"really\\" went on, and goes on during war, but it's a disappointment as far as the story of the wind-talkers. But it may also help you realize the way a class of citizen in this country is \\"seen\\" but \\"not seen\\" in the eyes of many - even today...
034580404X|5.0|I'm not going to lie... I was expecting some explicit language, but NOT like this! This book is NOT for the under exposed, and I would hope that anyone buying this book would know what the book is about before buying it, especially if it's someone under the age of 18 asking for the series. But the books are WONDERFUL!!! They arrived two day ago, and I'm already half way through the second book. I'm absolutely HOOKED and cannot wait for the movie(s)!!
B004XWLN20|5.0|Great series if you are a Superman fan! This show has it all! Highly recommend it to all ages. The complete set or individual seasons.
B007SGM084|4.0|STEAMY! I've read all three, and there were times I wished there was alot more than an abundant amount of sex of various types, and it dragged slightly in a few areas.  I did finish all the books as it was interesting enough not to put to the way side thinking I'd get back to it later, if it goes to the side it usually stays there.  Lacks the extra depth of a 5 star, but much better reading than a three.  Worth reading.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I thought I had seen it all. Each new show that came down the pike had been done to an exhausting level before. Television was stale and I had just about given up and then \\"Once Upon a Time\\" came out. I would like to say I was hooked from the first episode but I wasn't. I watched the first three, thought they were ok but didn't go back for a number of months. I guess I was too jaded and did not see the brilliance of the show at the onset. The show definitely finds its footing around episode 7 and then takes off with a bullet. I had finally run out of things to watch so I decided to go back and watch them on Amazon and I am so glad I did. I burned through the entire season and am now in the middle of the season again as I watch it with my husband who is also in love with it. I adore how the writers can take fairytale characters we all know and grew up with and give them an adult depth and backstory that one can sink their teeth into. I cannot pick a favorite character but I do have a fondness for Rumplestilskin and the Mad Hatter back stories. I love how each episode weaves two stories simultaneously and leaves enough room to grow these stories over time. I cannot wait to find out who the doctor is for example and I am curious to see what happens with each of these characters next season. This show has a fantastic plot, 3-dimensional characters, a solid foundation for future seasons and a strong fan base. My one and only complaint is that the green screen can be a bit much at times. I can forgive that as I know they are trying to do a huge project on a television show budget. Still one of the most brilliant shows I have seen in years. I thought I would never love a show as much as \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" in my lifetime as I felt those shows were incredible. However, I think that \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is moving up the ladder fast. Love this show!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an outstanding trilogy. The story line about the characters was very interesting and kept me interested throughout all three titles. I have and will continue to recommend these books.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I was really excited to like this book. A colleague of mine was enthusiastic and so I jumped on board even though I had been burned by witch/vampire/daemon novels in the past. Well this was no exception.<br /><br />Diana is built as a tough single gal just trying to get through her scholarly duties and go for a daily jog/row probably for eternity. I was already disappointed in her however because of the OVERBEARING shame she carries with her in regards to her Witch heritage and untapped powers (that she only uses sparingly, so... wait doesn't that mean you're still using your witchcraft???). As a grown woman I'm not really into the shame game as it were. I'm more into independent ladies who aren't killing themselves trying to be something they are not! And then she meets Matthew and loses EVERY SINGLE OUNCE of her independence. Except when she is trying to test him and trying to make herself feel more like the \\"boss\\" of which she is definitely not. She is his lap dog, and it is disgusting.<br /><br />And oh my lord Matthew... what a tepid one-note of a character. I'm sorry, two-notes. He is either IRATE AND POSSESSIVE TO A POINT OF ABUSE or totally in love and mushy like partially cooked oatmeal. Bleh. Their love affair is bi-polar at best and there is absolutely no chemistry.<br /><br />The worst part of this novel is the rule changes. Every chapter it seemed that there was a new power, or enemy, or relative, or paranormal being that existed that didn't just moments before. Trying to keep track of them all made a chore out of what should have been a pleasant Summertime read. There is absolutely no reason for ALL of the add ons. Mostly because it started out as a pretty nice time.<br /><br />Something I did enjoy was all of the DNA and sciencey talk. I wish the book would have stayed more on track with that instead of trying to splice it onto a ancient spellbound book that I didn't even care about.<br /><br />Also, SPOILER-ALERT: There is a certain type of energy in this book that is NEVER released !this book that is NEVER released !

B005DZMP00|5.0|A sequel usually has little chance of being as good as the original, but in the case of the Grateful Dead's \\"Europe '72\\", this second volume is one of my favorite vault releases from the band. I'll go along with the widely held opinion that the highlight of this 2 CD set is the \\"Dark Star\\" > \\"Drums\\" > \\"The Other One\\" sequence on disc 2. This sequence runs well over 50 minutes. But other highlights abound on this release as well, like another great version of \\"Loser\\", a tight \\"Sugaree\\" and another great Pigpen sung \\"Good Lovin'\\".

B007N9FKCY|4.0|this game is beautiful. With 16-bit graphics and smooth gameplay, this game is a masterpiece. However, there is a downside. It gets insanely difficult very quick. I couldn't get past the second world. If this game wasn't as hard, I would give it 5 stars.
B0086700CM|2.0|This game gets annoying when you play it 24/7.  I don't like this game because its just a waste of time. All you do is Swipe and tilt the machine for coins id like it if it had levels.
B008XFB86Y|3.0|The plot was unpredictable and the action was nearly constant. The characters also seemed fairly realistic as everyone made mistakes or in the protagonist's case, at least he wasn't indestructible like in many other action movies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great because its free and it has a hundred one games on it you will love this game.
1400069289|4.0|Most of us recognize that we are largely a product of habits - good or bad.  Over time we develop our habits across a wide range of actions or thoughts - and, in-turn, those habits develop us.<br /><br />Here's a quick exercise for you:<br />-Think about your best habit.  How did it form?  How does it persist?<br />-Now think about your worst habit. How did it form? How does it persist?<br /><br />It may have taken some work for you to do that exercise, because in doing so, you were actively engaging your brain in the analysis of your habits, which by nature, avoid active cognitive engagement.<br /><br />This book explores habits - how they're formed, why they're formed, and what occurs in our brains in regards to habits, and how habits can change.  Using a multitude of examples from a wide variety of life, this book explores the habits of individuals, corporations, and societies.<br />As it turns out, our brains love habits - good or bad.  These `autopilot' responses and behaviors allow our brains to focus its energy on other, less familiar activities.  Our brains process a multitude of `cues' throughout each day.  If each `cue' required deliberate thinking (tying our shoes for example) we would be mentally exhausted before lunch.  Think about when you first learned how to drive a car.  The information your brain had to process was almost overwhelming  - hopefully this is no longer the case.<br /><br />The encouragement to me from reading this book was that though habits are pervasive and life shaping, our habits are not out of our control.  We are not victims of our habits. Rather, with intentional thought and action, our habits can and do change.<br /><br />\\"Once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom and the responsibility to remake them.  Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work.\\"<br /><br />So, what habits would you like to change?
B008S4YZCO|4.0|The game is great but its a little slow at times and there are occasional freezes but over all its a lot of fun!!

6305622914|5.0|I suffocate from laughter every time I watch this movie.  Get the fully exposed version with the British dialogue for best results! Make the effort to understand the Brit speak because Americans males are just too macho and uptight to let it all hang loose like the Brits.
0812993292|5.0|I am likely not the typical reader of this book, being only 22 years old but in my obsession with all things literary I came across this novel and was intrigued.<br /><br />The book is about a man named Harold Fry who receives a letter from a woman who he hasn't seen in 20 years. Queenie Hennessy has written to inform him that she is dying from cancer. As Harold remembers how much Queenie had done for him back in the days when they worked together, he realizes that he has to do something, anything to keep Queenie alive. He decides that he must walk over 600 miles to the hospital where  his old friend is dying and that as long as he is walking, she will live.<br /><br />What starts as a trip to the mail box to send off the letter becomes a cross country journey with nothing more than his wallet and his yacht shoes. Leaving behind his wife who he barely knows anymore, Harold not only opens his eyes to the world around him but also to his life. He begins to ask questions that everyone has asked themselves at some point, \\"How did I get here from the person I used to be?\\"<br /><br />On his walk, Harold meets many people, most of whom seem to support his decision and all of whom touch his heart. Finally it seems the entire country has heard of Harold and his incredible journey, they want him to succeed and they all want Queenie to live. But Harold is facing his demons as he struggles to understand how he and his beloved Maureen have gotten so far apart and how he failed his son David. In the end it may prove too much for this old man to handle.<br /><br />Beware, this novel is a tearjerker. Even in unassuming times I felt tears welling up just thinking about the little things. We never realize how our decisions can affect others so much. We too often find it easier to forgive others than ourselves, we find ourselves blaming others for the inevitable. This is a superbly written novels full of realizations and beautiful prose. I would recommend this novels for older crowds and the old of souls (like myself) because it speaks to human nature.<br /><br />Although I speak of its beauty and hope, this novel is not just a big feel goodery. What truly struck me about it was how well the author covered the true emotions that a man might feel. Periods of hope, of happiness are proceeded by feelings of dejection and loss. Harold both knows that he will make it and realizes that it's near impossible. Not every character that Harold meets is savory, nor do they all believe that he can make it but in the end we discover that the real importance of this trip was partly the destination but more about the journey and the ability to say goodbye.and the old of souls (like myself) because it speaks to human nature.<br /><br />Although I speak of its beauty and hope, this novel is not just a big feel goodery.

B007SGM084|1.0|Just a few words:<br /><br />It seems like anyone can write a best seller now !<br />You don´t have to have any writing skills, an imagination or to be creative; all you need is to take advantage of a decadent society.<br /><br />This book does not deserve another word from me.

B000I0QM0E|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Fans of Tim Burton can do a lot worse than watch this film.<br /><br />Johnny Depp puts on one of his amusingly patented, cowardly heroic performances, as Ichabod Crane, the skinny pale weirdo detective from NYC, solving the headless horsemen case. As isolated dreary Sleepy Hollow, the town that surrounds him, is as strange & secretive as Ichabod & the Headless Horseman himself.<br /><br />Good to great performances abound, as one after the other important townsmen gets their heads lopped off in high fashion. Christopher Walken puts in one of his patented weirdo performances as the Headless Horseman! Short, sweet, & vicious! God love him!<br /><br />The script is fine for the chewing. The direction, darkly, bleakly, comedic, as the gorgeous dark cinematography graces your eyes glowing from the screen. A rich tapestry of dark hues & shades, contrasted by vividly bright hues, all in the right places, enhancing the viewing experience.<br /><br />A great film for Halloween, or any dreary grey day or stormy night. \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" will charm you, thrill you, & make you laugh!<br /><br />Heads up!
0765316994|4.0|This one was a hard one for me to place, I am a total fanboy of Scalzi, having read and reviewed everything he has written to date in terms of books. I was so looking forward to Red Shirts, and was thinking this would be wittier like The Androids Dream or Agent to the Stars. Unfortunately this book felt rushed, felt like he was behind a deadline and needed to crank something out. I really could have lived without the codas, and at one point in coda two I simply skipped the rest of it and went right on to coda three. I would recommend buying the book, but it is not up to Scalzi standards that he set in Old Mans War or his other books. It is worth reading, but this one is not up to his standard as a writer, you might end up being disappointed because this book could have been so much more than it ended up being. You can't rush a writer, and this one felt so rushed that things you were reading started to fall flat. There are some absolutely brilliant moments in the book, and that is what makes it worth reading, but you will read it once, and then move on back to Androids Dream or Old Mans War. This is a good try, but a try all the same, this really could have been so much more if he had really taken the time to write this one out and make the story his.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|The CD brought back all of the fun times in the movie. Clear recordings and I love how the songs are like in the movie meaning some of the songs put together as performed. Even Tom Cruise was great as Stacee! People criticized the singing of these songs other places but remember these are not the original singers BUT they do an excellent job with this music. I have only bought 2 other movie soundtracks in my 40 years because I never really wanted to listen to someone's cover songs. I could not wait to buy this on on CD and get it in the mail! Personally I prefer the CD formats over mp3's. Btw, as soon as the DVD comes out I'm buying it - directors cut if possible!!!! I love the way Stacee counts down from 5 in the movie before he sings \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" if you saw the movie you know what I mean...if not check it out!!
B0076NKNLA|3.0|Worth watching, but I agree with some others that the Monroe impersonation only works intermittently. There are some moments when the Marilyn mask becomes secondary to the performance and a vulnerable but winsome woman comes through. Interesting to see Olivier/Branagh reacting wide-eyed and in wonder at the film rushes, the script having him TELL us how luminous Monroe is on screen. Yes, Monroe was, but the Monroe/Williams in the rushes is much less so, excepting perhaps the little dance scene, which notably lacks a close-up. Otherwise decidedly not luminous.<br /><br />I recommend to anyone with an interest in the theme that they see the far superior  Me & Orson Welles, directed by Richard Linklater. As in \\"Marilyn,\\" callow youth runs away to the \\"circus,\\" as Olivier/Branagh puts it (in this case the theater), meets a great star (the central performance by Christian McKay is brilliant), gets chewed up by the encounter, but receives a valuable lesson in adulthood. The Monroe film, while fun, is a much lesser achievement.
1435122968|4.0|Most of my favorite stories are in this collection - such as At The Mountains Of Madness, The Call Of Cthulhu, The Music Of Erich Zann, The Colour Out Of Space, and The Shadow Over Innsouth.  Others, that I have never heard of, also grace its pages and made it worth grabbing up.<br />Its nice to have, in one's hands, a good old fashion book to read at night, as the storm outside rages, and the darkness fights to get inside.<br />The only problem with that is this is not a bus or airplane book - because it is such an old fashion hardcover book.  If you enjoyed this book may I suggest [[ASIN:156882176X Mysteries of the Worm: Early Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos (Call of Cthulhu Fiction)]]?

B007SGM084|3.0|Although these books fit the bill of an easy and entertaining summer/vacation read, I was not overly impressed with the writing or repetitive content.  There wasn't much in the way of a story line or thought provoking material but the sex scenes were steamy.  I had trouble with the fact that Ana, the main character, was able to climax during every seductive scene and was often ready to do this by simply looking at Christian.  Not very realistic for the average woman!

B0050PYNN0|1.0|I've got a funny feeling that this was written by a dirty minded ten year old.  Because the swearing and nudity in it comes across as somthing a ten year old would do to come across as  tough and cool.  I've got nothing against swearing and nudity in movies but it should be clever and add to the story, and this doesn't.  Just lame and stupid.  The only positive thing I can say for this movie is the fact that I watched this for free, because I'd hate to have payed for it, it's that bad

B006TF6WAM|5.0|A book has to be good to keep my attention these days and this one did to the very end.  I could recognise reality in so many of the characters and was moved to tears more than once.  I did not find a single mistake in logic, grammar, punctuation or factual details and I enjoyed following Harold's journey on Google maps.  Here is an author who knows what she is writing about although I think she has played down how difficult, dangerous and unpleasant it can be walking along England's main roads!  Readers of this book might also enjoy a newly released ebook, \\"Compline\\" [[ASIN:B008W51KMC Compline]]

B006LSZECO|1.0|A fun concept gone terribly wrong. Not a prude in any way but really what was point of the so much super crude language. It didn't fit the character and was distracting. But this author must have had a deadline. THe ending didn't exist...she apparently just stopped typing. Where was the editor?

030758836X|1.0|I am not a violent person, although I like crime lit--but this one was beyond the beyond. Obviously goody-two-shoes make boring characters, but these two were such disgusting skeevies you wanted to bang their heads together. The plot, if that is what it was, was so overly done it was laughable. You know those hapless catfish? I would club these people instead of them.

B0080R7P8A|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Can and was looking forward to this.  When they had dipped into archives previously (\\"Delay 1968\\", \\"Unlimited Edition\\") some real gems surfaced.  I don't hear any here though.<br /><br />What really made Can special was rhythmic innovation.  The rhythms on here have all been heard before.  There's not very much special going on here.<br /><br />For committed fans, this will be interesting.  And especially if you are interested in Can's musique concrete roots and side.  When Mooney was in the band, they were doing the same type of Stockhausen-influenced stuff that later resulted in \\"Augmn\\" and \\"Peking O\\" and \\"Soup\\"; they just didn't release any of it until now.  I thought that \\"Blind Mirror Surf\\" was maybe the most interesting of the tracks on here.<br /><br />I don't personally like their musique concrete very much, and I find this collection very thin.  \\"Graublau\\" is a long jam worth hearing because Schmidt works some nice brutal playing into it; the pieces with Mooney singing are similar to ones released already, but worth hearing; \\"Millionspiel\\" is an decent early jam on a Velvet Underground riff, \\"Messers, Scissors, Fork and Light\\" is \\"Spoon\\" taking shape and is pretty listenable.  \\"Dead Piegeon Suite\\" is too, it's \\"Vitamin C\\" with the band's James Brown influence more obvious than usual.  The live tracks are eccentric choices, mostly low-fidelity and not very special.  Overall this meanders tremendously and I wouldn't recommend purchase unless you're already familiar with the context, the rather great body of work this band released to include \\"Monster Movie\\", \\"Tago Mago\\", \\"Ege Bamysai\\", and \\"Soon Over Babaluma\\".
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I retract my 5 Star review of this game because Ice Age Village lead me to think I would get some kind of bonus for the 5 Star review, early in the game, which I didn't. This really is a fun game, until you find out that MOST of the quests, and the \\"good items\\" require you to spend LOTS of real cash for very little more playing time. I've been sucked out of about $12 already believing that I'd be able to play much longer, which didn't happen. Those credits were eaten up before I finished the level I was working on. Although this game is more for kids rather than adults, this 55 year old found it kinda fun. The graphics and animations are stunning. I would have gladly paid $25.00 or more for a version of the game that allowed me to play without so many \\"pay before play\\" restrictions. Because everything in the game is so expensive in game credits, without paying big bucks in real money for those game credits, the fun is short lived. I mean $99.00 for enough coins or acorns to play another day, maybe two? Really? I fully understand and appreciate the free game concept, and then the company makes money on in-game purchases, but in this game... Get real Gameloft!!! I certainly won't be paying any more.<br /><br />Another very annoying thing in the game play itself, is that every time you touch the screen outside of your purchased playing area, a screen pops up asking if you want to buy that area of land. This happens almost constantly, because of having to touch so many areas of the screen to collect coins, and move the screen around. A far better game design would have been to place the \\"purchase more land\\" option in the menu area, so you would simply just to go there to buy land, rather than having the pop-up screens drive you crazy.<br /><br />I have played The Oregon Trail: American Settlers (FREE Kindle Fire Edition), also by Gameloft, and I'm on level 78 and having a great time playing. I haven't spent a penny, but again, I would have gladly paid for the \\"unlocked\\" game itself because it has a much better balance of what you can do for free, items cost less in game credits, and it's not as much of a money sponge, even if you decided to buy the extras, it's reasonable. Consider that game as a very good alternative to Ice Age Village.game itself because it has a much better balance of what you can do for free, items cost less in game credits, and it's not as much of a money sponge, even if you decided to buy the extras, it's reasonable.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|If you are going to start this book, make sure there's nothing else going on in your life because this book will consume you. Once I started it, the house went to hell, the laundry piled up, and nothing got done until I finished it. I will definately read more by this author.
0307346617|1.0|Robopocolypse at least had \\"Lurker\\", \\"Z\\" doesn't even have a single character in it. What's more the accounts are filled with F-bombs, in other words, the author has a very poor vocabulary.  He also regularly makes his politics incredibly clear in a crass and unintelligent way: no doubt, he believes that people who disagree with him are all racist and/or greedy.<br /><br />Brooks does not have the proper skill to achieve suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Waving aside all the lessons of biology, we are still asked to accept countless stupidities, the most personally offensive of which is Brooks evidently low opinion of man, in general, but especially of man's adaptability and self-initiative.  What couldn't the population of one city, one college, or even one family do just with the scrounged bricks from area retaining walls, let alone with all the supplies available say at the Home Depot?  Man is the most dangerous game.  He has killed off countless, enormous, frightening animals with little more than rocks and sticks. Yet, unbelievingly, Brooks has whole armies which were purposefully deployed being overrun.  (during WWI, armed men could barely move entrenched men!)<br /><br />One of the excuses, he gives is that they ran out of ammunition.  Well, normal military vehicles would make excellent killing machines even without modifications but any hobby welder could seriously improve on them in about ten minutes time.  A normal combat knife would be pretty effective in hand to mouth combat against man who is so glass-jawed that he has to cook all his meat. Heck, the Spartans would not have been overrun.  And if we don't have their armor, as another reviewer said, we have jeans or winter coats.  Even Southerners could do a little sewing with their extra pairs of jeans for upper-body protection.<br /><br />Annoyingly, there are also countless scenes of individual stupidy.  Muslim countries, including Iran, start lobbing nuclear missiles at each other, but none at Israel :}.  The authorities in different countries try to cover up the zombie outbreak.  A guy reaches to pull the arm of a cave-in victim in an area he knows is zombie infested. Etc., etc., etc., ad nauseam.  And if these types of incidents are sometimes forgivable in movies, they seem much more contrived when it comes to the written word.<br /><br />But worst of all, since there are no characters, there is no plot.  All we have is incidents and some names, but often times not even names.  This is not just because of the style of the book, it is directly relatable to Brooks's lack of skill.  Authors like RLS, Wilkie Collins, Bram Stoker were doing different perspectives well over a hundred years ago and their novels actually had plots and characters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that there is a variety of games that my kids and I can play to have fun and pass time. I just wish there was more games available, I passed all the games and am waiting to buy more with all the points I have gathered replaying the ones I have! Great fun for everyone thou:)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game and I'm totally obsessed. I play a lot and really love it I hope this game gets even better through updates
0345522303|4.0|Started out a little slowly, and I put the book down to read 2 others before coming back to this one, then I couldn't put it down.  It's a different pace from the previous books in the series, more of a mystery in a fantasy setting with familiar characters than a development of the world itself, but I love mysteries, so I thoroughly enjoyed this volume.  I don't mind being told who the villain is from the outset, though some may not like that.  I like the return of Micum, one of my favorite characters, even if in an understandably small role.  Towards the end the tension was ratcheted up nicely, and I think she leaves an opening for a new direction to take the next book if she chooses.  I've enjoyed this series very much and look forward to more.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This is a very nice little puzzle game that I used to play when I was Younger. In my opinion its more fun then a lot of these other so called puzzle games that just are not interesting.

0385335997|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />The book starts with Claire, who's been living in her own time the past twenty years. In the last book she met a historian who found out that Jamie didn't die at Culloden. She's been planning on going back for the last 5 months. Her appearance in the past tooks Jamie totally by surprise and while they learn to know each other again after twenty years apart, they have to save Jamies's nephew (Young) Ian.<br /><br />I have to say that I love these books! The book really started to come alive after Claire finds Jamie. I liked how they were showed learning to know each other again. No wonder you'd be a little akward when you haven't seen each other in such a long time and so much has happened to them. I was getting kinda annoyed at Jenny though, why did you had to meddle in Jamie's things?And by that I mean getting Jamie married to Laoghaire!  That was the only problem I had with the book... I so wish we hear more of Fergus in the future. Poor man had a very interesting wedding... Most hilarious thing in the book :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games included in this app are rather juvenile, and may be more suited for children, adults will probably not be much interested.

0060557818|5.0|I don't know why I have never read any of Neil Gaiman's books before now, but I feel like I just discovered a new author that I adore and treasure. So, yes Neverwhere was my first Gaiman novel and I find it quite funny because it feels like a right of passage, that is to say, what was your first Gaiman novel?<br /> I fell in love with the London Underground world that Gaiman created and all the kooky characters that \\"fell through the cracks\\". A story of a man going through the motions in life, unwittingly gets thrown into a world of danger and adventure and all he wants is to go back to his simple life. By the end of this story, you see Richard grow as a character and he realizes that once he got what he wanted, it wasn't what he wanted at all after all.<br />There are some great moments in this novel but I feel like one of the most telling moments for me was when Richard attempts to return to London Above and finds out his quite literally been erased. I don't think I'll ever look at the subway again, and perhaps I'll smile and remember Richard and his motley crew while I wait for the train..<br />I just recently purchased a few more of Neil Gaiman's novels and I really can't wait to see what he has I store for me next!
B004T6A3SK|4.0|Jamie and Claire lives now in America They have some lands in the middle of wilderness and they're ready to settle to \\"normal\\" married life. The local Indians are relatively peaceful and Jamie's nephew Ian becomes good friend with them.<br /><br />In the 20th century Brianna is trying to find what happens to his parents. She's also coming closer to Roger Wakefield, who helped Claire to trace Jamie. When Brianna finds old newspaper article about her parents she decides to go through the stones without telling Roger. When Roger finds out she has left, he's determined to find her.<br /><br />Yet another godd book by Gabaldon! I enjoyed it but still thought it to be the weakest book in the serie so far. But that doesn't mean it was bad! I just found Roger so utterly boring. And there were too many pages from his point of view. He seemed more interesting in the future time.<br /><br />I liked to see how Brianna and Jamie got to know each other and their relationship grow. AndI liked how well she get along with John Grey. But I didn't understand how John could be so uninterested about his wife's death.<br /><br />The one thing I could have lived without was Brianna getting raped. I just didn't see the point of it...
B008EQIA7W|1.0|Can't believe I spent my hard earned money on this movie...I wish I could see the manager and ask for my money back!!!  Only saving grace is  the popcorn and soda I had watching it didn't cost me $20.  Spend your money on the Dollar Menu at your local fast food joint...it will be a much better buy!

0525457585|5.0|The Neverending Story was always a beloved movie for me as a child, I loved the land of Fantasia and Falkor, Atreyu and of course Bastian. Yes, the book is wholly different from the movie. I would say that the book would equal the first and second movies as far as storyline goes, and yet, they still are drastically different and on a whole the book is a lot darker. The movie still remains a favorite for me, and I love the book, neither one ruined the other for me, I just love both in different ways.<br /><br />From the childhood memories, the story progresses as a young boy, who doesn't seem to fit in, discovers a mystical world inside a magical book and all Bastians various adventures unfold. As an adult I see this novel as a story of what happens when we lie to ourselves and how those lies can change us and those around us. We can see this in the conversation that Gmorg has with Atreyu as the nothing circles them. I can also see the underlining moral of 'be who you are' and 'love yourself' inside this book as well. After all the wishes Bastians makes to be something grand and strong, fearless, handsome and brave, he realizes he just wants to be loved for who he is, faults and all. It is only until Bastian realizes these things that he can return to his world but he had to take a dark path to come to that realization.<br /><br />The Neverending Story means many things to many people, and this classic will always have a place in my heart.
B003U9NAD2|5.0|Regardless of your music tastes, give this a shot. Listen to it all the way through, loud, with good headphones or speakers, and with no interruptions or distractions. It's an odyssey. It's beautiful. It's haunting. It's easily one of my top 20 favorite albums of all time (if not top 10/5/3). If you're already into metal, then you're most likely going to love this. Contrary to what another reviewer said, I loved this album despite my inexperience with black metal -- I think all that is required is an open mind.<br /><br /> Every song on here is gold, but my favorite is the third, \\"Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen,\\" which translates in English to \\"Into the Castle From the Dream.\\" The first half of the song is pure chaos and energy, which fades away, slowly building back up to and coalescing into a fantastic guitar riff. The blast-beat drums kick in and carry the riff until synths join in, all over a subtle tremolo picking. Varg lets out a final scream and all the energy is unleashed once more in full force during the outro. Breathtaking. The transition from all the energy of the previous two songs to the desolate 15-minute ambient track, \\"Tomhet,\\" is devastating. It drips with melancholy. One certainly gets the sense of being lost in a forest, desperately and resentfully trying to avoid the gaze and light of God through the trees (hence the album title and the title of the second song, \\"If the Light Takes Us.\\")<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to spoil it or bore you with my assessment. I'd consider this a must-have for any black metal/metal-in-general fan... or for anyone with varied and open-minded music preferences.<br /><br />Disclaimer for the wary: yes, Varg Vikernes, the man behind Burzum, is a sketchy character, but luckily he has the sense to keep his politics mostly out of his music. You can find translations all his lyrics on his website or anywhere else on the web -- they're actually pretty great on this record. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss can definitely be appreciated regardless of one's level of respect for the man who created it.
0321334876|5.0|Very easy to follow and thorough. Colors and formatting make it an enjoyable experience and the content couldn't be better for such a small book. One of the first book you should buy once you've learned the syntax and played around a little with C++. A little outdated though, C++11 is out and TR1 doesn't mean a lot nowadays. Still, it's an entry-level book designed to help beginners doing things right, everyone will learn from it and it's still a very good refresher and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />One of the best programming-related book I've ever read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am totally loving this game. friend had it on ipod and I.was always stealing it and playing this game. just me or does the kindle version seem slower? anyway... get this game! its free anyway and awesome:)
B006L4MWVE|1.0|do not buy this movie-a piece of sh..!!B rated at best! Promises a cult classic, but is so wrong in many ways!
0060558121|5.0|There were so many moments while I was reading this book that I sat back and thought, Damn this book is good! I have loved so many books but I have to say that American Gods by Neil Gaiman is definitely at the top of that list. I have since told many of my friends to read this book, that it is epic and if they ever read one book in their lives, it should be this one.<br />  Essentially, American Gods is about the old Gods that immigrants from Europe, Asia and other foreign countries brought with them to America. As America matures the old Gods soon become forgotten and misplaced as the new Gods of technology take over. We follow Shadow, a beaten down man just released from prison, as he finds himself in the middle of this war between old and new.<br />  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that I love the little town of Lakeside with it's perception of perfection. Lakeside is a Norman Rockwell painting on the outside. I loved a lot of characters and side plots, Laura, Ibis and Jacquel, but I do have to say that the plot line with this little perfect town of Lakeside was my favorite.<br />  American Gods is my second Gaiman novel, Neverwhere being the first (which I also loved) and now that I fell in love with American Gods, I think I'll just have to go ahead and read everything this man wrote! Great job on this one!

0451450523|5.0|Such an achingly beautiful classic story that broke my heart. I loved the novel so much, I could feel the unicorns paid and confusion. It is no wonder that this fairy tail has been so popular for so long, it's a heartfelt story that will stick with you long after you are done reading.

I totally forgot Chuck Norris was in it!  Great!  They were throwing in lines or references to other movies some of the actors had been in...funny stuff!  I think these guys probably all really enjoyed working with each other, too.  My only disappointment was that Jet Li wasn't in the movie as much as the last.  Other than that.... YA GOTTA SEE IT!!!!  May I suggest if there is a next one that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is in it!  I think he'd fit right in!<br />P.S.  Jason Statham, too!

B007HO392S|2.0|Carrie Underwood is at the stage now where country music isn't big enough for her. Faith Hill had the same problem after huge hits with her Faith and Breathe albums in the late 90s. She turned into Celine Dion for her 2002 Cry CD which totally omitted country music. And look what happened to Faith Hill!<br /><br />That said, perhaps Hill had a point when she was caught pulling faces on camera as Underwood won an award a few years ago. Underwood isn't a very good singer. She has a harsh, shrill voice that she overuses constantly. It becomes quite wearing throughout this overwraught album.<br /><br />Blown Away is longer and louder than any of her other CDs and sadly, doesn't have anywhere near enough good songs to make it worth the effort. At least 5 of these 'tunes' should've been scrapped. Tiresome heard-it-all-before ballads like the dreadful Thank God For Hometowns (thank God for the skip button..), Forever Changed and Good In Goodbye. Dull crossover (to oblivion) numbers like One Way Ticket and Leave Love Alone don't help either because despite all the bluster and Underwood's ceasleless screaming, the songs just aren't memorable.. Even a formidable writer like RJ Lange lets her down. Sure, you can imagine his ex-wife Shania Twain singing Who Are You (better), but it's a terrible song and should have been jettisoned from the album.<br /><br />The album would make a good EP as the first 3 songs are all excellent. Lead single Good Girl provides country pop fun that doesn't appear anywhere else on the CD. The title track is nicely dramatic and Underwood's honking voice is actually a plus point here. Two Black Cadillacs is quietly effective as well. Not great out of 14 songs, though...<br /><br />The sleeve artwork is also off transforming the girl next door-esque singer into a stunning (unrecognisable) movie star beauty. Blown Away is a big fail as an album and I'll be willing to bet that less radio hits come from this set than any of her other albums.

0385742886|3.0|I was really looking forward to this prequel to the Maze Runner trilogy because I thoroughly enjoyed those books. (Team Minho FTW) However, this wasn't what I was expecting. There's a prologue and epilogue that focus on the characters of the Glade but other than that, this is a completely different story with new characters.<br /><br />It's still interesting and action packed with characters as intense as the ones we've come to know but for fans looking for more information on Thomas, Teresa, or Brenda, they might be disappointed. I was hoping for more background on the Gladers themselves.<br /><br />For those readers who are just beginning the series, I would say to this is a good place to start.

He's an extremist economist of the real-world but an expert by the academic.

You'd be better off reading Debunking Economics by Dr Steve Keen an Australian.

B00866JL96|3.0|I normally would never watch a film where the ending was so obvious from the trailers and plotline alone, you didn't even have to watch it.  But I AM a Zac Efron fan, and my sister raved about this one enough ... I just finished watching it.<br /><br />The film itself is totally predictable, down to the \\"put a child in jeopardy to elicit sympathy\\" end conflict and the uber-obvious ending.  Zac Efron, who has grown SO much as an actor, regressed a bit here, his Logan bland and one-dimensional - virtually a clone, in tone and personality, to his Charlie St. Cloud character in the film of the same name.<br /><br />I don't write many reviews, and this so-so film is only the exception because of the Amazon reviewer who posted for this film, Kathleen C. Fennessy - who really should actually pay attention to the films she supposedly watches more.  She talks about how Efron's Logan character \\"sets out for North Carolina (it's never clear how he figures that out as a destination)\\", when in actuality the character sets out for Louisiana, and DOES SO because he tracks down the lighthouse in the background of Beth's photo, heading directly to where it's located.<br /><br />THAT was plain annoying; even I was barely emotionally invested in the film by that point, but paid enough attention to know this plot point.  If you're going to do the snack or bathroom break, Ms. Fennessy, please PAUSE the film; don't let it run so that you miss stuff!<br /><br />That said, 'The Lucky One' is very typical of its genre, and should please many who love that genre.  Not bad, not great; just sort of ... there.  Zac, you HAVE the talent, please choose better roles!  =0)

0793542049|2.0|The book is a little misleading. I completed Hal Leonard's Bass Method Book 1 some time ago and needed to move on to something new after finding that Hal Leonard's Bass Method Book 2 was not as well written and does a poor job explaining things. The exercises in Book 1 are not very easy, while book 2 leaves me dazed and confused. Since I can read music and play all the scales on the circle of fifths, I figured my music theory was sound enough to maybe give this one a try. Couldn't hurt seeing how everything else I've found has left me frustrated. I thought maybe I was ready, so I gave it a try. Unfortunately, I was not. It starts out simple enough and then jumps to a much more advanced level. My search for a book to get me to the next level of playing continues. It seems that after teaching you how to read music, where the notes are, etc. in the beginner books, no one can simplify the process of learning arpeggios, etc.  Reading reviews on the web, it seems I'm not the only one having this problem. My journey to being a good bass player is extremely frustrating. I never had this type of problem learning trombone, clarinet or guitar. Yet bass, which everyone swears is supposed to be easier, is turning out to be far more difficult. It's definitely been far more frustrating.

B008W14ZD2|4.0|Let me first say that I may well be one of Owl City's oldest fans. My youngest son turned me on to Owl City a year and a half ago. At that time, I had pretty much given up on any new music being any good. Since then, I have expanded to other groups such as Reliant K, Lights, Breanne Duren and HeIsWe. I have gotten everything Owl City has put out, including the down-load only stuff, and Sky Sailing and Port Blue.<br /><br />I would prefer to have given this album a 4 1/2 star rating. I consider Ocean Eyes Deluxe Edition 5 star, Of June and Maybe I'm Dreaming 4 star, and All Things Bright and Beautiful 4 1/2 star.<br /><br />\\"Dreams and Disasters\\" starts the album out with a bang.<br />\\"Good Time\\" make me want to jump up and dance.<br />\\"Silhouette\\" revisits \\"Vanilla Twilight\\" and \\"Lonely Lullaby\\" themes, but, after all, music is a window into the soul, and obviously Adam Young has some deep feelings.<br />The rest is all good and enjoyable! Lots of good puns in the lyrics, an Owl City standard!<br /><br />I do like the more extensive collaborations in this album, particularly Matt Thiessen of Reliant K. I did miss Bree Duren's back-up vocals, however.<br /><br />All in all, I think this a very good album. It shows that Adam is still quite inspired, and that his talent is maturing. I look forward to more of his work in the future, and hope that he never looses his inspiration.
1897299214|5.0|A new admirer of Tom Delisle's work, I am an eager traveller to whichever destination he choses to visit. This work however was particularly interesting as it was, I realised, the first time that I had had any contact with an account of life in North Korea. As always Delisle's political insight is interesting and informative. It is however the mixture of the mundane details of his personal experiences in Korea together with his political insights that make this book so appealing. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0465092764|4.0|Peter Woit introduces the reader to the world that produced string theory and its variants (Superstring theory, M theory, etc.).  The author provides a readable review of the history and practice of particle physics, from the increasingly massive particle accelerators (including CERN's present Large Hadron Collider), to the theories invented to understand the outcome of these ambitious experiments.  He traces the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, along with QTF's successful manifestation known as the Standard Model of particle physics.  He rejoices in the many successes and brilliant insights offered by such luminaries as Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Dirac, Bethe, Schwinger, Feynman, Tomonaga, Gell-Mann, Glashow, Higgs, and Weinberg.  At the same time he laments the U.S. government decision to curtail the funding of the Superconducting Supercollider in Texas in the 1990's.<br /><br />The successes of quantum field theory in high-energy particle physics are seen to have led to a certain degree of hubris.  Other fields of physics were held in disdain, as manifested by Gell-Mann's jibe at solid state physics as \\"squalid\\" state physics.  I remember beginning the graduate level quantum mechanics sequence in the Fall of 1974, and the excitement of the high-energy theorist teaching that course in wake of the discovery of the J/Psi particle that November.  I was one of the many students confused by his dropping of c's and h-bars in his spiraling blackboard presentations!  He also held solid state physics in contempt--and at a university that was one of the world's centers for that field.  Woit indicates that it was the hubristic enthusiasm of particle theorists, seduced by the genius of Ed Witten, that culminated in the growth of string theory--resulting in the increasingly large number of faculty members who owed their positions (and what Woit regards as their essentially make-work research projects) to its existence--as it waxed largely unconstrained by the influence of experimental observations.<br /><br />Woit, as a physicist who jumped from what he regarded as the sinking ship of string-theory-infested particle physics into the unsullied realm of mathematics, has many interesting observations concerning the differences between these two disciplines.  He recounts many an amusing story, including an answer given by the cryptic Paul Dirac, in reply to a question regarding the one person whose ideas were too abstract for even him to understand--those of the mathematician who did so much to bring initially underappreciated group theoretical concepts to modern physics: Hermann Weyl!by the influence of experimental observations.<br /><br />Woit, as a physicist who jumped from what he regarded as the sinking ship of string-theory-infested particle physics into the unsullied realm of mathematics, has many interesting observations concerning the differences between these two disciplines.

Beautiful.<br /><br />Two guys who each have their own problems and burdens do life together in a way that kicks \\"the normal human tendency:  isolation and self-centeredness\\" in the face.<br /><br />There are many good truths in this movie.<br /><br />There is some language (henceforth it's rated \\"R\\"), but the overall story as a whole, the acting, the reality of life, love sacrificially given, and the ending makes for a beautiful movie.  :)

145162607X|2.0|Nothing in the way of Ricardian fiction gets published that I don't read and though I'm not a huge Phillipa Gregory fan, I had to read this simply because it involved Richard, whose life is my passion.<br /><br />I had to put this book down about 3/4 through. I could not take another overwrought paragraph describing something that had been detailed only pages before. Too many adjectives, too much repetition, too much hand-wringing. It's been done before, to much greater effect, by Sharon Kay Penman, Sandra Worth and Anne O'Brian.<br /><br />The two stars are for attempting the subject, because it's a grueling one and a writer can lose her way with the plot twists not only between the warring Plantagenets, but within the houses of York and Lancaster, as well. Ms. Gregory tackled this well. I myself failed miserably in this regard, so \\"yay!!\\" for focus. Otherwise, not much to recommend it.
4883191028|5.0|This book is great, but we have to understand that the student must know the hiragana and katakana before starting studying this book, and probably know some basic japanese.

B008602KQI|5.0|When I read The Hunger Games, I wondered if there would be a movie. The movie represents the spirit and intent of the novel right down to the claustrophobic hand-camera shooting style. You can taste the terror of young Katniss. The tension between each character interaction is palpable. A fantastic movie of life and death, love and survival, self determinism and blind allegiance! If you haven't read the books, you will still enjoy every deliciously layered plot twist.
0307341577|3.0|I have the feeling that if I had bought the paperback I would have put it down 100 times and it would have taken me 2 years to finish this book. The plot is solid, the characters interesting but the pace of the book is slow, kind of like Mystic River. The writer tends to give too many details about the surroundings and simple events become to worthy. You don't have to tell me that you put your hand on the door knob, twisted the knob, pull the door and walk through the door frame, just tell me that you walked into the room. You could have cut 20% of this book and it would have been a better read. But with the headphones on at the beach it was a good 'read', if I had read it I would have fallen asleep.

I'm surprised that I really care about both of these characters--so far removed from me in values, age and life style. But, these books have captured my heart. The heroine is a modern girl with her own ideas, feelings and philosophy. She has lots to teach--and a lot to learn. I tell my husband about the scenes, and we sometimes re-enact our own version. AHH! Pretty exciting for the 60+ set!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the first app I put on my kindle fire and it is awesome. I never even knew that they had apps like this. The people who created it should be proud. Good job! it is cool I get to try it for free.
030758836X|1.0|The first part of the book is a slow read about the usual \\"cheating husband suspected of killing his wife\\" story. I could not like either character - thinking she deserved to be killed or he deserved to be left.  The second part brought some life to the story and it was intriguing to learn all the planning she did to frame her husband and cause problems for her other victims.  She is certainly a psycopath, yet she is believed to be innocent of the real murder.  It was unbelievable that the book ended with the husband moving back in, knowing she was quilty, and the reader is expected to think they will live happily ever after. I am amazed this book remains for the 3rd week #1 on the best seller list. I also do not like this style where one chapter is about one character and the next is written about the other.

B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke came out near the beginning of my adolescence and was the first Hayao Miyazaki movie I ever saw: It dramatically set the stage for my deep love of Miyazaki/Ghibli movies and Japanese animation in general. It goes without saying that I am now a complete convert and as a general rule I enjoy anime more than western movies/television (nothing can beat a good Paul Newman flick though). I'm not so good at intellectual reviews so I'll just go through a few main pros and points about this movie:<br /><br />*I am an outdoor girl. I've always loved wolves. I am intrigued by folklore and mythology from other cultures. I love fantasy. All of these things add to my love of this movie, and a dislike of them may detract from someone elses ability to like it quite as much. It is still a gem either way.<br /><br />*Like all Miyazaki movies, close attention must be paid if you are going to understand and detract all of the subplots and subtle storyline details. Miyazaki puts forth the stories he sees in his head without apologies and without watering them down. Bless him.<br /><br />*Hayao is clearly anti war and very disturbed by the defilement of nature. I won't discuss specifics here, but after watching all of his movies I can easily deduce at least a vague idea of his political ideals. I respect him but I do not agree with him %100. I enjoy this movie anyway for a couple of reasons: First, he does not devalue humans in this movie. For example Lady Eboshi is shown as cold, overzealous and sometimes cruel in her treatment of nature and the gods, but she is not doing it for power and money like the samurai. She does what she does for the people that depend on her. Eboshi is certainly an antagonist, but a very human one who is portrayed with apparent value and strengths. We are shown her generosity, her fearlessness, and her strength of will. Second, it is a fairy tale. Wolves are gods. Boars are gods. Monkeys are gods. Etc. If I lived in mythical Japan-from-the-past where wolves spoke and boars created clans, I would probably be a bad guy for trying to cut all of their throats too. Hayao is definitely making a point about humans and nature, but the fantasy and strength of characters make it a good movie regardless of differing man vs. nature opinions.<br /><br />*There is violence in this movie, but it is PG-13. The first time I saw it was with my Grandma and she did a lot of \\"ew\\"ing, so if you're an 8 year old or a sensitive granny you may want to stay away. (I am happy to report that my Grandma has since come to like this movie. Hurray!)<br /><br />*The US dub is OK. Not great. I recommend watching the original Japanese version with subtitles.<br /><br />*The animation is fantastic: Enchanting, vibrant, detailed, FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I can not recommend this enough - or any Ghibli film period. Love, love, love!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Thought I would buy this book as there was so much hype over it...was a good easy and lazy read, although I fail to see what the fuss is about?!  Literature was poor and very repetitive...it felt as though I was reading something written by a teenager and if I read any more about Anna biting her lip I think I will be sick. Despite this it was an average over rated book which leaves very little to the imagination!

B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Umm, wow! Where do I even begin? I guess I should start by saying that I absolutely hate writing a negative review/comment. So much so that this is only one of a very few. I should also mention that I am a complete & total Nicholas Sparks-aholic. I LOVE his books, (my favorites are &#34;The Choice&#34;, &#34;Safe Haven&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;The Rescue&#34; and of course, &#34;The Notebook&#34;) but with that being said, I was extremely disappointed in this book. If you are anything like me: a person who adores a truly sappy love story (which Nicholas Sparks usually does so well) then you will be dissatisfied as well because it is definitely not the happy ending I was searching for.<br /><br />I will also say that I did really like Dawson & Amanda and thought it neat that Mr. Sparks set Dawson as living in Louisiana (my home state :D ). I also really appreciated the love that Dawson & Amanda shared together and the distinctive bonds they each shared with Tuck but that was about all there was that I liked. There was just too much disfunction with the other characters (Dawson's family). But I won't go into any other details/spoilers of the story because I don't want to give anything away to those who still want to read it despite all the reviews but my suggestion to all who have not yet read &#34;The Best Of Me&#34; : You really should consider skipping this one and just waiting for his next. The ending is not a happy one.<br /><br />I am ones of those readers who really, REALLY gets so involved in my reading that it's like I get that emotional attachment to the characters and start to relate to them and feel the same emotions; which is what I love most about Nicholas Sparks' writing, he's so good at it that he makes you feel what his characters feel especially the excitement with the happy endings. However, when I completed this book I felt sad; almost like a void as if something was missing and that's not an emotion that you want to feel after reading anovel.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|What do you get when you combine \\"The Running Man\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", and \\"Little Women\\"??  You get this!  Not terrible just a bit all over the place.  The shakey-cam handheld B.S. (SO overdone lately) was very distracting to me.  I should not feel so \\"aware\\" of the camera, it takes you out of the movie. It doesn't \\"add tension\\" so much at it adds motion sickness.  On the plus side, the audio and video quality were both excellent as were the costumes.  Fun movie but, unless you are a die hard fan of the story, probably more of a rental than a purchase.
B001T6B1CA|5.0|When you commit to reading this one, be prepared to cry. The first few times it happened--the American govt. negotiating a treaty, the Native Americans agreeing, and then the govt. breaking the treaty--I felt indignation. How could they do that! And then the cycle repeated over and over again. I felt sicker and sicker as I continued reading. A dull ache inside of me was what I was left with. This is a record of atrocities. An indigenous people being pushed out, nearly annihilated, and left to struggle in the wake of having their way of life forever altered.<br /><br />It made me think.<br /><br />The larger picture is that it still happens on Earth.<br /><br />Somewhere on a comment, I read an opinion that this should be required reading for every school kid. Yep. I agree.<br /><br />Classic example of needing to know our history, lest we repeat it.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|It was only a few weeks ago as I headed out the door to go birding that I passed a full-length mirror and realized I had become the stereotype you see so often in the background of this film: the extra who pops up with a camera from behind the cattails, the person who is entirely concealed by tall grass waiting for the flight of a rare warbler. If any hobbyist can be more clearly stereotyped than birders, they are unknown to me, and any film which can so clearly capture the essence of a stereotype without being offensive has got to be a winner. To the non-birder, I will say this: the movie is funny regardless. To the birder, I will add: be prepared to laugh at yourself at every turn. Now if you'll excuse me, I've heard that Empidonax traillii is making an appearance in my favorite nature area...

B003NRYJLS|5.0|The \\"Fly\\" episode was the best episode from seasons 1 - 3 and this is why. First, almost the entire episode is shot within a confined space, there are no outdoor scenes, no car chase scene, no comfortable respite like a dinner at the White's house that gives you an \\"ahhhh\\" moment after some violence and tension. This episode is ALL tension. This may seam boring to a casual viewer until one understands what the director was trying to accomplish. Second, long dialogs, and drawn out scenes build more tension. A trick Quentin Tarantino uses in allot of his films. The dialog is also brilliant as is the symbolism of the fly representing every stress factor in Walt's life (mentioned by another reviewer). Thirdly, this episode can STAND ALONE in a vacuum of all other episodes. This piece of work is hardly an episode...it is a SHORT FILM that can be watched by anyone who has never seen any of the other episodes.  The reference to Pinkmen's girlfriend is the only outside reference that a viewer need to know to fully appreciate the episode. Remove that and it is still a powerful moving short film.

The romance is but a piece to the whole puzzle. I cannot wait for the next book.<br />Keep it up Rebecca Hamilton!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I won't be going back to buy books 2 and 3.  Yes this book is pornographic, (and yes, I enjoy a good porn book/movie)  the key here is the word 'Good'.<br />I found 'shades' to be a very slow moving book.  The author may have a good idea of BDSM but needs to find a new way of writing it down.  This story was full of repetitive lines.  The poor woman in the story wouldn't have a lip left with the amount of times she bites it.  The gasps and heavy breathing as she looks into his eyes. Hmmmm.<br />I would recommend the book to anyone who doesn't mind a boringly written book but on an interesting topic.

B005LAIGW8|4.0|After watching this movie I consider it more of a reboot than a sequel, and if you watch it from that perspective then it turns out to be a pretty enjoyable movie! My only gripe is that in this movie Blaze can turn into the Ghost Rider in the light, yet at the very beginning of the movie he jumps back when the window is broken and the light is let in. I really like the look of the Ghost Rider in this movie, he doesn't look fake like in the first Ghost Rider, and watching his leather jacket bubble after turning into the Rider was pretty cool. Alot of people have been complaining about the bike, but to be truthful that really didn't distract me at all. So I say give it a chance and you just may be pleasantly surprised!

0142419400|5.0|I loved everything about Anna and the French Kiss. It was sweet yet serious and funny yet deep. The characters are what really made this book.<br /><br />Anna is witty and loves cinema, and St. Clair has great hair and is short. There are so many details and intricacies to everyone's personality that they feel so real. I would be BFF's with Anna in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Even though Anna and the French Kiss focuses on romance, there is a huge coming of age element mixed in. Anna (like the rest of her friends at school) got shipped off to Paris for her senior year. That's a huge adjustment, and not only does Anna have to cope with all new people, but she also has to cope with a whole new country and culture. It was awesome to see her development with those things throughout the novel.<br /><br />The setting of this book cannot be matched - Paris in the springtime (and other seasons too). Tr&egrave;s magnifique!<br /><br />To help you visualize Anna traipsing through France, tomorrow I'm going to post my pictures of France (I went there two years ago) along with Anna's comments on the places mentioned. Reading Anna and the French Kiss was like getting to relive my time there all over again.<br /><br />To answer the question in this section title (asked by dear Fred Savage in The Princess Bride): HECK YES! There is so much romantic tension in this book - almost too much for me. But, it was totally worth it.<br /><br />I was yelling things like, \\"SERIOUSLY?!\\" and \\"What now??\\" through the book, but I loved how Perkins wrapped everything up. Not everything is ideal (with other characters), but I liked that Perkins didn't make the ending \\"too perfect.\\"<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I don't read a ton of contemporary YA, so when I do I want the books to really wow me. I couldn't have asked for a better example of that in this novel. With its gorgeous setting, rich characters and coming of age story, Anna and the French Kiss is a perfect book to escape with.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|Ghost Rider is a pretty decent movie. With all the other reviews on here there is no need to go into detail about the plot. Cage does a nice job of playing Blaze. The \\"killings\\" were pretty cool, and the bike looked pretty cool. The cgi for the Rider isn't so good. Overall though it is a pretty decent movie and well worth a watch! If you plan on watching Ghost Rider along with Spirit of Vengeance, I can't really recommend that because, the story lines don't really go together. I see Spirit of Vengeance as more of a reboot than a sequel, but both are definitely worth a watch as long as you watch them as two separate movies!
0345803485|5.0|I picked up this book with very little expectation. Actually, I had prepared myself to hate it. I figured I'd read the first book in the triology to see what all the fuss was about, and that would be enough. Boy, was I wrong! As other reviewers have mentioned, the first few chapters are not that exciting, but once the relationship between Ana and Christian begins to develop, hold on tight!<br /><br />Christian is handsome, experienced, successful, powerful, controlling--and those qualities make him so appealing. Ana is young, naive, inexperienced (when it comes to the emotional and sexual aspects of relationships) and is drawn to Christian, due to all the qualities mentioned above, but also probably because she is in disbelief that he wants her. He has a troubled past, and Ana does not realize the extent to which he is damaged until she has already fallen for him, despite his early warnings to her to stay away from him (while at the same time actively pursuing her). As she learns more about him, Ana knows that he is not good for her, that he cannot be who she wants him to be, but they cannot stay away from each other. It is clear that Christian is also falling hard for her. These two characters are so drawn to each other; their sexual chemistry is electrifying and their love story is intoxicating. I found myself identifying with Ana on some levels and falling in love with Christian along the way. The most desirable pull for me is how Christian completely falls for Ana. His need to be with her compels him to revise his \\"rules\\" and relinquish control.<br /><br />Part of the hype over this book has to do with BDSM aspects, by which I was neither surprised nor offended. In fact, the BDSM provides an effective twist, with Christian as the dominant and Ana as the submissive. As their connection deepens, it becomes clear to the reader that Ana is in fact the one calling the shots, although she is too unsure of herself and unaware of her own power over Christian to use thisto her advantage. The reader is definitely left hanging at the end of this first book, eager to know what happens next with these characters and their tormented love affair. I am hooked! Looking foward to reading the other two books in the series.

144472729X|2.0|Transference it is called by Liberal Psychologists--at least when they aren't talking to their fellow Liberals--is defined as:  'the shift of emotions, especially those experienced in childhood, from one person or object to another'.  It is this act of transference that I feel is the real reason that Barak Obama now occupies the Oval Office, and his family the White House.<br />This feeling comes from my reading of the most recent Stephen King novel '11-22-63'.  A fevered dream espousing the Liberal Delusion that things would be so much better in the present if John F. Kennedy had not been killed in the past.<br />I should tell you now, that when Kennedy was assassinated  in Dallas on that tragic day in Dallas, TX. I was only three years old, and had been born into a family of lifelong  Southerners with a Yankee infiltrator who was my mother. It did not require a Moonie-type brainwashing to convert my mother into a Barry Goldwater Conservative, and when Alabama Governor George C. Wallace made his first bid for the Presidency she was on the front lines, even defying my father's strict no bumper stickers on the car edict by placing one on both the front and rear bumpers so that people coming and going would see that we were a Wallace Family.<br />Having said that, I will now continue with my analysis of why the Liberals turned out in such big numbers to support Obama.  Their delusional dream of what a complete eight year Kennedy Presidency (yes, in their dream Kennedy is always re-elected) would have meant for the Country.<br />No deepening involvement in Viet Nam; no double tap assassination of his brother Robert (who they imagine would not have run to replace his brother in the Oval Office in 1968) and the Marxist/Socialist Martin Luther King Jr.;  no Watts riots.  Their dream goes deeper than that, they actually have convinced themselves that the division between Whites and blacks would not exist.<br />All these alterations in the fabric of our Society simply because one man would have been permitted to serve out his elected term.<br />The reason this is a delusional dream is because the facts do nothing to support it.  It is true that had Kennedy lived to be re-elected the American Public would no doubt have felt they'd had enough of the Kennedy clan for awhile, and Bobby would not have run in 1968. As to the idea that Kennedy would not have strengthened America's resistance to Communism in the small southeast Asian land of Viet Nam?  The facts are real and unless you happen to be a delusional Liberal (Like Dr. Michael Savage, I am convinced that Liberalism is a Mental Disorder) had to dismiss, Kennedy was a Hawk.  A war hero who believed in America's Military Might and that America was Right to fight Communism. After all, he did say, \\"Pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend...to assure the survival and success of liberty...\\"  It is also utterly undeniable that as the youngest man ever yet elected to the Office of the President, Kennedy could not afford to show weakness. The truth is that it was Kennedy who sent 1,000 more 'Military Advisers' into the country at the start of his term, and that by the end of his life he had committed  12,000 advisers to South Vietnam. As well as sending more advisors to South Vietnam, Kennedy also sent 300 helicopters with US pilots.  Hardly a sign of ending American involvement.<br />As to the ideas of easing racial tension, well, that too does not stand up to scrutiny.  It is just as likely or more that he would have precipitated  a new Civil War.  His use of Federal troops to integrate the school in Little Rock, would doubtlessly have had to be repeated across the South.  Resentments would have flared, perhaps to the point of igniting the Second Civil War.<br />The facts show that the 1964 Voter's Right Law only passed after LBJ used the memory of Kennedy a a wedge issue.  The same can be said about the other major Democratic legislation that LBJ managed to enact.<br />So, it is clear that while it is a pleasant nostalgic trip into the past, Stephen King's '11-22-63' is flawed in far too many ways to be much more than that.  Preachy against everything from public smoking, growing American industry and international influence, and even the American diet of the day, it serves only to perpetuate the myth that is the Liberal Delusion.act.<br />So, it is clear that while it is a pleasant nostalgic trip into the past, Stephen King's '11-22-63' is flawed in far too many ways to be much more than that.

B000817YF0|5.0|It's never to late to buy this beautiful piece of art. Loving the hell out of it. And all the stuff you get inside the package. Simply amazing.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I was not surprised that it was THIS AWESOME! I loved the movie and I'm excited to see the next! I loved how Bruce Wayne became Batman and he did his part very well. Dr. Crane, who now he'd rather be called \\"Scarecrow\\", is the main villain, gives people drugs so that they see illusions of their fears. My only issue is, is that there always has to be some kind of inappropriate scene, but thankfully, it was just a short part. Aside from that, AWESOME MOVIE! I'd like to say that the movie itself is not really scary, it's just very intense and I'd advise children under the age of 13 should NOT watch this. If they can handle the violence, then by all means, it's up to the parents. :) Best movie of the year and I gotta say this again... A WOW movie! :D
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great for falling asleep to. don't know if the binaural beats really do anything but the rainfall puts me right to sleep.
