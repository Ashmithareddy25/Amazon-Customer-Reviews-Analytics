B000B5XOXY|5.0|Batman Forever holds a very special nostalgic place in my heart, so no matter how hard other Batman movies try they will never be able to replace that. Having said that, even though Batman Forever is my favorite, I still think Batman ('89) is the best.<br /><br />Now onto my review.<br /><br />It was the summer of 1995 and a brand new Batman movie was about to come out. No one knew exactly how this movie was going to be received. The previous movie (Batman Returns) was met with all kinds of disgust from children's parents who wrote letters to Warner Bros. stating that the movie was too dark and giving their children nightmares, etc. So, Warners was forced to 'lighten up' Batman for the next movie. To do so Warners decided to bring in a new director, Joel Schumacher. The original director of the first two Batman movies (Tim Burton) was made into a producer on Batman Forever. With Tim Burton not directing, Michael Keaton, who played Batman in the first two movies, decided not to return because he didn't like the direction the new movie was going for. Subsequently, Val Kilmer was cast to replace Keaton as Batman. Despite all of these changes Batman Forever was a smash hit! It was the second highest grossing movie of 1995, and it made more money than Batman Returns did, which is exactly what the studio was hoping for and didn't receive the hate mail that Batman Returns did. (For the record I also highly enjoyed Batman Returns.)<br /><br />I very highly enjoyed Val's take on the character of Batman. It was still dark but gave the character a sense of relatability. I also enjoyed his performance of Bruce Wayne. He seemed to enjoy being Bruce Wayne and a billionaire. In my opinion I think he also looked the most like how I think Bruce Wayne would look.<br /><br />Batman Forever needed to bring in a new villain as well. And they decided to bring in two, just like how they did in Batman Returns. They brought in veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones to play the part of Two-Face. A former district attorney who has half of his face disconfigured by acid which was thrown at him while he was in court. While some fans did not like Tommy's performance and found it to be a little too much like a mad-man (or even Joker-like) I highly enjoyed his performance and I also enjoyed the look of the character. It was very good before today's CGI infused look of the character from The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The Riddler was the second villain brought into Batman Forever and was played by one of my all-time favorite actors Jim Carrey. Jim's career was just beginning to explode at the time of Batman Forever's release. And, like Tommy's Two-Face, I was also very pleased with Jim's performance of The Riddler, which I know a lot of other fans supposedly were not. He was funny, looked great and I enjoyed his take on Edward Nygma as well.<br /><br />The most controversial part of the movie was bringing the character of Robin into the movie. And I thought they pulled this off absolutely perfectly!!! (Much better than the awful attempt made by Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight Rises who mutilated and destroyed the back story and character of Robin.) The character of Robin and Dick Grayson was played by Chris O'donnell and he really seemed to bring just the right amount of darkness and bad-boyness into his character. I also really enjoyed the part in the garage when he is with Bruce who he thinks he has nothing in common with until he sees Bruce's motorcycle collection and all of a sudden his entire perception of Bruce changes.<br /><br />And finally, the need for a new love interest for Batman is played by Nicole Kidman who is clearly the most beautiful female lead in any of the Batman movies. She plays Dr. Chase Meridian who has an obsession with Batman while she is Bruce Wayne's psychiatrist and Bruce Wayne is after her but she wants Batman.<br /><br />Batman Forever is a feast for the eyes with its techno inspired Gotham City, amazing special effects and stunts (for 1995) and filled with eye candy from the brand newly designed Batmobile, to the Batwing and Batboat. I understand that Batman Forever is not for everyone but when I have conversations with other Batman fans they all like to say that they enjoyed Batman Forever but they don't like to admit it freely. They are ashamed that they like some of  Schumacher's versions of Batman and Gotham City. So, if you can get past the nipples on the Batsuit, which everyone seems to bring up like its the biggest deal in the world (I really think people are overreacting like 1,000,000 times more than they should be about this), and just let yourself get taken up in the story of Batman Forever you will more than likely have yourself a very good time.<br /><br />I do have one very small gripe about the movie though and it would be that I would like to have the original opening sequence put into the film. The scene that shows that Two-Face has escaped from his cell at Arkham Asylum. It is a pretty dark scene that may have upset more parents but I thought it was really great. It was featured in the graphic novel adaptation of the movie, and as well as very briefly in the U2 music video for Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me. If you haven't seen this scene it is available in the deleted scenes on the two-disc special edition dvd and on the blu-ray edition of the film.<br /><br />The 2 disc dvd set and blu-ray also include the made for tv behind the scenes program Riddle Me This: Why Is Batman Forever? It stars Chris O'donnell as the host of the program. I can remember when this movie was coming out I recorded this on tv and used to watch it as a kid over and over until the movie came out on VHS. I miss the 90's. I also remember McDonald's Superhero Burger and the Batman Forever collector glasses they had. I wish DVD's would start including more cross-promtional commercials on them. Thank goodness for youtube.<br /><br />Also, I must highly recommend the soundtrack to Batman Forever. I don't usually like soundtrack's to movies but this is a very big and amazing exception and my personal favorite soundtrack of all-time.

B008XBCJ34|1.0|I will share my disapointing experience I had buying this movie. I didn't get it the way I should have and it's important that everyone knows that this movie is not the extended edition.<br />I only ordered it so I can have the extended version with the scenes that were cut out, which give answers to many questions we are left with from the movie we saw at the movies.<br />I read alot of Confusing reviews that left me with the impression that I would get the latest version with the missing scenes, but it turned out that I was lied to.<br />I returned the movie on amazon and was left shocked with their horrible returning policy. From paying $25 I only got $9 back with the fact that I didn't get what I wanted.<br />I am not recomending this movie because it's not the version you would want to have unless you just want to add the regular movie to your movie collection.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I first stumbled across Michael Matthews' work when I was browsing through my Kindle for workout and fitness books.  I found his book, [[ASIN:147514377X Muscle Myths: 50 Health & Fitness Mistakes You Don't Know You're Making (The Build Healthy Muscle Series)]] and the price was so great that I couldn't pass it up.  After reading through it (which I highly recommend), I wanted more, so I also bought this one as well.<br /><br />Mike does a wonderful job breaking down some of the more complex aspects of working out and explains it in a simple, conversation-like explanation.  In it, he explains some of the jargon the bodybuilding community uses, as well as a diet plan, workout plan, and information on supplements.  He also goes in-depth on how to perform three important exercises (bench press, squat, and the deadlift) as well as sourcing different websites for videos for a visual guide on how to correctly perform these exercises and many others.<br /><br />Although I'm currently using Beachbody products, such as Insanity and P90X to get into shape (the only gym suitable for the workouts described in this book are at my college, and to use the facility you must take a B.S. \\"how to lift weights\\" course), I feel that no matter what workout you like to do, such as Starting Strength, 5x5, or any of the Beachbody workouts, there is tons of useful information from this book that you can incorporate into your own workout.<br /><br />I recommend buying this book not only for the useful info, but for the free report as well.  He lays out an excellent workout plan for an entire year, as well as products and supplements he recommends.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking to get into great shape and learn a lot for a small price, this is definitely the book you should get.  Mike is also very accessible, so if you have any questions about the book he'll be happy to answer them for you.
159562015X|3.0|I have read several different types of personality/strength type books. This one is ok. I found it more difficult to understand and how to work within your strengths. It is not easy to teach or show to others. People just don't remember this structure.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Too bad I cant upgrade or have the same version my friends play. There are next to no options, the words are repetitive, boring, and no chance to buy themes as you can in other versions. I really think the game itself is fun depending what platform its on. Please make it updatable
1451650728|5.0|Mack hits another one out of the park with \\"The Persistence of Memory.\\"  As someone who was less than pleased with how TNG left off in Star Trek: Nemesis, David Mack's Destiny trilogy reignited my interest in Star Trek novels again and his latest book keeps that fire ablaze.  I am very pleased to see his contributions to the Star Trek universe continue with the Cold Equations trilogy and I immensely enjoyed this book!
B008Q09K2U|3.0|I have read everyone of his books but in this book he has become even more sarcastic, smart mouth and cynical than before and it now takes over from the story he is telling and detracts from the otherwise good read.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I've been an avid reader for many years and it is sometimes hard to find that book with a different twist.  This one has it!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I found this book to be a damn good read, as most Follett works. There is meticulous historic research behind, but everything is still entertaining and easy to read thanks to Follett's great ability to narrate the lives and facts of the characters on the historic background. As always, it's very easy to love and hate the single characters, which in this book are, basically, the next generations (cons, nephews, ...) of the ones in Fall of The Giants.<br /><br />Said this, this book is not like the previous one. First of all, it a bit too much of a \\"war commentary\\": I understand that, being set in WW2 time, the main topic is war, but there's not too much space for anything else. Fall of the Giants was set in WW1 but still the characters were also involved in a lot else (the Williams in Aberowen, the Peshkov brothers in St. Petersburg, ...). There's some lack of \\"evolution\\" in the characters, which basically have their personality at the beginning of the book and bring it up to the end - except maybe for Daisy (which easily become the most loved character of the book) and Lev.<br /><br />All in all, it's a very interesting book to read, and I would recommend it to everybody. Just, the previous one was much more appalling and deserved 6 stars, not just the 5 I was able to assign it.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|The superhero genre seems to be a challenge for most film makers to feature but CA:TFA is, in my opinion, one of the better films for all of 2011. I confess that I am a HUGH Captain America fan and I've been waiting decades for this film and it was more than I could hope for!!! Chris Evans really delivered as Steve Rogers and I can't say enough wonderful things about the entire cast; thank you one & all. Special kudos to Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell!!! Thank you Marvel Studios, Joe Johnston & crew for staying true to the source material and for delivering such a great story on film that I will enjoy viewing many, many times more!!!
B008UTV6S8|5.0|My wife and I saw this concert on tour in Atlanta last year and left the arena totally amazed.  As we walked out I told her that I hoped he would do a concert CD.  Live in New York City is more than I could have hoped for.  The DVD is pristine--both visually and sonically--and brought back much of the feeling of seeing him live.  But the songs on the CDs can absolutely stand alone--every one of them beautifully done by one of the tightest and most talented bands I have ever heard in concert.  Paul was in fine voice and was gracious with both the band and his audience.  If you missed the show, this is a wonderful substitute.  If you saw the show its a beautiful reminder of a great evening.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I was truly pleased with this game. It is difficult and I needed to go online for hints to figure some things out.  I'm still working on it and its nice to have a game last longer than a couple days.
1451626657|5.0|I loved Catch-22. There is so much greatness here, that it's hard to know where to begin. Many people have a hard time with the storytelling method that jumps back and forth into time. Everyone is used to books that move mostly from beginning to end, with ocassional \\"time jumps\\" only if the character POV changes. Heller uses a different organization method. He organizes by topic, and the narration is almost as if an interlocuter tosses out subjects and people to a war veteran and he tells everything he remembers about each one.<br /><br />I think Heller does this so that the reader doesn't focus on the \\"war events\\" such as battles and missions, but instead we focus on the personal stories and experiences of the different soldiers in Yossarian's bomb unit. The book is absurd from beginning to end. Of course, the absurdity of war, and the absurdity of cooperating with war, is the whole point. What's amazing is how Heller saw this on the heels of WW2, a conflict most people considered completely validated as a \\"just\\" war by Nazi atrocities. Catch-22 seems like the voice of Cassandra when we look at the American wars that followed.<br /><br />My favorite character of Catch-22 was Milo Minderbender, the 27-year old business prodigy whose antics seem perfectly applicable to today. I think Milo most compelling episode came when he contracted to bomb his own airbase, and everyone forgot their objections when he showed them how much profit he earned in the deal. The other Milo anecdote I truly loved is when he got mesmerized by cornering the Egyptian cotton market and ended up stuck with product he couldn't unload. Milo then tried to convince everyone in the unit that chocolate covered cotton was edible and that it was their duty to learn to like it.<br /><br />There is simply too much here to include in a short review. Do yourself a favor: read it, laugh, and read it again. You won't be sorry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually read this after watching the movie and, as always, the book is much much better! The writing is very detailed, very descriptive! You can actually feel what the characters are feeling. I'm really looking forward to the second one!! Two thumbs up!!
0143039431|1.0|Words cannot express my hatred for this book. If Amazon allowed it, this book would get a -10 star rating. If I could find every copy of this book I'd bundle them up and hurl them into the nearest nuclear reactor, gather the residue, and put it on the next probe to a neighboring galaxy. If I had a functional time machine, I'd seriously consider making sure this book never was created.<br /><br />Somehow, John Steinbeck manages to simultaneously whine while also using an author \\"voice\\" that drips with unparalleled condescension. I consider The Grapes of Wrath an atrocity foisted upon generations of unsuspecting students by brain-dead literati who call it Literature---most likely because they feel a tremendous need to prove they are intellectually superior to everyone else by forcing garbage down their throats.<br /><br />My grandparents were very much like Okies from the depression era. They came from the Missouri Ozarks, got married in 1933 and raised 11 children. During this era, my grandfather worked as a laborer on a pig farm, mostly shoveling pig manure. Obviously, my grandparents were very culturally similar to the Okies Steinbeck attempted to portray in this \\"novel\\". I find The Grapes of Wrath to be completely insulting to their legacy.<br /><br />The reason why is that The Grapes of Wrath uses symbols and referents that were completely alien to their world view. In no way would my grandparents conceptualize or symbolize the world like Steinbeck does. Of course, Steinbeck doesn't care. He's too good and too arrogant to try to look at the world through their lens. Instead, he transmogrifies their world view into something palatable to self-identified intelligentsia based in university English departments. Of course, their experience, expressed in symbols that would have spoken to people immersed in their own culture wouldn't be sophisticated enough to make their experience \\"valid\\". Oh no. Instead, he needed to create something totally alien to them, and then claim it to be the ultimate expression of their experience.<br /><br />To understand how offensive The Grapes of Wrath is, it's as if someone tried to write a novelization of \\"Boy'z 'n the Hood\\" using symbols and cultural referants typical among members of Augusta National Golf Club, with ghetto slang rendered into dialect by a white man with an elite education, then trying to tell people the result is the definitive rendition of American urban experience. The Grapes of Wrath is a 169,481 word definition of Noblesse Oblige.<br /><br />In short, Steinbeck is saying we can't care about people like my grandparents unless we turn them into something the eastern liberal establishment can understand (while validating their self-proclaimed intellectual superiority).<br /><br />I do recognize that my hatred for this book is extreme, probably driven by being forced to read it 3 times during my education AND WRITE PAPERS ON IT. Reading it was bad enough. Having to write three papers on The Grapes of Wrath is traumatic enough to make someone refuse to write an essay for the rest of their life. I so hated this book that I found myself hoping the entire Joad family would get mowed down by a Zephyr hurtling down the highway so they'd be put out of their misery. Unfortunately, Deathrace 2000 wouldn't get made for another 36 years.<br /><br />I wrote this review hoping that people who revere this book (and I recognize that there are many) can understand why legions of students (I would suggest they are a silent majority) hate it (as I did many years ago). I'm trying to give a voice to these people that cannot be dismissed with condescending insults like \\"you're not mature enough\\" or \\"you're just not capable of understanding\\". I thoroughly understand Steinbeck's craft, and I despise it.<br /><br />What makes The Grapes of Wrath even worse is Steinbeck's undeniable literary gifts. The Grapes of Wrath is the artistic equivalent of Pablo Picasso painting a heroic mural glorifying the Hollywood tradition of white actors performing in Blackface.<br /><br />I think the best summary of John Steinbeck's career came when The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \\"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\\".lywood tradition of white actors performing in Blackface.<br /><br />I think the best summary of John Steinbeck's career came when The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \\"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\\".
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The movie was absolutely great. It was 2 hours and 20 minutes and I was sorry it ended. Highly recommend watching all the individual super heroes Blue ray or DVD first so you can follow the story line. The picture quality was excellant.  I watched it on a Plasma 60 inch with 600 hz refresh. It was 7.1 Dolby sound, but I only have 5.1 speakers. The only area I wasn't upset with, but more puzzled was the special features such as the trailers and deleted items were repeated under several categories. Likewise the screen control in selecting the special features was not always reliable. That wasn't my Blue ray player as some other Blue Ray operate fine. I did like the fact that it actually displayed on the screen you can use the top menu button to skip around the trailers.

0316228532|1.0|I was so looking forward to this novel. I found that there were so many names to keep track of in the first two chapters, that I wasn't enjoying the story.<br />To say the least, this is not a \\"page turner\\" book. But I'm a bit more into it now and enjoying it. I've found that you really don't have to pay attention so diligently<br />to the names...the story, as pages go by, explain more to make the peripheral characters less important to remember. It was a bit of a disappointment, but I will<br />stay at it and review when I've finished it.

B009LUAR0I|5.0|This album is a much more grown up collection of songs. The deluxe version has a few extra songs and alternative versions of the songs on disk 1. Title track, both versions, are wonderful. Disk 2 has some rather annoying remixes and Popular Song was not at all what I'd expect from MIKA. He pushes the envelope on that one. Celebrate, Make You Happy, Overrated and Underwater are the best tracks but the whole album is stunning. This work will definitely push him into \\"Super Star\\" status.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have always loved the music of The Piano Guys! I was so happy to get the CD in the mail. It has great music and is a great quality too! I can't wait for it to be signed! Next CD, however, needs to have some more music that is new. I already have most of the songs on here. :/ I still love it though! :D

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|The Indiana Jones blu-ray collection is absolutely a feast for the eyes and ears, and the movies have never looked or sounded better than they do now in high-def.  All of the extras from the previous DVD collection have been ported over, and I like that the packaging takes up about 1/4th of the room on my shelf as the old collection.  Unfortunately, the studio decided to go with the same weird paper envelope/sleeve thing that was used for the Star Wars set released last year.  Not only is it hard to get the movies out of the case, there's a greater chance they'll be scratched as you take them in and out.  It's an absolutely unnecessary design choice, and one that I wish Lucasfilm would abandon for their top-tier releases.  However, it's a minor gripe, since if you're really concerned about damage, you can buy your own cases and take the discs out of the stupid booklet thing.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|Let's get one thing clear from the start:  You KNOW what the title of this movie is.  So, don't complain that the premise is ridiculous or that it's not historically accurate.  You knew that going into it.  But if you want a lot of vampire-slaying action, excitement and general fun, this movie is great.  The visuals are really good; the plot moves along quickly and keeps you engaged.  Very entertaining!
B008AU7F3C|1.0|I'm judging the music, not Natasha. Sometimes artists have inspiration for certain projects, and for other projects they're just going through the motions. Since the music industry subsists in the matrix of capitalism, Natasha needs to keep producing and updating her product because bands are like small businesses these days. We all want to hear the latest and greatest from our favorite brand names. She made this album b/c she had to, not b/c she wanted to. Alternatively, she might not have any inspiration right now, but didn't want to lose any momentum when it comes to songwriting, and so she went through the motions and gave her fans something to spend their money on.<br /><br />I think the 3-star review (great cover art, too bad music not as stimulating) was 100% accurate in his critique of the music. The best song, Laura, is ruined by moments of \\"cringe-worthy\\" lyrics, and even the most redeeming tracks are uneven. If you have their other two albums, you'd have to be lying to yourself to think this is just as good. I'd suggest investing in other artists. I don't think Natasha needs my donation to award her for resting on her laurels with this one.<br /><br />Admittedly, a 3-star review might have been accurate than 1-star. But I'm going extreme here because there are witless fans who went ahead and gave this 5 stars. This album does not deserve 5 stars, and I'm doing what I can to bring the average down.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Another wonderful album by a talented group! There isn't a song I don't like on this track.  Not sure what else to say because I am not at 20<br />Words yet.

B003L77G6A|5.0|As season 4 hits its strides you know that the best things about it are the burgeoning relationships that come from the returning cast members of Mayim Bialik's Amy and Melissa Rauch's Bernadette.  Penny, consistently portrayed as the vapid, loose, and drunkish object of Leonard's lost affections, is given a bit more depth finally simply by having her not just accepted as \\"one of the guys\\" but as a girlfriend with girlfriend bonds betwixt she, Amy, and Bernadette.  They are an extremely odd trio whose pairing somehow feels intuitive and they all get to play off of each other in ways that they can't play off of the guys.  Bernadette, the short and sweet and mouse-squeaky confection to Howard's horndog goofy agressive awkwardness, is Penny's sensible and mild mannered friend who doesn't flaunt her intelligence around Penny nor does she put Penny's lack of intelligence down while Amy, Sheldon's superior and unintimidated soulmate, bursts with a socially dysfunctional girl-crush on Penny.  Penny gets the opportunity to be a loyal friend to both of them and so finally shows some redeeming qualities to her character, as does the series, whose beauty and geek fish-out-of-water in their respective worlds continues to be mined for awkward comedy gold.<br /><br />Some of my favorite episodes are \\"The Zazzy Substitution\\" when Sheldon and Amy (Shamy!) break up and Sheldon scarily quickly brings a clowder of cats to the apartment.  A desperate Leonard calls in Sheldon's mother for help and in a great scene, when Shelly's mother is asking him why he has all of these cats, Leonard loudly sneezes the answer: \\"Ah-CRAZY!\\" to which Mrs. Cooper politely responds \\"God bless you, son.\\"<br /><br />We get to watch the crew get their geek on in \\"The Justice League Recombination\\" where the boys recruit Penny and her boyfriend to join them for a New Year's Eve party at the comic shop dressed as, what else?

B005EGXTHG|5.0|Very easy to read and very enjoyable. Once you read one you just have to keep reading. Highly recommended page turner
B008673ZAQ|5.0|In love with these books but its upsetting how they are broken up and not released for months at a time. You almost need to rereading from the beginning to remember whats happening in the books by the time the next one comes out. But they're so good I would happily reread them
B002PZLOOO|5.0|Jane is a freaking genius with observation and technique.  He understand perfectly how the mind works and how to get people to confess.  He pays attention to detail that never differ or stray such as body language, reaction and other things that are so ingenius.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very enjoyable! A good and fun app. Simple yet exciting. You will enjoy this game. Hard to put it down. Excellent!
B002BWP49C|4.0|After the last three failed to satisfy my taste, this one finally has some realistic intensity while maintaining a trueness to the story.  My wife loves this series, but this is the first one I have liked.  Eclipse and New Moon sucked in my opinion and don't even get me started with the original Twilight.  I am actually excited for Breaking Dawn Part II.  The ending actually leaves you really hanging and finally sets a beautiful tone for the next one.
B00846REIS|4.0|I like the chemistry, sexy, bad boy, rich, nice girl turns him into putty type of books.  So I would look for the sequel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awsome does not di scribe this book I thought the first book was perfect well you should see the look on my face now.  :-)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was awesome.  I read the 50 shades books and I liked this book even better.  I can't wait till the 3rd book comes out in 2013.  The 1st book in the series \\"Bared to You\\" is a must read also.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This album, which is the 3rd public album from Two Steps From Hell, has a lot more than the typical epic trailer music.  That being said, the epic trailer music that's on the album feels a like a lot more than generic advertisement tracks.  I was surprised to find music ranging between pop styled epic and classical.  Too be honest, I really love to see classical side of TSFH.  As for the pop, I was moderately surprised to see some lyrical songs.  I know a lot of major trailer music albums have Latin or some mysterious imaginary language, but there were actual lyrical songs on here.  Don't worry, they're certainly not the typical pop song you might hear on the radio.  They have the TSFH flair, that fans desire.  It's just a breath of fresh air in an unoriginal world.<br /><br />What makes this album better than other trailer music albums, or even many major film soundtracks, is that there are so many great themes.  Every melody is brought out of the songs, and the harmony nearly always compliments it.  Sometimes, the themes are so powerful, that you feel as though you're watching some kind of story.  One can visualize and feel the adventure popping out of the music.  TSFH truly sparks the imagination.  It is a healthy escape from reality, which I find not only entertaining but motivational and mentally refreshing.  Emphasis on the refreshing; especially when looking at today's music.<br /><br />With this being Two Steps From Hell's 3rd major public album (4th when considering Halloween), I'm surprised to find that it never feels generic.  They can't seem to make too many epic songs.  It's incredible.  Honestly, I wish I could see Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix working for day, just to see their thought process.  As an aspiring film maker, I'd love to see how such great minds think.<br /><br />TSFH, if you read this.  Don't settle for average and keep up the great work!  Sincerely your biggest fan,<br />Tim Freeman
B00866JL96|5.0|I saw the previews of this movie on TV and knew I wanted to see more, so I bought the movie.  I just love it!!  It's was so much more than I expected and I have say, Zac Efrom was awsome and very sexy!!! Yea, I turned 66 yrs old on Halloween this year. good for any age ...an unexpected ending!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I got to the part with the rocks where you had to break the code, (3/4) way through the game. I messed up the code and then realized what I was supposed to do. I go back and do it and nothing happens. I cant finish the game. LOVED the game up to that point and hope there will be a part 2 coming out soon.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a terrific action packed movie. The stars in it couldn't be better. Loved the entire movie. A1 rating.

B0029QRA1U|5.0|I purchased this item for my mother's birthday. Upon arrival I installed the software and showed her how it worked. It was the easiest experience I have had with her and a computer. The instructions were spelled out nicely and had plenty of screenshots. After I left she continued to convert her LPs to MP3s and had an easy time.<br /><br />The only possible drawback (or plus to some) was that it uses iTunes. In the end this probably made it easier for my mother instead of her trying to learn Audacity or some other open source option.

B0098460O4|3.0|I was moved to tears by their performance on Britain's Got Talent.  Probably too-large shoes to fill even for the original article.  They are good, but they need to work on their musical selection.  Mellow, romantic stuff is not where their voices belong.  They also need a better technical production.  I want to HEAR Jonathan.  He's got a huge voice and they managed to almost hide it.

B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I liked this game on my ipod so I grabbed it for my tablet when it was free. Glad I didn't spend money because it doesn't work. It opens up to the screen where you create a player name. I can type a name, but the enter key on my keyboard is \\"greyed out\\" and won't work. It is like the keyboard doesn't realize that I typed anything. It only happens in this game. I can't continue without creating a name so it is stuck there. I reported the problem but nothing so far.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app opens the reading and the study of the Holy Bible to a new level. So many resources for the reader can be found: numerous bible studies, devotionals, inspirational readings, and commentaries can be accessed. Features to keep the reader on a schedule, allow the reader to take notes, share, and catch up if the reader falls behind. Downloadable and online only versions from extremely literal word-for-word to very simple thought for thought translations are available. The only complaint I have is sometime the text has some mixed up characters, that usually don't prohibit the reader from understanding what the word was supposed to be, but they can be a little bit distracting. Overall an outstanding bible study and devotional resource!

0385344333|1.0|I have been a Reacher fan since the first book. Lee Childs has always put out a very well-written and entertaining product, until WANTED MAN. I read a lot of the negative reviews and was glad I wasn't the only one very upset with this book. I kept reading, waiting for the typical Reacher to come out and NOTHING.<br /><br />Too bad Lee, it's sad that you wrote this attempt for the almighty Dollar instead of the enjoyment of the millions of fans who have supported you. I will wait before getting the net Jack Reacher book until the comments get posted.<br /><br />I sure hope Mr. Childs tries another to offset this atrocity.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I originally saw it in the theaters when it came out back in 2000, but don't really remember it that much. So, I decided check it out again, and boy, was I surprised at how well it still holds up. The effects are a little outdated, but the story, character development, and action/suspense made up for it. In Pitch Black, Riddick is a very interesting mysterious character that blends in perfectly with the rest of the crew. Plot twists and turns keep you interested in the story and there's no shortage of action. Do yourself a favor and check this movie out if you haven't seen it yet. Ignore the outdated \\"special effects\\" of the creatures, and enjoy this movie for what it is...fun and entertaining.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Pretty good game.  No major issues that I have found.  A couple minor glitches in the friends area.  All in all worth the dowload.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|What makes these books and the hero so different from most, is Reacher's pragmatic no excuse attitude. If you like a lot of angst and dithering about<br />motive, if you like a lot of philosophy and dialogue about motive, self and bad guy, then dont read these books!<br />However if you like a sharp clean story, that keeps you guessing and a guy who knows what he wants and does it, you will love this series.<br />The only other detective type that I can think of that compares is J.D. ROBB'S in Death series. Dallas and Reacher are similar, although Dallas<br />experiences more emotional pain about her past. Reacher's character is not shallow and you definetly get a clear picture of who he is,you just dont have to go through page after page of why!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|WELL, FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD WATCH THESE KINDS OF HARDCORE ACTION MOVIES MIXED WITH A PINCH OF HUMOR. REASON IS BECAUSE LEGENDARY HEROES LIKE SYLVESTER STALLONE, CHUCK NORRIS, VAN DAMME, SCOTT ADKINS, AND BRUCE WILLIS HAVE A CHANCE TO SHOW OUT THEIR SUPERB ACTING TO THE WORLD AND TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE STILL TODAY'S HEROES. TRUTH IS THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE MOVIES LIKE THESE ANYMORE WHICH COULD TEACH US A VALUABLE LESSON THAT \\" A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF WHAT THEY FEEL THEY CAN'T DO, BUT THEY SHOULD LOOK ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF WHAT THEY CAN DO.\\" THIS LINE WAS WRITTEN BY MY ALL TIME FAVORITE LEGEND CHUCK NORRIS. STALLONE'S UPCOMING NEW RELEASE BULLET TO THE HEAD IS ALSO HITTING THE THEATERS NEXT YEAR, HOPEFULLY AROUND JANUARY. LOVE TO SEE MY HERO BACK IN A NEW ACTION MOVIE WITH A KILLER VENDETTA. THESE REAL LEGENDS ARE NOT BORN, THEY'RE MADE. BRING THESE HEROES HOME FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR!!!
0316926345|5.0|A novel which the author himself referred to as both his 'magnum opus' and, on re-reading it, 'appalling' is intriguing. Having read this novel several times, I always come back to it as Charles Ryder returned to Brideshead - with a host of memories and a feeling of great warmth. This was the novel which made me fall deeply in love with literature and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful books ever written.<br /><br />The novel begins when Charles Ryder is billeted on an unknown country estate during WWII, which turns out to be Brideshead, a place he knew well. The story then unfolds of his meeting of the young Lord Sebastian Flyte at Oxford and his coming under the spell of the Marchmain family and of Brideshead itself. As the young promise of Sebastian declines into drink, Charles leaves Oxford and becomes an architectural artist, before finding that his relations with the family are not yet over when he meets Sebastian's sister Julia on a ship returning from New York.<br /><br />Evelyn Waugh looks at many themes in this novel: love, loss, family and religion all intertwine and interweave in this story. Of course, Waugh was a committed convert to the Catholic faith and religion lies heavily on virtually every page of this book. Divorce, conversion and the pressure of religion are all present. Lord Marchmain, living abroad with his mistress, does not enter the novel for some time, but he haunts the pages and his eventual return to Brideshead and death scene are a pivotal part of the book. This can be criticised for being about the aristocracy (Waugh himself wrote it during the war during a time of restrictions and privations and the glamour and wealth of a past life pour from the pages) or not being relevant, but the themes of disappointment, love, religion and loss are things we have all experienced.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading more about the family and house on which Evelyn Waugh based \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" you might enjoy [[ASIN:B006TQVE8Q Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead]] (there is a kindle version, but it does not contain the illustrations available in the book version). If you are coming to this book for the first time I envy you - enjoy.ad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead]] (there is a kindle version, but it does not contain the illustrations available in the book version).

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I for one believe this series is one of the most enjoyable \\"watches\\" I've had the pleasure to see in a long time.<br />The wife and I promised to watch only ONE episode a night for the duration so it would last longer.... after the first watch, we went through the whole thing at one time like a very long movie.  Either way, we loved it!<br /><br />The last time I reviewed the Abbey I caught some rather... serious flack from a dude from, I think, Australia because I didn't think some of the... sexual antics by the young valet was needed in the episode...it all could have been alluded to much nicer... but this has been and still is my opinion...I don't really care if anyone agrees with me or not...(My self-esteem doesn't hing on Amazon reviews...)<br />It's NO big deal, folks!<br /><br />The acting is really, really good and natural.  The lady of the house, (can't recall her name), but she's an American actress, at first came across as a bit of a ditz...(is that PC?). But, the longer I watched her in the series, I came to see her character as one of very subtle power...<br /><br />So, I can't wait for part 3 to show it's head so I can purchase it as well as the first two!!!  I've given sets of these to friends and family members and plan to continue to do so....<br /><br />If any arise, or are here already, don't listen to the nay-sayers... this is a GREAT series and definitely  worth<br />your time and or money!!
B005FVNIW6|5.0|This is the book that so many have leeched off. You wonder where Harry Potter got quidditch and where the Hunger Games got there brutality? Well this is it and it was done so long ago! Once you've read it, all will become clear and you may well view those who copy it with disdain. In fact, it's so blatant you wonder how they got away with it! Even the Author is a bit of an enigma, what with him being a Mormon. This book , quite simply, does not disappoint. I have now also heard that a film is in production that'll feature Harrison Ford. I just hope it does it justice. Once you've finished this, you should try more great works I've come across such as the original, much better than the film, [[ASIN:0441014100 Starship Troopers]] or the amazing, but little known, [[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]].
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I have never been a big Diana Krall follower, and this is the first CD of her's that I have bought.  All that just to say that my very positive review of this CD is not borne out of some misguided loyalty.  I flat out love this CD.  I bought it because, whenever T.Bone Burnett works with an established artist, he is able to put a spin on their work that is both in keeping with their prior work and also brand new and refreshing, for instance, Allison Krause and Robert Plant's \\"Raising Sand.\\" He's done it once again.  I love that this CD is infused with a very old-time jazz sound and a much more modern sound all at the same time.  The first two songs, \\"Ain't No Sweet Man,\\" and \\"We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye\\" are real standouts.  The only song that I think interrupts the beautiful, relaxed sound of this CD is \\"When the Curtain Comes Down.\\"  Otherwise, I highly recommend this CD.  As for the criticism of the cover photos, shoot, if I looked as good as Diana Krall after having twins, I'd pose in my underwear, too.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|Well written. Characters make the story come alive! It taught me how the French were involved with the Germans during WWII. I had no idea.
B0098460O4|5.0|This much anticipated album delivers all that we ever wished for and more.  It is astoundingly beautiful and the choices were perfect.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book started out slow but then picked up and I was really enjoying it......until the end. Horrible ending. I don't want to give anything away so I won't elaborate. But the author could have done so much more to give the story closure. Too bad because it was a great plot. I would have given it 4 stars if the end was better.
B00026WU64|1.0|To all the people that gave this glowing reviews, I'd sure like some of what you're smoking.  After buying and thoroughly enjoying \\"Nashville Skyline,\\" and seeing the glowing reviews on this album, I took the plunge and purchased it without first previewing it.  BIG mistake.  This has to be THEE most lackluster album I have purchased in recent memory.  I literally cannot remember the last album I purchased an album that disappointed more.  Out of stubbornness I listened to the entire album once.  Once was enough.  It'll go to the bottom of the stack until I trade it in on something else.  At least it didn't cost much.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|This book was entertaining and gave me many laughs although I came to a point where the endless sexual encounters actually was too much. Then again I knew from start what kind of book this was and I chose to skip the parts I thought was \\"repeating old news\\". I think the language is fun and easy to read.
B009DJB9HC|3.0|Is this a BCC record, or a Glen Hughes exercise in self indulgence? For me, this record<br />starts to go a bit into the wrong direction, those tough 70's hard rock riffs<br />on the first two releases being replaced with something more along the lines of 80's<br />hair band tunes. I love the fact that there's still a band out there doing blues based hard rock today, and while I still dig these guys, I have to say their previous releases were<br />much better. This sounds more like a 1985 Glen Hughes album to me. Hughes vocals sound good<br />thru most of it, although a bit strained in parts of some ( \\"Circle\\" has an almost nails-on-<br />a-chalkboard screech in some parts that kinda flaw that one for me). Always liked Bonamassa, but some of his solos (not all)on this one seem alot shorter and a bit \\"phoned in\\", as well as some seeming somewhat buried in the mix this time...bummer. Could have used<br />his vocals on more than just one track too, to help with the whole Hughes dominated feel<br />of this one. I did think Bonham was still kickin butt, and the album is still alot better<br />than most stuff being released these days. I guess after the first two, I was just expecting<br />a bit better...

B007L96VCY|3.0|Originally released in 1971, Paul McCartney's \\"RAM\\" is one of my favorite albums. I love the loose, bluesy, 50s' rock & roll feel of it, the melodies and harmonies, and all the radical changes McCartney puts in his music that seem to work out as if mother nature were in charge. Another non-band effort, RAM is credited only to Paul and Linda, who went to New York in the fall of 1970 to record some written songs with the idea of forming a band. They auditioned many drummers, selected Denny Seiwell, and added some session players Hugh McCracken, Dave Spinozza, strings, horns, etc. Recorded (at least mostly) at Columbia Studios, New York, there are no less than six sound engineers credited on the album, including the famous Phil Ramone (Phil and I were on a panel together several years ago). The album was mixed by Erik Wangberg.<br /><br />The 2012 re-issue is about 7 dB louder than the 1993 Japanese EMI/Odeon Cat: TOCP-3125 (The Paul McCartney Collection series). The dynamic range found in \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" was 25.8 dB on the 1993 cd, and only 18.4 dB on the 2012. This is a 7.4 dB loss. In addition, the sound is different. When playing back the two discs at the same loudness level (see graphs below), the 2012 (Paul McCartney Archive Collection series) is edgy and fatiguing at the top end and has less body in many of the voices. Note the vocal and acoustic guitar in \\"3 Legs\\", the vibraphone in \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\", the cowbell in \\"Too Many People\\". In addition, the 2012 release sounds a little flatter in the depth of the sound stage, not quite the delineation in the layering of the recordings. The 1993 \\"Digitally Remastered\\" cd sounds more like what I imagine the master tape would sound like, smoother and more present. And even though it sounds easier on the ears, the rock and roll grit and gut cuts through more. I thought that I had read somewhere at the time that Geoff Emerick did the remastering for this collection, but I have not been able to verify this anywhere, and non of my \\"Paul McCartney Collection\\" cds credit anyone for remastering.<br /><br />The 2012 re-inssue is available in 12, count 'em, twelve versions, including 180 gram vinyl LP in stereo and the mono mix (different mix).

0316228532|2.0|I read the whole book. It was well written, but I didn't find any of the characters to be likable. There was no one to root for. Just a sad story about petty, small, selfish people. Certainly not my cup of tea.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|Amazon recommended this book to me after I read (and loved) Divergent.  Poor recommendation, Amazon.  This is a romance novel, not dystopian fiction.  Lauren Oliver even said so herself in the interview that Amazon posted.  Oliver admits she'd never even heard of the word dystopia before she wrote the series.  (Side note:  How does a writer in her late 20s not know the word dystopia?) The author herself says this is a romance novel.  So, there you have it.<br /><br />Regardless, I was not prepared for that.  I have no interest in romance novels and was, therefore, bored out of my mind with the mushy gushy stuff throughout.  I skimmed through 75% of the book and I don't think I missed anything.<br /><br />As a dystopian novel, it failed miserably.  And no wonder, it was never intended to be.  Back in the day, the great dystopias were 1984 and Brave New World.  Today, The Hunger Games and Divergent have landed themselves a place in history.  Delirium doesn't even come close... as dystopian fiction.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver says that she wrote this book after reading \\"Love in the Time of Cholera,\\" which actually IS an amazing, history-making book about love.  Delirium is certainly no Love in the Time of Cholera... To be brutally honest, I think this book belongs among the thousands of other cheap romance novels out there.

B0007SMD3W|5.0|I really surprised when listening to this version of From Genesis To Revelation. The analog master was recorded in 1969 when the technology of recording not as good as today. I thank people behind this remastering project because they made very awesome treatment to this recording. I think compare to other remastered recording of 1969 sound, this is the best. The sound is very clear, bright, and loud and it seems to me this is a 2000's recording.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent. Couldn't put it down and had to read the whole book in one day.  This book really shows what our SEALs are doing every day and we have no idea how many times they have taken on impossible missions with incredible bravery and sacrifice.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I know there's a great story here, but first you need to decipher the writing skills of the author.  You literally agonize over every sentence as if she were writing using a combination of New England talk and 18th Century literature.  What I prefer is a smooth easy read so I can complete a book in a week or two instead of feeling I'm once again back in my college English Lit Class.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Movie is a Classic we keep it in our travel trailer and watch it whenever we donot have TV access. In our opinion the second movie is NOT as good or as funny as the original.
0142429112|5.0|I love this book!  It is a great story with good characters.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes witches and vampires.
1401322786|2.0|While the polarity of the two above characters are stereotypical, which almost borderline cliché, the message of the book is an important one as evident in such passages as:    ...Time is not something you give back. The very next moment may be an answer to your prayer. To deny that is to deny the most important part of the future.\\" - p.195    and    \\"Everything man does today to be efficient, to fill the hour?\\" Dor said. \\"It does not satisfy. It only makes him hungry to do more. Man wants to own his existence. But no one owns time.\\" - p.208    And yet while these messages are crucial to our knowledge and understanding--even wisdom--they themselves on being overtly and directly told to the characters, rather than shown in the narrative through action or implied subtlety, also fall to the danger of cliché.    The book is more an inspirational vignette than a novel: being only 228 pages long on 5 1/4″ x 7 1/2″ paper and a story that wishes to instill faith in a nugget of wisdom that is already known and understood, but often unfulfilled without conscious effort and wilful direction.    Which makes this book a kind reminder toward that idealism of time and the importance of its balance and quality over quantity. Kudos to Mitch Albom for aspiring to inspire his readers towards hope and faith without the weight or dogma sometimes associated with religion. This book is inclusive to all and can easily be read by anyone.    While the intention of the work is admirable and its message important, I would have preferred a more concrete narrative and a richer portrayal of the characters that would deter them from becoming an over-generalized representation rather than authentic and compelling characters who command the reader's attention, empathy, and applause.    Is The Time Keeper worth the time to read? Sure. Just don't stop any clocks for it and expect a life-changing epiphany. Take it as it is: a kind reminder to slow down and be present in the precious value of themoment.    Zara from The Bibliotaphe Closet  [...]
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is fun for the first hour or so so go ahead and check it out worth the small downlaod
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Depp once made smart choices, making adult films. Sad. Honor the memory of the late Jonathon Frid & buy or rent the original series ( & see the night & day difference in quality compared with Burton's hack job ), the ONE & ONLY Dark Shadows series. For those not hung up on just seeing the vampire story, the Beginnings ( yellow cases ) are highly recommended.
1608871517|5.0|Love, love, love this book!  Only from one of Michael's closest friends and confidants could come such a fascinating tale of friendship, creativity and challenge.  Don't want to spoil anything, but Michael, ever the prankster, brought Bush out on stage, in the darkness with the light on Michael, then, suddenly stepped aside leaving Bush bathing in the moonlight at which time Michael said something like \\"ladies and gentlemen, Michael Bush!\\".  Cute tale.  Beautiful pictures and stories behind Bush and Tompkins' costumes created just for Michael, including the incredibly hard work of these artisans in getting it all just right to please Michael's perfectionist nature.<br /><br />This is one of those MJ books that fans just gotta have, believe me.  Why, the pictures of the outfits alone are worth the book price, but the backstory behind each piece is the icing on the cake.  Every time you watch a YT video or a DVD of Michael's performances, you are seeing Bush and Tompkins' creations.  Michael would provide the design impetus for a particular outfit and challenge Bush and Tompkins to \\"make it happen\\".  They never failed him and he was always (eventually, ha) appreciative.
B00902UH5M|5.0|This book is very good if you're Arnold fan or just would like to know how this all has been possible to Arnold. I think after you read this book you see why Arnold has achieved so much in his life and why and how he has done it. I would recommend for motivational reading for everyone.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in about 4 hours. I laughed, I cried, I hit things, and when it was all over...I read it again. Seriously READ THIS BOOK.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Well scripted with engaging characters.  Superb Ensemble cast, A who's who of British Theater.  Should be Oscar contender in several chategories.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|In my opinion, this movie is a \\"sleeper\\" movie.  I got this a couple of times from our library and decided I wanted a copy of my own.  I rarely buy movies unseen.  This is not a blockbuster in the sense of Crowe's big ticket movies, but the story is redemptive, dramatic, and sweet.  If you enjoy the setting and background in movies you will like the setting and the French countryside.  Crowe plays a high powered, harsh businessman in the beginning and I thought, \\"I'm sorry I got this one, this is not my type of movie.\\"  However, shortly afterwards he is thrust into the vineyard setting in France and I completely turned around.  Crowe is not just good in action/drama, he's good in drama/romance too.  I got it again and my husband liked it, which surprised me.  Seems like most guys don't like a love story but this is not sickly sweet.  It's more about a life changing and someone's eyes opening to see things he once thought irritating and unimportant can be fulfilling and finding unexpected happiness in slowing down and smelling the roses.  This is a movie with drama and romance, and some real-life humor.  I learned things about how a vineyard runs which I found interesting as well.  The characters are real people and likable.  I don't want to give away too many plot details.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|One of the best modern sci-fi movies Ive ever seen. Answers many questions about the Aliens universe, but raises more questions/
B001M5UDGS|5.0|When I heard about this movie and what it was about I thought it was one of the dumbest concepts I'd ever heard of. Then someone on youtube did a SuperHero Rewind review of it that actually piqued my interest. So I sat down to watch it. And it was hilarious and cheesy and still managed to actually be a good movie that had me emotionally invested. I actually cared about Doctor H and Penny. It's definitely worth a look.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love the sounds so relaxing i use this every night to help fall asleep and stay asleep i especially live the head phone theta waves
0802473156|5.0|Something you'd probably never think of, something so simple and yet something so important. Who would have thought we all speak love a certain way?! It makes so much sense, and I have been able to realise so many things from past relationships as well as my present one. I can now see how love languages came into play where we had butted heads or ended up in a stalemate with love and intimacy. We both needed different things to feel truly loved, a certain way - this book demystified why things kept getting stuck and why we didn't feel overflowing with love at times - despite the other partner thinking they were being loving.<br /><br />There is no doubt a book like this can save marriages. We aren't born knowing how to be great in a relationship, how to make sure our partners needs are met or how to work them out - what really makes them tick - but this can help. I recommend it to all couples I know.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My family and I watch a lot of TV shows and movies, and this is definitely the best we've ever seen. It breaks the traditions of typical TV, Sci-Fi, etc... to create something truly special. Whether you like science fiction or not, there is no denying that Firefly has some of the greatest characters in any story, not to mention some of the best stories ever. All in all, you need to watch this!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another interesting and well written book by Cornwell. Attention to detail and character development excellent. Always interesting to see the twists and turns not only in \\"the case\\" but also the life of Scarpetta.
0446580848|2.0|Love DeMille, but not sure what happened with this book.  The constant snarky comments by the mail character brought the book to a slow crawl.  The only real action in the book was the last 25 pages or so.  Very disappointed in this writing style from DeMille.
B007Q0OUNA|2.0|I bought this for my son's birthday.  We had fun building it and talking about it, but when it came down to playability, this set comes up short.  Too complex.  Stairs and top section fall apart frequently.  We cannot close it down or open it very easily.  After many re-builds, it has ended up being something he does not use to play.  He uses the mini-figs and the horses while Weathertop sits partially assembled.  Get it if you want to build it and display it only.  Does not hold up to playability like other Lego sets in our collection.  Too frustrating to watch it come apart.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I personally think this app is way to expencive for what it is but that is just my personal opinion sorry but I still gave it five stars it is fun just needs to be free
0525953728|5.0|Very interesting book, in depth stories. The author does a great job in describing very intense situations and makes the reader feel as if they are carrying out the missions
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Many people didn't seem to care for this movie.  I personally liked it.  Certainly it was not the normal Aliens horror flim, rather a sci-fi movie that tells the less horrific story of how it all began.<br /><br />I have a 3D T.V. and maybe it was even cooler to me because the 3D effects are pretty top notch.  Overall I give it 4 alien engineers out of 5.
B009MAJYYW|4.0|Most reviews have concentrated on complaints, so it's worth addressing those:<br /><br />No \\"Best of Bond\\" compilation has included the current film's title song. Go back to the [[ASIN:B00001YVFB The Best of Bond: James Bond]]; you won't find \\"The World Is Not Enough\\". The [[ASIN:B00006I0BO Best of Bond James Bond]] did not include \\"Die Another Day\\", and [[ASIN:B001FQHQRI Best Of Bond... James Bond, The (CD)]] did not include \\"Another Way to Die\\". I'm not saying it isn't a fair complaint; just that complaining about it demonstrates an unfamiliarity with the \\"Best of Bond\\" compilation series dating back to 1999.<br /><br />The absence of music from specific films has to do with rights issues:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009IPZNAK Licence To Kill]] and [[ASIN:B009JENZ7S Music From The MGM Motion Picture The World Is Not Enough]] are controlled by MCA<br />[[ASIN:B009IPZ4XQ Tomorrow Never Dies]] was released by A&M Records; the expanded score album [[ASIN:B00003Q06H Tomorrow Never Dies (1997 Film)]] was issued in 2000 on the boutique label, Chapter III Records<br />[[ASIN:B003LWPG2Q Music From The MGM Motion Picture Die Another Day]] was released by Warner Records<br /><br />I'm hopeful that Intrada, MCA's boutique label might get the rights to give us a proper score release for LICENCE TO KILL.<br /><br />I'd have also preferred to see the music sequenced differently. Chronological sequencing is a bit cold. I look back to the original 1992 [[ASIN:B000002V0S The Best of James Bond 30th Anniversary]] edition. The single-disc release mixed up the songs, whereas the 2-disc edition presented the 16 title tracks in chronological order - but Disc 2's bonus content was not chronological. That Disc 2 presented a lot of rarities, including the demo recordings of \\"Goldfinger\\" by Anthony Newley and \\"You Only Live Twice\\" by Julie Rogers. It also included three different radio spots and an entire 20-minute suite of then-unreleased score music from THUNDERBALL. I was rather hoping to see this 50 YEARS...50 TRACKS incarnation also delve into the vaults, but unfortunately every track here is available on other releases.<br /><br />As for what's actually included in this compilation, it's a solid representation of the 007 soundtrack albums. I'm glad to see John Barry's instrumental title from FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE finally make its way onto one of these compilations, as well as Diana Coupland's performance of \\"Under the Mango Tree\\" from DR. NO. It's definitely a shame that, as other reviewers have noted, there are no representations from John Barry's terrific scores for [[ASIN:B000087DS2 On Her Majesty's Secret Service]] or THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, but I dig that \\"Do You Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown?\\" by Nina and The Pretenders' \\"Where Has Everybody Gone\\" and \\"If There Was a Man\\" made the cut. I might have cut \\"Christmas Trees\\" to make room for a Barry score piece, but it's hard to think what to cut to make room for a third track from THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.<br /><br />And that's really the thing with a compilation album like this: it's impossible to include every \\"obvious\\" track. Choices are made arbitrarily, or by legal issues or time constraints and we get what we get. 50 YEARS - 50 TRACKS isn't perfect, but there's a perfectly good reason for each complaint we all have. Best not to fret over what's missing and just enjoy what's here - which is admittedly a very solid survey of 007 scores.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|As usual, the product came on time and worked as expected. I am a great fan of Mila and enjoy everything she makes. Looking forward to the next movie.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. Quick response to moves. No glitches at all. I would recomend to a friend.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|In a popular music world of Lady Gaga's and other musical crud, these guys continue to keep REAL Rock & Roll alive, and for that we are grateful! This cd rocks in every sense, from the first song \\"Big Train\\", to the last \\"Crawl\\", each song has more contrast than even ther previous 2 statements. Congrats to Kevin, Glenn, Joe, Jason and Derek for another outstanding release, and please, please guys- continue to create rock music in a seemingly dying  musical genre. This cd isn't leaving my car player for a long while!(Shame on the reviewer / punter with 1 star, indeed!)

B0013O123Q|5.0|I hated this film and stopped it a number of times. I think I watched it twice in full.  This is not because the film is poorly made, but simply - as art, Noe delves under your skin, purposefully, and starts needling around your body.  This film is brutal, and the first few moments are frenetic, disorienting, and disturbing enough that, if you got through those, the rest of the film should be relatively manageable until the profoundly disturbing 12 minute still shot in the subway alley.<br /><br />I doubt I could watch it again.  It's likely the most disturbing film I have ever seen.... along the lines of Men Behind the Sun, August Underground, and the like.<br /><br />I think the most profoundly disturbing thing is that 90% miss the point, and without spoilers, after the opening scene with the two guys in the upstairs apartment... make sure to listen to what the guy says to the person being taken out on the stretcher, next to the club.  When I realized what was going on, the raw emotion that was elicited made me realize how expertly Noe crafted his narrative.  It's definitely a bit of an homage to Kubrick's the Killing with the storyline, but it's more like a Memento crossed with Pulp Fiction, then cross it with the most profoundly paralyzing and disturbing story you can remember.<br /><br />I don't like being made uncomfortable, but I am a big fan of film as art, and something transformative that isn't always pleasant.  Art isn't just about enjoying something, but it's about recognizing and pondering your reaction to it.<br /><br />This film is not pleasant. Noe could be considered a mysoginistic pornographer.  But this film, certainly, is art... and it would be a mistake for anyone that considers themselves a lover of film to not watch it for what it is.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|i love the big bang theory and I'm glad i could find all five seasons on blue ray so i can watch it with no commercials my item came in quickly and i would order from this seller again
B008BM9L72|5.0|The best read I have had in many a year. Great story line even though some sexy parts were abit too much for me personally. Can't imagine anyone being able to keep up with Christian and Ana but worth dreaming about!! The Trilogy are the only books that I have read more than once.
B0034G4OYA|1.0|I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed at the movies.  This was a great idea for a movie, but in execution the filmmakers failed miserably.  This fodder is designed to appeal to the absolute lowest common denominator, with opportunities to poke fun at classic monsters wasted left and right.  I can't imagine anyone but the most ignorant of young children enjoying this bomb.  I love MAD MONSTER PARTY(1967) and hoped HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA would evoke its spirit, but the powers that be succumbed to fabricating a C-grade or lower product that gives in to playing it safe.  Way too safe, with chances to interest adults shunned in favor of attempts to entertain the widest possible contingency of youngsters who've spent every waking moment parked in front of free trash TV and Mom's boombox.  Stay away from this stinker.  I have high hopes that my upcoming outing to see FRANKENWEENIE will restore my faith in modern animated films.  Seek out MAD MONSTER PARTY for quality Halloween fun for the whole family.

B008J34466|5.0|Pink is my favorite female contemporary pop performer. All the thirteen songs in this audio CD are genuine reflection of her character. The arrangement of the songs are a good combination of meaningful content that will not be easy to top by other performers in her well mastered genre.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was absolutley pleased to receive this item in my mail.<br />I instantly placed it in my ps3 to view it, to see if it would play since it was region coded (A/1), thus normally not playing in europe?<br />But it did. Since then ive watched the movie 2x.<br /><br />Great service, on time delivered. And the joy is great to have 'the action movie' of the year :p.<br /><br />A must-have for any marvel fan, action fan, humor fan!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoyed playing! I like to play right after work to clear my head! Need more ways to get diamonds!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is a classic film. It is a wonderful story about life.  I have probably seen this movie times than any other movie.  I first saw it as a young 16 year old and love it just as much now as the first time I saw it.  It is funny, sad, happy, and full of love.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|My son wanted to watch bc liked the other alien movies. Acting was so so. you don't even see an alien until the last 4 minutes.
B0030MM68O|3.0|Hurt Locker was a film that offers a look into war not many of us ever see.  we often think of a infantrymen in wartime.  This movie focus is primarily on  bomb disposal units.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Like a fine wine, Mr. DeMille's writing gets better with time.  This book and the familiar characters have developed even deeper and the \\"villian\\" is again presented quite dramatically.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I don't get Showtime at home so after hearing about all of the awards that this program recently received, I broke down and purchased the DVD for Season I.  I have never purchased a video DVD (call me cheap) as it seems a waste to watch something and then you've wasted a DVD. I am not one to have time or need to view a movie over and over.  I would rather rent, but couldn't wait.  So I splurged.  What a great decision!!!  I love Damian Lewis and remember him from \\"Life\\" when it aired on NBC but was canceled.  I love the \\"page-turner\\" type of suspense from episode to episode and was delighted that I could sit and watch it all at once.  Clair Danes was just incredible with her portrayal of a bipolar patient.  The character portrayed by Lewis was so stoic and his reasoning is still controversial in my mind, but I can see why he has made his decision for his \\"cause\\" and to keep the oath that he took.  Just because the guys at the top are American doesn't mean what they did (by sending in the droid) was a correct and right thing to do.  Obviously, they know this too or they wouldn't be fighting to cover it up.<br /><br />I am looking forward to Season II!  Hopefully there will be many more Seasons hereafter!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it! It was so real in my mind.I couldn't wait to turn the page. Needless to say... this book was very intrestmental in helping me and my man in our....bedroom time!!!
B0058P7KUA|1.0|Doesn't work on my DROID Bionic? What's the reasoning behind that? I can play games with better graphics than this.
B004J4WKS8|3.0|It was not what I expected, everyone was boasting about this book, I'm disappointed. Not worth the price I paid.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is one of the best apps I've ever played compared to most apps.If you try it you will love it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I was very eager to start this book after finishing the first book in the series. Name of the Wind took a little time for me to get into but once it got rolling I couldn't put it down. After finishing on such a high note I was slightly leery that perhaps I'd see a similar curve starting this book. Thankfully it picks up right where book one left off and there is very little downtime before the story is back in full swing.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and very engaging for those that haven't spent much time with the fantasy genre. The pacing is great and the only frustrations might arise when your eagerness to progress the story boils over.<br /><br />Top notch and highly recommended.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This a great next episode in the saga. Not a rehash of old stuff. Good action and character development.<br />Wondering when the next one will come out?
B006LSZECO|4.0|I decided to download Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn on my Kindle. A friend had recommended it as a thriller that I would not be able to put down. It was perfect. Why? Because I could not stop reading ...someone needed to be found guilty. And I did not figure it out until the end.    You have to love a book that leaves you with the line: \\"I feel sorry for you....because every morning you have to wake and be you!\\"    Yes indeed, this one was fun.    b  [...]  [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book, like most book from Nelson DeMille is build not only on a good mystery story but it's also about learning the dynamic of a specific issue and/or a world situation.  In this book, the story feels real and you travel through an actual Islamic Country living what it is really about.  Captivating from beginning to end.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Our family has enjoyed all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies and books.  This movie did not disappoint either.
B000T46O52|5.0|I had to watch the movie for a college assignment and this movie was powerful. Great movie. 2 great actors!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I wasn't sure how this would look on our 3D TV, some movies say 3D and they really aren't.  The only thing I can say is this was amazing!!! The 3D effects blew my mind, we have a 55' 3D Sony Bravia TV and I was more than pleasantly surprised at the quality.
B0092SPYQG|4.0|I'll be honest and say that I haven't been overly impressed with Papa Roach's stuff since Infest and Getting Away With Murder. That's not to say that there haven't been great songs, it just seemed like they were experimenting musically. Some worked, some didn't. On The Connection, they have continued to try something new buy adding some electronic elements and have seemed to get the right balance of rock and rap back in line. This is a great album with a lot of energy, catchy hooks, and solid song writing. Glad their back!  If you get a chance to see them live, do it. They are awesome!!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I am happy I was able to order this replacement cord. Hope it holds up longer than the last one though. Got it with the original kindle (few years ago) and the cord sort of dissolved/crumbled off the wiring. :(

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've only completed the first third of the book.  Up to this point the whole story is talking about going to Yemen, getting a history lesson about Yemen, learning about how dangerous Yemen is, going to Yemen, and getting another history lesson about Yemen.<br /><br />I'm hoping that somewhere in the rest of the book, someone does something other than standing around talking about Yemen.<br /><br />Enough already.  Ugh!
B0098460O4|5.0|Okay, I am not into classical music at all, but Jonathan's voice touched me deeply (Charlotte is okay, but it is Jonathan who who really get to me).<br /><br />Now, regarding the CD, I'd be lying if I said that it does not have issues with sound quality. It does and these issues are really noticeable in some places. My sheer admiration of Jonathan, however, cannot bring me to give this CD anything other than 5 stars.<br /><br />Jonathan, the 5 stars go out to you buddy; I hope your beautiful voice will accompany me for decades to come!

B008S4FZHI|1.0|Unfortunately I found this boring.  The plot was uninspiring, the character interactions uninteresting.  I perservered after Red Mist as I thought it got some harsh reviews which were underserved, but I will think twice about buying the next one.
B009CPN2G8|3.0|Papi teaches the children, but their mother works in PR at the hotel. Their inquisitive and adventurous daughter helps to solve a mystery. Not as good as BHC 1 but fun.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cord that came withe the Kindle was clearly badly designed, and vulnerable to shorting. This one is redesigned, and works fine. The female socket on the Kindle could have been better chosen in the design.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This reader didn't know whether to laugh or to cry while reading this tall ladder to the upper loft! Each rung is both a step up as well as a slippery slope ever deeper into the art of the written word. In one word creative!
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I think this movie was over rated. I guess we were expecting at least some of the real band members to appear in this movie.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read BARED TO YOU again before I read this one. I'm glad I did! REFLECTED IN YOU immediately picks up where BTY leaves off.  More intense sexually and emotionally, this one reveals secrets that answer questions to the baggage Gideon and Eva carry. I read this as fast as I could turn the pages.  May, 2013, can't get here fast enough to continue this amazing story in ENTWINED IN YOU. FANTASTIC READ!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|Absolutely remarkable reading this story.... the loss of this writer/artist was a tragedy; that he at least left us this story is a true blessing...best read this month..!!
0446547654|1.0|Nicholas Sparks is a talented writer but this book didn't do it for me. At first, the storyline between Amanda and Dawson was great  but then it hit a wall and started to become predictable. Sadly, Sparks ended up going his familiar route once he has hooked you with his main characters. I was expecting more given the variety of ways he could have gone with the ending. I read that this book is slated to become a movie. Hopefully, the movie will have the wisdom not to follow Sparks off a cliff with the ending. For me the ending was pitiful - it's not realistic - and not what you want to read once you've gone through the journey with these characters. It's an okay story but if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't waste the time flipping the pages. I'd skip the book and just wait for the movie - over and done in 2 hours - matinee.
B009LZEZSI|3.0|I'm not enjoying this season so far at all. I'm not even going to buy season 4 here on Amazon.<br />Forget that I have not cared for most of the songs so far...<br />The writers would have done far better to have just gotten us used to the new kids and kept it about the McKinley High glee club. It's so disjointed and the stories are spread too thin. I can't even think of any of the new kids names right now.<br />What would have been better is to have last year's seniors just pop in here and there as guests. The way the show is now I could care less for the new kids, we've hardly gotten to know them. Let the graduated cast go. I'd miss the original cast members, but there's too much going on now to have any character development of the new glee club kids. I'm not even sure I'm going to keep watching. What were they thinking??
B005K17RU0|4.0|I look at the weather every morning on my Kindle Fire. The app never freezes up....and its pretty accurate. No complaints.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|just got the game great game to play when you want time to pass bye or when you on break multiplayer great good to have backup
B004X75RK4|4.0|Enjoy this movie every time.  Ryan Reynolds is just awesome with his facial gestures, sounds and line delivery.  And Sandra Bullock plays a great cold executive turned softie.  I always enjoy this movie. It's nothing groundbreaking or thought-provoking, but its a overall enjoyable flick.
B0096C7QF0|5.0|contains the songs I love Midnight blues and if nickels were heart aches. this is the only cd I found them on
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I was happy to receive this in the mail...I have all 6th seasons and I was itching to add this one to my collection. Out of all the shows I watch I am in love with this tv series and watched it since 2005! All I have to say, that if this supplier keeps updating after each season with the price I paid after it only being out less then a month, I'll be buying from them..again.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Kay Scarpetta at her finest......love,love,love! Not enough of Marino and Lucy this time, hope Patricia changes that with the next book. Benton seemed a little too wishy washy this go round......Can't wait for Kay's next case!
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Excellent guitar work, great musicians, exciting mix of music from heavy rock, acoustic, classical, and everything in-between. Recommended! Buy it now.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Both husband and wife highly recommend, superb cast, plenty of surprises, depth and humor. Cultural details, adult development, travel adventure for all walks of life.
B007XH6BPG|3.0|I had high expectations for two of my favorite musicians working together- but it didn't come together in an edgy and exciting way. There are some great individual parts, but overall it's mediocre pop. No life, no vibrancy, too much singing in chorus, the songs are not that interesting.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am very picky about white noise but I love it when it is done well. After trying several other white noise apps I was not satisfied. The rain sounds were. too hollow and the other sounds were too harsh. I loved the free version of this app though. The rain actually sounds like rain and I love the options to mix and match sounds to get something custom for me. As nice as the free app was, the paid version is better and worth the price because:<br />1. Wider variety of sounds. Some of which are simply wonderful. They have a relaxation &quot;wave&quot; that is very effective when I need to calm down for a few minutes during the day. I also love the pre-sleep wave and many more of the regular white noise sounds.<br />2. You can close the app and listen in the background. Fabulous for winding down.<br />3. No adds. my daughter loves to play with the sounds. I like not having to worry about where she clicks.<br />4. There are a lot of other nice features like a timer, the ability to control the volume of each sound individually, being able to save a combination that I like. Those may have been present on the free version, but I never looked into it.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Absolutely fantastic, fantastic read, roll on the next one!<br />Will Eva and Gideon have a happily ever after I hope so!
B008I3QZKU|4.0|This is very obviously the work of The Killers. I love this band, and I'm very happy with the new music. The overall feeling is a little gloomier than the old stuff, but there are still some really upbeat, dance-y songs. Every song is really, really good.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I purchased this item from Amazon, as a recommendation from Amazon for my new Kindle Fire. I like the design, but have been sent two cases that don't fit. They've been cool about returns, but I'm asking for a refund if they send me another case that's the wrong size.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|This movie is crazy good...if you are a I just want to watch a movie about love and comedy type of person. The script is corny but I love the plot!!!
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Defineltly worth the upgrade. Colors are great and the sound rocked. Like the ability to stream it too One you can watch often.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I love puzzle games and this was a really good one. Very challenging and long so I did use the in game hints and a walkthrough for a couple areas where I got stuck. It does have a skip button so that you can pass on a mini puzzle that you just can't get done. Drove me nuts that I couldn't zoom in as I was going blind trying to see some of the tiny graphics on my phone. That is why I didn't give it five stars.
1401937519|5.0|Outstanding! Definitely a MUST READ! From the moment I opened the book, I couldn't put it down. Anita has brought a real gift by sharing her experience into this world and I strongly recommend everyone read this book.
030759565X|5.0|I'll be honest, I've waited a very long time for this cookbook.  I've been a fan of Ms. Perelman's since a friend of mine introduced me to her chocolate babka recipe (circa 2007).  I've tried dozens of recipes on her site over the years - this cookbook does not disappoint!  The day I received it (yes, I preordered), I read through about half the cookbook stories (there's an article for each recipe) and flipped through every recipe for meal ideas this week.  I enjoyed this format, it highlights why Ms. Perelman is such an amazing cook, blogger, and teacher.  Her sense of humor, personality, and attention to detail shine throughout.<br /><br />Channel this mentality as you consider this cookbook:  (as she writes) \\"Will this recipe be really, truly worth it?\\"<br /><br />YES! YES! Here's why:<br /><br />Amazing Photography<br />Easy to Understand Recipe Instructions<br />Tips & Tricks<br />How-To Techniques/Photographs (even something like weave your own challah, wonderful!)<br />30+ Recipes for real salads (not just ones with lettuce in them!)<br />40+ Vegetarian Entrees & Sandwich Ideas<br />Do-ahead Party Recipes (enjoy parties that you host!)<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian but a few of my best friends are and for the vegetarian recipes alone, I would get this book.  Here are some of the recipes I have bookmarked for this week: kale salad with cherries and pecans, ratatouille sub, roasted eggplant with yogurt-tahini sauce & cumin-crisped chickpeas, harvest roast chicken with grapes, olives & rosemary and buttered popcorn cookies. I will definitely be making the cinnamon toast french toast for brunch this weekend!  There's a wide range of everyday meals but also special occasion meals.  Some take time and others are quick.  I appreciate the diversity in the set of recipes.  If you're not sold on purchasing this cookbook, I encourage you to try a few recipes on her blog and test it out.<br /><br />Some initial reviews mentioned negatively that her book has too many stories about her son.  Well, she dedicated her cookbook to her son (and he is stinking cute).  She writes stories about her friends, family, and life experiences.  If you don't want that, then I encourage you to find something else that fits your needs.  This cookbook has personality, depth, and humor.  These are things I want in a cookbook, if you do too, pick up a copy!
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|I was blown away by this movie when I saw it in 2001. I worked at a movie theater and got to \\"build\\" the print (and its 2003 sequel), and I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I didn't know if the Creeper was a man or monster. I wasn't disappointed to find out it was the latter; I would've been mad had it been some mutated hillbilly.<br /><br />I love the Florida country atmosphere (I grew up in places much like the ones shown in the movie), so the film brought back some memories. There are also some great action sequences that break up the slow moments. Justin Long and Gina Phillips are great as brother and sister, with fantastic chemistry. There's just something more frightening about siblings battling a monster than boyfriend and girlfriend.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great horror film that's very satisfying...until the depressing ending.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|functional and reliable little app! works great on the kindle fire as well as on the android phone. highly recommended.
0385344333|4.0|While Lee Child's just prior Reacher novel, \\"The Affair\\", was a retrospective, \\"Wanted Man\\" continues loosely the tale started in \\"61 Hours\\" and carried forward in \\"Worth Dying For\\", as our hero is meandering his way to Virginia from the Dakotas.  No sooner is he picked up thumbing a ride late at night, does he get deeply involved in some sort of crime setting, barely escaping injury or death when he eludes gunfire at close range from one of the car's passengers.  What follows is a complex and convoluted tale of murder, double agents, FBI and CIA folk, etc. - and even a scorecard wouldn't figure out who was who till the end.  When Reacher virtually single-handedly takes on a terrorist group in an abandoned missile compound, the suspense builds to an exciting (if slightly a little hard to believe) conclusion.  As often is the case, Reacher has no problem delivering justice at the end of a firearm!<br /><br />We night quibble that there was a bit too much \\"filler\\" in much of the book - at times the plot virtually comes to a halt while mundane descriptions of driveways and such consume word count.  But overall, another good entry in one of the best thriller series of the last 20 years!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game story was also really good I would like to know if the 2nd one is out yet or when it will be but fun game download now cuhz
B009WJWMNI|5.0|Great escape. Acting is fine and the script so far is keeping my attention. Hope it gets a little darker and explores the main character's psych.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is an okay game I mean sometimes it wont open so I have to buy it again but it is okay
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is very good. I would tell anyone to read this book. It has steamy and erotic love and a captivating story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great fun. easy versions are just challenging enough to get you in the swing of things - then it gets tougher but not impossible. good logic builder.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wasn't going to read book two, but when #1 left you hanging so that you have to read #2, I was glad I did.  If you can get over the constant eroticism, the story is quite good.  I can't seem to put it down.  So good, I am now reading #3.
B004HW7JH4|2.0|Do you tune in to Mad Men to watch Don Draper be a head over heels in love, monogamous husband, who wants to spend every waking second with his wife?  I didn't think so.  But this is what you get.  They should have renamed the show the Don and Megan show.  If you don't like Megan you may want to pass.  This vapid character and her hip and sassy French Canadian couture get at least 35% of the screen time this season.  Her character nor the actress are interesting enough to pull this off. And her freaky \\"teeph\\"  don't help.  Girl could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence.<br /><br />Every supporting character and their dynamics that we've come to know and love are sacrificed at the altar of Don and Megan.  Except for Roger and the fat grandmother every ounce of humor has been squeezed out of the show.  Don Draper, our heroic anti hero, once the defender of all that is right and good about being a pig and a lout of a man has been snipped.  He now lectures a straying Pete about the virtues of family life.  Here's Don on comparing Megan and Betty to Pete:  \\"If I had found Megan first I wouldn't have lost her.\\" Who'll hold my hair back while I puke? The character of Don seems tired and listless.  You feel like the actor, not the character, had the flu the whole time while filming.<br /><br />Please take note.  This sad, sorry review is written by someone who loves Mad Men and think it is some of the best TV ever made.  I'm normally a season behind because I like to wait until I can buy it and watch it right through.  I was counting the days until I was able to watch this.  However, if it wasn't for Hurricane Sandy and three days out of work with nothing to do  I wouldn't have even finished this season.<br /><br />All good things must come to an end I suppose.
0425263908|1.0|After reading the Shades of Grey trilogy, I was hungry for something that would bring the pleasure I had experienced. This story borrows so much that it is annoying. Eva is Ana, Gideon is Christian, Cary is a combination of Kate and Jose, and the list goes on. The story is rushed and I really don't like these characters. I got to page 302 of 334 and just quit reading. I didn't want to invest any more time and knew I wouldn't read book 2.
B008OOYALE|5.0|good game but needs less time with hatching, evolving, and breeding<br />dragons are cool<br />grafickes are good also land needs less time to complete after it is bought
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy very much. I had a hard time putting the books down.  I hope she writes more books like this.
030759565X|5.0|This is an incredible cookbook for every cook.  One reviewer had some interesting comments about Deb being a purist, using the \\"freshest ingredients,\\" the recipes taking too long, and having \\"a lot\\" of pictures of her son.  Hmmm, why would you not use \\"freshest ingredients\\"?  There are a couple of pictures of her son, but I certainly wouldn't consider that \\"a lot\\" with a book that is over 300 pages, with several photos of the recipes, food and instructional steps.  I have made several of her recipes after a full work day with great results.  There are some recipes that require more time, but that is why we have weekends!! I can't wait to start cooking tonight - potato frittata with feta and scallions!!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I have to say, I can understand why some readers would give this book a low rating. Rowling does not pull any punches in this work. To say that it is \\"gritty\\" or \\"edgy\\" makes her treatment of the characters appear to be dry and banal at times. While I do find Rowling's style to be stiff at times, I think what she has presented is a matter-of-fact presentation of what heartbreak and damage the social and emotional chasms in our lives can produce.<br /><br />As someone who works in public health, and fights a constant fight to protect social safety nets, I can understand the frustrations of not only the characters in this novel, but with Rowling's attempt to show readers the range and complexity of the human condition. And, to a point, she succeeds in a mere 400 or so pages.<br /><br />While the work is beautifully crafted, intricately sculpted, and wonderful to read. The world she creates is ugly to look at, even uglier that I cannot escape it because it looks so much like mine. Fortunately, she is able to modulate the tone of the novel, and treatment of the characters so the reader moves effortlessly from anger, frustration, mutual understanding, and sympathy, and back again. The journey through this novel, and through the town of pagford, is not a linear one, it weaves between characters who are cast in ever changing colors. The narrative exists not really to tell a story, but to convey the experience of these characters together.<br /><br />I did not cry at the end as Rowling suggested I would, but I did find it cathartic. I can see how some would say that the ending was contrived or nihilistic. I found it was humane -I could sense a writer who could not bear to let some of her characters suffer.<br /><br />Beyond the abuse, the violence, the selfishness and bitterness, there are nakedly human struggles to live, to love, be loved, or simply left alone. It is a lesson in the difficulties of compassion --that even when we know it is right, and that we know it will be unpopular, sometimes the ability to act on that compassion can prove impossibly elusive.<br /><br />For those whose lives are painfully lacking a Barry Fairbrother, his presence in this book represents the fantasy we have silently built, and Rowling has expertly brought to life.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|Let me start this review by making it known that P.O.D. is one of my favorite bands ever.  If you are familiar with their music at all and like it, then it's not even worth your time to read this review.  Just buy the album already.  It absolutely rocks!  You will not be disappointed overall.  The first time I listened to it, I thought it was good but not great.  The more I listened to it, the more I liked it and now I love it.
6305897786|4.0|First of all I have watched this movie 3 times now during my lifetime so far.  This is by far a very strange film and mutiple elements that make you go what the heck is happening at times.  But the basic plotline is threwout the movie and if you enjoy a good suspense triller as much as I do then you will enjoy this movie.  There were a few moments the movie seems to drag along but Depp saves the movie with his amazing actor skills and sense of humor.  I also enjoy how the movie was shot on locations very amazing shots of the layout of the country's.  So if your into a suspense triller with some horror elements surrounding the film's direction as it pace itself along, then pick this movie up and enjoy another great Depp preformance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show makes me think of what might happen the zombies are us and the survivers are the ones on the outside trying to make a way with nothing,  instead of giving in.
0800177177|4.0|This movie Dracula by Coppola is one his better movies he directed and oppose to some people I actually liked the plotline of Love never dies because in my viewpoint true love trually never ever dies.  Gary Oldman does an amazing job as the character Dracula and Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors no mater what movies he is in.  So if you love a good horror movie with some great action scens in the beggining of the movie and you enjoy the actors in this movie then pick this movie up and savor a great horror movie with great actors in it.  I personally never get tired of watching this movie because it's one of my favorite movies in my horror movie collection.  So make up your own mind about the movie and not the other reviews of it, you will not be sorry for buying this movie it's a great horror movie with additional elements that everyone should enjoy because of the chemistry between the actors is perfect together.  This is a movie I savor everytime I watch it and it keeps my intrest all the way threwout the movie.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|We thought this film would be more \\"campy,\\" like most Tim Burton films.  It seemed to be trying to be serious and, unfortunately, just didn't work very well.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|The Exorcist extended Director's cut is by far one of the best horror movies ever to come out of the horor movie section.  I wasn't even born yet for the orginal movie but when I heard they were coming out with the director's cut I told myself I must have this movie for my horror collection.  It lives up to the hype of the scariest film of all time and the bonus scenes really added to the movie pace and endurence.  So if your like me and love classic movies of all types of collections then pick this movie up and keep it in your horror collection as a collector's item because the Director's cut of the Exorcist is defently worth the price of having this copy in your movie collection.  I never get tired of watching this version time and time again.  So don't listen to other reviews just make up your own mind and come buy a classic horror movie that you wont be sorry watching again with the added scenes and material left out of the orginal movie.
1451620829|4.0|I am a die hard Kiss Fan and appreciate all the eras of Kiss. I just want to say if you want to learn about the man Peter Criss not just the Cat Man read this book. He truly has nine lives at least. The story of how he views God in is life is amazing. Great read. Could not put it down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting! I play until I run out of coins then I put it away a while and play it again as soon as my coins regenerate! I just love it! its my favorite kindle game.
B00062PN6I|3.0|I use these in the A/V booth of our church. I did not expect perfect sound out of these, but I wanted something that would be comfortable through 90 minutes and provide better than average sound while blocking out some external noise. These met all of my needs.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|When the trailers and media comments on how this movie prior to release caused such a religious conflict, I had to see the movie to find out why.  I personally did not see any so called religious conflict with this movie that caused such a stir.  I understand the writer's direction with this movie, wondering why,where,when,if and looking for a final solution...sorry I can't give away the movie story line.<br /><br />As Sci-Fi movies go this on a scale of 1-10 would be a 7+.  In some ways I feel it was over hipped but very entertaining in a time when there are few Science fiction movies being released.
B007PFD90G|4.0|I am about 85% of the way through this book and I have been surprised and taken aback by the number of different ways this book has affected my thinking on things I did not expect when I picked up this book:<br /><br />- As an active and professing Christian I am appreciating the viewpoint of an Atheist<br />- As an American citizen I am appreciating the insights into the ways that major religions shape behaviors to maintain political power<br />- I am faced with some cognitive dissonance between the author's constant statements of not wanting to be famous or put in this position, but the tone of the book belies this. I know it is a memoir, and by their very nature they present that way, but it keeps popping into my head.<br />- As a human, I am compassionate in my new understanding of the impact on his life that this fatwa presented him and his family<br />- I am appreciating the historical and philosophical ideas behind religious positions, almost a religious history text in places<br />- I am gaining new appreciation for friendships that would withstand life altering situations<br />- I am appreciating how politics is politics the world over<br />- I am reorienting my ideas of real-life cloak & dagger vs. what I have learned from spy movies<br />- .. and I am entertained by the behind the scened \\"no names witheld\\" view of a saga that we tuned into via more than a decade of brief news reports.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to others!
B008VBYN80|5.0|what you do in this game is do quests and fights the fights are easy at first and you can hit random battle and get to fight other guys. if you win you get a good amount of gold and when you lvl up you get a diamond. XD!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Really loved this movie, from the acting to the directing it was all just perfectly fitted together. A feel-good experience in a fairytale setting of america in the 60s. Cute, funny and clever.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|This movie was terrible.  Granted, I am not the target audience, but as a married 27 year old male, I have to sit through a number of chick flicks and there usually is some redeeming quality, even if I don't enjoy the whole thing.  How they conned the male actors in this movie into participating is SHOCKING!  Yikes.  Guys, if your g/f, wife, significant other suggests watching this, quickly suggest nearly any other chick flick, Lifetime movie, Oxygen, it's all acceptable.  Amazon says I have to give at least a star, but really I would put this as a zero star.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun and aggravating game to play for all ages.  My problem was I didn't know that you could tap the flight of the blue bird and make him multiply.
0316228532|4.0|This is a fabulous read. If you're looking for Harry Potter, or an exciting world of fantasy, this is not the book for you. It is entirely different, though is slightly similar in some of its dark themes. The character development in this book is incredibly interesting, and you are left to form your own opinion of characters. There is no clear \\"good guy\\" or \\"bad guy\\", but rather you experience different views of the same character and come to your own conclusion. This is far more reflective of real life, and I found this to be a very interesting way of conveying the storyline and really differentiated it from other books. I found myself staying up late at night to read more, and delve more into the lives of the people in this town. While some have said that you don't fall in love with the characters, this is correct to an extent, in that you don't in the same way as in many other books. However, I did find that I found a connection with some of the characters, as they are more real than in many novels and have many flaws.<br /><br />In the beginning I did find it quite difficult to remember which character was which, as there are quite a few and have so many ties to one another. Stick with it though! It does fall into place and this no longer becomes a problem.<br /><br />Have an open mind, acknowledge that it's something entirely different than the Potter world, and enjoy!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not very good. The whole movie was strange and not my type of movie and did not hold my interest.
0374203032|5.0|1. This book is great and excellent, because it makes us to consider fundamentally<br />how we should maintain the harmony between Ethics and Economy.<br /><br />2. The following facts described in this book as examples are beyond our human moral limits, judging from the ethical point of view.<br /><br />1) The services of an Indian surrogate mother to carry a pregnancy: USD 6,250.00<br />2) The right to shoot an endangered black rhino: USD 150,000.00<br />3) The cell phone number of your doctor: USD 1,500.00 and up per year<br />4) Admission of your child to a prestigious university<br />5) Buy the life insurance policy of an ailing or elderly person, pay the annual<br />premiums while the person is alive, and then collect the death benefit when<br />he or she dies:  potentially, millions(depending on the policy)<br /><br />3. The theory of \\"economic approach to life\\" where all the behaviors of the human beings can be analyzed and interpreted by economics on the premise of the market-economy or the market society ,accepts and supports the above mentioned facts, even if unintentionally.<br /><br />4. The author's posture against them is right and understandable. Because, the old saying \\"Economy without Ethics is a vice, and Ethics without Economy is a dream\\"<br />which was made through the long history and the various experiences of the human beings, is to the point. Furthermore, based on this, we can also say \\"The management and the conduct without Ethics is a vice and Ethics without the management and the conduct is a dream.\\"<br /><br />5. Mr. Eiichi Shibusawa, the father of the modern Japanese economy, sought to maintain the harmony between Ethics and Economy, as a way of fostering business<br />and paving the way for national prosperity. According to his biography and his books, in case of facing the difficulty to maintain the harmony between Ethics and Economy, what he did at that time seems to put the priority on Ethics, based on \\"The Analects of Confucius\\" and the theory of \\"Ethics the first, Profit the second.\\"<br /><br />6. The money(=currency),through which the profit is recognized, is an invention(=a kind of tool) made by our ancestors with wisdom in order to overcome the inconvenience to barter one thing for another, long time ago. Therefore, Ethics is more important than Profit. So, \\"Ethics the first, Profit the second\\" theory is understandable, also from this point of view.<br /><br />7. The sub-prime loan, and the CDS(=Credit Default Swap) problems which gave a severe earthquake to the international financial markets ,have the similar elements of the above mentioned facts.<br /><br />8. Particularly, CDS(=Credit Default Swap) which was developed for the purpose of transferring the credit risk in a simple and convenient way in the markets, has another function as a life insurance of the said company or other legal-entities. Some buyer of the protection of CDS, may welcome the bankruptcy of the said insured entity, and may not hesitate to cut off the circulative flow of the social credit worthiness, seeking for their own profits. Therefore, regarding the CDS, the following three points should be strictly reviewed and examined.<br /><br />1) The object entity whose CDS is transacted in the market<br />2) Its written acceptance on CDS<br />3) The qualification of the participants to CDS markets<br /><br />9. There is a saying, \\"A man who has a long-range view becomes rich, and a man<br />who has a near-sighted tendency becomes poor.\\" Recently, people have been inclined to lead a near-sighted life, to lose the initiative against the money(=currency) which our ancestors made as a tool, and are losing their Ethics ,little by little.

B008PC1GF8|5.0|The recording is undoubtedly one of Karajan's best recordings. The performance here is unsurpassed, and Karajan shared his deepest love and respect to Bruckner's beloved eighth.<br />For those who own the 1989 original CDs, this remastered CD improved significantly on the depth and width of the sound stage, which makes the performance sounds more natural and balanced. A must buy for either a Karajan fan or Bruckner lover.

B007EECSFA|5.0|I think this might be one of Kate Morton's best books yet! Her prose is so eloqunetly written! I don't ask too much from a book but I do ask the the following: I want well-developed, believable characters, a great plot with unpredictable twists ( and I mean 150 pages out, not fifteen pages out), and good writing. This book has it all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read a lot of science fiction and love time travel books. This one is a keeper. One I will read again and again. I am not generally a Stephen King fan. Not that I dislike his style but I prefer suspense to horror. Now I see i may have misjudged him and I will consider others of his. I see that in writing about light and darkness he highlights the hu.an question and makes us think.<br />The characters are fascinating, the pacing is excellent and I loved the romance angle. I saw where I thought the last part might go and was totally wrong.<br />My one criticism was the very ending. Though<br />loose ends were tied up, what happened did not seem believable or in keeping with the tone of the book.<br />i would recommend to anyone liking King or fans of time travel especia0lly if you loved Replay by Ken Grimwood.

B004V5QWU2|2.0|I'm so sad, because this was my *favorite* sleep noise app. I used it every night on my 1st gen Kindle Fire. Imagine my distress when I then loaded it onto my new Fire HD and discovered that the sounds played with noticeable gaps in the loop...starting and stopping. I'm not sure what changed between the devices, but I was really disappointed. There is no way I could fall asleep with the gap of silence in the sound, so I've had to switch to a different app for sleep noise.

B001EN71CW|5.0|...and Fox and the general public let him down. Yes, the show ended before its time due to lack of interest by the general public, FOX's bad decision making, and even - at least in my view - poor marketing to begin with. Heck, I didn't know this show even existed until after it went off the air (yes, I am part of that general public that let this fantastic show die - I am ashamed). You will likely read countless reviews here on Amazon describing the excellent story, the detailed worlds, the fine acting (okay, not 100%, but better than most we see on TV these days), and the ability to capture ones imagination and make you want to watch the next episode and the entire series (over and over again). That is the gift that Joss brought to us with this series and the movie. Is this show for everyone? No - but that's like asking if Star Wars, Avengers, or Family Guy is for everyone. There is a market for this show and it saddens me that it wasn't \\"big\\" enough for the bean counters. It also saddens me that no one else has picked this up (and that Joss himself seems to have moved on to other projects). But alas, you can read about this epic adventure all you like - I simply ask that you give it a try and rate it yourself.<br /><br />Amazon helps in that endeavor by making the entire series available via Amazon Prime streaming. Not only do you get great, fast free 2-day shipping, but you get the ability to watch series like this and many others at no additional cost. If not here, then try your local video store or that big red box or that streaming/DVD company that rhymes with \\"wetmix\\" (okay, not my most creative, but you get the idea). I can safely promise that this series is like no other you've likely seen. It brings together Sci-Fi, Western, Action, and Adventure into one fantastic 1-season series. I've purchased this numerous times already (for myself, for a gift, as a replacement for myself when someone close asked for my copy, etc) and now even watch it on occasion via Amazon Prime, even though I have the discs. As you can tell, my review is likely biased by the fact that this series changed my opinion of a good TV series, like Matrix did in the 90s and Star Wars did in the 70s for Sci-Fi viewing audiences. But again, don't take my word for it - just check it out yourself.Amazon Prime, even though I have the discs.

B009F879HK|5.0|As others have noted, this is indeed a beautiful collector's piece for any Beatles fan! The quality of the sound of both sides is just great--it sounds like a record and I actually prefer that to the sound of a CD! (I've heard people say that our ears were \\"made\\" for us to best enjoy mono and stereo; I'm not sure that we can hear literally 100% of the sound when we play a CD.)<br /><br />They replicated the artwork nicely; the record itself has that red label although there are two or three minor changes like the label saying it was made in the E.U. and not Great Britain; and the sleeve boasts those snazzy lines with the Parlophone message that \\"this record must be played at 45 r.p.m.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, The Beatles do a great job on \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You.\\" They sound terrific! This music remains incredible even today and I highly recommend this for any fan of The Beatles. People who appreciate rock and roll from the early 1960s will also be delighted!

B0060AY6FO|3.0|Reasonably engaging after a preparatory re-read of Pride & Prejudice. Characters develop rather slowly and somewhat predictably, with the possible exception of the Wickhams who remain their self-absorbed,juvenile selves despite challenges and opportunities to get-it-together for themselves. P.D. James did a good job with language...appropriately stilted and Austen-esque.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|I am not much of a reader. The last time I read a who book was 6 years ago. After reading an article on the LA Times about the situation in NK, I wanted to get a more inside look. Boy did this book deliver. The stories of these people read like a novel and for several nights while reading I really felt like I was inside NK. This book has made me re-evaluate my current situation and I am a lot more thankful for the opportunities that are available to me. I am also thankful to never had to experience extreme hunger.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first book so I continued the series.  The second book was a little less thrilling.  This  one was a disappointment.  I think the author made Katniss a very fickle character with very few endearing qualities.  I hoped after the first Hunger Games her character would grow up.  By the end of the series I felt sorry for both Peeta and Gale.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I pre-ordered the four-disc combo in June... So I ended up spending only $19.99 for it (thanks, Amazon, for the $5 pre-order coupon). I don't have a 3D TV or 3D Blu-ray player... so I have no use for one of the discs, but I paid the same for the four-disc pack as I would have for a two or three-disc pack.  I do have a Blu-ray, and a regular DVD, so I'm happy with that.  This four-disc combo comes with a digital download of the movie and the soundtrack.<br /><br />For people complaining about special features not being on the DVD release, I was severely let down by the special features anyway.  I rarely go into a movie thinking about the special features, but I was expecting something better, and bigger in quantity, especially in the deleted scenes arena. Bridesmaids has over an hour of unused footage... The Avengers has less than fifteen minutes.  But, it does have the short and decent featurettes.<br /><br />I will say that I hate, hate, HATE the packaging.  It comes in a two-sided deep Blu-ray case, so you have to stack discs on top of one another. Oh, and the hologram cover covers a blank sleeve, so you can't detach it (I want to say I have a Harry Potter sleeve that has the image behind it so you can remove the hologram).
B007Y2W44W|4.0|With their seventh release Nile continue to explore the dark realms of the ancient Egyptian Underworld - their fixation with the Book of the Dead seemingly inexhaustible - and in doing so they continue to forge their own version of speedy death metal. They are thoroughly engrossed in the subject matter, but the liner notes seem to indicate the interest is strongly driven by the fact that this stuff just makes for great content for death metal songs. In any case, they've honed their skills and remain one of the most captivating bands in the scene. The moods created by all of the background chants and instrumentations continue to keep the music credible, although at times things become a bit comical, but this is death metal after all. The music stands for itself - brutal, edgy and really fast - but the similarity in songs does grate on the ears by mid disc. The guitars are obliterating, and Kollias has continued to master the blasting with his 32nd note kick thumping and incredibly fast stick work. There aren't many faster within the genre. Thanks to the many years of experience now and Neil Kernon at the production helm, the sound quality is absolutely phenomenal. At this point in time there aren't many bands out there in this genre that can match the depth, clarity and speed of Nile, and while not my favorite genre of metal, I have a healthy respect for this band. And most importantly, hopefully this review won't classify me as an ethno-musicological cannibal.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett has been a favorite for many years. Always entertaining, he brings history alive. It sure would have been nice to have history taught like that in school. The plot is complex enough and has enough characters to force the reader to pay attention and not leave too much time between reading sessions for fear of losing your place.<br />His knack for weaving personal stories into the large canvas of something like the First World War is an art and shows the author at the height of his writing powers. I look forward to the second installment of this trilogy once the e-book price comes down or they start showing up in second hand bookstores. My only real complaint is that Mr. Follett's publisher seems intent on ripping off the very customers that keep them in business for the moment.
B007V80WUC|4.0|Michael Eriksen has an amazing voice, and it seems that during the past 5 years Circus Maximus decided they would make his vocal melodies a more prominent part of their music. For me, at least, the results are mixed. The good news is that Eriksen doesn't disappoint - his performance here solidifies him as one of the most talented front men in the progressive realm. In fact, at the end of the day, I enjoy his voice more than that of James LaBrie. So what is the bad news here? While I wouldn't say the band has \\"sold out\\" in any way whatsoever, many of these songs lack an intensity that has been a part of their sound for the past decade. While \\"Architect of Fortune\\" has that Dream Theater vibe and \\"Namaste\\" is definitely a heavy and dark tune, some of these songs, such as \\"Game of Life\\" or \\"Reach Within,\\" just sound ordinary. And then with \\"I Am\\" - the third mellow melodic rocker in a row - the pace just feels off for this band. It's a solid song, just a bit pedestrian. Fortunately, things pick up, and 3 out of the last 4 songs on the disc are consistent with much of the material the band created on their first two releases.  \\"Used\\" is a catchy, up-tempo song with solid riffing and a nice breakout solo section in the middle. The final two tracks are epics, \\"Burn After Reading\\" what I would consider the better of the two and more representative of vintage CM. After such a long hiatus I'm a bit disappointed by the songwriting, but the quality remains high.
0763644765|4.0|I thought the book was cute, but it definitely could have been a bit more informative.  My daughter enjoys looking at the pictures and picks up this book often when sitting on the potty herself.  I only wish it addressed exactly what the goal was.
B008OHV5HS|5.0|It was sad news indeed to hear of the passing of Threshold's long-time front man Andrew McDermott, for it seemed that the band had finally settled nicely into their new label deal with Nuclear Blast and had delivered one of their finest and most melodic, yet heavy releases ever with 2007's Dead Reckoning. Despite the incredibly consistent output of high quality progressive metal from this outfit over the past 2 decades, the one thing that has always eluded them has been a permanent singer. \\"Mac\\" - as he was affectionately called - was the closest they ever came to this kind of stability. Fortunately, Damien Wilson (Star One, Ayreon) - who debuted with the band in 1993 and also contributed vocals on their third release Extinct Instinct - agreed to rejoin this underrated, yet prolific band. The result is a stellar performance on his part, perhaps his best effort ever. March Of Progress is a glorious and epic concept album with extremely strong songs from start to finish. In fact, each of these songs could easily stand on their own. And while there are no growls this time around, the overall vibe is actually heavier compared to Dead Reckoning - partly due to the darker, less optimistic lyrical direction which focuses on socio-political issues and their impact on the present and future of our world. There is no doubt that these songs were created to showcase Wilson's vocal style - most the perfect balance of his more prog oriented leanings with the melodic choruses that have dominated this band's sound over the past decade. In addition to catchy melodies, the strength of Threshold has always been found in song writing (something I've long contested they do even better than Dream Theater), and there is no lack of either on this release. While a few songs could have been cut a bit shorter (\\"The Hours\\" and Liberty, Complacency, Dependency\\") this is an extremely satisfying listen from beginning to end with 3 of the strongest songs held in reserve for the finale (\\"Don't Look Down,\\" \\"Coda\\" and \\"The Rubicon\\"). This one is easily in the running for progressive metal album of the year.Down,\\" \\"Coda\\" and \\"The Rubicon\\"). This one is easily in the running for progressive metal album of the year.

You're thrown into the deep end of an unfamiliar world, trying to figure out who people are, where they are and what's going on. Naturally, you think you figure it out only to have your preconceptions proved false. Then it happens again, but at a higher level and finally, an awful secret is revealed that sets up the prequel and the planned sequels also.

0525958002|3.0|Out of the gates it was really working well for me from JT's childhood through about 1986. Most of the interesting little personal and professional tidbits are there through that point including really interesting details about how the band got their start and breaks early on. I wish one of the club owner's doors I'd knocked on back in the day had magically offered to manage my band Ha! But I digress. From about 1986 to the present JT really starts to skip around quite a bit. From the first album up through Notorious there are tons of details about song writing sessions, the studios and the work itself that went into the albums as well as personal life stuff surrounding it all. Post Notorious the album breakdowns/analysis become pretty brief. The Liberty album is barely mentioned except for to say if flopped. I wanted to know more, why he thought it flopped, what could have been differently, were the songs good at one point, if he could go back what would he change? There was zero mention of the Thank You album or any details surrounding it. It's like once he hit the 90s, he got bored with it. The personal life details are still there to some degree although he does skip around in some cases years at a time on that as well... it's like what were you doing dude? If you were playing Frisbee on the beach for two years, that's cool, just say so and move on. The reunion packed fewer details than I would have liked as well... like why did Andy really leave the second time and how did that all play out from JT/DD perspective? There are relatively few details about Astronaut or RCM sessions/albums. And Reportage is not even mentioned at all. Not even a word about it. That kind of annoyed me. Would love to know what kind of music is on it... why don't they play songs from it? How did it all play out politically?! So all in all definitely worth a read and it did fill a few gaps for me that had been left from Andy's book but left me with just as many new questions. And then it ended sort of anticlimactically for me. Maybe if he'd given the period of 1986-present the same amount of attention as he gave 1960's-1986, I would have given it 5 stars.ended sort of anticlimactically for me.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is fabulous! It is well written and unlike 50 shades it does not \\"repeat it'self\\" several times. For example Ana metioned 1,000 times about Christian's low slung pants, etc. and the foil packets, this author does a really god job, and actually the story is not as similar in the second book to 50 as you would think. Gideon is a good lover, but not a dominant in the sense that Christan Gray is. I cannot wait for the third book to come out, I am so excited!!!!!

0345803507|3.0|This review will combine my thoughts on all three books.<br /><br />In the past week, I have read all three books from the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy.<br /><br />I originally read this book as a joke, and I hate to say this, but it was mildly enjoyable.  This is the kind of book you read when you need a break from intellectual thought.  The reading is as quick as Ana and Christian's courtship and while it was not realistic, how I can I expect books like this to be?<br /><br />It's obvious from the beginning that this book is meant for someone who needs to be in their \\"happy place.\\"  This place is where you can be socially inept yet find man who makes $100,000.00 an hour (really?  That much?) and finds you utterly desirable. Not only is he rich, but he's young, commanding, and has a wealthy... package.  Yeah, package.<br /><br />If you have sensitive eyes, beware, as you will probably roll your eyes a lot.  The dialogue in this book is really strained.  Personally, I feel that dialogue should set the mood, and I get a lot of descriptions rather than action.  Yes, we get it, Ana.  His touch is electrifying.  Most of their communication with each other is through hissing and sharp intakes of breath.<br /><br />The books are incredibly repetitive... but so is life.  As soon as things get good, something bad happens, and then they have to deal with it while Christian attempts not to beat Ana (in a good way... I guess).  They get angry over small things with each other.  I suppose the author was running out of ways for them to make each other mad, because even the faintest thing would set either of them off.  For a man who makes as much as he does, it surprises me that he is so petulant (learn this word, as it will appear dozens of times in the books).<br /><br />Here are the following words you will read OVER AND OVER AGAIN:<br />* Mercurial<br />* Murmur<br />* Impassive<br />* Taciturn<br />* Petulant<br />* FIFTY, FIFTY, FIFTY<br />* OH MY<br />* There (in italics... because she's talking about... there)<br />* Bemused<br />* Hiss<br /><br />Although I make fun of these books, I've read them all.  So what made me sit through all of them?  Firstly, the characters are so unreliable that I have no clue what they would do next.  Secondly, the sex scenes were hilarious and sometimes enjoyable.  I bookmarked a few and thought, \\"I should try that.\\"  And finally, there were some scenes that were actually gross.  At times, I thought Christian was a little too understanding... especially during menstruation... and breast feeding... and reciprocating after intercourse.  It's great that he is so in touch with someone that he can share these things, but it just felt out of character.  But because some of these things were disturbing, I had to keep on reading.  I JUST HAD TO.<br /><br />Why do I give these books three stars?  It helped me laugh when I was sick for three days.  It reminded me why I love my boyfriend so much (and made me thankful that he isn't that crazy).  It made me want to try new things.  And sometimes you just need an easy read in between the classics.use she's talking about... there)<br />* Bemused<br />* Hiss<br /><br />Although I make fun of these books, I've read them all.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Sorry I just can't get into the characters. Got about a third through it and if she said \\"oh, my\\" one more time! It really seems to only be a book about sexual activity without a good story behind it.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I loved this book, so many answers to questions y had since book one about Annabeth, He did it once more can't wait till the next one comes out!
0525952926|4.0|I liked this book although I thought it was a bit more lengthy than it needed to be.  If you liked Fall of Giants you will like this one because you get more involved in the characters in this one.  We learn about the development of the relationships as well as the events leading up to and during World War 2.  I am anxious to see what happens to the characters in the last of the trilogy.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read every book written by Nelson DeMille and while this particular work shows signs of his previous efforts, it falls short of a great book in several areas. One, the character development is somewhat superficial, secondly, the final confrontation with the main antagonist is fairly predictable and brief, leaving the reader to ask: \\"Is that all there is\\" ?<br />On a more positive note, John Corey's characterization is spot on with his usual irreverent approach to life, danger, women and his compatriots .<br /><br />All in all, not a great work but certainly worth the read.
0525953728|4.0|A surprisingly quick read.  Of course, once you get to the latter third or so - the actual mission - you won't be able to put it down.  Shocking how close they were to losing an entire helicopter chalk of men!  The early sections of this book provide useful and relevant background info on what it takes to join a team like Seal Team 6.

B009HV2JT8|3.0|Abraham Lincoln is one tough dude, according to the premise of this story.  It seems there is no shortage of vampire movies these days.  The public just cannot get enough of them.  Perhaps there is something about the vampire that is very attractive to people.  I have to admit that this is a most original vampire tale.  The story is wildly imaginative.  I mean, really.  President Abraham Lincoln as a hunter of vampires!  The plot is so outlandish that it actually does work.  But you do have to allow yourself to be won over by the story.  You have to buy into it and allow yourself to get immersed into that world.  It may be easier to think of it as an alternate reality.<br /><br />Young Abraham's mother was killed by a man, who turns out to be a vampire.  Abe grows up, finds the man, and tries to kill him.  Were it not for the intervention of Henry, a seasoned vampire hunter, young Abe would not have survived that first encounter.  Henry, in Obi-Wan Kenobi fashion, proceeds to teach the young Lincoln all he will need to become a vampire killer.  Abe works a normal job during the day, studies for law school, and moonlights as a hunter at night.  Eventually, he enters the political arena and becomes president.  And it just so happens that the South is heavily populated by vampires, who take advantage of slavery to provide them with their meals.  Using slaves like livestock for slaughter allows them to survive without attracting too much attention.  Naturally, they would support Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy during the Civil War.<br /><br />The special effects are terrific.  Production quality is very high.  This is a first-rate, high budget movie.  I highly recommend that you give this movie a chance.  Granted, it will not appeal to everyone.  Like I said, you have to be willing to be won over by the outlandish plot.<br /><br />Watching the Raven and seeing John Cusack play Edgar Allan Poe made it a little easier to accept this film.  I guess it's fashionable to take actual historical figures, and put them in a fictional story like this.  Poe tracking down a serial killer in 19th century Baltimore.  Abe Lincoln hunting down vampires in the South during the years leading up to the Civil War!  Ok, what can we expect to see in the future?  Obama as a Klingon commander?  Bill Clinton as a Jedi master?  George W. Bush as a Time Lord?  I suppose this is all for the good, as long as it's done in good fun.  It can be fun to watch someone like Abe Lincoln as an action hero.  Just watch it for entertainment, get swept into the story, and you will enjoy the movie.  Take the plot too seriously and you will not enjoy it at all.take actual historical figures, and put them in a fictional story like this.

B006LSZECO|1.0|NOTE: Spoilers<br /><br />For me, the problem with this book was that the main characters were never really likable. From the first page to the last, I could care less what happened to either of them. In the end I wanted Nick to deal Amy the emotional blow she deserved but other than that, I found them both selfish and egotistical.<br /><br />Amy starts out as a supposed sweet girl who comes off as wanted to be a good wife, until we find out that for years she's been preparing to frame her husband for her own murder. The diary thing, pretending to love him, pretending to be BFF's with the neighbor (Which they never discuss after she returns home - are they still friendly?), pretending to be sickened by blood... all this in preparation to turn the tables on the man she feels is wronging her. The entire thing felt impossible and unrealistic. Once she takes off, she has $10K in cash which dwindles quickly. What was she expecting to do with that money anyway? We're expected to believe she thinks this is a suitable amount to start over somewhere else? Spoiled rich kid or not - she's got to know that's nothing.<br /><br />Nick is so unemotional, I found him boring. Finding out he had a mistress was shocking and yet, not surprising. He's an arrogant guy who had his ego checked when he got laid off from his job and had to move home to help his family. Plus, it's clear he's unhappy in his marriage. Once he figures out he's being played, he finally embraces an emotion: anger, and that's when I thought this book might turn around. How wrong I was!<br /><br />In the end I expected to read that Nick found a way to turn the tables on this woman, learn his lesson and move on. Instead it's like the author couldn't figure out how to end it and just shrugged. We hate Amy and want to see her get what's coming to her and yet, it never happens. He's terrified of his own wife, a murderer and sociopath, and yet stays with her.<br /><br />I love my Kindle but I really wanted to chuck it at the wall when I was finished with this book.the wall when I was finished with this book.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm clock was the boat to my shining armour. it was sexy .... i pooped my pants after downloading it. buy it or else ur dumb..... i cried after using it for the first time. it was sooooo...... LIFECHANGING!!!! ahhhhhhhh! im gonna marry it someday .... and have tiny alarm clock app babies. And then we're gonna get a dog that's a camera. :) And a bird from angry birds, preferably the really pissed off yellow one. Maybe even a green pig. Speaking of which, there's this new app that's a spinoff of angry birds called BAD PIGGIES. it was a great app. i like it even more then A.Birds. U build the pigs a bunch of different vehicles to take them to find the map to the island where the eggs are. Some levels are challenging while some aren't. You can attach a balloon  and make them fly or put wheels on a cart and send them flying down a mountainside. Soooo entertaining. So by that app also. Wait , also by this alarm clock app, it changed my life. I luv my pants!!!!!! Byyyyyyyyeeeee!!!!!!!;) :) ;)
1451620829|1.0|If you want to read 360 pages of a guy whining about how he's gotten screwed over his entire life than this book is for you.In his mind every lawyer on the planet is incompetent and out to screw him even when he hires them.He's supposed to be this die hard musician but all he does is bitch about how much money he isn't making.All he seems to do is ask for a pat on the back on everything,Yes Gene is a money obsessed weasel but without him Criss would have spent the rest of his life playing bars for a few bucks a night.If it was so hard to be around Gene and Paul then maybe he should have found another group to work with.He's supposed to be a devout catholic but banging everything with a pulse while he was married was okay because he was a rock star?? Between his bashing the other guys and his whining about money that he pissed and snorted away this gets boring very fast and stays that way.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|As stated, this chip is simply spectacular.  I came from a Q6600 and I was debating whether this would be a better upgrade than the 2500k and I must say I feel I've made the right choice.<br /><br />I was getting a little tired of the lagging issues I had to deal with when using my old PC and I had finally decided to upgrade.  I received the shipment extremely quickly (next day) and proceeded to immediately gut my old PCs parts out of my Antec 900.  Everything went incredibly smoothly and without hesitation, I decided to try for a modest overclock (mind you, this is ALL on air cooling with a Zalman CNPS9700).  4GHz?  Easy.  4.2?  Simple.  4.4? Such a breeze.  4.6?  Simple but I was uncomfortable with the voltage requirement so I knocked it back down to 4.4 GHz and, to be quite blunt, it blows every conception of CPU power I had embedded in my mind out of the water.  I couldn't believe the performance that I've gotten out of this chip. It blows my mind how I can play Battlefield 3 on Ultra @ 1080p while also streaming Netflix on another monitor without hickup.  This thing is the multitasker's dream!  Intel sure has stepped up their game! I was AMD only until Conroe made an appearance and I'm ecstatic that I made the switch and now my PC is just unbeatable.<br /><br />CPU: i5-3570k<br />MB: Biostar TZ77B (temporarily)<br />GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 660 Ti Superclocked<br />Case: Antec Nine Hundred<br />PSU: Ultra Lifetime 750w

Just when you think you know everything you learn even more about why a character is the way they are. It is an emotional read that I didn't want to put down! Way to go Suzanne Collins!
1451695195|2.0|I really expected to hear about knowledge and answered questions from the other side. There is very little of that in this book. This is more of a detailed account of his coma and the effect on family, rather than lessons learned and knowledge gained.<br />I guess for people that don't believe in the existence of NDE's this book should clear that up. He covers that angle over and over again. That's not a problem for me - I want to hear more about the other side, not a human's experience from this side.<br />I hope he writes another book, maybe after some of his new found knowledge works its' way to the surface a little better ...

B000002UDD|5.0|It's hard to imagine now that at one time Megadeth was considered underground.  So Far so Good is speed metal at its best.  Blazing guitar work, that went unnoticed by my teachers that were all trying to teach me jazz.  Speed metal/prog metal brought great music to the underclass.  However, to call Megadeth elite at this time is a non-starter.  Their version of Anarchy in the UK rips to shards any document that would have you think that they are playing music for the complexity of it.  Really, this is just Dave Mustaine playing another modern version of the blues.  His predecessors were folks like Charlie Parker, Buddy Guy, and John Coltrane.<br />In this way, I have heard blues called, \\"The motherload of music.\\"  Almost everything, be it punk, which is ultra simple blues, to speed metal, to John Coltrane, pretty much all Western music grows as a branch from the blues tree.

Very good writing, I didn't have any trouble telling the difference between the two trains of thought, so to speak. It kept me anticipating what was going to happen to both of the main characters, and I was frequently surprised! I'm anxious to pick up another novel by Gillian Flynn.

B004BLTNM0|5.0|After first watching I Spit On Your Grave (2010) I wanted to see the original cult classic and I will say that I was very pleased and disturbed at the same time wich I know was the point of this movie. It achieved it without a doubt, both versions of I Spit On Your Grave are very different from each other wich I appreciate because it would be easy to make an exact copy of this movie and thankfully they did not. With this latest release of I Spit On Your Grave you get the original 1978 Directors Cut.<br /><br />And with this release you get some good bonus features and digitally remastered, bonus features include:  2 different Audio Commentary tracks, one with Writer / Director Meir Zarchi and the other with Author / Historian Joe Bob Briggs, The Values Of Vengeance: Meir Zarchi Remembers I Spit On Your Grave feature, 1.78:1 Widescreen Presentation, Poster & Still Gallery, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, Radio Spots, Alternate Main Title, Subtitles and TV Spots & Trailers.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|I Spit On Your Grave (2010) is a heart pounding expierence that all true horror fans should see at least once. I was scepitcal about the re-make due to the fact that the original is auch a cult classic and is hailed by many to be the scariest horror film ever made. But without further ado, I was, to say the least, shocked and very surprised by this re-make of a cult classic. The rape scene will in fact make your blood boil and irritate you to no end, but the revenge that Jennifer Hill gets is all to sweet and well worth your viewing.<br /><br />On this DVD release you get a nice little package with some really good bonus features including:  Audio Commentary with Director Steven R. Monroe and Producer Lisa Hansen, The Revenge Of Jennifer Hills:  Remaking A Cult Icon feature, Subtitles, Teaser Trailer, Theatrical Trailers, 2.35:1 Widescreen Presentation, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Radio Spot and Deleted Scenes. \\"A Full Emotional Ride:  eerie and unsettling... visceral and disturbing and ultimately quite exilarating.\\" \\"If you can handle it, see it.\\" Those are just a few reviews on this movie and they are very accurate. If you love horror then get this and the original I Spit On Your Grave.

To be honest, I was bored and not eager to finish. It's an easy read and the story flows smoothly but besides them being in a committed relationship after a week and having sex every 5 mins there's not much to the story. I really was looking forward to this but I don't think I will be reading the second and third book.

0316228532|1.0|I have never reviewed a product on Amazon until now, but I am reviewing this one just to make sure the overall product rating goes down at least a little more.  No, I did not expect this to be like Harry Potter. What I found only a couple chapters in, though, was enough profanity to make me stop and wonder what the rest of the book was like. I randomly flipped to various pages throughout the book. Every page I turned to had the \\"F\\" word or another vulgar expression/subject on it.  That was enough for me.  Ms. Rowling, you may have written a wonderful children's series, but that does not make your adult literature great, too.  This book belongs in the trash.  How sad that such a gifted author chose to write like this.

1400067820|4.0|The author has a well-earned fan club, and I'm almost a member, and I'm not quite smart enough to follow all the arguments and just smart enough to think it may not completely be my fault.  Read the other positive reviews--they'll persuade you, and if I were able to follow the book better, I may have written one of them myself.<br /><br />I have to laugh at how the author's point of view makes me feel smart in the places where my actions \\"agree with\\" his recommendations -- get out of the stock market, keep options open, trust in and that old school technology will be around longer than anything new with an on/off switch.  (He's a man; his examples are fountain pens and paper books vs Mac & iPads; mine are old Singer treadle sewing machines and analog rug looms vs. the latest electronic embroidering machine, which will be obsolete the next time MicroSoft releases a new OS.)  At the same time, I observe myself ignoring the bit about staying out of debt, or perhaps pretending \\"it will be different with me...\\"<br /><br />Taleb makes me work to let go of the smaller points that make me excessively irritated (not the word I want but the closest that the review policy will let me use) in the light of my overall agreement with his perspective.  Specifically, the three lines about our world being better because we have Silvia Plath's poetry because she didn't have Prozac appear, to me, to fly in the face of his overall position that no-one should benefit because someone else absorbed all the suffering.  \\"Moods,\\" IMO, are not equivalent to suicidal depression.  As it is, plenty of \\"everything with a soul WAS silenced,\\" when anyone commits suicide that medication could have prevented (p. 41, review copy).<br /><br />And now I've spent six lines ranting about three stick-in-my-mind lines that don't negate the rest of the book.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|What you won't get:<br /><br />1.) A loving and detailed description of streets paved with gold and dancing angels.<br />2.) Proof.<br /><br />What you *will* get:<br /><br />A narrative that is divided into two alternating parts: One part is what others are doing (mostly family members) while Alexander is in a coma. The other part is what Alexander is experiencing during the Coma. His description is undoubtedly thinner than what most would probably like but narrative description doesn't seem to be one of Alexander's gifts. We can't all be poets. Alexander dedicated his life to being a highly trained and accomplished neurologist, not a John Steinbeck. (What Alexander *does* spend considerable time describing is the emotional impact the experience was having on him.) More to the point: Once one reads enough NDEs, one realizes that NDEs are highly subjective experiences filled with symbolism and archetype. Was the butterfly Alexander rode during his NDE \\"real\\"? Yes and no. Yes, it was real in a subjective and symbolic sense. The butterfly was obviously a potent symbol and it doesn't take much insight to guess its meaning. Will the next person, during their NDE, ride or see a butterfly? No, but they may experience something \\"like\\" the butterfly, and something just as powerfully meaningful. Reading NDEs for what heaven \\"looks like\\" may be gratifying (like eating popcorn) but that's not what NDEs are about. The NDE landscape is different for each person because what matters isn't what's *seen*, but what's *meaningful*. To one person what's meaningful is an angel with wings. To another, that \\"angel\\" will be a child, on orb or a beautiful sphere of light. Judge Alexander's NDE not for what he did or didn't see, but for what he learned concerning life, our place in it, and Love. These are universal lessons common to nearly all NDEs. The only difference is in the symbolism used to express and communicate these ideas:<br /><br />\\"You are loved and cherished, dearly forever.\\"<br />\\"You have nothing to fear.\\"<br />\\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\"<br /><br />What is a tour of heaven going to add to these sentiments?<br /><br />*Proof*<br /><br />First thing to be said is that Alexander initially opposed the title of the book. The title was given by the publisher, Simon & Schuster.<br /><br />\\"I didn't really consider this book to be scientific proof of anything,\\" he said.<br /><br />Alexander's book, as he himself states, is written for the \\"second camp\\" of readers \\"who have heard about NDEs, either by reading about them or--because they're extraordinarily common--by having a friend or relative who had undergone one. These people in the middle were the ones my story could really help.\\" It's not written to persuade the atheist or the devout skeptic. He's spent his life comforting and healing, and this book (in his view) is an extension of that. If you're looking for proof, you're not going to find it in this book at least (which makes the title unfortunate). Alexander intimates that he will write another book (or \\"paper\\" perhaps) intended for the more scientifically and skeptically oriented. With that in mind, and despite the claims of many critics (and reviewers here at Amazon) Alexander *does* address the issue of *when* his NDE may have occurred. He is inclined to eliminate the possibility that the entirety of the NDE occurred during the brief hours (or less) when his neocortex presumably began to recover. He writes:<br /><br />8. A \\"reboot phenomenon\\" -- a random dump of bizarre disjointed memories due to old memories in the damaged neocortex, which might occur on restarting the cortex into consciousness after a prolonged system-wide failure, as in my diffuse meningitis. Especially given the intricacies of my elaborate recollections, this seems most unlikely.<br /><br />So, this would be Alexander's response to critics like Sam Harris, Richard Carrier and numerous armchair atheists and self-styled philosophers. Here's one typical response by someone named PZ Myers:<br /><br />//\\"Notice that key phrase: \\"words registered later\\". He was not writing this stuff down while he was in a brain-dead state; I would argue that he was also not experiencing them at that time. These were stories that he built later, as he was coming to grips with that past trauma, and they were a means of coping with a huge painful gap in his memory. We know that this is what our brains do; it fills gaps in our knowledge with imaginary events to maintain continuity, a process called confabulation.\\"//<br /><br />This \\"dismissal by confabulation\\" is a current favorite among skeptics, and simply in terms of evidence there *is* none. Skeptics, when offering \\"confabulation\\", are indulging in a mechanism which actually has less to support it than non-local consciousness. There is no evidence that \\"confabulation\\" can create a lucid, meaningful narrative and experience on par with the NDE. It's a leap, an assumption that skeptics are willing to make, but there is (as of yet) *no* evidence to support that leap. If you read any skeptic who says otherwise, ask them to provide the evidence, the study, or the link to the paper that backs up their assertion. They can't. All they can point you to (which they somehow can't be bothered to defend) is research that does *not*, in fact, suggest the brain is capable of creating the lucid narrative of an NDE. Alexendar is also aware of this, being a neurosurgeon. If confabulation were remotely capable of producing an NDE I trust that Alexander would be the first to suggest it (and most likely accept it). More importantly, many, many NDEs occur when the brain is *not* recovering from the type of trauma that would induce confabulation. This also indicates that confabulation is not a reliable or likely explanation for NDEs. It is, however, sufficient for skeptics who, when a lack of evidence works in their favor, are hypocritically willing to accept that insufficiency.<br /><br />And this raises another issue. I have yet to read a response, from a skeptic, that was remotely convincing. All the skeptics I have read fall back on discredited explanations (explanations discredited by other skeptics, mind you), and offer no supporting evidence that backs up their assertions. This is skepticism turned Scientism. Skepticism requires knowledge concerning the subject being investigated; but all the dismissive skeptics I have read display little knowledge of the NDE. They end up expressing a priori opinions based on a reductionist or materialist belief system that is, at root, no different than any religious belief system.<br /><br />Another avenue which critics take is to ridicule the content or the message expressed in Alexander's NDE:<br /><br />//\\"But of course not. He returns from his mind-expanding experience and does not sit down to write a revolutionary new paper on the science of the mind, but instead, as usual, writes a bunch of banal drivel about angels. This is the deep message that he shares with us that would have taken years to fully grasp...\\" ~ PZ Myers//<br /><br />Whether one thinks the NDE was banal is as red as the red herring can get. Who cares whether Myers thinks Alexander's NDE was banal? (I personally find Myers' article to be pompous and banal - especially when he can't come up with anything better than to write \\"bullshit\\"). The issue isn't whether the NDE was transcendent (how can one communicate such an experience - real or not?), but that it occurred at all. According to every current model of the brain, Alexander's brain shouldn't have been able to produce a lucid experience.<br /><br />Don't believe skeptics who write that there's no evidence to support non-local consciousness. That's complete rubbish. There is a mountain of evidence suggesting that consciousness is non-local. The only issue is in how one *interprets* that evidence. To date, skeptics have singularly and indisputably failed to provide a brain-based explanation for the NDE.This does not mean they won't. What it means is that any assertion that consciousness is purely the product of the brain is a statement of belief -- of a reductionist belief system. Period.<br /><br />For example, here's Victor Stenger:<br /><br />//This is nothing more than the classic argument from ignorance,\\" wrote physicist Victor Stenger, the author of the best-selling book \\"God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist.\\"<br /><br />\\"The flaw in the argument should be obvious. Just because someone -- or even all of science -- currently cannot provide a natural explanation for something, it does not follow that a natural explanation does not exist or will never be found,\\" he wrote.//<br /><br />The fundamental flaw in Stenger's argument should be obvious. He thinks he knows what \\"natural\\" is. He believes (operative word being \\"believes\\") that what is natural entails a fairly circumscribed reductionist or materialist belief system. Here is Wikipedia:<br /><br />//\\"Metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy which maintains that nature encompasses all that exists throughout space and time. Nature (the universe or cosmos) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal physical substance--mass-energy. For example, astronomer Carl Sagan, an agnostic, described the cosmos as \\"all that is or ever was or ever will be.\\"[1] Non-physical or quasi-physical substance, such as information, ideas, values, logic, mathematics, intellect, and other emergent phenomena, either supervene upon the physical or can be reduced to a physical account. The supernatural does not exist, which is to say, only nature is real[2], i.e. Atheism.\\"//<br /><br />Stenger, like Richard Carrier and other skeptics, is a Metaphysical Naturalist. Metaphysical Naturalism, it needs to be pointed out, *is a belief system*. Science does not support metaphysical naturalism (or Stenger or Harris or any of the other self-styled \\"skeptics\\"). Science is a methodology, not a belief system.<br /><br />The methodology of science is best expressed, not by the Metaphysical Naturalist, but by the *Methodological* Naturalist:<br /><br />//\\"Methodological naturalism is concerned not with claims about what exists but with methods of learning what is nature. It is strictly the idea that all scientific endeavors--all hypotheses and events--are to be explained and tested by reference to natural causes and events. The genesis of nature, e.g., by an act of God, is not addressed. This second sense of naturalism seeks only to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature. Methodological naturalism is a way of acquiring knowledge.\\"//<br /><br />The methodological naturalist does not make proclamations concerning the nature of NDEs, consciousness, reality or God. *Science* properly recognizes that the jury is still out. Again, there is mounting evidence that allows for the interpretation that consciousness is non-local. If that offends the belief systems of individuals like Carrier, Myers, Harris or Stenger, then they'll just have to suck it up (just like their religious brethren, who still refuse to belief in evolution or a 4.6 billion year old earth). Nobody should treat their pronouncements any differently than the pronouncements made by adherents of any other threatened belief system.<br /><br />Parting thought: I hope Alexander follows up this book with something more scientifically minded. As far as skeptics go, this book is low hanging fruit. The real test for Alexander will be in confronting the belief systems of his colleagues. He has the knowledge to make the argument and I look forward to hearing it.<br /><br />At the close of the book, Alexander writes:<br /><br />\\"I know there will be people who will seek to invalidate my experience anyhow, and many who will discount it out of court, because of a refusal to believe that what I underwent could possibly be \\"scientific\\" -- could possibly be anything more than a crazy, feverish dream.... [But] here I am. I'm still a scientist, I'm still a doctor, and as such I have two essential duties: to honor the truth and to help heal. That means telling my story.\\"<br /><br />One stylistic observation:<br /><br />What's with the incomplete sentences Mr. Alexander? They're not necessary and they *do* tend to confuse.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|First off let me say Jessica Lang is superb. She is brilliant and what a pleasure it is to see first class acting - a rare thing these days.<br />This series is very creative, dark, twisted, intelligent and fantastically done.<br />Thank you to all who are involved in the creation!
B007CI81IQ|5.0|I purchased this after spending 8 weeks in Uganda working at a state hospital and feeling rather disenchanted with how things were working in a country with quite a lot of resources, and good farmland.  Disconcerting to have a ward of children with 1/3rd suffering from severe malnutrtion.  This book has very much helped my thinking about this and I would rate it the best of several i have read on this issue. I highly recommend it.
1936608898|5.0|I've read almost all of the \\"paleo\\" and \\"primal\\" books out there and I think this is one of the best. It may not have all the science-y bits in it, for that I would recommend the Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf, but it does a great job at thoroughly explaining the why's and how's of eating this in a way that I think is easier for most people to understand.<br /><br />Because of this, I have actually bought this book several times to give out as gifts to people and have found myself lending this book out to more people who are interested in learning more about \\"food with no brakes\\". The analogies the Hartwigs use to explain concepts are well done.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Terrific storyline , direction, acting, and human interest. Totally engrossing. Really appreciate this purchase since it beats extra cable costs.
0767817729|4.0|I love the movie, anything with Kevin Costner is always a delight to watch, so is Madeline Stowe and Anthony Quinn.  It was a great love story but with a tragic ending.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I loved this movie but it was not appropriate for young children as the characters in it were too scary - not sure of when it should be shown.  I notice that on the other reviews no observation was made of the scary nature.  I thought it was nicely done but will save it for when the Grands turn 5 or so.

B000Q6GUT8|4.0|If you have little faith in a corrupt system, this movie will do little to restore any rose-colored glasses view of things. Since I fall into that category, I enjoyed the story very much. Does the bad guy get his just desserts in the end? I like it when they do. Good story, good action, good all around in my humble opinion.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|For those of us who remember the TV show of Dark Shadows there isn't much of a comparison.  They are two different types of shows.  I used to come home from work and watch the sitcom while I shivered until my husband got home.  This DVD is nothing like that.  It is pure fun with only the twist that Depp can give a film.  I enjoyed every bit of it and recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for a pure repeat of the TV show. This is another example of what a good actor Johnny Depp is. How would you feel coming back about 200 years into our world from the one in which you were living?  Food for thought!

B007THA4FI|2.0|I expected more from the writer of the Harry Potter series, but I  found it tiresome and stopped reading rather early on. It was tedious and rather vulgar in sections.  Perhaps it &#34;took off&#34; later on, but I was not wiling to waste more time on it.

B007SGM084|5.0|As this book has a great story, it is exciting and renewing. Some of what is written has been very taboo and I found that to be the most amazing part, I enjoyed the details of each and every situation. I have read the trilogy twice and will read it again. The writing maynot be outstanding but it is a very captivating story. Look forward to reading it thur Christians eyes. It is my view that this is why I live in America I can read what I want and no ones tells me different.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|A: She was exactly what I expected, based on everything else I've seen her in. She expresses every emotion, whether it's anger, fear, or determination with a look of constipation - furrowed brow, gritting teeth, etc. She does a lot of running in this film, and I have to say that she actually does this well. Perhaps she could find a film where she portrays a marathon runner, and she would probably be praised.<br /><br />Charlize's evil queen is total camp, but she's great. She expresses her evilness with a steely smirk and a slooooow, drawling British accent. Chris Hemsworth is always fun to watch, and he plays the Huntsman with an equal measure of strength and humor. It's very fortunate these two actors are able to balance Stewart's blandness.<br /><br />The special effects are quite stunning, as anyone who saw the trailer already knows. We see too little (pun intended) of the dwarfs, all portrayed by great British actors. They make their appearance pretty late in the film, but add a jolt of fun to a sometimes dark story.<br /><br />This was a decent film, but not one I will watch again.
B00913DPW2|1.0|I love hidden object and puzzle games, this was just terrible. There was no story. I don't need a plot, but a little direction would be nice. I never knew why I was doing anything. I didn't understand what any puzzle had to do with the next or even whatever this is supposed to be about. Getting frustrated with gameplay, I looked for the walkthrough, which clarified nothing. The fact that in game clues were very far between locations was crazy. I found myself going back and forth between 6 rooms just to get hints for a puzzle. Also, the fact that sound is a clue is irritating beyond belief. I commute on a train or am at home, and have the common courtesy to keep the media sound on my phone turned off. I understand that this is a preference, but this is the first time I've got ever come across this issue.<br />I'm so glad that this was a free app of the day, and that I didn't pay for it.<br />I wish I could give it negative stars.

B000GOUMPI|5.0|The Shining is without a doubt the best Horror movie ever made. Even after 30 years, it still is the best. Nicholson is absolutely brilliant in this Steven King classic.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|I read this way back when it first came out and had to read it over again, only this time on my Kindle. Harris' story is a real nailbiter, especially since we all know what's coming! The main character finds himself not only doing his job, but trying to solve the mysterious disappearance of his predecessor, survive attempts on his life, and trying to save the girl. Harris knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat and tells of the disaster so vividly that you feel like you were there.

0061726834|5.0|Delirium is one of those books that I had no interest in reading initially. The plot seemed a bit too familiar and sounded as if it could easily go wrong. Then came the gushing reviews from my fellow bloggers. So what did that make me do? Naturally, I put off reading it even longer (I've since learned to listen to them)! Eventually I gave in and now I can't believe how I could put off reading such a fantastic book!<br /><br />Delirium contained all my favorite elements: A bit of action, a pinch of mystery, a killer ending, and a romance seemingly doomed from the start. Yet, even in the face of that doom, the main character, Lena, maintained hope. There's just something about underdog characters like Lena that I love. They manage to both inspire and intrigue me. Up against all odds, will they make it or break it? You'll have to read this one to find out!<br /><br />Delirium evoked all kinds of emotions: anger, sadness, love, and hope to name a few. Expect a rollercoaster! While, yes, this is a very emotional book, it is none of the fluff that one might expect from reading the blurb. There is legitimate thought and meaning in Delirium! Yes, it is about love, but there is so much more to it!<br /><br />Don't be like me and put off reading Delirium! Life's too short to miss out on the good ones!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Great movie.. I really like this one and another of Robert Duvall's westerns, \\"Broken Trail\\". They bear watching numerous times. There's some great footage in the Special Features of \\"Lonesome Dove\\" that makes one aware of how close they come to reality in this movie. Also, I wondered about the scene where Robert Duvall's horse bucks before he races away from the advancing line of riders. It surely looked like him and not a stunt double... and it WAS him. Genuine buck too! This particular package (movie and specials) is worth adding to the home library.

1455502758|5.0|Hitchens was one of a kind. When you heard him speak, you were struck by his eloquence, wit, and intelligence. When we lost him last year to cancer, it was a sad day for the world. \\"Mortality\\" is a collection of Hitchens' writings during treatment of cancer. The essays, as always, are well-written and go deep to the human condition.<br /><br />It can be read in probably an hour or so, which may seem short, but these are classic Hitchens and we get to peer into what it feels like to know you're going to die.

B000E1YVZU|4.0|I don't get why some people hate this film so much.<br />Yes, the energy is different from the staged production. Yes, some of the shorter songs (voicemails, etc) have now become spoken dialogue--but the changes are all necessary when you go to the medium of film.<br /><br />I think Chris Columbus did a great job, and clearly wanted to celebrate and honor Larson's vision--the man even sought out the original cast (Daphne was pregnant at the time of filming so she couldn't play Mimi, and Fredi Walker thought she was too old to play Joanne) in order to accomplish that goal.<br /><br />Perhaps the studio's error was in cleaning up the sound. The show was such a success because it was so raw and at times unpolished, maybe that's where the film sort of fails--the music is too polished, too clean. Mimi doesn't sound as wild and as desperate to live her life now because she knows death is knocking at her door. (Not knocking Rosario's Mimi, I loved her), Roger isn't as angry, as volatile.<br /><br />With that said, the film was my introduction to RENT and holds a special place in my heart. Since then,I've seen the staged version a number of times at the Nederlander (even saw Adam and Anthony as Roger and Mark) and saw the revival when it was at the New World Stages theater. Each time the energy was different, the portrayals were different --but the message was the same. Life is fleeting. Love now. Live now. Because there is no day but today. And if that message comes through, then the medium RENT is conveyed through, whether film or stage, has done its job.<br />This film does its job.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|So far the season has gotten off to a great start with a return to the gore and suspensful scenes that attracted viewers like myself to the show.
0297859390|3.0|Part of me enjoyed the book, but part of me kept wondering about the level of hostility directed at women. While some of the female characters come off as decent human beings, I couldn't help thinking about some of the bitter guys I know who just keep complaining about those b*tches who've divorced them or who have had the guts to do something other than revolve their lives around men's needs. I'm not saying that the author is suggesting that Nick is a hero, but the fact that the book is told primarily from his point of view seems likely to tip the scales against Amy in ways that may well give aid and comfort to abusers. Certainly, were I an abused wife or girlfriend, I'm pretty sure this book would make me very uncomfortable.

B00280LYIC|4.0|Good young adult novel with an interesting story. It is a very easy read so you will probably fly through it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so awesome everytime I play I feel like I am in anther world because it is so awsome
B008C1O8CA|4.0|Glad to see Green Day has gone back to the old garage sound. Really like this album, but there are a couple of tracks that I feel are just fillers for the album. Crank this up! Great driving music, too!
0425263908|2.0|I was hoping for a great, sexy read.  And there was definitely plenty of sex, but there was just zero substance.  I didn't care about either of the main characters, and there was zero growth from either.  They were predictable, and there was basically no plot.  Just scenes where they had sex, but no overall story.  Very disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My grandaughters and I share the Percy Jackson Series together.  We enjoyed the story and are looking forward to the next installment.  The story is fast paced and really holds their interest and mine.  There was lots of action and adventure that my kindergarten aged grandchild loves and it gives my 5th grade grandchild a great book to read for her daily reading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|enjoyed all three of the books in this trilogy, can't put them down.  Loved the story that EL created, good job.  Heard it was not well written, I did not agreee, I thought it was good.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I read the negative reviews and listened to the raspy-sounding clips.  I bought the recording anyway because I'm a Dylan fan, and a fan of Christmas and Christmas music.  I listened with low expectations.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised, and have been listening to it over and over.  For me, the music is a reflection of Christmas the way it should be . . . heart-felt, uncommercial, not sugar coated.  It has a kind of in-your-face effect, so typical of Bob, but so atypical of most of the Christmas music that's out there.  I loved it.  All of the best Christmas church hymns are included, and they are done with such honesty.  All of the songs reinforce that Christmas is about the birth of Jesus, and people being happy as a result.  You can tell the songs are being sung by a man who truly believes. It's Christmas In the Heart.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|so I bought this app and really liked to play it but then it would go black in the middle of my playing. sorry I'm just going to say it like it is
B008602KQI|3.0|I don't know what it was about the movie, but it just didn't move me like reading the book did.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Adventure(s) like no other. Characters that are both ordinary and unique allowed me to journey into worlds familiar and new. An awesome ride.
B009ESIGHI|1.0|Disney does it again. See the other DVD versions, reviews, forum threads, wikipedia page and other assorted dots from the corners of the internet for information on what, and in particular, why there's a problem. I don't often write reviews but it's ridiculous that this is still an issue and that they'll put more effort into covering their tracks and making the cut less obvious rather than simply using the full, true version and giving the fans what they want. We'll just have to wait and see what the intend to do to the twitching corpse that is the Star Wars franchise... on a topical and mildly related note... Disappointed but not surprised but beings of this manner.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free has made it to all our devices - it's addicting. We've got family members who ask for our devices just so that they can play the game :)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Dickens weaves a wonderful tale about the foibles of human nature, and the true meaning of Christmas. Set in 19th century London, this book describes in great detail the culture of the times,and the traps that we humans fall into in all times when we fail to set the right priorities in life. A classic story of Christmas that will live on forever as a favorite.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a really great movie to start with, but to watch in on the go on my kindle fire was even better. The sound was really great and the quality of the video was even better. The price even macthced well. I am very happy with this viedo
B0090X4GJE|4.0|My prior review is below.  I have now culled out the songs on this disc, I like ... I must say I love them. I find myself listening to them over and over. If you consider the repeated lyrics as a product of Ellie's instrument: her voice, you can get over the repetition.  I am always on the search for what I call \\"life songs.\\"  That is, songs I will like for my entire life.  This disc has at least two. I am warming up to it.<br /><br />____________________________________<br /><br />Even today if you scratch vinyl, you can get the stylus stuck in a groove.  The result is a repeated lyric over and over and over until you make a physical correction.  No doubt about it, Ellie G has an incredible voice, but she needs to find a lyricist to help out to fill in holes with something other than repeated refrains.  Across this album Ellie repeats lyrics over and over to the extent that I can't listen again to a given song.  On the iconic ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN she reminds of of the track title over 20 times.  Halcyon is a great song with a wonderful riff, but she tells us IT'S GONNA BE BETTER 27 times in just a few minutes.  I tried to LET IT GO, LET IT GO, LET IT GO, LET IT GO, LET IT GO ... , but it really doesn't ever get that much better for me. With this talent, I find myself wondering how good it could be if Ellie found her Bernie Taupin.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|This is a great Blade runner edition. It has been digitally restored and remastered incorporating new footage and special effects. The soundtrack is remastered and presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. The 2nd disc has outtakes, deleted scenes, and new interviews. The feature runs 117 minutes. This is the best version of Blade Runner that I have seen. It's definitely worth the few bucks they are asking for it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|The case is simple, no belt clip, velcro closure. I ordered several. It protects my expensive Plantronics Voyager Pro+ very well whcin in my pocket or glovebox or computer bag.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This movie has got it all. Well maybe not comedy, but who cares. By the cover you already know everything you need to. Leo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou deliver a powerful performance worthy of 5 Academy Award Nominations. We all probably remember the influx of refugees form Sierra Leone in the late 1990's some of the stories I heard from those people that were able to make it to America were hard to believe. This movie portrays that civil war very well. It is the story of 2 men that are brought together and risk their lives trying to escape the terrible bloodshed. They have a trump card. A huge diamond. The problem is getting to the right people. They go through hell to protect what they hold dear. This is one of the most powerful movies I've seen since the turn of the century. Please don't miss it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I'm not sure how to rate Adobe Reader.  I use it all the time and have had no problems with it.  It's on my Kindle, my IPhone, my computers.  Well, you can't leave home without it.
B001NT9CW4|5.0|I had the LP(album)many years ago and played it to death.I thought I would try the Amazon MP3 download instead of purchasing the CD disc at a music store.I love it ! It sounds Great!The MP3 tracks include cuts that weren't on album/CD and they are recorded and a higher bit/sample rate making them higher quality.I am most pleased.
B004LUS390|5.0|I absolutely love this App.  I have it on my Kindle and my IPhone.  I'm learning new techniques in drawing, painting, etc.
B009DJB8I2|2.0|I was excited to get this in the mail yesterday and was excited to open it. I saw that the things holding the CDs in were broken and Disc 3 was just flailing about. I can barely close the case at all and the thing was so badly made, that it's ALREADY falling apart. It was only worth it because I got a code for a TF2 item and a Dota 2 invite. I already had Dota 2 though. You can download the soundtrack for free on the Portal website. It really wasn't worth it other than getting the What's in the Portal 2 Soundtrack Box in TF2. I don't even know if you can get it anymore, but oh well. Don't buy this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love being able to pin projects and recies when on the go with my Kindle. The only thing I have trouble with is renaming and editing boards but I'd rather do that on my computer anyway.
B000W9399S|4.0|I went to a pagan gathering where I met an interesting friend named, Wizzard.  He told me of the complexities and fantasy of the disc world.  I had seen the two films based on ,\\"The Comfort of Magic, \\" and \\" The Hog father,\\" but the films do not do the books justice.  If you a different , fun point of view on life read these novels.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Sweet Tooth is not a classic McEwan novel!  Very enjoyable with an amusing twist at the end.  It's sort of Joanna Trollope style, a comment which would probably offend both authors!  It's an undemanding Kindle read for the plane or bedtime.
1432794426|5.0|I strongly recommend this book by Dr. Karen Moriarty to anyone who has ever even heard the name Michael Jackson! This is by far the very best book I have ever read about the man, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson!! Dr. Moriarty presented Michael and his life in a way that I never really heard about. For instance, I knew that Mr. Jackson had been taken to court for many trivial issues, but I didn't realize just how much Michael had to deal with this kind of nonsense. It was practically on a daily basis! How did he have time for his music and the numerous charities he helped to support? He supported so many charities and he did NOT do it for fame and accolades. He supported these charities because he honestly felt that is was what he was put on this Earth to do! He truly felt for the poor and disadvantaged of this world and for the planet itself. This book will open your eyes to the wonderful humanitarian side of the superstar.<br />I'm convinced that anyone who reads this wonderful book, Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy, will come away with a whole new and tremendous respect for Mr. Michael J. Jackson!!<br />Thank you, Dr. Moriarty, for writing this book. I hope all of those who \\"hate\\" Michael will read it and gain a respect for our King of Pop.....King of our Hearts!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like  this game. if any of you people say this game is stupid. oh yaeh I am a boy get items
B001AFF25W|5.0|This is the book that tells what you already know but for some misterious reason you keep forgetting.<br /><br />Then you wonder how you forgot all that stuff. Start taking action and life miraculously begins to smile again.<br />Then again time pass and you need to buy another book like this one.. maybe containing some more philosophy and abstraction but the soul and essense are the same.<br />That's life. :D<br /><br />Love it! I've read. Added the tips to my routine and my life is better than before.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Self Help Author for reminding us what we forget.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|When John Carter came out, it was considered one of the biggest flops of 2012, and arguably of all time.  Evidently much was spent on casting and effects, with not much return.<br /><br />However, I recently watched this film and was pleasantly surprised as to how good the film is.  Based on the Mars novels of Edgar Rice Borroughs (the creator of Tarzan), John Carter is a stirring story with great visuals.<br /><br />The computer effects in this film are amazing.  I have read that the film was made and then adapted to 3D for the theater, which may have made the 3D version lackluster.  However the aliens are fantastic, and the sets, props and vehicles all add to the movie magic.<br /><br />The story is quite exciting, with John, a Civil War veteran in the US, whisked away to a similar civil war on Mars.  John develops super-like powers of quickness and strength with the change in gravity, etc., and assists the oppressed in making a difference in their world.<br /><br />Thus John Carter was an entertaining treat that a lot of people seem to have missed.
B001NBEWN6|1.0|This book came highly recommended and disappointed severely.<br /><br />There are some traces of a plot hidden in the extreme over-abundance of pretentious descriptions, but not enough. The writing style was indulgent and more or less obscured the actual content of the story. The short sentences and sentence fragments that described every event so thoroughly started off alright, but by the second or third chapter I'd seen so many of them that I just longed to see a fully developed sentence. I should have seen that coming from the opening paragraph: \\"The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dustgreen trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute bluebottles hum vacuously in the fruity air.\\" It's just too much, like she wanted to cram every single adjective and adverb she could into these sentences. When you write a book, you don't have to prove that you have a wide vocabulary to this extent.<br /><br />My irritation at the writing only increased as the story went on, and eventually ruined the book for me. The story was weak at best, as if the book were nothing more than a way for Roy to show off all of her big words.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Dark Shadows is a movie reboot of the old soap opera about a supernatural family and their relationships and adventures.<br /><br />Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, a cursed vampire freed from imprisonment after 200 years.  He returns to his family estate and attempts to free his descendants from the curse set upon his house by his spurned lover (who happened to be a witch).<br /><br />Barnabas encounters all of the new technology as \\"magic,\\" with the expected humorous outcomes.  Dark and yet quirky, the film is quite fun, and you develop a sympathy for the vampire and his relatives in escaping the evil punishment.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Tim Burton films, especially those with dark humor like Beetlejuice or the more recent Frankenweenie, you will definitely want to check this film out.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I LOVE this workout video!  It's my favorite of all time.  It's simply a basic, no frills, easy to follow, go-to workout that gets the job done.  After one week I could tell a difference in my arms, abs, legs, and glutes.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Not worth the time.  Not very science oriented. Nothing to think about after being bored to death.  I would rater see the Day Earth Stood Still again.  Or how about 2001.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I'm a fan of all genre's of music. Literally. Opinionated yet unbiased if there is such a thing. I seen Taylor perform at a fair before she recorded anything and before I knew anything about her except her age. She was to be blunt without a singing voice and having problems with timing with her band.<br />  I can LMAO thinking about that. She sets the bar now. Simply amazing. For years she's run her entire world. Tour staff,stage design,show,clothing,when,where and how of everything Taylor. Writes her songs orchestrates her music,sound and finished product.<br /> The line of successful musical artists that have that kind of control are short behind her.<br /> This compilation of diverse songs should not be in the country genre. It's about as far out of that as any other from her. But she isn't the first to break away hard from country. In fact,was she really country in the beginning? I guess it depends on if your old school country or not. I am,and I know that is a losing battle.<br /> This is my favorite Taylor release. It shows so much growth and diversity,but it's not without,\\"Taylor 100%\\",behind every note. Critically. I'm watching and listening now Ms. Swift. And digging what your doing. If you like her musical style,it hasn't changed. It's just blown open like a rose after a summer rain.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Just finished this book. I'm going to start the next one right now. Can't wait to see what happens next
B0086700CM|5.0|Great fun! I love this game! no problems on my kindle fire. I cannot say anything but I was stuck playing it for 2 hours straight!
B004WO9F56|3.0|Amazing concert, good production. I wish it was NTSC video quality. PAL system drop down the picture quality. Of course, if you watch it on a NTSC device you will feel the difference, otherwise you will probably not notice. Tobias Sammet rocks. Good audio quality.<br /><br />I think it should be noted on the description that this Blu Ray is recorded in PAL System. Big mistake!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love them. I can't get enough. The books are long but I'm already hoping the don't end. I have become attached to the carachters.
0345803485|2.0|The best word of advice that I may pass along to you, future purchaser, is that Fifty Shades of Grey should be held with no more esteem than, let's say, a Mc Donalds cheeseburger. The book is cheap, rarely filled with anything substantial, yet you long to have a taste from time to time. The book it's self isn't necessarily something to be loathed for I rather enjoyed the unintentional comedy of it, and in my honesty, it was rather naughty to be reading it in the middle of starbucks on my e-reader. However, what strikes me as most deplorable is the amount of recognition it has received for practically botching the english language.<br /><br />I lament sincerely for those who truly found meaning in a book that wishes it could be more than a scrap of delusional fantasies that make unicorns feel relative.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a perfectly written book. I was engulfed in Suzanne's imagination by page 3 and a half. If it were my name on that cover, I would be OK with never accomplishing a single other thing in my life.
B009AY04A8|5.0|interesting puzzles. some easy some difficult. great game. cant wait for 2nd one. I've loved all games that I have bought from them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a fantastic book and a must read, that is if you have read the first. Even so, I will be forever glad that I did move my mind into the world of Panem for a few days. Could not put it down, I tried. Couldn't.
B008OOYALE|5.0|funfun<br />if you like pet games this is a pretty good one. its a little slow on the time component.  this means you can not get much done at the BEGINNING..
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Loved this movie. Took you right into the intriguing storyline with well played out characters and was true to its claim. Thoroughly enjoyed very bit of it. And of course,Maggie Smith at her finest in these types of films! [[ASIN:B004GEGW44 From Time to Time (Chimneys of Green Knowe) [Reg.2]]]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works absolutely great!!! I love it!!! This is the best calculator app in the market!!! It has every thing you would need for a math class or work!! LOVE IT!!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|i first found this book hard to put down but after reading page after page of nothing but kinky sex, it got a bit too much.  I mean, seriously, how many men can perform numerous times in a matter of hours/minutes?  i've never met one.  I would've liked more story and less sex.  i've got nothing against the kinky sex in the book, it was quite a turn on at times.  other times, like when she lost her virginity & orgasmed. Twice.  are you serious?  Losing your virginity as a female is not fun and it's not pleasant, yet alone having 2 orgasms the first time you've ever had sex.  still, looking forward to reading the next book but i'm not sure how they're going to be able to make a movie out of this book.  If it's not XXX rated, it won't be anywhere near as good as the book.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|The image of Phillipe Petite on the wire between the Twin Towers unites the characters in this book. And what characters they are! The fate of the Twin Towers and 9/11 are never mentioned, but that reality also permeates this book. A must read!
B00005MNP8|5.0|This is an eclectic mix of songs from the late 1970's by Blondie. I think the naivete is sincere as well as the cynicism. It starts out with punk rock and ends in a version of disco. I guess euphoria is right way to describe this album. Eventually there is a comedown on Autoamerican, perhaps their best, but Parallel Lines takes one into a statosphere that one hopes will never end. At least not in this lifetime. It was a precocious album and well ahead of its time, even today. I give it 5 stars!
B0085X31VE|5.0|This album is, in my opinion, album of the year for 2012. Forget Not has quickly turned into my absolute favorite song of all time. The entire album is amazing but Forget Not is one of those songs that you hear for the first time and its a life changing moment.
0071752854|5.0|In 4 lines:<br />Great and clever book about pitching and communication.<br />A MUST READ.<br />And yes, it's against 99% of the books about sales out there...<br />Give it a try... and try how it works... and works!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|While aimed at a younger audience than myself, I still found this to be an entertaining story and very much enjoyed the use of the haunting vintage photographs to illustrate the characters.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Great book that everyone, no matter if you're an entrepreneur, painter, writer, or just someone in search of his/her place in the world, should read.  Highly recommended.  Also recommend Pressfield's other book on the subject, \\"Do The Work.\\"
B00979CS50|4.0|Now we know the real danger of pot smoking, you forget how to end a song. There are some good songs on this cd, but they just go on way too long (Driftin' Back is a good example). I love \\"Ragged Glory\\" and this cd has the same sound and vibe as that great cd, but the songs at this point aren't as good as that earlier cd in my opinion. Maybe they will grow on me.<br />And one last complaint: Could the song lyrics have been printed any smaller? Neil, is that a joke that you are playing on your older fans? It may have seemed funny when you were high, but come on.
B000FC130E|3.0|Unique perspective of another \\"parallel\\" world of London, UK. Nice story. Good read. reason for 3 stars only is because I found myself being able to let go of the story for  a few days if i were too busy with other things in my life. With books i usually label 4-5 stars, i find that i cannot wait to return to the story every single day.
0064430227|5.0|I found this book on a list of Best 100 Books for Toddlers, and I must admit, the list was right.  My 2 1/2 girl and 1 1/2 year old boy love this book and I imagine will keep loving this book for many more years.  Age is best for 2.5-4 year olds. It's definitely one of the longer books we read but they really like it. Also gave as a cute birthday gift with a scratch pad and crayons (thought it was more useful than another random toy).
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best comic book hero movie ever made. To see it in 3D and see my childhood heroes come to life is amazing. If you haven't seen it and you read these comic books as a child, you have to love it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game was a lot of fun to play. I addicted to it! I would recommend it to someone looking for a new game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game! It's fun to play for all ages. This is a game I got fir myself but my kids are loving it aswell. :)
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Really like Amazon video!  The audio problem we had initially was fixed very quickly and the download was excellent!  Waited to see this at home since it was a long movie and being able to pause really a nice feature!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|LOVED IT IT WAS SO GREAT READ IT YOU WONT REGRET IT JUST DO IT ALREADY HANDS DOWN GREAT AMAZING
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|A very interesting show. I watched it all during the week leading to Halloween. It isn't a typical horror littered with jump scares (although there are a couple). There were a couple twist and turns along the way to keep the story interesting. I wasn't completely satisfied by the ending, but I don't hold it against the show. Good endings are hard to come by...
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view. I think she has a fascination with Disney films.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Easily one of the best albums I've ever purchased. Instantly liked the entire album. It's fun, easy to listen to and fun to dance too. Great lyrics too. A bit like Mumford and Sons!
B003UESJF6|5.0|My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view. I think she has a fascination with DreamWork films.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe Reader for Kindle is an excellent application with one exception.  For some pdf files, one can not highlight a partial line.  One can not move the round icons to specify a partial line.  On other pdf files, it works well.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view. I think she has a fascination with DreamWork films.
B005PR2FD8|4.0|DVD game in good condition for used and gives good playback. I recommend buying it as a Tekken fan and the fact that it's a good deal.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view. I think she has a fascination with Disney films.
B007SGM084|4.0|Not going to lie, I picked this trilogy up knowing full well that this wasn't going to be a mentally riveting book that would change the way I view the world. So if you go into these books knowing that you are just reading them for some naughty reading, then you will be very satisfied. The writing quality isn't spectacular or anything (very on par with the Twilight trilogy). I would definitely recommend this set of books to younger women who like the Twilight books. I was told that these were a spin off of some Twilight fan fiction that used to be on a blog, and i can definitely see where that rumor rings true. Being a pretty big Twilight fan myself, it made picking up these books easy and you felt almost like you knew some of the background to the characters before you really get far into the books.<br /><br />So in summary, it's an easy read that delivers on what all the ladies in your office have been gossiping about: A kinky book that has a sex scene in almost every chapter. If you buy these books looking for that kind of content, you will not be disappointed.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is one of those TV shows that keeps you interrested during the entire seasons, guessing whats coming next and which new disney charecter will show up next. If you enjoy the cartoon version of all the disney charecters, then watch this series to see them come alive.
0143113100|5.0|This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I don't usually read non-fiction but this book was fascinating. I enjoyed the personal stories that were contained in each chapter and it helped me to appreciate the saying \\"use it or lose it\\".<br /><br />After reading the book, I recommended it to a number of my friends, especially the ones with children, as it really helps you to appreciate the need to exercise and challenge your mental faculties. I think this is an essential read for anyone working with young children (especially those who deal with special needs children), as well as physiotherapists. The author does an excellent job of highlighting the potential our brains have to heal and to function despite injuries or disabilities.<br /><br />As much as I loved this book, I must admit that it does get a bit tedious towards the last 1/4. Nevertheless, it is a really great book, and I would definitely recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written and keeps the characters real. Reminds me of a cross of “The Most Dangerous Game\\" with “The Running Man“ but in a post-apocalyptic setting.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love it. great app. no need to search through unwanted puzzles at book store or Dept store. keep it up.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|This movie was alright... It had its let downs but it was still a nice way to wrap up a long day. It was visually beautiful and the plot was not too out there. Considering the crap Hollywood is turning out these days this film does not rate a flush in my opinion. Its a good movie.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie is so kick ass!! It was exactly what I was hoping it would be! Not disappointed at all!!!  :)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|True to Jodi Piccoult's form...this book grabbed me from the start and I didn't want to put it down. A sad but believable story of two kids that grow up together and are so close they feel each others pain.
B00932A6G4|4.0|If all the Starship Trooper movies would of been like this, the series would of been much better! I didn't care for the second or third movie. Which is why I give this one four out of five stars.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome app. I cant stop checking it out. Only bad thing is that I never get my work done now, because I'm on pinterest
B006XOBFTM|5.0|The only thing \\"wrong\\" with this set is that it's a German release, and not easy to find in (what's left of) the American marketplace. The 24-bit remastering is not quite a night-and-day level revelation, but it does offer an improvement in fidelity over the previous incarnations of every recording here, and considerably so in the cases of the oldest of them, the symphonies 4 and 5, and ESPECIALLY No. 5 -- and that, in itself, makes the set particularly worthwhile, as Walter's 1947 account of the Mahler 5th has had a complicated, almost star-crossed history up to this time as a recording (even Sony Classical's efforts at an intermediate upgrade in the 1990s had to be re-done AFTER its initial release). As represented here, the Symphony No. 5 finally needs a minimum of apologies for its sound -- for the first time, there is a semblance of richness to go with the clarity of what used to be a thin, very dry sounding recording. The rest is glorious from start to finish, including two renditions of the Symphony No. 1 that are almost as different as night and day -- the savage, furious mono recording with the NY Philharmonic from 1954 versus the more lyrical and reflective stereo recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra from the early 1960s.<br /><br />As to the matter of Walter's age at the time of the later recordings here, and the Philharmonic versus the Columbia Symphony, this is really a non-issue. Yes, Walter had retired in 1956, and suffered serious heart problems that slowed him down. But the offer of the chance to make these recordings, which embodied a series of sessions from 1958 until 1962 (the year of his death), gave him a new lease on his professional life, as well as a final mission, to address the arrival of the then-new medium of stereo sound and leave a legacy that would continue to be heard beyond his own time. He rose to the occasion, as did the players involved. And that brings us to the \\"Columbia Symphony Orchestra\\" as represented here -- it was comprised of many of the finest musicians on the West Coast, a good number of whom gave up higher-paying engagements at the time simply for the opportunity to make these recordings with Walter. And most of them, already at or near the top of their respective professions, outdid themselves -- don't forget that at this time, recording sessions devoted to Mahler's symphonies were rare and special occasions, and that classical recording was only just entering its boom time, when the advent of stereo precipitated the re-recording of virtually every piece of music under the sun that still mattered to audiences in the late 1950s/early 1960s -- at this time, EVERY session was special to some degree, and the quality and musicianship and the outlook of the generation of musicians then participating made recording on repertory like this even more important, as an opportunity that they all knew had eluded their predecessors (and who would ever have thought such opportunities, to record the Mahler 1st or the 9th, yet, would arise on the West Coast, and under this conductor [the man who introduced the 9th to the world, and visa versa]? It was a gift from God for many of those concerned). The tendency wasn't just to rise to the occasion, but to soar wherever possible.<br /><br />Additionally, the rehearsals and the recording schedules were planned specifically so as not to tax the conductor's strength -- as a result, the notion that Walter was bringing less than his optimum energy from that point in his life to the podium is simply not relevant on these performances (and only became a consideration in his final round of recordings, somewhat later than those represented here -- principally one or two Haydn symphonies and the Bruckner Symphony No. 7, if memory serves). For its part, the New York Philharmonic was, of course, a powerhouse ensemble, and there was great and longstanding love between Walter and the players, but there is no reason to look askance at the Columbia Symphony recordings -- they were a true labor of love and a special opportunity for all concerned. Walter went into the latter knowing that these would be his lasting (and last) testament to the world about his way of interpreting the works involved, and given his relationship to the composer and the pieces -- and one must remember that he conducted the premieres of Das Lied Von Der Erde and the Symphony No. 9 in the second decade of the twentieth century -- they can all be regarded as being but a single step away from authoritative, where they are not absolutely the latter. The whole set is magnificent. And that Fifth Symphony is a wonder.<br /><br />It's also a sign of the times we live in that these recordings, which were done primarily with the American listening market in mind -- until the mid-1960s, Columbia Records did not have an overseas operation, and licensed its recordings to Philips Records in Europe (which is how Columbia's Epic label in the US got the work of I Musici and the Concertgebouw Orchestra, in return) -- are being offered in this optimum remastered form to European listeners, and must be imported to the United States. Sony Music in America ought to be ashamed of itself for that decision.ny recordings -- they were a true labor of love and a special opportunity for all concerned.

Even though it costs more than you would actually pay at Target, since I live 60 Miles away from the nearest store, I factored in the price of gas and got it for a steal!<br /><br />That being said, I am really glad I got the deluxe version.  The last 4 songs really feel like they belong on the album, and in my opinion, \\"Run\\" could be released as a single.<br /><br />All in all, this is P!ink, swearing and all, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

B008N5UX9M|3.0|There's a lot of confusion and mixed reviews for this album due to the fact that it's marketed to sell, rather than for accuracy.  This is NOT a Steve Harris solo album (in the same way Iommi's \\"Seventh Star\\" wasn't a Black Sabbath album!) - it's a band called British Lion that Steve Harris is playing with, which is released under Harris's name because that will increase exposure and sales.  He shares songwriting credits and plays bass on it, but his presence in the overall musical product is not very prominent - for the most part, what we have here is a modern-sounding hard rock band.  There are a few instrumental sections that hint at Iron Maiden, but if I heard this album not knowing Steve Harris was involved, I wouldn't really think they were Iron Maidenish!  A number of people have mentioned it sounding like classic 70s rock, but to my ears it just reminds me of modern hard rock (with some classic hard rock/metal influences). People have also mentioned the \\"weak vocals\\" - they're certainly not up to par with a full-throated classic metal (or power metal) singer, but they're pretty decent for modern rock vocals.  Overall, even though I haven't bothered with modern mainstream music since the 80s (I listen to modern bands who are as good as Maiden was in the 80s, not the heirs to the pop-metal scene), I rather like this album - it's not in the league or style of Iron Maiden, but it's a pretty good rock album.<br />  So, don't expect anything Iron Maidenish - fans of Iron Maiden solo projects could compare this to Bruce's \\"Tattooed Millionaire\\" and Skunkworks or Adrian Smith's side projects ASAP and Psycho Motel's \\"Welcome to the World\\" as an example of an Iron Maiden member trying something a little more mainstream and modern outside Iron Maiden.  Listen to the song samples before buying!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I've been using Avast as my ONLY anti-virus software on all my pc's since a friend who is a computer genious recommended it to me back in 2005.  This purchase was from the Amazon store for my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />All I can say is, AVAST is fantastic!  It works smoothly, doesn't hog your memory the way costlier big-name anti-virus programs do, and I have NEVER had an infection since installing it (currently on 5 pcs, 1 laptop, my smartphone, and now my tablet too - as well as on 4 previous pc's) even though I'm online about 18 hrs/day, including gaming, social networking and more.<br /><br />Most of all, IT'S FREE!!  The truth is, it's kind of amazing that there is a free anti-virus program out there that does a BETTER job than those who charge a monthly or annual fee... but AVAST does just that!!

B0060MYM3S|5.0|My review of the previous season of GAME OF THRONES was that it was really good, but did have some glaring problems, such as how the characters of the Lannisters, particularly Jaime, who just seemed to be, for the most part, intensely unlikable villains with no real reason to exist other than to hate.<br /><br />I was very glad to see that problem was cleared up in the second season, which is superior to the first in just about every way.<br /><br />I might get into some spoiler-ish territory here, so tread lightly.<br /><br />Now, I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books, so I'm not going to get too heavily into specifics of what I think didn't work, because there still were some problems. The most glaring issue to me was that of the relationship between Robb and Talisa, but there's so much going on here that I'm willing to overlook the speed in which their relationship grows from slightly adversarial to nuptual. I'm assuming that certain plot points needed to be handled with a degree of expediancy to catch up with the rest of the story, which is unfolding slower in some areas but with greater effect.<br /><br />The change of allegiance of Theon Greyjoy also seems a tad forced from a dramatic point of view, but again, this could very much be a product of the world these characters live in, rather than a more modern world.<br /><br />The adventure of Jon Snow beyond the Wall is really riveting, and I'm very much looking forward to the appearance of Mance Rayder.<br /><br />The various troubles of of Arya and Sansa are also very compelling, and I am absolutely in love with Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister.<br /><br />Of course, while the cast does really compelling work, it's ultimately raised to that AMAZEBALLS level by Peter Dinklage, fully embracing his top billing on the program and episode after episode crushing the role of Tyrion Lannister. While his work continues to stun, also much credit needs to go to Alan Taylor, director of many of the episodes of this show. While he's now just breaking into feature films with the next THOR feature, we have a veteran of feature film coming and lending his expertise to what is by far the best episode of this season.<br /><br />That director is Neil Marshall (DOG SOLDIERS, THE DESCENT, DOOMSDAY, CENTURION) and that episode is \\"Blackwater\\" as the forces of Stannis Baratheon begin their siege of King's Landing. It hits every beat it needs to, from the actual assault to Tyrion's St. Crispin's Day speech to the breathless last moments of the episode with Cersei, and it does it with such cinematic assurance that it's an award-worthy piece of directing.<br /><br />Also a big step up for the show is making Cersei and Jaime a little more three-dimensional (even though Jaime is still a tad less crisply characterized), and that's due in large part to Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Also still bringing majesty to her role is Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, and Iain Glen as her most-trusted aide Ser Jorah is excellent as well.<br /><br />All we have to do now as viewers is hunker down and wait, since winter is coming.or of many of the episodes of this show.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was very surprised at how good this book was.  Nice to get a first hand look rather than news!
B007TK77QE|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is not a story about a magical place, or an exciting adventure full of action. It is one that is firmly centred around the book's characters.<br /><br />The death of Barry Fairbrother, a councillor in a small town, unravels the lives of people that he came into contact with. The impact of Barry's death on individuals within the community that he was part of is told in a 'warts and all' style.<br /><br />The story cleverly shows how everyday lives within a community can be so intertwined, without the people realising. Everyone has their place, their routine, their status, and everyone has their own spin on things around them. Normally, these opinions and beliefs lie hidden under the surface of happy daily life.<br /><br />Barry's death opens this can of worms. Family turmoil, personal demons, lingering prejudices and different opinions bubble to the surface, as townsfolk scramble to win his vacated seat on the council. To succeed, would provide them with the power to set things in place that are in line with their own preferences.<br /><br />There were definitely plenty of cringe-worthy moments in this book, some of which I didn't really enjoy. But, the fact that they triggered such a strong reaction from me is evidence of clever writing. The foul language was plentiful, and although it was there to show the essence of the seedier characters, I felt there was too much (maybe I'm getting old and prudish!).<br /><br />In my opinion, the last fifty pages in the book were the best, but I have to add that all the pages before were completely necessary to build the overall story. I'm trying hard not to include any spoilers in this review. I can say that I was engrossed in the story, it's characters and messages ... and I was truly affected by the outcome.<br /><br />J.K. has swung this book to be as opposite to Harry Potter as she could. Not everyone will like it, but I'm confident that most readers will.<br />flag

B005LAJ212|2.0|Okay, I did a rare thing and watched a show I didnt care for AGAIN. Everyone getting onto me about \\"oh how could you not like this show? Its about a little girl who gets her Dad taken away from her! (now considering that I cant stand kids, my reply is a quick \\"Good!\\" But hey, a lot of you out there dont hold the same dislike for those little pains in the butt that I do so I'll try to look at it from a neutral standpoint. a guy gets killed at the beginning. We dont know who it is they wont tell us. We have to figure it out for ourselves. We can only assume its the guy Emily is suppose to be marrying (they are getting married, right?). Then we see a little girl at a beach house (im guessing this is Emily as a child?)Then a bit later we see a video being played which again (assuming) that this is a news cast of Emily's Dad being arrested or whatever turns out he was responsible for some terrorist act or something that caused a plane to crash and kill everyone. The company he worked for turned him in and I guess little Miss Emily is mad about that. Now, theres nothing that I saw that said the guy was innocent. This is just something you have to assume. I dont like assumptions. So here you have the majority saying the guy did it, there was obviously a trial and he was found guilty, and he died in prison. Now, maybe he was innocent. Maybe he was framed idk. But im sorry I just cant get into this show. Too many assumptions have to be made and they have to be made a certain way. Im sorry but I need more heck a lot more than subtle hints being thrown out at me. I need more than facial grimaces and shoulder shrugs. I cant read a person by the way they hold their cell phone. Perhaps this isnt a show for middle age ppl but rather the 20-ish crowd. Heck the way I see it, if the guy was framed and those ppl had something to do with it, she lost her Dad and that family lost their son. Theres your revenge right there. It isnt going to bring your Dad back so just let it go. Youve both lost so now move on. Besides, Romans 12:19 \\"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\\"<br /><br />Like this show if you wish, but as a person that doesnt care for kids to begin with and doesnt come from a tight-knit family, this show just didnt appeal to me.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|I didn't go see this in the movie theatre, but I got enough word-of-mouth raves from friends to buy the DVD, sight unseen.  I was not disappointed, but more so from the beautiful filming and special effects in the movie rather than the plot.<br /><br />This re-envisioning of the Snow White fairytale has the Evil Queen imprisoning her for years while she undermines and controls the kingdom.  Snow White escapes into a dark enchanted forest where just about everything is out to drug or kill you and the Queen sends out a Huntsman (a drunken man who recently lost his wife) to bring her back.  Of course, he ends up on her side and there is the love interest between them that never really materializes (will there be another movie for that?).  There's also a nobleman who knew the princess as a young girl who still has a thing for her, but that whole subplot really goes nowhere.  Maybe, they just didn't have the time for it in leading up to all of the action.  The thing that struck me as the strangest, however, was having Snow White say a Catholic prayer in one scene...since there was no other religious element in the movie save the covert pagan one of having Snow White meet the Lord of the Forest.<br /><br />The Evil Queen's reasons for why she sucks the life out of people and lands is explained, at the very least...making her slightly sympathetic.  Snow White is sort of an enigma, as you feel like you really don't get to know her.  Other than that, the movie is filled with small faeries that shimmer with pixie dust, the traditional troll/bridge, and (of course) the Seven Dwarves.  They are one of the best things in the movie, the most human in some ways.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad movie but not the best.  Worth owning if you like fantasy movies with some nice special effects mixed in with some action scenes.

0756405890|2.0|As a first novel, Patrick Rothfuss has really set the bar high for himself with The Name of the Wind. As a fantasy novel in general, Rothfuss has created a wandering and wordy tale that leaves me wondering if I want more.<br /><br />The first of a planned trilogy (I suspect this will become one of the four- or five-book trilogies that seem pervasive in fantasy now), the tale of Kvothe is at its heart a rather typical tale of a young boy, overly-gifted in numerous ways, who sets out on a quest to defeat an unknown evil. At parts it reminded me of Ender's Game/Shadow, with a very precocious young protagonist setting out on his own and facing seemingly insurmountable hardships. Then he finds himself in magic school, an experience somewhere in between the uplifting journey of Harry Potter and the sobering realities of The Magicians (Lev Grossman). Unfortunately, by the end of 700 pages, it seemed we had hardly progressed beyond where we knew we were going since the first few chapters.<br /><br />The plot is fairly insubstantial, mostly driven by fetch quests and getting sidetracked. The beginning of the novel felt more focused than the end, which gave the impression of telling a story for the sake of telling a story. The characters are similarly lacking. Kvothe is gifted, sure - I have no problem with that. In fact I am used to it, I expect it, and I like it. But his endless pride and cocksure attitude eventually gets to be grating. His friends in magic school only show up when they are needed in the story and don't seem to exist outside of Kvothe's proximity. They have no trials or tribulations of their own and bring nothing to the table. His social foes in the school are mindlessly out to get him for no reason other than to provide conflict. In the end, the story just doesn't feel natural because there are no real characters outside of Kvothe. It doesn't flow well - it just goes.<br /><br />The saving grace of this book is Rothfuss' prose. He is clearly a talented writer. His plotting and characters, not so great. But his prose in general is very satisfying. I think there is a great story in this book, but it is hidden under some debris. I have seen in some interviews where he talks about his publisher allowing him to publish whatever length book he wanted as a first novel. In this, I think they did him a disservice. A keen editor could have turned this promising but flawed tome into a book of real, long-lasting merit.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something fun to read, go ahead and read this. If you're craving something really special, I don't think this is it.
B000000OPU|5.0|I don't compare Peter Gabriel's solo efforts with his Genesis days.  Yes, same person but two different beasts - and very good ones at that.<br /><br />Having grown up in the 1980s, \\"So\\" was my introduction to the music of Gabriel.  How many times did I hear \\"Sledgehammer,\\" \\"In Your Eyes,\\" and \\"Big Time\\" on the radio and see the videos for \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\" on MTV?  For some reason, I never got tired of hearing his music or seeing his videos.  I loved the abstract nature of his videos and I can listen to his lyrics with a more mature ear all these years later and truly appreciate the timelessness of this album even moreso.  The melodies are pure genius.<br /><br />It's rare for me that I like entire albums, but \\"So\\" has really grown on me and I can now include it on my list of albums that all I need to do is \\"just push play\\" and never have to worry about mediocrity for the duration.<br /><br />I love \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\" (and how true it is that \\"...no one wants you when you lose\\").<br /><br />Peter Gabriel is a musical genius.

B0020MMBCG|1.0|As a general rule, I just buy a book after looking into the relevant reviews readers submit at Amazon. In fact, those reviews were quite favorable, so that I purchased the above book.<br /><br />Please, imagine a presentation book that it is not well presented... Well, this is the case of the above book. Such book contains many flaws. One is concerned with the author's drawings which lack quality and clarity. By the way, a 7-year old person draws better than the author! Another flaw is that many ideas are repetitive along the book. Besides, the book could have been written using much fewer pages without any substantial loss (one reviewer commented that the book could be written on a piece of napkin). On page 14, believe it or not, Roam stated that \\"We can solve problems with pictures\\"! This is a new revolutionary method for problem solving that I have never heard about before!<br /><br />It is just puzzling why \\"The Back of the Napkin\\" received so many favorable reviews...

0670023329|4.0|I am genuinely reluctant to admit that I found this book so compelling.  It seems positively indecent to have taken any kind of pleasure from reading about such monstrous brutality inflicted on so massive a scale.  Shin was but one of hundreds of thousands of \\"political\\" prisoners inhabiting the labour camps whose existence North Korea continues to deny.<br /><br />Born into a life of slavery, Shin endures unimaginably execrable treatment.  Tortured as a teenager, his abdomen was pierced with a grappling hook while suspended over a coal fire until his flesh sizzled. A guard cuts off one of his fingers as punishment for dropping a sewing machine. As with all prisoners, he suffered the labours of Hercules while subsisting on a starvation diet that led him to eat rats, snakes, insects and the occasional grain of undigested corn harvested from cow dung. And yet, according to some observers, Shin's life was remarkably comfortable for Camp 14.  He certainly fared better than a six-year old classmate who was beaten to death with a chalkboard pointer for concealing five kernels of corn in her pocket.<br /><br />After his remarkable escape, Shin's understandably difficult adjustment to the outside world, about which he knew almost nothing, also makes for a fascinating story, one which is still unfolding even years after obtaining his freedom.<br /><br />This is a sobering story, especially considering that the horrors therein described continue unabated.  Whatever your station in life, you will feel better about it after reading this book.
B000007R0S|5.0|I have a 9.1 system and after listening through several DTS dvd's, Blu rays, SACDs from several other artists, this remains the BEST product that I have appreciated. It gracefully makes use of all the channels (extended to the rears). Most other concert DVDs only use the rear surrounds (and rears) for ambient audience reaction. This uses all channels to dramatic effect, esp considering the range of the music and instrumentation. I just hope to see other productions rise to this standard soon.
1451662432|3.0|I followed Arnold's career when I first saw him in a magazine many years ago and saw him and others in various competitions.  His life story is amazing and an inspiration but the book is not as interesting as it could be and it is filled with cussing.  If he intended the book to inspire 'kid's then why the rough language?  Yes, it is the way they spoke but there are ways around the rough language when 'recalling' it.  Second, it appears that the book is a public apology for his behavior as a father and husband.<br /><br />The book does have merit and his life proves that the United states is still a country of great opportunity!

B007THA4FI|2.0|Casual Vacancy  by J.K. Rowling, my kindle edition.<br /><br />This book was very disappointing.  I am an avid Harry Potter's fan and expected far better in this her first book after the series.  It was slow and did not go from character plot to character plot smoothly.  I'm sorry, but I found it boring!  I give it 2 stars.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this book.It's not a book that you just can't put down but read and relax..The book has a great story line. If you have seen the movie and not read the book then you are missing out.The book brings the story to life with so much more detail than the movie.I was dissapointed in the movie that I just rented. Read the book it's a good one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome. it is challenging but fun. I never regret getting this game. I would get this game every time when it is offered.
B008KE3960|3.0|I enjoy the game, but this first-day release is crashing on my LG-P925 phone every time I play the basic Grass map starting as a Rookie.  It crashes with an error message after there are 3 to 5 planes at levels 2 to 3.  I hope that the bug is fixed in the next release.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love all the different dragon you can collect. I also love the fact you don't need to spend real money to get gold. just have some friends.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love dragons.(in general)most of the dragons are pretty cool, some are childish.It takes patience, but worth the wait when you get cool ones.sometimes it takes multiple tries to get what your trying for, but I'm still enjoying the game after 2 months of breeding and feeding dragons.I suggest you try it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm for waking, medicine reminders and more.  The many different settings and multiple alarm set up is why.  Setting music as the alarm sound would be a bonus.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have not been able to figure out how to get past certain levels, get power ups or another character.  I usually don't have time to play these games though to figure it out. Overall it is a fun game I'd recommend.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|this was great. blu ray looked great. and the features were darn good but this is usual for DC Films
B000SEJHRA|4.0|This was my first exposure to his writing. It took me a few chapters to warmup to his humor and not feel guilty for laughing at some of his painful experiences. I went back and re-read those first few chapters after I completed the book and it was much funnier to me the second time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|and it's free! I use it everyday for work,  never had a problem or a glitch. Highly recommended for a quick alarm fix.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It is alwaysnampleasure to read a book by this author.  So far I have read almost all of his books.  It is a joy and pleasure to read his books.  Great insight into the ins and outs of the<br />Aw.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book!!! I could hardly put it down. It only took me a weekend to finish it. Going to start the next book tomorrow, can't wait!!
B005F3XV62|3.0|This is a fun movie to watch with kids...nothing too serious to worry about.  I enjoyed this movie when I wasn't committed to watching a serious flick.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Being of a more mature age was very skeptical about reading this book, thinking it was more for the young ones.  However I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is well written, and kept me enthralled until the end.  I have now downloaded the 2nd book in the series.
B008L34P2C|3.0|The first Ghost Rider was okay, and so was this one; anyone expecting a great film from Nicholas Cage is silly.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very entertaining and informative. I had no idea what is the day to day of a SEAL, now I know. Impressive what you have to go through to qualify
0385344228|4.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay was a thought-provoking, engaging mystery/ psychological legal thriller. An assistant DA's only child, his fourteen year old son, Jacob, was accused of brutally stabbing a classmate in the woods close to school. Jacob's  father who initially headed the team investigating the murder, unconditionally believed in his child's innocence even when there was questionable evidence uncovered. The accusation unraveled their relationships with family and friends. Loyalties were questioned. Bonds were tested. Their once seemingly perfect life destroyed.<br /><br />I thought the story was very realistically portrayed. Jacob acted and sounded like a fourteen year old boy, with all of the sullenness, solitariness, and moodiness that many teenagers experience, one moment being belligerent and the next acting like a little boy. I could understand the parents' desire to believe their son, but also their confusion and fear about knowing the truth.<br /><br />I wish there had been a chapter or two from Jacob's own voice. Most of the story is told from the dad's perspective, although there are revelations from Jacob's mom too.<br /><br />Most of the story reads like a courtroom transcription. However, the novel would periodically break from the transcription style to allow the father to fill in some gaps and provide some details to the events being discussed. I had to adjust to the writing style, but despite my initial struggle with it, I thought the book was exceptional.<br /><br />The subject matter was not an easy one, especially for those who are parents. The idea that parents with the best of intentions, who provided unconditional love and support, may not impact their child positively or for that matter, in anyway at all, is frightening. Further, doing your best may not be good enough or make any difference. The idea that involved parents may not truly know their child and the life that he or she lives shatters the belief that love conquers all and that everything can be made right with love. The novel highlighted that a good life is fragile and should not be taken for granted; things can change in a minute regardless of best efforts. It was an unsettling message. The story-line sticks with the reader and doesn't let go, thereby making for a great discussion.<br /><br />If given the option, I would have rated this book with 4 1/2 stars. I highly recommend this book.
B000I9X67W|4.0|Loved this movie when it first came out and I watched it with our boys.  I have recommended it to several friends who want to watch a good movie with no drugs, violence, sex, etc.  I purchased this as a gift as well for my mother-in-law, who loves movies but would miss a lot of good ones if we didn't screen them first.  \\"Drumline\\" is full of drama, talent, and a piece that the entire family can enjoy.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book has inspired me to be a better christian, husband, father, and all-around better person...<br />If more people lived like Adam Brown this world would be a better place.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i like it. its exactly like the facebook game. it would be better if i couldbe on the same level as the facebook game
B000W25JUW|5.0|Listening to each of these tracks provides the stimulus that returns me to my misspent youth. Sitting in the living room on Laura Avenue at 3:00 in the morning, after the bars closed, rolling a fatty. Oh to be 23 and know it all again.
1567184855|4.0|I love this book.  Having lost a teenage son two years ago, I am always looking for answers and insight into life after death.<br />This book really gave me comfort and hope. My only complaint was that it had two pages missing. Other than that the book was in good condition.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is better than Alantic City.  You do not loose any Cash!  Win the prize and turn it in for cash to play more.  The best thing is the cash is not coming out of your pocket!  Love It!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|amazing!!! This book was so much better than its movie,but that isn't very surprising! I can't wait to read the second one
B00280LYIC|4.0|Good book! Love that its Greek facts are true. I will read the next book. Looking forward to it. Thanks.
034552554X|5.0|I recommended this book for our book club.  Everyone loved it. I even bought this for a friend. I couldn't put it down and I will read it again.
0810996596|5.0|If you love monster toys, posters, and beautifully made books, then you have to buy this one. You can tell Kirk loves his collection by his enthusiasm and great memories they provide for him. My absolute favorite book in my collection!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob was our book club pick. It kept me intrigued and I cared about the characters.  It's a page turner. I did not love the ending!
B009SCRERI|5.0|I am a dyed-in-the-wool Tink fan.  Ever have been since I first read \\"Peter Pan\\".<br /><br />Of course I'm also an avid Tinkerbell collector as well.<br /><br />Of the 4 movies, this is by far the best of the bunch.  Great story line that constantly moves forward.  Tink really shows the heroine part of her as well but thanks to Periwinkle, all things turn out for the best.  Just goes to show how important family really is to all of us.<br /><br />Great job on the new fairies and voicings.  The score is also VERY good, truly worthy of a symphony orchestra.  The songs...well...they are passable and the worst part of the movie.  Fortunately, there aren't too many of them.  Incidental music belongs incidental to the movie, not as the soundtrack.  Thank you Disney for realizing this.<br /><br />I rented this at first, watched it 5 times and then bought it.  Like a good book, I still can't put it down!<br /><br />For the child in all of us that still believes (clap those hands), this is the perfect Tinkerbell movie.<br /><br />My ONLY question though.  If Tink and Peri are sisters...why is Peri so super model skinny?
B00992CF6W|3.0|Love Minecraft but the pocket edition is still really limited... Hope to see more updates in the future like the full version gets.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|this was the best alarm clock i have found. it will wake you up especially if you have to solve math problem
B008OOYALE|5.0|Totally addictive. Never know what your going to get.  Takes time, but thoroughly enjoyable.  Have many friends and family members of all ages playing and loving it.
B007REV4T8|2.0|Having sat through the movie, the plot is barely developed for more than a few minutes. The rest of the time are chase scenes that move through traffic tunnels in Shanghai to gambling in Macau. The whole thing seems to be one dimensional.  Now if you are a teenager maybe that is fine.<br /><br />The filming is excellent with good camera angles. Both girls are boring and one dimensiosall<br /><br />The biggest problem is the boring nature of the whole experience.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|tide is the best u can tell the weather and u can have more than 100 locations:)so u shoes by thanks. 4 reading
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|Okay,so I only tried watching the first episode so take this with a grain of salt...  I've read the first few books in the series and was intrigued by the thought of watching the show.  Unfortunately, in creating the show they have focused more on porn than on actually writing a good screen play or having quality acting.  I'm not that much of a prude but the amount of sex/nudity was a bit excessive.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Ed Sherran's album + is unbelievable.  It is so amazing.  His voice is so pure, his songs just speak to you.  I would recommend  this album to anyone with great music taste.  He has an amazing and natural ability..
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I really loved this one! The special effects are as great as the performances(Andy Serkis shines as Ceasar). It is a detailed explanation for what happened before the original.
B0098VXE50|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I gave it 5 stars because I felt it delivered in all<br />areas of entertainment.  I don't see how it could have been any better.  Acting and<br />visual effects, story-line, etc. was all excellent in my opinion.
0345529057|5.0|The product is exactly as the description. No misplaced pages or anything wrong as written in the reviews before. Thank god. The used glue has a quality according to the price for all 4 books, so if you want a more resistant book you has to buy a more expensive one. But for one or two readings it is sufficient.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is one of those books that pick you up, whisk you along, and make you sad when it's over. God bless all our men and women in uniform!
B000V697WK|5.0|I always liked all steely dan does and this is just another installment in a long list of steely dan hits
B009B8YZKS|3.0|Forward Unto Dawn is a Halo 4 \\"prequel\\" live-action movie that sets things up for the Halo 4 game to give you a little more understanding about characters that will appear in Halo 4 and to give back story about the origins of the Covenant attacks on Earth.<br /><br />Quality wise, it's pretty darn nice looking, but it isn't until the final act when things really ramp up, Master Chief makes his entrance and the battles take place.  Up until that point, we are presented with a pretty basic coming-of-age story of a group of young spoiled kids whose parents are rich dignitaries and social elites.  The main character can't stop thinking about his older brother, an OSDT, killed in battle.  The blossoming love story of two of the main characters, etc.  Honestly, it feels like I was watching a Beverly Hills 90210 episode, with all the sad expressions and angst.  They should have called this series \\"HALO210\\".<br /><br />In the final act, the action ramps up, Master Chief blasts his way in to save what remains of the group so they can survive to grow older and take place in the events of Halo 4.<br /><br />Technically it looks fantastic (with some slight obvious CGI elements) and once Master Chief shows up it's well done.<br /><br />While I will be getting this because it's included in the Deluxe Edition of Halo 4, I will skip the first 60 or so minutes and fire up the chapters where Master Chief saves the day and when the action starts.  The rest belongs on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Great idea, good execution, horrible angst-filled story.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|It seems my 40th year of life is a golden one. I've learned and experienced and been exposed to new things, new to me, ones I cannot believe I did not know before now. Phantom is one of the spectacular experiences. For that is what it is. I first saw the movie purely by accident as my teenager recorded it on the DVR and I happened to select it rather than one of my shows. I was in it before I knew what happened! I watched it twice that night. The next night I invited her to watch it with me-she fell asleep halfway through and woke to me yet again dabbing my eyes and sighing loudly. Oh to have been led downward by Gerard Butler...<br /><br />My family was blessed with a vacation to Las Vagas and I was beyond excited to experience the Phantom at the Venetian. It did not disappoint. I was surprised by the different nuances seeing it live and in a different manner. It was SPECTACULAR! and I wish I had been able to see it every night I was in Vegas.<br /><br />My husband surprised me with this Live at Albert Hall recording. He also was very impressed with the Vegas show and thought this would be a great gift. HE WAS SO RIGHT! I HAVE THE GREATEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD!!! This is our very favorite version. The Phantom performance elicited our most heart-wrenching sympathy. The conflict in Christine was most-relatable. We have a 10-foot screen and projector in our \\"movieroom\\" (entire downstairs)and a high-end surround sound system and I cannot imagine a better way to experience this MASTERPIECE! Yes, the man had everything set up complete with chinese take-out and all refreshments. GREATEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD!!!<br /><br />Buy it. YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!
B0047S1KMS|5.0|I'm not the biggest zombie fanatic, but I do enjoy my zombie movies, my zombie comics and my zombie video games, and Dead Set is a *fantastic* television mini-series (or extended movie - depends on how you want to look at it) that broadcast in the UK and never seemed to make its way over here to the US.  I only saw it because a friend picked up the DVD and made us watch it one evening, and I'm very grateful she did, because it was stellar.<br /><br />This show mixes the horrible \\"reality television\\" fad that seems like it will never die, with ZOMBIES!  Cast and crew get chomped, chopped, sliced and stabbed while trying to survive the Zombie Apocalypse which has finally happened outside their secluded \\"Big Brother\\" set.  While the world falls apart, the cast and crew are not aware of what is going out until the last moment.<br /><br />Great ridiculous characters, good amounts of gore, and people it realistic situations (hello, the bucket scene!) make this a fantastic way to spend a few zombie filled hours.  A pretty good ending as well.<br /><br />Why this hasn't been released in the US is a crime and a shame.  Hopefully someone will get their act together and release it stateside.<br /><br />Good stuff.  Worth the price of the all-region NTSC widescreen dvd.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Everything involved with the purchase went perfect.  The product arrived on the day of release and was exactly as advertised.
B009329Y30|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and have read almost all of his books and seen all the movies!  The Lucky One is by far the best movie based on Sparks books.  I loved this movie, unlike the others, this movie is so much like the book.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|I don't understand. I don't understand, why this has so many great reviews.  I have read Frankenstein, I have read Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Hardy. Some of the best Victorian writers and I don't find this book to be that well written.  I honestly have to say, I find it so excrutiatingly boring, dull, poorly written that I can't get past forty pages.  Frankestein is great! I will die happy knowing that I have never read this hideously boring book!!!
B003L20IHE|3.0|I heard good things about this movie so I thought I'd give it a chance.  It's ok, I'd watch it again if there wasn't anything else on tv.
B005USZYDU|5.0|There is a major problem in Stratenberg, a man is about to get away with murder.  There's one witness that nobody knows about though.  Find out how Theo can save the day in Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I watched the movie before reading the book, I wish I had did it the other way around but anyway I loved both. Yes, Rachel falls for her BFF boyfriend but she feels extremely guilty but sometimes things do happen when we don't want them too but you just can't help to love all the characters in this movie.  Loved It!
B003B02O14|3.0|I bought this book a year ago, it was on my to-Read-list but life happened to prevent me to complete it and now I have time to catch up John Grisham book.<br /><br />I was cheering for Patrick the whole story of all the plots he has been planning to get his life free, then he got it but suddenly the ending happened. What?!<br />The Eva character is not make sense at the end. I hope he will get the happy ending at the end after all of the things he endure. I cried at the end. He deserved love, not brokenhearted.<br /><br />Now I need to read other book, the happy one to clear my sad mood.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use Dropbox every single day for school, pictures, and any other documents I need to save.

B000W93CHC|3.0|A change of subject for Ken Follett. Interesting read, but I felt the characters lacked depth. Despite that, I kept picking the Kindle back up to see what happened next.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A very interesting book which deals with extremely deep topics such as abortion, drugs, alcohol, and the troubles of being a teenager.
1591391105|4.0|This is the best book on the subject I've read dealing with taking over a job as a new manager. It's comprehensive for all levels between first-level manager and CEO, and it's applicable to all industries and functional areas. It therefore obviously falls short of being specific for every manager's given situation, which forces the reader to filter out about 20% of the content. But this need to filter creates the desired effect of forcing the reader to think about the challenges of his or her next job while setting aside the parts that don't apply.<br /><br />Some of the diagrams are over-simplistic and of no practical use, but they all help stimulate thoughts to help the lessons sink in.<br /><br />The author identifies the pitfalls most managers make during transition and then offers insightful steps on how to navigate those early months. For most readers, there will be critical `aha' insights, and this book can serve as a planning reference for every new manager.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I find this book rather amazing. The title is good and it snaps my attention. The storytelling is great, easy to read. But what I missed are the real medical arguments and evidence. I'm not convinced that there's a afterlife just yet. But it grasped my attention, because I want to read more about it. So that's why 3 stars.
B002OPZ37E|5.0|This album is an amazing album. I have already moshed to like all of these songs so hearing the actual tracks makes me feel proud that I went to the concert. The shipping was fast so I got it in two days and was able to pop the CD right in the player and head-bang like a boss.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Fantastic book! Best one so far. I would recommend the entire series to anyone who asks, and this has by far been my favorite book.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Sean Connery & Daniel Craig two best Bonds of all time.<br />First 4 Connery Bond films and the first 2 Craig films have the most plausible plots,<br />for \\"secret agent\\"/action films. All the others drifted far from that.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a classic Nelson DeMille (John Corey) read.  It book ended leaving a lot of hooks for future John Corey and Kate Mayfield books.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Don't listen to the negative reviews as they probably didn't read the book.  I thought the book was another good Reacher book.  Sure, it might be slightly different from the rest but you wouldn't want them all to be the same.  Just my opinion.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved Bared to you and this is just as good. It's being compared to fifty shades but it is much better written and the characters much stronger. I can't wait for the last book but I don't want the story to end! I get the possessive nature of the relationship and wish men like Gideon really did exist (without all the messed up past that is)!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love the games -addicting and you can level up pretty fast ! after awhile you just want you just want yo make sure you beat every game :)
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I felt the book was disappointing, not at all up to the level of quality and enjoyment I've experienced and come to expect in many of the Patricia Cornwell's earlier Scarpetta novels.<br /><br />The story or plot, I think was a good one however,It seemed at times the author was using technical information and reaching back to earlier novels simply for fill rather than developing the characters, who often seemed flat, and enhancing the story line which seemed to drag at times.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins is, probably, one of the brightest minds of our age. The best example of science writing. Letting be well known when his statements are proven by science, and when they are merely a possibility, Dawkins don't pretend to know what he doesn't. A very rational aproach to one of the most central aspects of human life. He is able to give the most consistent answers to date, to a lot of questions as for example: why the \\"moral\\" probably came from the natural selection and not religion?. He debunks a series of myths and superstitions, that still harm a lot of people every single day in this world. He shows the readers that one doesn't need religion to be \\"happy\\" or \\"good\\"; on the contrary, religion can make good persons do \\"bad\\" things. A very big step into enlightenment.
1401322786|5.0|Great book that brings about a new outlook after every time you read it. Helps peel away the layers and gets to some of the real philosophical issues we are dealing with today.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was really drawn into these characters. I already got the second book and finished it, too.  It was very well written.  Appropriate for younger readers.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game....it is very addicting!<br />I highly recommend Temple Run, as it is very challenging game.<br />The only bad thing about this game is...It keeps me from doing my chores!!!If that's really a bad thing?
030746363X|5.0|Very informative and chapters broken down into understandable and easy to read. Fun and some very descriptive! Easy to refer back too and follow!
B003XD7ECI|1.0|Being a fan of Kiske for a number of years I listen to this album just for the fact that Kiske sings on it.  I was very dissapointed, his voice was as always perfect but the songs and the female vocals were horrid poppy garbage.  This album would be better if Kiske was singing and all the music/female vocals were removed, thats how bad it got....oh and if there was some actual songwrighting would have helped too instead of this emotional style trainwreck.
B007FU1OH6|4.0|Thoughly enjoyable but not as good as shadow of the wind. Did keep me occupied and the writting is supperb however the ending left me abanded as if it is now a soap opera. The litreature is superb sometimes l feel we think the same. As though the author is talking to me.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|...like all of Nelson DeMille's books, The Panther is another great one!  His details<br />from both research and experience make all the difference between him and many<br />other writers.  Just wish he was more prolific!!<br /><br />Bill
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have been watching Supernatural since Day 1.  To me it is one of the written shows I have ever seen.  And, since I am 56 years old from when I was in elementary school and starting watching Dark Shadows, I have been hooked on anything to do with the Supernatural.  Jensen and Jason are get together and it is not hard to believe that they are not brothers in real life.  To the writers of this show keep the plots still making one wonder what will happen next.  And, to Team Dean and Sammy, keep up with the suspense.  I Love This Show!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|A few glitches that need working on but other than that it's a great app! Thanks for taking the time to make it. :)
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when this was picked for a book club. Turned out I really enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it to those readers of paranormal romance that enjoy strong female characters.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|This is the second Timbuk2 sleeve I have used for a Kindle product. My first was a ballistic nylon sleeve w/ a felt interior and it was a great product. This new Timbuk2 sleeve for the 7\\" Kindle HD is a clear upgrade in design and functionality.<br /><br />Right off, the build quality is superb as usual for a Timbuk2 product. It feels like a quality product. It is a very basic product, a sleeve w/ a velcro secured flap. The flap and rear of the case is composed of ballistic nylon while the patterned front is made from a different synthetic fabric.<br /><br />The functionality of the case though is where I am most impressed. While nominally for the 7\\" Kindle HD, this sleeve can be used w/ the classic Kindle Touch/Paperwhite as well as other 7\\" tablet such as the Nexus 7. When used w/ the e-ink Kindle, it is slightly roomier than normal but not loose. The killer feature is the quilted cushioning. It covers the whole case with tiny diamond shaped pillows to protect your device. I think this is a really nice improvement over older Timbuk2 cases. Also nicer is the liner, now a soft velvet versus felt.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice product that combines style with functionality, my favorite sort of product.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book grabs you from the beginning and entertains up to the end. Pay attention because it is a mystery that has you trying to put the pieces together as you follow the character solving the puzzle.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|My granddaughter loved rango she watched it so many times.  It was great to hear her laugh out loud, rewind and laugh again.  Johnny Depp was great.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Well written with a good story line. But the important part is it will make your grandmother blush. Could not put it down
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat as it was full of action.  I would tell anyone that they should get it and have a great time watching it.
B006GLM5PA|4.0|This episode did not start out the way that I had hoped, of course. Naturally, I wasn't too thrilled with Sookie going on a date with Sam either. However, Bill's performance at the Descendants of the Glorious Dead meeting was an unexpected great moment. We get to see Bill back in the Civil War, he does a great job in winning over at least some of the town, and he gets emotional when he reveals that he was forced to leave his wife and children behind. Not to mention the quick shot of his bloody tear. And the way the episode ends, although shocking and sad, makes way for, in my opinion, one of the best episodes in the entire season.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|out of this world amazing. catchy. hip. mumfordy. sweet. fun. touching. real. rock. roots. get it now.  that's 17 of the required 20 words. that'll have to do. I'm going back to the cd. trust me on this.
B006GLN17G|5.0|Love, love, love this episode!!! I know it should be sad, but the situation created by gran's death makes possible the incredibly beautiful way that Sookie and Bill grow closer, as he is her only escape from the situation, and eventually, uh, well, you know. Also, we see what a good and loyal friend Tara is to Sookie when she takes care of her and defends her after Jason hits Sookie. Lafayette is great in how he helps to protect Sookie from all the \\"circling buzzards\\" and the fact that he's Lafayette. And you gotta love when Sookie tells everyone at gran's funeral to shut the f*** up. Overall, I say this is one of the best, if not the best, episodes in the season.
B003WUYP56|4.0|I have tried for years, to understand String Theory and it's effect on Physics as an evolving science. I am not properly trained.<br />Finally, I discovered Lee Smolin's book \\"The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next\\". It is well written and compelling. I don't believe this: but, I couldn't put it down.<br />I don't claim to know much more than I knew before, but I feel so much enlightened about the history of String Theory, comfortable about the way great physicists think and conduct science, and excited about the future discoveries and conduct of Physics.<br />This author and book has made me feel more like a cognoscenti. That's pretty good for a commoner.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got to make my 84 year old mom very happy with 2 seasons of Downton Abbey.  Great quality programming for a discerning viewer who loved going back in time in England.  The behind the scenes features were especially enjoyable to learn more about the property , the costuming, characters, etc.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I've never met a Smitten Kitchen recipe that hasn't been anything short of fabulous.  I've made dozens.  Perelman is funny, thorough, and descriptive with all of her recipes and I can't wait to try all the new ones in this book.  There's barely any overlap from her blog, so there are tons of new ones to try.
B00127RAJY|4.0|PROS:<br />1.Honestly it's over in a flash. It moves so quickly and i LOVE the way it moves from strength to cardio to floor work. I dislike DVD's that spend solid time in each area. As i know what's coming and dread the 'next segment' and if youre struggling with floor work (as a example) you know its only going to last max 3 mins before you move on.<br />2.Its really motivating to watch Jillian..she is a fantastic instructor, who really cares for your progress and keeps you going.<br />3. You can do the work out and really feel you have achieved something and not be exhausted or in pain for the rest of the day, and no pain the next day either so it's easy to do this 5 days a week. Mind you it really kicks your butt while youre doing it.<br />4. I have been doing the work out for 3 wks now and i can now do all the full push ups, my mood has improved and my endurance at work has increased a lot. Thanks Jillian, youre the best. Im going to be buying some of your other DVD's very soon.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.The music is very loud and sometimes drowns out Jillians voice..so i have to turn the whole DVD up really loud to hear her..obviosly then the music is super loud too.<br />2. Totally crap that anyone can do star jumps (jumping jacks) OK revise that statement. Anyone probably CAN do them but SHOULD they do them?....really 400lb people which is 200kg in Australia should NOT be putting that sort of pressure on knee joints. Honestly dangerous. Im 100kg (roughly 200lb) only 5'4 tall and no way do i do the star jumps even though i can, untill i lose some weight. I just do more of the other stuff like jumping rope, running on the spot and the bum kicks. Id love to see Jillian carry 400lbs and do some star jumps, i bet she wld change her mind really quickly. Not to mention she's totally flat chested and has noooo idea what 40JJ boobs feel like when airborne lol. There is no point injuring yourself. But even at 200lb i can do everything else fine, as although i'm very overweight im very strong and reasonably fit.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I wanted to see the movie in the theater but was in the process of moving so i missed it.the movie arrived in a couple days it was in new condition
B0055SWM08|2.0|The game itself is excellent, both challenging and rewarding.  However, it also uploads something that causes the web brouser to open Quell page every time you open the brouser.  That is why I deleted it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Action packed and never a dull moment.  Suspense leaves you hanging and can't figure it all out until the end.  I love how Childs makes Reacher know what's going on but won't tell anyone and leaves them (and you the reader) guessing all thru the book.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app allows you to do so much editing and creating ... definetely worth while ... its a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it you wont be able to stop playing around with all your different options
0451196716|5.0|To think that Stephen King had this in him so early on in his career just isn't fair.  He is a master.  As morbid as this book seemed, he made it out to be something more than that.  Good writers try, great writers suceed.  This was a sucess.  It reminded me of being on road marches in basic training in the Army. Often times on long ones, we would tend to group together and talk to keep one and other motivated.  We weren't under the same pressure as these kids, thank God, but none the less we championed some, despised others and tried to make it the best we could. This book will make you think. Is our society far off from this?
B0086700CM|5.0|Downloaded this for my daughter but I can't stop playing. Enjoy the challange that the game gives me &amp; excited to get more into it.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Easy to use and very handy. Information included is very useful for  the reader. Makes reading the books more meaningful
B0073XORCY|5.0|I place the original Thick As A Brick on a short list of the greatest albums of all time.  TAAB2 is a worthy follow up.  The concept is \\"What ifs\\".  What if Gerald Bostock (the imaginary lyricist of the original TAAB) turned out this way, or took this particluar path in life, or wound up...<br /><br />Anderson returns to true prog form.  As all great prog albums, TAAB2 is to be played from beginning to end without interruption.  If you are a Tull fan from way back and lost the love along the way, this may be your only hope.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille is one of the great story tellers. Wise-cracking John Corey is a great vehicle for DeMille.  Corey chases the terrorist known as The Panther all the way to Yemen to avenge The Panther's murderous ways. DeMille (and (Corey) don't disappoint in this political thriller.
1439153663|1.0|I bought this book based on the sheer volume of high ratings it received.  What a disappointing read!  Like a previous review, it was drudgery from beginning to end. This book has flat, one-dimensional characters, tremendous redundancy in story-telling and an uncompelling drawn-out story line with unsatisfactory conclusions.  This sloppily written book could have been written by a teenager. A big thumbs down from me.  I wouldn't share this book with a friend.  I wouldn't want them to waste their time.
B009329ZF2|4.0|this is a good movie, storyline is somewhat original, its an easy watch and full of action. it's a must watch...
B0079IEPHA|2.0|This show should be better.  Talented actors, high production value.  But, the writing is just OK.  Unfortunately, I think Gabriel Macht is badly miscast in this show - just not masculine and commanding enough for how his character is written.  Patrick Adams is terrific, but the more they try to make him the bumbling protege of Macht's character, the lamer it gets.
0393343405|4.0|This is a true detective story, the kind of story that delights while informing the reader about historical events. It spans 2500 years and the scholarship is impeccable. A true joy to read.
B004QQWA84|5.0|This CD and band are what make me happy about metal today. In Solitude really have a great sound and put together some awesome songs. A win for the fans.
B007EECSFA|4.0|If you've read any other of Kate Morton's novels then you already know what to expect with this one: someone in the present is trying to unravel a mystery from the past.  However, just because this story follows along with her generic plot line doesn't mean that it's not interesting! There are many layers to this story, and Kate Morton does a really good job of weaving them amongst one another so that you find yourself caught in the middle.  I especially liked the parts that took place during the Blitz because Morton presents the characters as typical young women with regular dreams and hopes, girls who are hopelessly in love and always out for a fun time.  It's a contrast to the side of the picture that history paints: the bold, modern women who held down the fort while the men were off to war.  The other great thing about this book was that the ending was completely unexpected.  Despite reading all of Morton's other novels I was thrown for a loop at the end!  All in all, this is a good read: nothing I would stay up all night to finish, but a page-turning mystery mixed with a solid bit of historical fiction.
032147404X|5.0|Wow!  What a perfect read!  Scott writes his books in this series in such an excellent way!  The jokes are fine, no big deal.  They are mostly just at the beginning of each chapter, and it gives your mind a minute to relax a bit, before delving off into the next chapter.  These are \\"hard to put down\\" books... I let my assistant read one and she read it all in one sitting and was asking for the next one!  Highly recommend, very enjoyable and definitely lots of tips for beginners and even pro's... Excellent!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great book even though sort of same story as number one with a different plot has to stop leaving the women behind
B008NABUU8|1.0|The game would be fun if it didn't cause my system to hang (often) and crash (sometimes).  I use a Samsung Infuse.<br /><br />It's like they made all the bells and whistles great and the actual product poorly.  So much potential but it's just not there yet. Maybe when it can run without hanging or crashing (those are musts, imo).
B007SRWER0|4.0|Freefall is Stiglitz' pop-critique of the Great Recession up to 2010. Like his earlier popular works the book is econ-lite for the general public but it is also based on a solid foundation not speculation. His years of research and participation in government organizations including the Clinton administration, the World Bank, and the United Nations make Dr. Stiglitz' thoughts on these events and their solutions more than just arm chair speculations. In fact, he is the primary opponent to Neo-liberalism and non-holistic Keynesian solutions. Nor is he a partisan in American politics for all his work reflects criticism of both political parties and their cookie-cutter economic positions.<br /><br />He begins the book with a condemnation of both political parties, the Federal Reserve, and the financial industry, and continues with critiques of the nonresponsiveness of the Bush administration, the \\"muddling through\\" of the Obama administration, and the general ineptness of the Federal Reserve. Chiefly, the work questions why limited reform of the capital system has occurred and places it firmly at the foot of the political corruption of the US government due to the power of the financial industry.<br /><br />He also blames the world's economists for failing to argue positive economics and instead participating in normative debates without a factual basis. This chapter (No. 9) is an outstanding overview of 20th century economic theory and its influence in government policy making. He highlights the importance of Schumpeter and Hayek in the 20th century and how they both rejected market equilibrium theory in favor of more complex models of market forces requiring governmental intervention.<br /><br />As always Stiglitz provides rational solutions for our irrational times and is a worthy reading experience.
1781161097|4.0|When Ridley Scott announced his dramatic return to sci-fi and that the film would be an &#34;Alien&#34; prequel, movie fans everywhere rejoiced! And although &#34;Prometheus&#34; may not have delivered on its promise, the concepts behind the film are thrilling and innovative. It's all captured here in this art book that takes the reader beyond the screen and into the world of the Engineers.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|There should be no doubt after this novel that neither Patricia Cornwell nor her character Kay Scarpetta have lost anything at all.  Thoroughly enjoyed it, highly recommend it to fans and even those who haven't encountered these novels before.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love this Album. A lot of people keep telling me it's not nearly as good as the first, but I disagree. You can feel the energy in the music in tracks like Babel and I Will Wait, but there's also a softer side (Reminder, etc). If you're a fan of Mumford & Sons buy this album and support a great band.
B007PFDJH4|4.0|Ian McEwan is an extraordinary author.  His characterizations and his writing cadence are extraodinary.  This book was really not what I expected.  I was expecting a spy thriller book with earth-shattering and catastrophic segments.  There is nothing life-threatening or dangerous about this book even though the element of surprise and the fear of the unexpected are both there for the reader.  I have to admit that Serena Frome was probably one of the most unlikeable protagonists that I've ever read.  She was very well portrayed and that is not why I didn't like her.  She is just not a woman that I would be drawn to at all if I was to meet someone like her.  She vacillates and can't seem to make a decision to save her life.  She's insincere and a bit of a snob actually.  She moves through her life and her main goal is to make no waves, stand for nothing and just drift.  Having said that, I found the minor characters in the book were wonderful and very real.  I especially liked Serena's sister and father.  Although we don't see them much in the book, I found them very easy to picture and imagine.  There's a lot about love, desire, deceit, creativity (in the form of the written word).  Without giving away anything of the plot, there is even an evil character.  A character that doesn't loom that large in the narrative, but one whose deception is actually behind the whole story.  McEwan does such a good job of laying bare human deceptions and exposing all the cracks and breaks under the gloss of the human facade. It seems to come up and hit you as you read his books.
0062124293|4.0|There isn't much middle ground in reactions to this book - you are either going to love it or be completely turned off before you get halfway through the first chapter.  I fall into the love it category.  Here is a little taste, from the chapter titled \\"I Am a Feminist\\" so you can gauge your interest.    \\"Here is the quick way of working out if your're a feminist.  Put your hands in your underpants.    a.  Do you have a vagina?  b.  Do you wan to be in charge of it?    If you said yes to both, then congratulations! You're a feminist.    Because we need to reclaim the word 'feminism.'  We need the word 'feminism' back real bad.  When statistics come in saying that only 29% of American would describe themselves as feminist- and only 42% of British women- I used to think, What do you think feminism IS, ladies?  What part of liberation of women is not for you?  Is it the freedom to vote?  The right not to be owned by the man you marry?  The campaign for equal pay?  'Vogue' by Madonna?  Jeans? Did all this good s*** GET ON YOUR NERVES?  Or were you just DRUNK AT THE TIME OF THE SURVEY?\\"    Caitlin Moran isn't afraid to share any details of her life with us, from her first period, first orgasm, and first attempt at shaving her pubic hair.  And she does it all in hilarious fashion.  If you just cringed at this and said \\"yuck,\\" this might not be the book for you.    There really isn't any stone she will leave unturned, including her abortion.  Moran does not pull any punches.  She is unapologetic about it and completley at peace with her decision.  She believes it was the right choice for her, and there is no way anyone is going to make her feel ashamed about it.  I suspect that there are many women who wish they had the courage to be so candid about something that they regard as their biggest secret.    The beauty of this book is that it is a collection of essays.  So if one chapter isn't doing it for you, skip it and move on.  I didn't love all of them - the one about role models was kind of blah- but for the most part, it was a hilarious and thought provoking read that I want to pass on to my daughter (once she is 16 - I wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than that.)
B0055SWM08|5.0|the only way it could have been better is if the story that was made for the game was included but that's it if it was an option. but a beautiful puzzle game.

030758836X|2.0|I listened to the audiobook - which was done well.  The story drew you in about a dysfunctional<br />couple, but the ending felt like the author just gave up on the story, and ended it. What a disapointment!

B007I1TFK0|4.0|One of Broadways's most epic achievements &#34;Evita&#34; was always cinematic. Here is the proof! Madonna's worthy performance may be the singularly best crowning achievement of her career - comfortable in a medium she helped master, the movie musical was reborn with &#34;Evita&#34;.

B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is an amazing DVD CD set. Muddy Waters is truly the 'Father of Blues' It is so nice to see legends like Muddy, Buddy Guy, Lefty  and Junior Wales play. Then to have Keith and Ronnie from the Rolling Stones join in along with Mick is just a treat.

A master surgeon has split Torres into her human and Klingon personalities to use her pure Klingon DNA to search for a clue to a cure for the phage.....<br /><br />This is a very good episode and as it contains some action and a deep insight into the personality and character of B'Elanna Torres.  You finally get to see the struggle of personalities that she faced during her entire life.<br /><br />This is a good episode and I recommend it to you.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Kristen Stewart could have at least tried to change her expression at least a couple of times during the movie.  Charleze Theron was amazing as the witch, she made the movie watchable.  Chris Hemsworth was good as the huntsman.

B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Great book.  There is so much that goes on in this book and you don't really know until the end who done it.  I like that because it keeps you guessing and reading.  Would recommend this to anyone who like murder mysteries.

The shuttle appears to have been involved in a battle and is damaged.  The doctor examines him and finds that he can keep Chakotay alive but his brain energy is gone and he is brain dead.....<br /><br />This is a pretty good episode with an alien invader with a plan that can threaten the lives of the Voyager crew.  I enjoyed this episode and it was probably a 3.5 rating but I rolled it up to a 4.  This series has not had a lot of action since the first episode that started the season.  There have been some good stories like this one and the action was higher in this one.  I recommend to you.
B007SGM084|1.0|I found this set of books to be weakly written.  The language was repetitive and frankly boring by the middle of the second book.  I was disappointed that the story did not develop into something with more depth.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took a while to get used to the pov writing.  I particularly found Amy's voice to be annoying.

But glad I read it.

B007MDB548|4.0|Disney continues its \\"Fairies\\" franchise with the latest entry in the series, \\"Secret of the Wings.\\" This marks the fourth movie and there doesn't look to be an end in sight with next year's addition already scheduled. Timing couldn't be better to release the newest sequel since it takes place in the land of Winter and would make the perfect gift for Christmas for any little girl.<br /><br />A curious Tinker Bell ignores the rules of warm fairies and ventures into the forbidden world of winter. Her dangerous excursion leads her to uncover a mysterious secret and almost break a wing . A bizarre glow overcomes her wings during the quick visit, which drives Tinker Bell to return and delve deeper into the winter woods in search of the Keeper of all fairy knowledge.<br /><br />As is usual with Disney's Blu-ray releases, \\"Secret of the Wings\\" looks fabulous. Its CG animation is clean and picture perfect. A greater amount of visual depth can be felt when watching the 3D version of the film. However, the 2D version is stunning as well. The color schemes are beautiful no matter if the screen is filled with striking whites or darker tones.<br /><br />A 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees maximum audio enjoyment for viewers. The magical sounds of the fairy world, dialogue, and musical score really get a chance to make an impact on home theater audiences. As if there would ever be any question about Disney providing their loyal \\"Fairy\\" fans with a high quality audio experience.<br /><br />Special features include a bonus 22-minute adventure entitled \\"Pixie Hollow Games.\\" It also contains two music videos by McClain Sisters and Zendaya. There's a never-before-seen preview of \\"Fright Light\\" and deleted scenes with introductions by the filmmaker as well.<br /><br />The \\"Secret of the Wings\\" 4-disc combo pack gives Disney collectors every possible format for people to view the movie in.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like the simple yet effective design.  I can keep track of multiple notes, check lists, and insert pics/etc.  The best part is that I can write them in one place and my other devices sync up, what a timesaver!  (I used to keep notes here and there and always one in my pocket)

B00846REIS|1.0|I thought I was reading a poor version of 50 Shades! The characters were dull and lifeless in comparison to 50 Shades and most of the story line was similar.
0470601787|5.0|Back in 1998 had the privilege to attend a training workshop by David Sibbet. I was highly sceptical about the concept sketching out ideas in serious business meetings, but since that training I've used visual techniques with dozens of clients and had quite extraordinary results. So, when I saw Visual Meetings in a book store I had to buy a copy.<br /><br />You'll find this book useful if you're finding it hard to get agreement when it comes to problem solving, creative ideas and decisions. The author clearly explains the power of visualisation and using sketches for interaction - whether its on a napkin, flip chart or whiteboard. For those who think they can't draw (like you and me) he also explains how to pick up a pen and doodle your way into other people worlds. What a great way to create rapport and joint understanding.<br /><br />You'll find some very good material in the book and if you approach it a bit like a workshop in print you will get a lot from it.<br /><br />Unlike many business books this one gets the message across with plenty of graphics (as you might expect) and concise prose.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Easy to order. Enjoyed the continuation of Hunger Games. Kept my attention and didn;t want to put it down. Wprth your read.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Although the cast is obviously outstanding, I worried the story might be slow moving or depressing. On the contrary, it held my attention every minute with stories of self-discovery, renewed purpose and love lost and found. Although I enjoy an action flick, a suspenseful mystery or an amusing animated movie, it was so refreshing to watch a character-driven film set in an exotic locale.
0307474275|5.0|I love this book.  It was riveting and I couldn't stop reading it.  I actually took some vacation days after buying it because I wanted to just read it all day long.  While the books make so many parts of the story sound true, it shouldn't be taken as fact.  It is a story and designed to make things larger and more exciting that in reality.  Use your own judgement and enjoy the book for its story, not what facts it does or doesn't depict correctly
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|The good news is that this game has amazing graphics.  We are talking visually stunning here!  The bad news is that the game requires a LOT of wasted time going back and forth between 15 or so different screens. You end up spending most of your time finding one object and<br />then having to travel through all the screens you've already completed just to put that object where it belongs.  After that it's back through all those screens AGAIN to find another item. You end up repeating this over and over again for every freaking item!  Another problem is that (at least for me) the game locks up.  I got to the point where in order to proceed with the game I had to enter a date from off of a &quot;photo&quot;.  I knew the date but when I tried to enter it I could only get the lock to show 00000000 or 02141979.  The game would not allow me to enter any other numbers!  Too bad because this had the potential to be an excellent game!

0312944926|4.0|Dan brown has an amazing writing style that keeps you involved in the story regardless of how much time has passed between reading sessions.  I read this book at work over a month or two and was always excited to see the next twist and try to guess where the story was being taken.<br /><br />Once again a great read from an amazing author!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This book captures the music business in the 90's up to now.  Through different points of view, the author skillfully reveals the pathos and the artistry of the music business as it is in disarray, dealing with the new digital age. Very well written.

B000002AGN|5.0|This CD is a jazz classic that I really love. I bought it ages ago and lost it. I just recently reordered a new copy and it was like getting an old friend back. Although most people know this CD for Take Five, I think Blue Rhondo Ala Turk is great too.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|I bought this series for my teen daughter and she loves it!  It's similar to Lord of the Rings, without the gore and hours-long battle scenes, and features 3 main characters on a quest to save their kingdom.  I LOVE the strong female lead who can fight as well, or better than the male lead!  Her cleavage will keep the attention of any adolescent boy while the killer physique of the male lead will keep the girls happy!  Their love story is very age appropriate for the tween-teen set who aren't too jaded. :) The plots get a little same-same but the new characters that come in periodically keep it interesting.

B0058O84G0|4.0|An excellent book if you are interested in historical novels.  I felt very much part of the era as the historical detail was so vividly explained. I look forward to book three.
B002GY9F9K|2.0|The Legend of the Seeker is a fantasy adventure-drama series that came out a few years back that was based, rather loosely, upon The Sword of Truth \\"epic\\" fantasy series of books written by Terry Goodkind.  The Legend of the Seeker features the tried-and-true-and-cliched-and-worn-out fantasy theme of the unsuspecting young man, named Richard Cypher (played by Craig Horner), growing up in a very modest setting only to discover that he is actually The Hero Who Defeats Evil, called the Seeker, and he must embark on a quest to defeat the evil sorcerer ruler, Darken Rahl, aided by his companions Zed the wizard (Bruce Spence), and Kahlan the Confessor (Bridget Regan), a sort of truth-seeking blend of judge, priestess, and witch.  Normally, it's a good idea to limit comments in a review to the subject of the review itself, but this television show seems to have received such polarizing reviews from fans of the show who love it and from fans of Goodkind's books, who hate it, that I feel some commentary on those other reviews and the books upon which this show is based is in order.<br /><br />As I have hinted, the television show does not closely follow the books.  Contrary to what many of the most critical reviewers believe, the mere fact that the tv series does not faithfully follow the books does not automatically merit a 4-star deduction in the rating. Several recent TV shows have deviated substantially from the books upon which they are based and the result is a much better television work than a literary work (e.g. HBO's True Blood is much better than Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series, the short-lived The Dresden Files had a great deal more sensible plots than the Jim Butcher books upon which they were based, and Showtime's Dexter is superior to Jeff Lindsay's Dexter novels). A television show does not need to follow the books upon which it is based as closely as HBO's Game of Thrones follows George R.R. Martin's novels to be a quality show.  In fact, I have to say that I paid less attention to my Blu-Ray set of Game of Thrones because I had fairly recently finished reading the books and I found HBO's adaptation to follow Martin's books so closely, so I actually would have preferred some distinctions between the book and the TV show to keep it more fresh and interesting.<br /><br />However, I will concede that I agree completely with the criticism that the series was made worse by deviating from Terry Goodkind's books, not because I think Goodkind's works were so special, but because at every point where the screenwriters changed the plot, they picked a worse plot development. Every time where they chose to deviate from the book, their choice was less logical or interesting and interfered with the plot development and flow.  For instance, in the first episode of the TV show, Richard does not even know Zed the wizard who is supposed to guard and train him for his future heroic role and this lack of familiarity draws the question from Kahlan \\"Why have you not trained him to be the Seeker?\\" a good question indeed, since Richard's familiarity with Zed in the first book makes much more sense.<br /><br />Having said that, I don't feel aghast with outrage that anyone would dare not to follow Terry Goodkind's books. I read the first one and got about 3/4 of the way through the second before I gave up. I found Goodkind to be terribly derivative of Terry Brooks (himself very derivative of Tolkien), Robert Jordan (an awful writer, hardly one to emulate), and children's author Lloyd Alexander's terrific Chronicles of Prydain. I got tired of the awkward dialog, often presented in summary form and I got quite bored with his protagonist's constant headstrong foolishness. I got tired of Goodkind writing his protagonists into an impossibly bleak corner, only to utilize some hitherto unmentioned amazing ability - a gimmick - to allow them to escape. Even Goodkind's names are rather sophomoric - Richard Cypher (the mysterious young hero),Darken Rahl (dark, evil, gutteral), Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (magical, at the far end of the spectrum), the Mord-Sith (can anyone say Star Wars villain?), etc....<br /><br />Every episode of this television series features more of the same - Richard gets in trouble because he continues to make headstrong, stupid decisions against the advice and better judgment of his companions - \\"I don't care if I die and as a result Darken Rahl kills millions of innocent people, I have to go rescue this innocent kitten!!\\". OK, I exaggerated slightly - insert \\"innocent woman/child\\" for \\"kitten.\\"  Every episode features the same slow motion sword-and-knife fight scenes with Richard and Kahlan defeating overwhelming forces of enemy soldiers, with the same exaggerated choreography with the dopey enemies falling dead under blows that don't even slightly resemble fatal swordthrusts or knife slashes, let alone ones that come close to actually connecting with the dastardly foe, all highlighted by Bridget Regan's martial shrieks.  Oh, and what is with Kahlan's inexplicable wardrobe changes? - in one scene, she's wearing her white Confessor's dress, minutes later she's wearing her olive traveling dress, and then she's back in the white one again. Every episode is concluded with some lame philosophical statement that more or less says \\"I guess I/we have learned my/our lesson,\\" that lesson usually being stick to the quest for Richard or trust the Seeker's intuition for Kahlan and Zed.<br /><br />The show features a diverse cast of characters with one characteristic in common:  none of the thespians in this series seem like they could act their way out of a soggy paper bag - the acting is abysmal, about what one would expect from a 9th grader who just joined his/her school's drama club and just remembering their lines is as much as they can do. Perhaps part of the blame for the uninspired performances can be laid at the feet of director Sam Raimi (creator of the Hercules and Xena shows) and thescreenwriters, who sludged, rather than crafted, much of the dialog in this series (e.g. the endless lines about the duty of the Seeker and the duty of his companions to protect him and advance his quest), which turned out rather lame and melodramatic.<br /><br />The show is not altogether devoid of positives.  The two lead actors, Craig Horner and Bridget Regan, are terrifically attractive and charismatic and even manage to have some chemistry from time to time (but sadly, they then go back to spewing formulaic lines in a less-than-convincing fashion).  For a television show, it actually has pretty good special effects, particularly the wizard fire and other magic.  And hey, it's a fantasy series, not just some lame sit-com trying to copy Friends or yet another forensics-based police-legal drama.<br /><br />I would have given this series maybe a 1.5/5 rating but rounded up to a 2/5 for ABC's courage to do a sci-fi/fantasy drama in the age of the endless cheap, pointless, nearly identical and omnipresent reality series; we sure as hell don't need any more singing contests or day-in-the-life-of-some-worthless-pseudo-celebrity-or-washed-up-hasbeen types of shows. The Legend of the Seeker's plots tend toward the silly, the acting is stilted and wooden, and the individual episodes plod forward toward the inevitable final confrontation with Darken Rahl with much sameness. I think the show would have benefitted it Raimi had treated it with a bit more seriousness (akin to HBO's Game of Thrones, which features some excellent acting) or with a lot less seriousness and more humor.  Instead, it tends to have the same sort of slightly silly tone that Raimi's previous shows Hercules and Xena had and I can't recall seeing many, if any, critics labeling those two shows quality television.<br /><br />========================<br /><br />I am confident that my comments here will draw the ire of many people including both fans of the Goodkind books and fans of the TV series.  If you are inclined to click on that \\"NOT HELPFUL\\" button, before you do that, please do something - please post a comment to this review and explain exactly why you think anything that I've said above is not accurate. Don't just say \\"You're wrong!\\" or \\"I disagree!\\" or \\"You're a dope!\\" Please, give me some intelligent, logical reasons, backed up with examples, for why you do not feel my opinions make sense.  Thank you.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Unfortunately, I had not seen this movie in the theatre.  If I had, I would not have purchased this Blu-ray.  Then why four stars?  I think there was a lot of potential with the material, just not edited properly, for the movie to have been a lot better.  Charlize Theron was as beautiful as ever, but I don't think she came across as really evil.  The effects are spectacular!
B0056CUZRA|5.0|As a previous \\"pillars of the earth\\" fan, I was always going to be cynical about the next series. Whilst on holiday in Bali, this was the ideal time to test the hypothesis on the new book.<br />Addictive, fast-moving but at occasions predictable would be my overall impressions. Not as great as the POE/WWE duo at first impressions but then Ive yet to read number two or three.......
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Love this book! Never would have expect it to be that intense with action! I also love the way it keeps u guessing and wondering whats next!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is not as good as  the pc verison but it is awsome. i play multiplayer all the time works flawlessly.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|I'm not sure what's most impressive about this movie.  The fact that its a baseball movie that barely features anyone actually playing the game, the fact that its really a movie about business statistics in sports, the fact that Jonah Hill got (and deserved) an Oscar nomination for this, the fact that a script co-written by Aaron Sorkin manages to have many effective moments of silence rather than rapid-fire dialogue, or the simple fact that all these things combined to make a great movie.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Die hard fans of the tele novel will probably not like this movie.  However, having said that, the send up by Mr. Depp and his entirely supportive cast makes this a highly enjoyable and worth watching movie.  It is at once funny and serious but entirely enjoyable through the length of the film.<br /><br />Mr. Depp makes the character at once likable, funny, and serious.  Kudos for that.  The rest of the cast do not dissapoint.<br /><br />This became a must have for my video collection - and now I have it.<br /><br />Try it - you'll like it.
B00979CS50|5.0|On this album, as on no other in recent memory, I'm reminded of the fact that Crazy Horse w/ Neil is an absolute force of Nature. Neil's voice, for starters, is in great shape and the bombast usually associated w/ the Horse is in evidence in some places(which is surely to be expected)but it's in the musical subtleties where one can savor a delicacy that has rarely been in evidence in The Horse's music. This is a man and a band that has played together for so many years that the level of communication has reached a level of intimacy that is truely breath-taking.<br />\\"Four Strong Winds\\", written by fellow Canadian Ian Tyson is the best description, at the moment, that conjurs up, for me,the essence of The Horse and Neil. Not in the style of music, but the natural forces in-play in this work. I've had the album for three days so it's a bit early to try and slot it into the NY canon, but it's not too early to say that if you're a NY fan, and have listened to him low these many years, it will hit that super sweet spot only The Horse can hit and it enlarges that sweet spot because it's unlike other Crazy Horse albums, in that it not only recapitulates the band's history it expands it. Crazy Horse is not just alive and doin well, it's thriving, it's growing, it's doing stuff it's never done. This is an intimate listening experience because it's current, personal, contemplative and as the Horse is known to do, it Rocks. I had to ask myself \\"What year is this, and does that even matter anymore\\". Neil and the Horse still have the ability to confound all MY expectations. And for a guy my age that's saying something. There are still Neil Young and Crazy Horse stories to be told. This album adds to the very best this band has ever been. The great thing is it adds to my life things I have no other way of acquiring. It's the music, man, it's the music man. It's a miracle to me. Now-a-days this stuff just doesn't happen very often.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love books that puts you in there shoes of how life would be if it was you or look at how people you may know that have went through a different lifestyle than u! Very great book!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I am about 2/3 through this first book of the Central Trilogy and look forward each day to reading more.  There are numerous characters with very varied backgrounds which keeps it interesting though if you put it down for too long, you may have a hard time remembering who is who.  The story is compelling enough though that I am motivated to read each day.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Love love love Dexter!  Every season leaves me awaiting the next year with great anticipation to see what other adventures, troubles and near death excursions that lie ahead of our sweet beloved murdering Dexter Morgan.
B003204MQS|5.0|Well, it's that time again, time for another damn Paranormal Activity movie. In sarcastic celebration of the release of the 4th (Christ almighty, 4th?) of these movies, I thought I'd revisit the one that started it all. The film that, much like the saw movies, somehow launched a franchise while simultaneously helping no one's career. ...how the hell does that happen, anyway?<br /><br />So I'm sure by now everyone knows the basic premise: a couple of young professionals are being haunted (or hunted) by a nameless demon thing. The boyfriend buys a fancy camera to bring the audience along for the ride and we peek in as events go from bad to worse to please-just-get-help-already. It's becoming a well-worn formula, but Paranormal Activity managed a little bit of movie magic - sitting at that weird cross section of right time/right place, memorable gimmick, and excellent marketing campaign that can make a movie a success in the face of mixed audience reactions.<br /><br />The polarizing nature of the film, and the love-hate reactions, are what I want to talk about most. Because, overall, I'd say it's a pretty quality (if low budget) production. It takes itself seriously, the pacing is good, and the story is simple but escalates the danger and the stakes at the appropriate times. What few effects are used are well done; simple but flawless. You never see the strings or the magician's hands at work. We get a very solid and honest performance from Katie Featherston. And this demon, this haunting presence, feels well developed. Even though we never get to see it, I get the impression it has a personality and maybe a look that writer could describe. And the tactics it uses kind of make sense, in a creepy, wife-beating, eternal spirit sort of way. So, yeah, the bones of a well done production are there. The key to whether you love or hate it is whether or not you give a damn.<br /><br />I seriously mean that. It all rests on whether or not you develop empathy for the characters, for their situation; whether or not you can project yourself into it. Not SYMPATHY, mind you, it doesn't matter whether or not you LIKE these people, but empathy; whether or not you can see yourself in their shoes. Because, like I said, the story is incredibly simplistic. The couple does almost nothing to better their situation, so there's almost no real struggle against their antagonist and you could argue that its 90 minutes of people reacting. The effects are very simple; moving doors, moving shadows, bits of noise. Compare it to something like, I don't know, Drag Me to Hell for example, which is a traditionally told story with a ton of conflict, a ton of struggle and lots of loud things thrown at the camera; Paranormal Activity is practically a 'slice of life' movie when compared to something like that.<br /><br />BUT!!! If you get sucked in, like I did, the fact that the things happening are so small becomes terrifying! If those things were happening to ME, if my lights were going on and off, if I could see demon breath on my girlfriend's should, I'd about lose my mind. Once the movie's got your imagination, once you've put yourself there - this is my house, my boyfriend, my life - it becomes a masterpiece of pacing and atmosphere. This home, this place that SHOULD be safe, is now corrupted by a dangerous, creepy, rapey little demon. Every little thing, every light switch, the tv, the bed, becomes a danger. Nowhere is safe. This movie infects my mind and, when I'm watching it, every little thing in my home becomes suspect. The clicks from the heater set me off; the rattle in the pipe makes me jump. Because it's the little things, the little creaks and groans, that mean SOMETHING IS WATCHING YOU!<br /><br />The problem is that it all hinges on that one thing, on grabbing the audience's empathy. If that doesn't happen for you (and that's the movie's fault, not yours) it is quite boring. There's no real story, no real effects, no graphic sex scenes. Just two people living a particularly awful period of their lives (like a Chekhovian ghost story).<br /><br />And I don't want to talk about the ending. There are three of them on the DVD, and I think even more on YouTube, so pick your favorite and go with that. They went with the least nihilistic one for the theatrical release, because that was the smartest thing to do from a marketing perspective. Audiences hate nihilistic endings, that's just how it is, and if everyone's dead it's harder to make sequels. We could argue about that all day, and I don't want to. The ending they ultimately picked is one, last, big jump scare that brings this particular story, these two people in this house, to a logical conclusion. On that level, it works just fine for me.<br /><br />All that said, I have to say that Paranormal Activity remains one of my favorite scary movies. It's a personal choice, but the movie hits all the right buttons for me and none of the wrong ones. It's subtle and subdued while still being imaginative and honest. And, these days, that is something special indeed.<br /><br />BOO!!!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Special affects are good, predictable, rip-off of Alien(episode 1 ?), not enough Cherize walking to carry the movie.  I should have waited for it to be aired, my youngest warned me.
0345803507|4.0|After reading Books 1 and 2, then I had to read book 3, which I enjoyed most of all. It<br />was interesting to find out that everything turned out so well. I do like happy endings!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I have been a Halo fan for all of my life and Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn has definitely done something beautiful for the community and myself. This is a film that everyone (Halo fan or not should enjoy). It's not just a film; it's an experience!<br /><br />erik1220
B004YM6JI2|5.0|DVD set arrived very quickly and in great shape.  This series continues to surprise and entertain me and my family.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book months ago just looking for something to take up some of my time. I had not heard of any good books lately so I randomly selected this one. Let me tell you - I'm glad that I did!!! I'm not typically into mystery novels but this one had something special. I absolutely loved the characters and the way that the author slowly built up the story line. If I say much more I will start to give out spoilers..and that would just ruin the mystery! Take it from me. This book is WORTH the read!
0307341550|5.0|My wife introduced me to Giilian Flynn's work. Sharp Objects was a total page turner. I enjoy Michael Conelly, James Elroy, James Lee Burke, George Pelecanos, Nevada Barr, Robert B.Parker and James W. Hall. Flynn writes  strong plots with a real whodunit flair. I read Sharp Objects and Dark Places in three days. And I am not a speed reader, I couldn't put down them down. I would read one paragragh of the next chapter after the last I had intended to read, and I was hooked for another chapter and again and again.<br />The stories are atmospheric and very mysterious. Her characters are complex and as flawed as Pelcanos' and Elroys' and Burkes'.The last books that had me so addicted was the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo trilogy. Both books \\"felt\\" very similar to that series.<br />I am waiting for my wife to finish Gone Girl so that I can consume/inhale it. Get that next one coming Gillian!

B0074YVW1G|5.0|Excellent book - wish it was written years ago. It should be read by every parent, teacher, lecturer and especially every business leader. If you have read it and are not looking at life and people and the world of business with new eyes, you did not get this book.
B007THA4FI|2.0|No Harry Potter. I'm not sure what I expected but I didn't care for this story. I guess I'll stick to her wizard stories.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love this album and have had it on repeat every since I bought it.  There are some great tracks for dancing and some strong ballads as well.  Adam Lambert's voice shines throughout.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game. Finished it in about three hours. Has a great replay value obviously because the puzzles are shuffled differently each time. Was a good challenge.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book is slow in developing and then improves.  It is not as well written as some of her previous books, but that is ok because I always learn somehting from reading her novels.
B007EE5820|2.0|Amazon does their customers a good service.<br /><br />I just finished reading the sample of Total Recall. I enjoyed it very much and would have purchased this ebook if the sample ended a chapter before it did (Confession of a Tank Driver) which ended with good humour.<br /><br />Instead, the sample ended on the next chapter \\"Mr. Universe\\" where Arnold brags about being a barroom bully. Up to this point in the book I found Arnold to be a very nice person, above low-brow acts like bullying people.<br /><br />One does not become a bully overnight, it is a learnt trait. This suggests that Arnold would have been doing the bullying thing long before Munich and probably long after.<br /><br />So, either he is over exaggerating his barroom antics or he is not being fully honest about his good natured disposition.<br /><br />Perhaps Arnie should have entitled his book, \\"True Lies\\".<br /><br />I have no time for Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for including this disturbing portion of the book into the sample. It makes for a fair evaluation.<br /><br />Robert

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Ok, let me start out by saying that I wanted to believe this book and the story it conveys - I really did. I read the article in Newsweek and watched an interview on youtube. So when I got the book I was ready for it all to be validated. Unfortunately I was disappointed.<br /><br />These are some of the issues I have with it:<br /><br />1. If your going to be convincing in this arena stick to the strengths in your story - scientist, NDE, skeptic turned believer, conviction of experience, overwhelming nature of the experience etc... he did a good job of this in the Newsweek article and the youtube interview, instead in the book he goes off on tangents that minimize his overall credibility.<br /><br />2. He strongly implies that it rained every day while he was in coma and then the sun came out when he awoke. (Implying that it was tied to his ordeal). I'm sorry but this is simply an example of grandiosity. Why put this in? So are we to believe that God arranged for all other human beings in his vicinity to be subjected and effected by his odyssey? Credible on small claims results in credibility on larger ones and vise versa.<br /><br />3. There is a very strange (odd) 'commercial' in the middle of the book that is out of context and adds nothing to his story. He goes on and on about this 'advertisement' - about a chapter long - it is about some contraption for experiencing hallucinations on a regular basis at home. Kind of like a 'do it yourself' NDE home version. This was very confusing - was he implying that he goes back into the NDE realm on demand? Is he selling a product? I didn't understand it. It made me wonder if he is more new age 'flower child' then scientist.<br /><br />4. I'm left with the overall impression that he didn't fully recover from his coma and he is just a little confused and disoriented.<br /><br />5. He goes on and on about the beautiful girl with the unforgettable face and smile in his NDE. I mean - he stresses this to where you get annoyed that he is repeating himself over and over - then he is shown of picture of the girl with the unforgettable face(shown to him to be his bio-sister that he never met but predeceased him) and it isn't until another later date that he is reading of another NDE participant who recognized someone (a sibling) that they never met in life does he put it all together - this was a whole chapter entitled something like \\"the photograph\\". What? See the picture - recognize the NDE girl as your non-living bio-sister .... that would make sense...the delay makes no sense. Leads one to believe he wanted it to be connected.<br /><br />6. There is a strong strong (should I say it again?) strong indication that this fella has a reason to be 'special'. Unfortunately that obvious need lessons the credibility of his story.<br /><br />7. A scientist but bring back nothing new - I mean - bring back some new scientific discovery to where people marvel on the revelation. Nope. No new math equation. No new discovery of any kind. Even though he was exposed to multiple universes and the secrets of the cosmos - he didn't bring back any 'proof' .... why not?<br /><br />Make no mistake - I read the Newsweek article, I spent an hour listening to the youtube video, I spent $10 plus tax on this book - believe me - I wanted it to be 'perfect'....but it's not....sorry....<br /><br />My advice is to skip the book and save the $10. It doesn't add anything new to the 'good' part of the story. (Read the Newsweek and watch/listen to the youtube video).

0060873175|4.0|Paperback/Science Fiction: 4 1/2 stars! I don't want to give away the plot, but don't listen to the haters.  It's a cross between Timeline (a great book!) and Jurassic Park (with a twist).  Yes, it is science fiction at its truest form.  Crichton does a great job of storytelling with lots of twist and turns.  The characters are likable and I really see Angie Harmon in my head when Karen is around.<br />One of the ironic parts for me was a majority of the book takes place on the week of Halloween, which is when I read it.<br />This book is a real page turner and I recommend it.

Very rarely is a book so engaging, rich, and compelling that I actually cry while reading it, but I cried four times while reading this book. It drew me in completely. It is a tad slow to start, but once it get's going it moves fast and relentlessly, like Katsa. The romance was heart-warming/wrenching and I don't think I've ever been so invested in a YA couple as I was in Katsa and Po. Katsa is easy to love and easy to sympathize with, just as Po and Bitterblue are. The adventure is pure and exciting. Now one of my favorite books.

030758836X|5.0|Generally, I think of mystery novels as pleasant, if often predictable, diversions from my \\"real\\" reading. Gone Girl is anything but. This is a genuine literary novel that happens to have at its center a sophisticated and highly satisfying mystery. And that makes it a mystery unlike nearly all others. The only things that come close to this brilliant novel by Gillian Flynn are the books in the Ripley series by Patricia Highsmith. I consider this high praise indeed.<br /><br />Although others have attempted to summarize the plot, I argue that it defies a succinct summary. That's because Gone Girl operates on multiple levels. There are the outward, observable activities that take place along a conventional time line and which on their own constitute a typical mystery. Then there are the inner motivations, feelings and attitudes of the book's two main characters: Amy and Nick, husband and wife. What goes on inside the heads of these two is difficult for the reader to discern, given that the outer evidence of their inner lives must be deciphered and pieced together in order to come to a basic understanding of what is actually happening at the novel's deeper level. Gillian Flynn is clearly a master at plotting, particularly because the characters inner lives are revealed in non-linear time, often via a diary written by Amy or through comments from some of the secondary characters.<br /><br />Just as Amy and Nick manipulate one another and the people around them, so Gillian Flynn manipulates her readers. She capitalizes on the expectations that we readers have developed through years of reading conventional mysteries, demonstrating that people tend to see not what is in front of them, but what they have been trained to expect. Thus, when the surprises start to unfold, we are startled into realizing that Gone Girl is not just any diversionary read. It is true literature.

1595141715|3.0|I liked it for the most part. I found myself to be annoyed by Hannah a lot, and I found most of her reasons for suicide really trivial. Then I remember how that felt in high school, like everything was the end of the world. I would have identified more with her if I was reading this at 15 or 16 instead of 21. I liked the end though, when Hannah started to give more insight into how she was feeling rather than what so-and-so did to make her life so miserable. I wish we had gotten more of that because obviously she had real clinical depression and emotional problems, I don't doubt that. I just wanted them to be fleshed out more.<br /><br />I mean the things that happened to her happen to everyone in different ways. I was objectified in high school. I was depressed over stupid things, and if I had killed myself I probably could have blamed people, too but it wouldn't have been fair. It just seemed really selfish to me to put that burden on these kids, you know? Now they know what they did was wrong and hopefully they learn from it but basically blaming them for HER decision to end HER life was ridiculous. It felt like she was suffering so she wanted to make everyone else suffer as well. Maybe you weren't really supposed to like Hannah, though. There were only a few times in the book that I actually felt sympathy for her.

0307959856|1.0|I listened to this book in audio format on a very long drive from Minnesota to Arizona. Sheer obstinacy kept me listening: could this book really be as bad as it seemed?  Yes!<br /><br />This is an un-compelling mystery involving a minor character from Pride and Prejudice and the ne'er-do-well George Wickham.  A great deal of time is spent in the head of Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very tedious place to be.  Constant unnecessary repetition of facts by three or more characters, as well as more detail than anyone would care to know about the legal system of Great Britain, felt like \\"padding\\" and left me drumming my fingers with frustration.<br /><br />This is a book about Darcy, Wickham, and every other male mentioned in P&P.  The beloved females so key to the enjoyment of P&P are but very vaguely limned characters.  They merely waft through the plot action and have barely half a dozen lines altogether.  Elizabeth is forever napping.  Lydia is the air-headed narcissist she always was.  Jane is a stock goodie-goodie, as is the housekeeper.  The ending is contrived, preposterous, and un-rewarding.<br /><br />This is a book unworthy of being used even as a doorstop.<br /><br />There's a reason classics are classics: they cannot be duplicated in sequels, and this book is no exception.
0575095830|5.0|REVIEW SUMMARY: Gritty mash-up of Western themes and Fantasy setting as only Abercrombie could do it.<br /><br />MY RATING: 4.5 Stars<br /><br />BRIEF SYNOPSIS: Shy South's home has been burned to the ground, her brother and sister stolen. To get them back Shy will have to brave the lawless frontier and all the savages that inhabit it.<br /><br />PROS: Great prose, Western themes mesh perfectly, return of beloved characters.<br /><br />CONS: Slightly drawn out, less interesting protagonists.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There are few things I look forward to more than the release of a new Abercrombie novel and Red Country does not disappoint.<br /><br />\\"The losers are always the villains, Sworbreck. Only winners can be heroes.\\"<br /><br />The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie is the very reason I got back into the fantasy genre after a five year hiatus of sticking strictly to science fiction. The First Law taught me that fantasy can be gritty and bloody and none too happily-ever-after. As a result I've spent that past several years sinking my teeth into any and all titles of the Sword & Sorcery sub-genre and I still have not found an author quite so engaging as Abercrombie. Red Country is a minor departure from the series, it still occupies the same overall setting but is layered with Western themes. I've never been huge into Westerns but I was eager to see how this would translate.<br /><br />Reading Red Country the first thing that struck me was just how appropriate the influence of the Western genre was on this particular piece. I'm sure that there are other fantasy novels that draw similar inspiration but I doubt that any wear it with such pride. The archetypes are present - the conquest of nature, the conflict between \\"civilized\\" and savage, the greed and cowardice of man, and the reliance on private justice. Such issues were already prevalent in The First Law trilogy, not to mention Abercrombie's standalone novels Best Served Cold and The Heroes, but Red Country gives them a different flavor altogether. Not only does Abercrombie demonstrate his knowledge of the Western genre but it is also evident that he genuinely respects it.<br /><br />Red Country primarily follows the perspectives of Shy South and Temple. There are also chapters where the perspective shifts to the supporting cast for a short time, broadening the scope of events and providing insights that might otherwise have been overlooked. I consider writing characters to be Abercrombie's strongest suit. I love all the vile, despicable, and ultimately human characters that inhabit his books. Abercrombie's characters are painted in shades of blood spattered gray. As in life, no one considers themselves a villain. Fans of the series will be pleased at the return of several beloved characters (one in particular but no spoilers here, thanks).<br /><br />The cast of Red Country is weaker than previous books but don't mistake that for weak overall. Shy South and Temple may not be as interesting as Logen Ninefingers, Inquisitor Glokta, Jezal dan Luthar, Whirrun of Bligh, Bremer dan Gorst, or Prince Calder but they are still good characters. Shy is probably the most decent human to ever star in an Abercrombie novel. She has her own demons but carries on living her life the best she can, providing for her family. Shy is neither a pedestrian sex-object nor an Amazonian whose sole motivation is revenge. She has strengths and displays moments of weakness and doubt. Temple is also a pretty decent fellow for a man who always takes the easy way out. Of all the characters he is by far the easiest to sympathize with as he struggles with cowardice and morality.<br /><br />And if we're going to talk cowardice and morality it would be criminal not to mention Shy's step-father-of-sorts, Lamb. Lamb is a coward as Shy is none too slow to point out. You could spit in Lamb's face and he would likely thank you for the privilege... that is, until the kidnapping of Shy's siblings Pit and Ro.Say one thing for Lamb, say he's a coward, but braving the wild and rescuing Pit and Ro will require a different sort of man. As the story progresses it becomes painfully apparent that Lamb has a violent past of his own. As the blood begins to spill and the bodies pile up a reader may wonder what is the greater cowardice, avoiding conflict at the expense of one's own pride or displaying one's true bloody self. What can I say, a man has to be realistic about these things.<br /><br />At times the plot does feel slightly drawn out. Red Country is a hefty novel that is concentrated around one plot thread. Our \\"heroes\\" embark on a looong journey and you can't help but feel the weight of it. Fortunately the story is always interesting, thanks in no small part to Abercrombie's wit and deft prose. Honestly, Abercrombie writes like no other. The language is contemporary (no thees or thous and plenty of eff this) but the grammar feels appropriately dated. The dialogue bears a distinctly Western swagger to it that I never tire of reading. Another aspect that really helps to round out the experience is the use of quotes before each new part of Red Country. I don't know how Abercrombie picks what quotes to include in his novels but they are always equal parts insightful and awesome, setting the tone for all the bloodshed and betrayal to come. Oh and what bloodshed there is! I would say that Red Country has the lowest body count of any Abercrombie novel to date but it's not the quantity that counts but the quality.<br /><br />Red Country is not an epic quest like The First Law trilogy, a tale of revenge like Best Served Cold, or a war story like The Heroes. You have to admire an author that is willing to take a necessary risk - not just with new characters but with new subject matter as well. There is a quest though it is hardly epic. There is revenge, though it is a byproduct. There is combat, though it bears much more resemblance to massacre than war. Red Country is personal in the way that only the very best Sword & Sorcery fiction is. My favorite moment of the novel is a take on the iconic saloon scene. The weight of violence hangs overhead throughout the scene until the tension finally gives and explodes into visceral action. It is classic Western. Much of Red Country could be considered the same, a respectful homage to a genre that lacks the popularity it once enjoyed. Were you to replace the swords with six-shooters you would have a Clint Eastwood blockbuster.<br /><br />Red Country may not be the novel that fans asked for (though I'm sure many will be pleased) but I get the feeling it was exactly the novel that Abercrombie wanted to write. I won't remember this as my favorite of his novels, but that's okay. This is still a fantastic read, and a unique one at that. This is the sort of book that makes you want to re-read the previous titles to see if there is anything you missed. The exploration of themes is Red Country's highest accomplishment. The characters are believable in their cowardice and their courage, and those recurring characters are bound to incite no small amount of excitement. The action is intense and grisly. The writing is finely constructed. The ending is surprisingly cheery. With The First Law trilogy Abercrombie showed me that not all fantasy has to be a Lord of the Rings knock off. With Red Law Abercrombie has showed me that there is still deeper to delve into with the Sword & Sorcery genre.

B007MB5OCE|4.0|Well, this is a novel totally unlike what we have been used to from the Nordic countries. This is no Mankell or Nesbo or about an angry, smart girl taking revenge.

The way some of the critics talked about all the kinky sex in this trilogy, I was a little skeptical about reading it. However, after a few chapters, you needed to find out what drove this Gray character to be the way he was and then how he was going to be able to overcome his fears.  I would certainly recommend<br />this book to others.
0312330537|3.0|The author lost me on page 23. You are not reading Dostoevsky. No mistake on that. If you can have compassion on author's human fallacy and focus on his love for his friends, you will be able to finish this book, with a little bit of skipping here and there. The author sees the suffering of the poor and express his respect to their compassion toward humanity. He sees the suffering of the lepers and their strength to turn curse into healing. He sees the brave fights of the heartbroken and their struggle to turn their bleeding into honor. There was certainly a lot of ballywood elements in this book and even though it is supposed to be autobiographical fiction, it was bit hard to believe due to one or two dimensional characters.

I'm not a musician, but i hear familiar strains of bluegrass, folk, balladry, Irish old sod music and even a gospel-type thing in their musical tapestry. I don't know how they can continue the innovation and remain true to their sound, but i hope to hear lots more from them. I haven't been this excited about a band since U2 came out!

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Everything about the album is top of the line. Much respect for a rapper promoting marriage equality. Proud to say he reps the 206.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful story for young and old to experience then discuss. This will enable kids to see things from different perspectives as Auggie tells his personal story of fear and courage, as well as how those close to him are affected by this new situation. This moving story is told with humor and a great deal of heart.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love mahjong and this a great app. The free edition is great you can reset your scores and play forever. You will not be sorry if you get this app.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome movie loved all the different \\"Heros\\" even the Hulk which is a change Mark did a wonderful job and well they all nailed it cant wait till the next one
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I LOVE DOCTOR WHO!!!!!!!! Finding the sixth season at a reasonable price was shocking and amazing! I am so grateful to have it. It works perfectly, no scratches and arrived a day early. Couldn't be more pleased!
B008PDROCQ|4.0|This version provides the same quality in music as the original version.  If you have the original version, save your money here.  Also, there are only 10 tracks on the CD and not 12 as advertised on amazon.com.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It's an old horror film, and the new ones just don't compare. I also think it was one of the best of Stephen King. His books are usually much better than the movies. It was creepy, and had that quality that all those old movies have. I loved it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Wonderful read!! I.finished it way too soon! The characters have amazing depth and the author did an amazing job keeping the story engaging throughout!
B004FP1WX0|3.0|This movie was interesting but a bit disturbing.  Honestly I can't tell if the journey the main character takes to meet his \\"online dream girl\\" was fake or real, if I were to guess I'd say it was fake.  But it doesn't matter because the subject matter of the move is easily understood.  Meeting, liking, then obsessing over someone online only to be disappointed by the truth of who and what they are about is something I'm sure a lot of people have done.
B00936A0ZW|2.0|I have been a fan since Racer X so I know Pauls music. This is not what I was expecting. One of those discs that I will never listen to again. I will pre-listen on all future releases before I buy. If you are a Racer X or Mr Big fan go buy one of those albums. Even all of Pauls solo stuff prior to this is great. I think maybe the wife should stay out of the music and the band. P.S. I never write reviews but you should be warned. Listen before you buy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put the book down!  The only thing I wasn't happy with was the ending.  It was disappointing I thought.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's a copy of were is my water with a different character, but with that being said, I really enjoyed the latter game, and i also enjoy this one as well
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Best one out there. The math problem to turn off the alarm is genius! Very happy with it. Only use the easiest math problem because I'm tired in the morning.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am addicted to this book.  I'm not quite finished it yet (I work full time and sometimes find it hard to squeeze in reading), but every spare minute I have - I pick up this book.  Have lost some of my favourite characters in this one, but that's the way it goes in this saga.  Definitely worth reading.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This series is amazing. I watch it every night! I've finished this first season and now I'm waiting daily for the new episodes!
B00979CS50|5.0|OK - how many 67 year old guys do you know who can rock like this, write like this and put a great album out almost 44 years after his first solo album?<br /><br />This is the best CD with Crazy Horse since \\"Ragged Glory\\". Some of Neil's best guitar playing in the past couple of decades, and perhaps ever. Old Black GROWLS on this release. Crazy Horse sounds GREAT, Ralph pushes the band.<br /><br />Highlights Disc 1: Pretty much the entire disc. The song \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" sounds like it should be on \\"Rust\\". It Rocks.  Born in Ontario belongs on \\"American Stars & Bars\\" - has a \\"Homegrown\\" vibe. The two epic songs - are that - EPIC. \\"Ramada Inn\\" is my favorite - almost 17 minutes of guitar bliss. Classic Neil and Crazy Horse. \\"Driftin Back\\" is 27+ minutes of epic guitar with Crazy Horse. Fun song. Who else can do this?<br /><br />Highlights Disc 2: \\"Twisted Road\\" is another good rocking song. Has a \\"Hawks and Doves\\" vibe (chord changes remind me of Union Man). Apparently the video is good although I have not seen it yet. \\"She's Always Dancing\\" is another of those classic Horse songs. Reminds me, for whatever reason, of Hurricane. That type of guitar playing. Great stuff. Seriously. \\"For the Love of Man\\" is a ballad and seems slightly out of place - but then so did \\"Running Dry\\" on Everybody Knows. Nice song. \\"Walk Like A Giant\\" is the third song over 10 minutes and to my ears the lesser of the three - but that's not a bad thing - it's like \\"Over and Over\\" on Ragged Glory - still very good! Great playing. I actually prefer the remix of the title song which resides on the second disc.<br /><br />If you are a Crazy Horse fan - you need this. That simple. It's not the gold medal standard - but damn it's close!<br /><br />My gripe: You need an electron microscope to read the lyrics and book. My bet is even Neil couldn't read his own words or the credits. Bad job.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Short and sweet: if you dig physical comedy, cult-show actors, movies that not only defy convention but pill-pop jokes on genres, this movie's for you. It doesn't start that way, though -- for the first five minutes, you might consider pressing STOP 'cause, yeah, this kinda looks cheap, unaffecting like the buzz-'n-deluge of pain appearance most bouncers are expected to sport these days, but it quickly achieves its tones and shtick. Yes, it's our two protagonists against an as-yet unknown antagonist. Yes, the good guys win in the end. But everything in between is slapstick and spraying blood, running gags and everyone running for their lives. Watch it if you loved: Shaun of the Dead, Hott Fuzz, Evil Dead/II, most legit slasher movies, Cabin In the Woods, and others.
B0086700CM|5.0|Happy Halloween!  This game works like a charm my daughter installed a couple of things on my kinddle including this and she loves it :D
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|They are keeping it fresh and exciting, with some new twists, new charactors and interesting situations... and plenty of Zombies!
B000ICXQOM|3.0|I bought the bluray Screwhead edition of Army of Darkness hoping to get the FULL version of the movie.  Many items have been cut out of the movie since it came out. This edition actually has less features than the dvd version did.  So needless to say I was disappointed.<br /><br />I am a fan of the movie, but cutting out scenes just takes the fun out of it.  I wish Sam Raimi would release an uneditted version of the movie!
1442346949|5.0|This book contains a unique and personal insight to steve job's life.  Simply amazing.<br /><br />The narrator also doesnt a fantastic job at clearly guiding you through the book, and making even dry material interesting.
B000MGBSI0|4.0|It came quickly but the packaging was a little smashed. I liked that this item came quickly as I am addicted to the show. There has been a couple skips in the dvd's but overall good.
0307887898|5.0|This book is really great for anyone who is considering starting a business.  It presents a very scientific approach to product development and helps a newbie understand that most successful businesses don't happen by mistake.  There are rather specific, tried and true methods that can help you to avoid wasting your valuable time and money.  It taught me a lot, and it is the most valuable startup book I have read so far.  I checked this out of from my local library.<br /><br />The bottom line: Your idea is only good if people want to buy what you are making; you won't know what people want until you ask them. You won't know what people don't like specifically, unless you ask them specifically :)
B0040UAYI4|1.0|I brought this thinking i would be able to play with a mouse and keyboard like on pc but when i put it on. this is shit this should not even be on amazon if you think this will be just like a pc dont get it stick with a dual shock
0425263916|5.0|This book was even better than Bared to you,we got to have more information on Gideon and his relationship with Ava,and why they are so obsessed with eachother.Their mutual pasts have brought them together like no other two people could be.I love this one book and have already pre-ordred the 3rd book.I cannot wait for he story to continue.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Thankyou G5, this is a great deal,  players have option to purchase city coins or investment cards to speed up their city building/progress,though you can reach goals with steady involvment with the app. Very enjoyable, good smooth graphics with easy on the ear virtual city sounds. More like pc apps that I can play on my KFHD
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hanger games series is a amazing trilligy of a girl names catniss who is under faced with some dificlet chanenges
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is an excellent app. The only critisism I can offer are some softer wake up sounds. Like wind chimes or birds that one might hear in the morning. A rooster crowing in the morning is the last thing I want to wake too. Easy to set, great huge snooze button, and the math problems to get your brain going are a great idea. It really works.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|If you haven't tried TED yet, you are in for a real surprise.  These 5 to 15 minute spots are not dumbed down for any general audience, and they contain things you just won't see on commercial tv
B00932IQIO|5.0|Excellent program.  I would recommend to anyone. Claire Danes and Mandy Patankin are amazing.  I believe this kind of thing does go on with State Department and CIA.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|Can't use the store to purchase icons, backgrounds or premium calendar.  Can't use multiple items because can't get premium.  Won't sync with google Calendar (probably because Amazon won't let kindles use google  Store.. and google calendar in their apps.. so not under Jorte's control, but still a problem for us who use kindle fire)  I hope this is resolved soon so we can at least use the store with our Amazon accounts.  Then definately 5 Stars!  I love Jorte on my phone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I fell in love with this book and with Christian.  The characters came to life and this book was better than the first.  I couldn't put it down and now reading the third book in this series. I would recommend everyone to read this trilogy because you will fall in love and have sympathy for Christian all at the same time.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Being a HUGE fan of Sailing to Philadelphia, (one of my desert island CD's), Rag Picker's Dream, and All the Roadrunning, I wondered if another solo Knopfler CD would be as impressive as those? This CD did not let me down. While other reviews are correct regarding the songs being more haunting and Irish or traditional in style, the CD is enjoyable in a fresh and creative Knopfler way. Yes, Get Lucky is different, but it still spotlight's Knopfler's genius as a song writer, story teller (So Far from the Clyde), genre bender, and accomplished guitarist. You Can't Beat the House, the third song, could fit on Sailing to Philadelphia for those looking for a more Dire Straits sound. But fortunately this CD is broader than that. Other songs like Get Lucky, Piper to the End and the incomparable Remembrance Day are musical events. One of my favorite CD's to listen to right now. My only regret is that I did not discover this CD sooner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you love it now waight till it gets a lot more updates it goes from good to omega amazing with every update.<br />thank you for trying this awesome game.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|This recording seems to displease those who expect Clark to stay in one lane.  To my ear, the recording is most interesting for the diversity of the selections.  While I also enjoy the distorted blues/rock tracks, I find it refreshing to listen to the songs that are of different genres.  I hope Mr. Clark continues to resist type-casting.  A very entertaining CD!
1476715904|4.0|Pretty much my entire face was leaking after I read the last page. I had myself a good long cry and now I feel so enlightened. I have a deeper outlook on the whole world. I'm not sure if this is from the book or listening to the Avett Brothers in the background the entire time I read! I am their newest fan. I loved the quotes from their songs that the author put before every chapter. I really enjoyed this book. I can't say 'Slammed' deserves the 4 stars I gave it from a literary standpoint. There was a lot lacking for me in the dialog and some scenes had an awful staged feel about them, but I still really loved it.<br /><br />Also... Slam poetry? No thanks.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|this device has two major problems and probably alot more minor ones. First when you try to load negatives it binds up and you have to giggle it to finally get it loaded but once you do it the down load was quick and easy and the results were awesome.  the 35MM film slides were a bust. If you think you can load all you old slides and get them in digital form think again.  The picture quality was terrible.  I tried the adjustment buttons and everything but the pictures were just unviewable on the computer.
B004FQX59I|5.0|This is more of a documentary than fiction. If you haven't seen it yet, you need to. It is dramatic, emotional, and truth telling. There is a lot of bad language but honestly, I've lived around that and know that it was meant to display the emotion happening at the time, and this is THE ONLY MOVIE I could tolerate it in. It will show you for sure, that the JFK assassination was NOT a one man job. Someone higher up than the secret service called them off that day. The president had no protection.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Unfortunately i can review the playback so the stars will reflect on the movie. THe movie is awesome the HD playback was horrible. The colors were terribly dark. The bluray disk play a beautiful picture on my TV so the issue isnt the end product. Hopefully Amazon Prime fixes this on their Stream Rate side of the house.
B000H30B2C|5.0|This movie to me was amazing, when I saw it at the theater, I knew I had to have it in my collection,it seems each time I watched it, I noticed more detail, that I didn't see before for some reason.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I've loved Enya ever since I first heard her as a second or third grade student in elementary school. Listen to her during homework, jogging, relaxing, cleaning -- everything. The one vocal artist that I find myself returning to over and over again. This particular selection is superb -- some of my favorite songs and some I've never heard before -- and the price is fantastic. Highly recommended.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie.... and the delivery via the Internet to my TV was flawless........ a must see to follow up on all the other Marvel movies about their characters...... Amazon is the way to go when you want to stream movies to your TV.... much better then Netflix
B0091REZMW|4.0|Haven't gotten all that far yet but enjoying it thus far ...keep waiting for the must buy to continue to pop up
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was so awesome. There is so much action. It was hard to put it down. As each chapter ends there is like a cliff hanger to get you into the next chapter. I really enjoyed the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a mix of temple run and jet pack Jo ride so if you like those games you will like this game its aswome but don't listen to me just play it for your self.
1451695195|5.0|This powerful story should be required reading for everyone. This is the book that finally uses science to understand the true nature of spirituality. In my life I've had many experiences that have shown me beyond any doubt that these higher realms the author describes do indeed exist and are more real than our physical world. Everything he writes about in his near-death experience is exactly what I myself have experienced. And he writes from an objective scientific perspective that rises above religion and dogma and traditional views of heaven and hell. Truly a blessing for the world!
B004P1JEXE|4.0|The story is ever evolving with great twists and turns. To be honest if you have read the last 2 books then you wont need to read this review as your mind should be already made up - buy it!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My daughter was so happy to get this book. She read it within three days because she could not  put it down. Thank you for providing us the opportunity to do business with you.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice game very polished and fun! A nice little twist on the match 3 game, sound and graphics are top notch looks like a keeper. Runs very well on Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Super convenient. More bells and whistles than my cell phone calculator. I highly recommend this for users of the Kindle Fire HD!
1423140605|5.0|I just finished the book and I've got to say wow! I loved the humour and the cliffhanger in the end. An easy read with a lot of adventure. Rick Roirdan did not disappoint although I wanted Jason, Frank, and Hazel's point of views too but I guess The House of Hades will contain them.
0062200399|5.0|I first read Stardust years ago in a cheap, paperback edition, and it is a great story. A few months ago, I was offered the opportunity to get a review copy of Stardust: The Gift Edition, which is a brand new hardcover edition of Neil Gaiman's classic tale. Naturally, I jumped on the opportunity as you can probably tell since I'm reviewing it.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with the story, Stardust is a fairy tale for adults. The story starts off with the tale of Dunstan Thorn and how he fell in love with an imprisoned fairy princess and had a child named Tristran with her. Many years later, this child, now a young man, heads off into Fairy to find a fallen star after making a foolish promise to a young woman. While there, he has a bunch of adventures that would take far too long to explain in detail. It's a cool story that's well worth reading.<br /><br />***Note: Due to the way this site works all reviews are combined, so if you aren't interested in getting a copy of the Gift Edition of this book, you may as well ignore the rest of this review***<br />You may wonder what it is about the Gift Edition that's so special. Well, like I already said, it a hardcover. In fact, it's a very nice looking hardcover. The cover looks a lot like the sort of covers they had back before the invention of dust jackets. It's just the image of a falling star with the title and the author's name that has been (I assume) stamped on with some sort of goldish-looking foil. It's very classy, and if you want a nice looking copy to sit on your shelf, this is the one for you.<br /><br />Besides that, it has some cool extras. There's a new introduction by Gaiman. There's an excerpt of an unfinished novel that Stardust was originally going to be a sort of prequel to. There are also some new illustrations by Charles Vess. All of this makes it a great book to by if you love Stardust, don't have the original heavily-illustrated DC comics version, and want an illustrated copy (or want to read the extras).read the extras).
B003NX76BM|5.0|I've read every Nora  Roberts book there is and this one is by far one of my favorites. The story is solid with amazing characters and my.favorite dogs.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Be prepared for outstanding twists & turns in this story of a man & woman in conflict.<br />Easy to read & relate to in this modern day romance gone array.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this has to be the best dragon game i ever played<br />the dragons in this are so cute and well designed
B004XUMR4U|5.0|**No Spoilers** It has been my experience that in almost every series (especially in comedies and light dramas) there is one or two episodes that really stand out as heart wrenching or otherwise more memorable than most other episodes. In M*A*S*H it was \\"Follies of the Living - Concerns of the Dead\\", in Futurama it was \\"Jurassic Bark\\" and for Firefly, for me, it is this episode. The humor and drama is still there as is the growing camaraderie among the crew but added to that is a deeper look into Mal's and Zoe's mutual past.<br /><br />This brief expedition into their time during the war helps us to understand a little more of how their growth was affected by the people they encountered and ran with.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A fascinating story! If I only owned and read the first part known as \\"WOOL 1\\" and then had to order the rest of the mini stories known as \\"WOOL 2 thru WOOL 5\\" I would have not have read any more of the book. In my mind it bordered on nonsense.<br />However, the author, Hugh Howey, finished with a pleasant and interesting story.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|This is a must for anyone who is at least a little interested in how a billion people live in this mysterious continent. Fiction yes, but it is the real thing.
B0000BX8FT|5.0|The Very Best of Cher is an awesome collection of Cher songs, spanning from her 1965's All I Really Want To Do all the way to 2001's Living Proof. While the US edition has 21 tracks and is packaged with Live!

B00846REIS|5.0|I could not put the book down, I read the book in 2 days which is usual for me. I can't wait for the last book to come out entwined.<br />We could use a few more Gidegons as boyfriends or husbands in the world.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great sequel to The Lion.  Although this got a little wordy in places, stick with it because it pays off in the end.  Sometimes hard to tell who's the bad guy, The Panther and his crew, the Yemeni gov't, or the CIA.  John Corey is in rare form.  This book really gives you an appreciation for what are guys are dealing with in the mid East.  Can't wait for DeMille's next one.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Outstanding blu ray set! Loads of bonus material and extras. A must have for any movie collection. Buy them now!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I had this game for a few weeks and played everyday with no problems.  However in the past 2 days, it forces closed after every room.  If they don't fix the issues I will un-install it.
B008OJ8BM8|5.0|This is a great Album.  I enjoyed it very much and for this price you can not beat it.  More Words
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I enjoy this game but it makes my phone crash. (Evo) Bummer. I had to uninstall.<br />fill. fill. fill. fill. fill.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show!! It's just soaks you in the moment and has you sitting on the edge of your seat!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual Nelson DeMille does not disappoint. John Corey is again on the hunt or should I say bait for the bad guys again. John is at most cunning as well as being his usual witty conversationalist.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|To be honest, I loved this book! I was addicted and stayed up all night to finish it. I fell in love with the characters and the title is the most perfect title. Travis's and Pigeon's relationship is a beautiful disaster. It's beautiful because when it comes down to it, they love eachother. The are addicted to one another and how each makes either feel. Their realationship is so dysfunctional and unhealthy but this story shows you sometimes if you go thru the fights,tears and craziness; what you get out at the end is eachother and you survived it. And if you still love eachother then the fight was worth it and find some peace within. I love it, i want more, always been a sucker for the bad boy, sometimes they can change and be fixed. I'm married to one;)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the app.  My son and I enjoy puzzles.  There is a touch sensitivity issue but otherwise we enjoy the game.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Sometime hard to understand what to do next. Difficult to see some of the major game objects to get bonuses.
B008KE3960|5.0|Fun game!!! Adds a new meaning to the term tower defense. It like flight control plus bloons td!!!! Totally recommeded.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a really fun game and its very addictive. Needs more free ones to start the game though. just saying
B00913DPW2|1.0|couldnt even get past the first challenge, no hints. I found the key, the map and still couldnt get in the door
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The begging picked up from the second book very well. But I felt like the ending was very rushed and it has to many scenes to jump back and fourth too.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Swap two tiles to make groups of at least three in a row. It's a common theme, but Call of Atlantis attempted to be a bit more.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is made more interesting in a number of ways:<br />to win, you must get special pieces to drop out of the bottom of the level. Making matches is just a means to that end.<br />there are special bonuses (extra lives, extra time, eliminate all tiles of a selected type, swap two non-special tiles, destroy a 3x3 block of tiles)<br />obstacles include bricks that prevent special pieces from falling out the bottom of a column, \\"locked\\" pieces that cannot be moved until they are made a part of one or two matches, \\"frozen\\" pieces that cannot be moved and will not fall (causing gaps underneath them) until they are a part of one or two matches.<br /><br />The gameplay seems pretty well balanced for the several dozen levels in the game. You start out easy, get more difficult, and then have slightly more difficult levels as time goes on--but you get more time as well. I was concerned in the early stages that I would run out of powerups and lives and would have to start over the entire game from the first level; fortunately, I beat the game with a decent amount remaining. I am surprised they didn't make the game free and have in-app purchases for powerups. Also note each level has a slightly different layout, which is nice.<br /><br />In addition to enhancing the gameplay, they attempted to make the game stand out by adding a story element. There's something about recovering crystals and Atlantis, with text on the special abilities of the crystals and the different historical cities--none of which makes an ounce of difference in the game. There are two minigames: one where you trace a finger along a path (extremely easy) and one where you pick what object most belongs in given places in a scene (easy). Frankly, these elements all seem pointless--I feel they could have dropped the minigames and the story and just had it asa fun puzzle game.<br /><br />After fighting through all those levels and going through the basic story, I was looking forward to the ending... and was very disappointed when there wasn't one! After I finished the final level and final minigames, after all that story buildup about these epic crystals and powers... nothing happened. It just showed a brief message about playing the game over and started my back at level one. What a letdown.<br /><br />Overall a good game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the first five books and bought them because the price was right and then became totally immersed in the world of the silos.  Rarely has a book so engaged me- I read it avidly, worried for the characters, tried to imagine where the author was going (which I'm exceptionally good at) and failed and had to put the book down numerous times to calm myself down and fight my anxiety over what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Wow, just loved the writing, the character development, the story, the frightening plausibility, the unexpected twists, the way the plot built- the books were just wonderful.  I read a lot of science fiction and I could literally smell that silo, visualize the faces and outfits, the attitudes and all the action.  It was exciting, nerve-wracking and never dull.  Please, sir, can I have some more?
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game! I love the dragons and everything in it! The dragons are so cute and fun to watch.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing. Brilliant plot that weaves the character throughout history in implausibly funny ways. I would highly recommend this book.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|After many years of \\"you should really watch this movie, dad\\", I finally watched it.... and then bought it... /shame on me, for calling myself a \\"Shakespeare fan\\"- what a terrific adaptation... It now is in a 1st place tie with my other favorite 'modern' adaptation of WS- \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" [aka 'The Taming of the Shrew']...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I cannot put this game down. levels continue to build in difficulty and new buildings and features are always popping up. loving this game for kindle!
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Story is classic and a must read.  There are many ebook versions of this story.  This one doesn't have a table of contents.  If that isn't important to you then the story is the same.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It's a book about running, and perhaps more importantly, about life lessons. Engaging from start to finish, and well-paced, like one of those beautifully executed long distance runs that are described in this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|games aren't my thing, but Flow is in a class of it's own.<br /> it has a challenge for almost any level of mental workout.<br /> it's simple, fun and truly rewarding.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app helps determine how long to fully charge and what length of time you have for each type of use with your battery reserve. it even allows you to calibrate for mor precise information.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I got this game cause it was good on Pc. I get it than I cant install it. then it wanted me to pay again. I try again and still wont work. If you know how to fix this problem please tell me.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This four-disc pack was worth every penny (I think it was approximately $28 total for me but because I pre-ordered the Combo Pack I got a $5 discount later).<br /><br />When I opened the pack it contained a DVD, a 3D Blu-ray disc, a 2D Blu-ray disc, and a digital copy. I immediately loaded the digital copy to my iMac, Apple laptop, and iPhone via iTunes. No problems with following the instructions contained within the disc pack.<br /><br />I played the 3D version Blu-ray disc and I watched the entire movie. Really, the 3D was nice in certain scenes but for the most part, the Avengers wasn't much of a 3D spectacle.  I think that the 3D version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" with Jim Carrey was more impressive from a 3D perspective. But that aside, I watched the Avengers in 2D and it was fine as well.<br /><br />There was this feature called \\"Second Screen\\" that allows you to watch the movie while giving you background information on characters and scenes via your iPhone and iPad.  It took forever to figure out how to get this feature to work as the instructions are not very clear.  But since this was an \\"extra\\" and not the main reason that I bought the Combo Pack then it wasn't such a big deal once I figured it out.<br /><br />Other than figuring out how to get \\"Second Screen\\" to work, I enjoyed everything else (deleted scenes, director's commentary, etc.) immensely. There could be no better Christmas gift for the Marvel super-hero fan than this Combo Pack.  Also there are other options to order an Avengers poster, etc.  (I'd pass on the poster. I ordered it and it's cheesy. It's something that a five-year might like.).<br /><br />I'm not much into rock music so I can't give you a review on the soundtrack album included in the Combo Pack. But still this is a good deal for the buck!
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|First - why is this called The Grey? Most of the wolves were black.<br />Anyhow, this is just an okay movie. Entertaining enough, but full of kind of dumb things that keep one from truly enjoying the movie.<br />For instance the fake look of the wolves was REALLY distracting.<br />Also, the behavior of the wolves wasn't really true to life. And a pack of wolves is generally about 10 wolves - 15 is a pretty big pack. There is a scene where it is dark and you can only hear the wolves, it sounded like there were 50 wolves out there. That just doesn't happen.<br /><br />Character development was also just so-so. The Liam Neeson character is the only one that is at all developed. Isn't it kind of film making 101 to make sure that the viewers care about the central characters? Who cares if anyone dies if you don't feel anything for them? I'm talking just movies here, not real life.<br /><br />The good thing about the movie is that the premise was interesting.<br /><br />Should you watch this movie? Eh, if nothing better is available it is at least entertaining.
B005ZO4TOO|5.0|My kids havent seen this yet, but I have thumbed through it to make sure all pieces were intact. This is a wonderful, detailed book. I wish I had one when I was younger. I am putting it in our christmas box for the kids to open on christmas eve with some hot chocolate, new christman pjs, christmas movies, this book, and another one. Should be some fun memories :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Hours of fun...challenging on the upper levels which make you think..a great Kindle game...Playrix makes terrific software, so please keep them coming..
0345803485|1.0|I found this book to be utterly without taste or merit.  I tossed it in the garbage after getting a quarter of the way through when a friend told me it didn't get any better.  It is pornography disguised as literary fiction.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|Very fun and sets a good foundation for principles of algebra. Our six year old who is advanced in math loves it. But I play it too.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninja is a lot of fun.  I downloaded it because my son was already playing and it looked like it was a blast.  I always figured that I could do better.  I was wrong!  It's a fun little game...but don't think that you'll beat the kids.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Five star app all the way! Has all the features and options so I no longer have to switch in and out of multiple pic editing apps to edit a single pic. This one does it all which is unbelievable for a FREE app! Two thumbs up, five stars, and kudos to the developers!
B000OLGCI4|4.0|This is one of my examples of a Disney classic done great! It's one of those films where it's not a fairy tale, but doesn't need to be. The music is wild, especially \\"I Wanna Be Like You.\\"  I really like how this is a \\"babysitter\\" kind of movie where Bagheera the cranky panther must watch over a stubborn man cub like Mowgli, and Baloo doesn't seem to help him. The funniest moment between Baloo and Bagheera is when Bagheera gives a speech for Baloo who then takes it proudly, and makes Bagheera feel duped. Also, Shere Khan is a great villain, especially because he's a tiger. He's sophisticated, gentlemanly, but evil and deadly at the same time. Kaa is great too. He may not be the main villain or Shere Khan's henchman, but with all the popularity around him, he might as well be. Mowgli is remininscing of a protagonist with a difficult story; stubborn and rude but still a fun boy. King Louie's character is confusing for me. He kidnaps Mowgli, yet he is used for the fun bright side stuff of this movie? Oh well. Personally, I still really enjoy this. For a film that's no fairy tale, it does a great job!
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Well the price was great. shipped to my house on time. The only problem I had was it looked like it had been in storage for awhile. Other than that it's all good. would recommend.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett's ability to bring history to life is unparalleled. A worthy sequel to Fall of Giants and just as fascinating as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. Can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Ridley Scott scores four stars with this fascinating, neatly dovetailed prequel to the Aliens series. It also sets the stage for what could ba a spectacular new set of sequels to this new story thread. Very much worth viewing... especially with the Engineer Speaks and alternate endings components (which should have been in the original release).
B001ILFUDC|5.0|If I had to choose a favorite Disney movie to be made by Walt Disney himself, then that would definetly be \\"Pinocchio.\\" The main reason is because of Pinocchio, himself. is cute, innocent, and much more delightful than the jerk in the book. Jiminy Cricket is also a fun sidekick character. He's charming, he sings softly, he definetly knows between right and wrong, and he is only crabby when something goes wrong. Figaro the cat is cute and bratty, such a delightful comic relief. The song \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" is soft and delightful. Also, the music video on this edition is one of the few Disney music videos I personally approve of. The only thing I pan about this movie is Stromboli and the Coachman. They both make the movie dark, and neither get punished. Luckily though, that's not the focus of the film. This is definetly one of Walt Disney's greatest films for a reason!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I like the game, because it first makes you earn your money to buy all the objects for your fishtank, although pricey, the game you play requires alertness, fast action thus using your brain, and hand-eye co-ordination. You have a time limit for each level. Your object is to create a balance of fish, plants and decor thus achieving a beautiful graphic fishtank w/music accompanied by lovely swimmming variety of fish, turtles and seahorses. Your money is earned by gaining points and moving thru each level. I would reccomend this game to Seniors as it's not too difficult to do, you keep the mind active, and have fun watching your tank come to life. We all know watching the fishtank is very calming for the soul!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|At times, confusing, and I really never could figure the whole meaning of this book. I understand that human beings are cruel, and that we will probably self destruct, and/or blow our selves up, it was depressing. I know that there had to be a point made, but it was not strong enough for me.  It will be interesting to see how they make this into a movie. Maybe for once the movie might be better than the book.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I do nto buy to many CD's any more since outside of the popular songs the rest of most cd's suck. That is 100% not ture with this album. I can listen to this and there new one over and over. There is not a bad song. Just an amazingly well done.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Despite all the bad reviews and the dark theme of the book I myself do not think this is a horrible book. J.K. Rowling is a very talented author, and her style of writing is - as always - colourful and witty. The reason I gave this book three stars is becase it was so painful to read. Oh my god, it was painful. I am not the kind of person who puts down  a book, but about fifty pages into the book, I was filled with inexplicable hatred for everything in my life  - my friends, my family, even myself. It is amazing how manipulative this book can be. The absolute absence of even a hint of happiness within the characters and the plot is one of the reasons this book makes me rage for no apparent reason. That all of the people in this book have hearts of coal and reflect human selfishness in every aspect is another. I was seriously tempted to stop reading midway, because this book was ruining my mood and destroying my faith in humanity. After finishing, however, and looking back, this was actually composed pretty well. It had the touch of philosophy I value the most in books, and the vocabulary was splendid. I wouldnt recommend this book, but it still is a great item. Kinda like Damien except with a more pessimistic overlook. All i hope for is that Rowling will release another young adult masterpeice, of which the literal world is lacking.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was one of the best books... All kind of messed up but in a great way! It had me wanting more I loved it!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love Nelson Demille's writing and have read almost all of his other books.  The Panther was very good reading overall but at times was too long on story and not enough action compared to most of his other books.  There were only two spots in the book where the reader was captivated by what was going on in the story.  The attack on the road to the small town where the drones sprang into action saving the good guys and when John Corey, Brenner and Kate caught up to the Panther's camp.<br /><br />I can't wait until he spins another tale and Detective Corey and Kate Mayfield are in the center of the action.
B000TEPJOY|5.0|If you like jazz and don't have this album, get it!!  Cannonball, Miles, Blakey, Hank Jones do I need to say more?
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Nicely built, heavy cables with gold plating on the connectors. They work fine for my set up and are good value. Can't fault this product.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book touched my soul. The adversity that Adam overcame to become the man he was is simply amazing and there is no question that without God, Adam could never have achieved the things he did. This book is a true celebration of his life and while I mourn his death I also understand that this book may never have been written without it.
1423140605|5.0|So amazing! Can't wait till next fall! Great ending and got it the day it came out so very happy!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Space Nazis, from the moon.  If you're looking for Citizen Kane, keep looking.  If you're looking something funny,sly and entertaining, give it a try.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I loved the show on Broadway. All of the songs on this CD seemed to be produced in a studio as there was no interference from the audience. The songs are great and, after having seen the play, a lot of the hidden clues in the lyrics make sense! I never picked up on some of the foretelling of what was going to happen. It was quite clever the way the lyricists did this. There is not one track on this CD that I do not thoroughly enjoy. If you love the play then get this CD as it will bring back a lot of good memories from the show!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a dood solitare set up, allows you to select a randow deal or one the is winable evey time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Unreal! One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time. From start to finish the book felt original and extremely well written. Each chapter gradually reveals more of the mysteries hidden within, while at the same time opening your mind to more and more questions? I found myself contemplating countless different endings and even how this could relate to our own possible future. It manages to deliver a great message of hope and promise, without ever approaching \\"preachy\\" or \\"righteous\\" overtones. I'd recommend this book to almost anyone, which is the beauty of it. You don't have to like Sci-Fi, Apocalyptic Fiction or any genre it might be labeled as... it is just an all-around great read for anyone who loves well written original material that will leave you contemplating our existence and legacy for long after you put it down!Thank you Hugh Howey!
B007MDB548|5.0|My 4yr old, 2yr old, husband and I absolutely loved this movie.  It has a really good story line and is overall another great hit.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Definately not an Alien prequel - sort of a sideways nod to the film, which is only fair since they re-used the H.R. Geiger props.  Basically - they just bit off way more than they could chew with this one.<br /><br />This film reminds me very much of the movie \\"Below\\" - it doesn't know if if wants to be a sci-fi action film, a thriller, a horror, or a commentary.  In the end, it does well holding your attention, but fails to satisfy. Seems like they just lost focus on what type of film they were trying to make - very sad, because it got off to a very good start.  Delivers on the tag-line \\"questions will be answered,\\" just not the questions you thought should be answered.<br /><br />All things considered - a straight-up remake of Alien would probably have been a better film.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|I like Alan Parsons work. I can listen to this many times over. In the car,at home or on the boom box.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is very hard to put down its so suspenseful and delightful to resd . i recommend it to everyone. will be reading the next one of the series soon.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Since many years I have owned the previous release of Karajan's Bruckner cycle. The first thing I MUST say before any other statement: this set is identical of the original recordings. There have been NO upgradings regarding to the sound, whatsoever. Though I decided to buy this copy due to an accident in my apartment (water touched some of my scores, CDs and books!), originally I was NOT planned to buy this set.<br />I heard some complains about the price of the original Box, let me put it clear: I purchased my original set at Gramola's at the Graben, I. Bezirk in Wien (Vienna). The price, twenty years ago, was about the same than I paid for this set! The quality is equal the same, which is fine with me. Just for your information.<br /><br />Since my youth I have been an absolute freak of Bruckner. Though I am a pianist in profession, I feel the greatest affinity with this composer, after all.<br />His works are NEVER ever to be get tired of. There are superb versions besides Karajan of Anton Bruckner's symphonies. I believe the greatest Bruckner conductor, besides Karajan is undoubtedly; Wilhelm Furtwaengler. There exist today SUPERB Bruckner Symphony versions at Pristine Classical Records of this conductor. The versions are recorded in the 1940's and beginning of the 1950's. Some of them could really compete with the recording quality of Karajan! Really: you can check it out here: [...]<br />There are also other great Bucknarians: one of them is certainly Eugen Jochum. I have listened to Paternostro too.. but do not consider him in this gallery of famed Brucknarians.<br /><br />So if you haven't bought, or heard the Bruckner-Karajan: THIS one is warmly recommended. If you want to be adventurous, go to Pristine Records. I also came across it, 'magically' through Amazon. Because MANY people were talking about this great phenomenon in the classical music recording business. I was taken by storm by it.. and have bought a close to 100 albums there. All online with Flac files (incomparable with the amateur style  iTunes!!).<br />Good luck,<br />And start to LOVE BRUCKNER..he amateur style  iTunes!!).  Good luck,  And start to LOVE BRUCKNER..
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I was excited to begin The Redbreast after reading reviews from others.  It is quite hard to follow at the beginning with all the foreign names, I recommend making a note on paper as you go along so that you can easily refer back and keep track of the characters.  It is important to try to read them in the correct order, I am now on the third, translated into English, Harry Hole book.  They do follow a story thread.  Brilliant stories.  I have to say that I think the Kindle additions are not great, hard to tell at times if there are sections missing.  I would prefer to read the paper copies.
B007SGM084|5.0|A bit erotic for my taste, but had a wonderful story line.a brest read.couldrnt put it down.will read again on vacation.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is great.  The only drawback is it takes a while to breed and evolve. I work long hours so it isntnan issue for me its perfect!
B006S08RLU|5.0|One of the great French films of all time! Visually stunning! It will just make you smile for 90 minutes.
B007RI56NY|5.0|This album is a good album, it's got a personalized type music on it. The band is great. I recommend this album.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Must admit I was pleasantly surprised... I actually listened to the samples and said, \\"I don't think so... just another 50 Shades gimmick!\\"  I was ordering another CD, and then thought what the heck... I'll save shipping if I order two! That was one of the best decisions I've ever made! What a fabulous listen... whether or not you're a fan of the Trilogy!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I was not able to put it down until i had finished it. Cannot wait to find out what happens next.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Downloaded this video to my Kindle Fire, for a flight to Hawaii. The download was fast and the clarity of the picture was great. The sound and ability to stop and start within a 24 hour period.<br /><br />I waited to rent this movie do to the reviews. I enjoyed every minute of if and recommend it to all sci-fi junkies.<br />Enjoy
B005USZYDU|4.0|I love Theodore Boone! He makes me wish to be 13 again, because I have a mad crush on him. The episodes in \\"kitty court\\" are delightful and make my day - tell John Grisham, we want to watch this kid grow up!
B004GYY714|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS APP!! I can tune in to any radio station in the country no matter where I am. Worked great on a long road trip when my car radio couldn't pick up a station, just tuned in to TUNEIN and found several stations to listen too while I was driving. Told my family to get this app for there android devices & they all love it also. Works great in airports, on airplanes, trains & in their bathrooms.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoy the storyline. Cannot get enough of it. Could not wait to find out what happens in the next book.
B001EHDQFO|4.0|A Great incite to why we do things unconsciously & how we can change ourselves consciously, to help to improve our lives now and into the future.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Story line continues with an unexpected twist in events in Gideon and Eva's relationship. Can their relationship continue? Have to wait till May for book 3 to find out. Too bad for that long wait.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I only used this product once to download some read only file at work. It worked as it said it would.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Unbelievable, really sad that this is the end, no more stories. Awesome read, never the less. Could not put it down for a minute.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|Purchased this product for my 4 month old grandson and he loves it. It only took him a minute to figure out that if he touches the snail it will play music and move.  Also, the mirror is an added bonus as he loves to look in a mirror and talk to the baby inside.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I originally caught this on PBS and absolutely loved it. From alfi boe to Samantha barks, the cast sings with emotion and you will get caught up in it, I guarantee it!
B006ZS4FE8|1.0|I got this at Toys R Us for $89, free shipping to my house.  Amazon was selling it for $144.<br />I'm excited to give this to my girls for Christmas.  I have girls and boys-- I love that they can play Legos together and both create lands that they love.  (We got the boys Lord of the Rings castles, with horses!)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Hi, I'm Kristopher, author of [[ASIN:B009AIXFPU Moonlight Witches (Book 1)]]<br /><br />This Saga is never ending of wonderful imagination and heart thrilling action. Bella and Edward continue to grow strong together and love each other passionately. But the ONLY thing i didn't like this book is that Jacob never get to be with Bella.<br /><br />Jacob the charcter in the book is my idol and my hero. He has same personality as i do when it come to love. I am very passionate about love. Jacob made me and create the better person out of me. I alway been a romance kind of person but with Jacob, i grew stronger. That kind of thing when it come to love, it what it needed!<br /><br />I happy for Bella and Edward. But sorry, I am Jacob's biggest fan, and i am alway his.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love love this game its very fun to play when your killing time. its also great for kids to play as well. my kids really enjoy playing it as much as I do.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Love this book. Is interesting and very informative about the main subject: the turn in to modern times. Also I like the kindle format, quick and easy...
B000007XUQ|5.0|I like this cd, great memento, the first cd just a holiday music then a vocal voice from Karen Carpenter. I say this is a very classic Christmas Collection CD. It brings a significant meaning of Christmas holiday, that is family together with love.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw and loved the movie before I read the book.  The book was great.  Much more detail, of course, then the movie and hard to put down once I started reading. I don't have a lot of time to read so I read mostly at night so I just finished reading it last night.  The ending was a lot different then the movie so now I can hardly wait to start reading the second book.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Amazing film. And a great DVD case. Isn't a hard plastic one like all the other ones, it's more like paper and is really nice
B005K0HDGE|5.0|You just can't go wrong with a Stephen King book. I haven't reached the end but I am tearing through it. It's a great story so far.
0385535147|5.0|I have not been a big John Grisham fan but I loved this book.  It is very rare that I read a book in two nights but I did this one.  I had to keep on to see where it was going.  Sure some of it is far fetched but I read for entertainment.  If I want realism, I can watch the news.  I highly recommend it.
0345803493|5.0|Despite all of the sex,this really is an exciting and adorable love story. When Anastasia describes the way Christian looks at her with the eyes and the erotic look on his face full of desire and lust and this and that,and after reading just the way he looks at her I find myself holding my breath and I can picture him. I too think of him as being UNBELIEVABLY SEXY and irresistible yet i have never met the guy! I love this book, put aside all the 1 page-long-sex and it really is a cute love story of a young couple that likes sex.. now what is wrong about that? They love each other? So why not? In my opinion I would purchase this book 1,000 times more just to show the author how much i adored her work, but I don't think i would like having all these copies laying around. :p And as for the sex, it is totally NOT repetitive. in fact I believe she does such an amazing job at varying where they do it and how she describes everything that comes after that.
B008DW6VOQ|2.0|This is not close to some of the other finanicial apps I use. I was very disappointed and have used it sparingly. I use Bloomberg.com all the time when I am at a PC.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I loved all Cornwells earlier books. But the past five or so have been stale. None of her characters are likable anymore. Lucy is psycho, Kay is bitter, Marino is sour. And what Bennett see's in her is a mystery. And the story line was predictable and lazy. I agree with other reviews....she's lost her creativity and is just churning out books to make a dollar. Save your money. And your time.
B00975L81Y|4.0|Yes, this is Cradle, and that is a good thing. After ten studio recordings they have managed not to change from what they feel comfortable doing. This is what we have come to expect from this band; more of the same relentless, horror themed metal. Some may complain that Cradle has not top early recordings or that the band just can't grow. That is not why people are fans of them. Fans want this and they are happy to produce the same type of songs we expect. If you're a fan you will buy this regardless, if you're not then you are missing a great soundtrack to horror. Bottom line, this is their best effort in a while and a worth a listen.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I've bought this movie most likely cause it was on 3D, there isn't many films on 3D, about the movie, I like it, I mean, I'm a big fun of syfy movies, so I've seen a lot of them, this one is ok!!!<br />I can't really say anymore than that.......
0763644765|5.0|We got this when we started introducing our daughter (at 16 months) to the potty even though we thought it seemed ridiculous... She LOVES it! She insists on having this particular book whenever she sits on her potty, she &#34;reads&#34; it herself now and sounds it out (which is super amusing to us), and when she goes potty she now mimics the book by saying &#34;hooray!&#34; A simple book that is a great accessory to potty training.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Kept me interested from start to finish, same as the first book. Can hardly wait for the next book to come out.
160774273X|5.0|Ken's directions are so very clean, so specific, and if you follow what he says you can't miss.  It was the best bread I've ever made.  Crispy crust had the best crunch and the bread was just as good the second day.  And it was easy to make.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|I enjoyed how each chapter gave both myth and truth to the reader. It gave us a better understanding and appreciation on how magical the truth is.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Once again, Taylor Swift uses both her writing and vocal talent to deliver yet another outstanding album.<br /><br />This time around, she continues to provide fans with the fun and upbeat tunes along with the traditional country songs we have become used to over the span of her career. However, she also seems to ad some other elements into the mix showcasing both her growth as an artist and her growth from a girl into a woman.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best songs on the album are probably the upbeat and catchy tracks \\"22,\\" \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"Holy Ground\\" along with the more subtle works like the title track \\"Red,\\" \\"All To Well\\" and \\"Starlight.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this album to any country music fan.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book. Easy reading and holds your interest to see what happens next.<br />I hope he is not let down by civilian life.
0425263916|3.0|Reflected in You I will say was better then Bared to You, the first book in the series. I found this book to break away from the Fifty Shades of Grey copy cat storyline and break out on its own, which i appreciated. I just could not get into the characters still, I found Eva to be annoying and whiny. Gideon was over baring, jealous, twisted, and has major issues that I could not deal with in a boyfriend no matter how much money he has.<br /><br />I couldn't get into their love affair. Found it over the top, not real, and too quick for only dating a month. Their constant fighting then having sex was the base of their relationship... very healthy right?<br /><br />I will read the next book, that doesn't even come out until May 2013 but don't mind the wait. That tells me something on how much I am into this book.<br /><br />I give Reflected in You 2.5 Stars
B003DTLUFO|5.0|BRS is just like shown! She came in great condition and without a long wait for shipping! A lot of little pieces (of course)-tiny legs, arms and fists- and is pose-able only standing or \\"sliding\\" in a crouched position but she comes with the sword and massive gun so she doesn't need much. You can either have her hood up or down- its two separate heads- and the blue flame on her eye is a little tricky to put on but totally worth it when it finally clicks into place!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Love this movie. Tugs on the heart strings! One of the best movies Sandra bullock has ever done! Get it today!
B0063IH60K|3.0|play on my Kindle fire cause I love it just hats all the ads ads ads ads ads ads why??? they are repeated and repeaters
B004J1DBJI|5.0|As long as you have wifi around you, this app is great. It gives you answers and shows you step by step how to do problems. I use to have problems doing derivatives, this helped so much. Must buy for calculus and upper math levels. It's GREAT!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors.  I feel I learn the background of historical events through the characters In his novels.  A friend who read it said he thought the story was a little far fetched.  But what happened to the characters toward the end very closely matched my family's lives in Europe in World War II.  Sometimes identically to the events my father relayed to me.  It helped me better understand my family history and my parents.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Action packed James Bond film.  This one keeps you on the edge of your seat and moves fast.  Lots of action, I feel the film is more so than in the past, and I like seeing the haywire side of a James Bond gone Rogue!!
B004P1JEWU|4.0|An excellent book that keeps you guessing all the way through.  When you feel that you have identified a main character, the author surprises you by killing them off.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Was slightly dissappointed after reading Bared to You. I enjoyed Bared to you and would definitely recommend it for your next read.
B0079NQZLE|3.0|This is definitely the same concept as the Hunger Games except with more blood, so I wonder if the author actually wrote the Hunger Games ... hmm ..<br /><br />I don't like gore or horror - but I felt like I was watching a Godzilla movie instead of an intense movie about how the world will ruin itself and force kids to kill each other to survive. There were a few moments I enjoyed the concept of the movie, because it will come to life; eventually. I expected a little more, but then again .. I love Godzilla.
B008RTE09S|4.0|Sir Paul has stood by this film for many years. He defended it in the \\"Anthology\\" interviews in '95 and he took the time to do a commentary track for the Blu-ray release. Viewing the film in restored clarity made me realize that Magical Mystery Tour is a sort of diamond in the rough... buried two feet underground.... in solid waste. However, there are some interesting things going on here. It's ahead of its time in many ways. For example, ways of editing scenes that have actually become far more commonplace now than in the era it was produced. On the other hand, the whole film is pretty silly and everyone involved spent more time smoking herbal jazz cigarettes than trying to create a riveting viewing experience.<br /><br />If you aren't a Beatles fan, you may want to steer clear. For Beatles fans, however, it's worth watching if for no other reason than the \\"I am the Walrus\\" sequence. This is a great little music video from a time when there was no such thing.<br /><br />Check out the extras as well for some interesting bits. T & A alert... you'll see a lot more of the stripper than you did in the final film.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I think I enjoyed the concept of Snow White being a dark tale instead of a Disney fairy tale... but this totally missed the mark.  It was an OK movie, I enjoyed many of the scenes and the actors - but I was left wanting more.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Fantastic album. Beautiful piano and cello arrangements of contemporary and classic songs. If you haven't seen any of their Youtube videos, definitely check them out.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|I hadn't seen the movie since release but just watched it on blu-ray. I've played two or three of the PoP games, and I felt they did a great job recreating the world and stunts of the games, while not requiring any background in the games to enjoy. The story works pretty well and utilizes the time travel component effectively. Both the leads fit their parts and had nice chemistry.
0375507256|5.0|As I was warned, Cloud Atlas was very difficult at first. Each story was seemingly connected in the barest, most generic forced way. So much so that at the end of the fourth story I was ready to toss it aside and think of it as over-hyped crap disguised as \\"literature\\".<br /><br />At some point it all clicks for you, though, and you think, \\"This is genius...\\" Suddenly each individual story is not only entertaining, but the echoes of the other parts become almost surreal. I was up until 2 or 3 AM every night reading the second half, eagerly anticipating everything to come and sad once it passed.
B004SBX112|5.0|This game is very challenging but do able. Truely enjoyible game to just sit and relax with. I would recommend to anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|These are wonderful!  Just good bold fashioned adventures with plenty of action, historical references, and suspense to keep you turning the pages!
B008NEVP1S|5.0|This is a CD that gets played over and over.  Aimee Mann is a wonder with words and stringing them together with music.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I eat, sleep, nd live this game ....beat it so much time can't help but replay it..... &lt;3 &lt;3 there should be more weapons upgrade
B008OIQYTG|5.0|As always, Lee doesn't disappoint.  A lot of great guitar work.  I highly recommend this album.  Worth the wait.<br />I love the tune 'Maybe Tomorrow'.  Nice vocal and vintage Lee.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Surprisingly good quality of sound and vision.<br />great energy due to interaction of house musicians and stars.<br />was this really a chance encounter?
B004MC0FO8|3.0|I really dont want to do a review on this product right now since i have not had a chance to use it much at all. where is the delete button.
B005EGXTEE|3.0|I decided to read this book after all of the hype that it created upon its release. I found the book to be very easy to read, and it certainly does leave you wanting to read the second installment (Catching Fire). However, I did find it to be a little immature in places, and would have preferred if it was written more for adults rather than for the teen lit. market. I‘d still recommend giving it a read, especially if you're looking for something easy to read either before bed or on your lunch break.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Written so you couldn't wait to get to the next chapter as every other chapter was told from Nick's perspective and the next Amy's. Kept my interest throughout. Not sure I really liked the ending but it was a very exiting book to read.
