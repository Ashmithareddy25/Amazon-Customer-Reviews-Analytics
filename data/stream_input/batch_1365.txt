B003WTE886|5.0|This is my favorite TS album besides the first one. I really love the song Story of US and her new one for Hunger Games is amazing! This album is worth buying!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really liked the game was kinds hard to move up though with no instruction s on how to play some of games had to figure it out
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is my favorite book. Finally a big-selling book that deserves the attention! All the songs are coming out for the movie and I cant wait! Gotta shout-out my favorite book with a review!
0307593312|5.0|I can't imagine how someone could be anything less then blown away by this book. I was interested in reading it more for the bad reviews then for the good ones. I was curious to see a terrible or uninteresting work by a master, any master, Fellini, Bergman Marquez or Murakami.<br />Instead, I found myself unable to put down this tour de force. I believe it is Murakami's most interesting, accessible and brilliant work. In a time, when absolute truths have been mediafied out of existence, when reality itself is being manipulated in ways we can't even begin to fathom and we just sit there, as emptied eyed voyeurs to this mass delusion, 1Q84 (at least for me) provides that rare metaphorical anchor, that at least for a moment helps me remember everything I've forgotten.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I purchased this cover at the same time as the Kindle Fire....wished I hadn't. It is flimsy and uncomfortable in the hand when reading, won't stand up properly for reading hands free in the normal paperback way, and you will want to do this with the fire because of it's weight...your hand, especially the thumb will tire quickly. You can read it hands-free in the horizontal position, but it collapses when you tap to turn page, etc. A waste of money....
B001EO748M|5.0|This series on the Tudor family is the only television series I have ever purchased. Henry VIII is one of the most important movers-and-shakers in history, and these episodes give us an eye-witness view of the forces which created our world today. Many people who are now household names are all part of Henry's story. Love him or hate him, you can't understand Western history unless you know the saga of Henry VIII.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a very nice lightly padded case that protects the Fire without being intrusive.  I have had it for a month and it is holding up well.  It is soft plastic and closes over the Fire like a book cover.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I loved this game on the pc now I can play it where ever I go.  haven't had any issues.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Hercules is by far the greatest movie ever created.  The song list in the movie is amazing as well.  It is a great family movie and is totally worth watching! :)
B0042XXANK|5.0|THE SIX MILLON DOLLAR MAN, SEASON 1, IN ITALIAN<br /><br />It is good to be able to view an exciting TV series like The Six Million Dollar Man or the Bionic Woman in Italian. I shall want to collect these box sets!<br /><br />I did not realise when I first viewed season 1 in English the emotional impact the conversion to being bionic it had on Colonel Austin as well as it had in consequence on his surgeon and furthermore on the big financier in a different way and on Oscar Goldman. At first the relationship was poor between the latter and Colonel Steve Austin but in time as we see it improved and they became good friends. I like stories like this whereby there is a positive turnover with the nature of the main characters and whereby the main character does not just neutralize or kill the bad guys but also helps the emotionally afflicted. I recommend this season for viewers!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 in 1 is great. I mean not only do get a game to play, you 101 games altogether. It's pretty addicting once you start playing, but fun!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I own this game on my personal computer and now I get to take it on the go with my phone.  Awesome!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Even my three year old lives playing this game.  It had provided countless hours of entertainment and keeps him occupied during our long commute home.
0062082353|5.0|an absolutley riviting book but I wouldn't recommend it to the ladies and definitly not to anyone under 16.As a retired  Navy chief I can say it's the real deal. One problem. It wasn't long enough.I wanted to know more. When do we begin filming?
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I found this by accident.  I have a number of real pins in my basement and this plays like a real table. Good pastime when sitting at an airport.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to read. Easy to find passages. Easy to use. I find that I am going to enjoy using more and more.
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|Honestly one of the worst movies i've seen. Glad I didnt pay the like 18 bucks it cost to see it in 3D.
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|I watched this as a child and was traumatized! The wicked \\"witch\\" in this movie has a corridor full of the heads of her victims which she puts on herself whenever she wants to change her appearance. This is not the fanciful dream of Oz #1; this is a nightmare! NOT a kid's movie. I'm glad it was scrapped.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie - for three times up to now. Despite the major flaws in its storyline, there are plenty of reasons for that (and I don't mean the ending scene, which is gorgeous also from a open-minded physical standpoint of view): The opening scene. The visualization of the sun. The score. And the well-defined use of visual effects. But one question remains: WHY, OH WHY not avoid the numerous logical errors? I hope that there will someday be a director for a remake who knows something about science - or who stoops to ask a scientist. Because this could have been one of the best SF movies ever, not just one of the most beautiful ones.
0439023513|5.0|I started reading The Hunger Games series about 4 days ago and just haven't been able to put my Kindle down. I just had to know what was going to happen next. The first two books were fabulous and after seeing so many negative reviews of Mockingjay I was nervous that my love of the series would be shattered. Boy was I suprised that Mockingjay was completely riveting and as emotionally charged as ever! I find it so amusing that so many people complained about Katniss' character development in the final installment. They say that she changed and is suddenly \\"un-likeable\\". Well the fact of the matter is that Katniss has never been likeable! I have pretty much hated her from day one! She isn't the character that you are supposed to like, that role falls to Peeta as well as Gale and the other tributes. On that note, while reading the Twilight series, I never particularly liked Bella at all. She was pessimistic, annoying and undeserving of any sympathy. The characters that I fell in love with were all around her. That same formula is very prevelent in The Hunger Games trilogy and doesn't change in the final book. I won't go into spoilers about the direction the story takes, but I will say that the ending made me burst into tears. I have only cried while reading three times;at the end of BreakingDawn, in the middle of Catching Fire when they are giving their interviews and Peeta announces the \\"pregnancy\\" and the last page of Mockingjay. Please disreguard the negative reviews and give the book a chance for yourself. If you read the first two books, there is NO WAY you won't want to finish the series! It definitely does not disappoint!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|definitely beats the other office suites out there. most compatible with Asus transformer and keyboard dock. don't waste your money on other ones :-)
B00011CZRE|5.0|I love this movie.  I watched it again recently and I still get excited during the suspensful parts.  A classic.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun game.  Needs a better tutorial.  Ends abruptly in quest mode with no real resolution to the story.  Good for killing time,  though.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Excellent movie! Hope it wins an academy award. Great acting, writing, screenplay & directing. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of this movie.<br /><br />Thank You :-)
B004A7UVLC|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching Sherlock.  To redo such a revered set of books and movies, one must come up with a mix of the old and the new.  They  have done this by speeding up the show, putting it in modern times, and having Sherlock be slightly over the top.  It's fun and clever.  My only question i Sherlock sociopathic, or does he have Asberger's syndrome?  He is certainly a genius.  Watch it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The overall design of the app is great. The music is wonderfully relaxing as well. Puzzles will keep you entertained for hours.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|The actual size of the book-hard plastic sleeve is bigger than the pictures can really show, It does not fit on my DVD rack. Awesome show, tons and tons of awesome extras, including the Atomic County series based on Seths comic. I have owned all 4 season on separate DVD sets, which I traded in years ago. This complete series has a few behind the scenes looks and extras those separate DVD sets didn't have. Still my favorite show I always kicked myself for trading it in, but I been checking on this item for a while now, and had a decent price drop from what it used to be, and purchased this item, as it has been my favorite show, at least until the creator, co-created Chuck which just may have beat the OC for my favorite. I only fear that this big DVD book will not age well over time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I use titanium backup to keep my save state indefinitely. thanks to cyanogenmod the game loads super fast! Motorola Defy
B0073PQ720|1.0|Just watched the movie last night. Bad choice for a Friday night! Bad movie! My wife didn't like it either and she is a big fan of Ryan Gosling. Music score was OK. The movie is very slow going with lots of silent scenes which don't help at all. I'm not against silent scenes in general when they are done right and help the mood of the movie or help audience to understand the character but in this movie it was just frustrating. I was not expecting this much blood and plain cruelty from this movie. It is also very light on car chases, which I actually DID expect from a \\"Drive\\" movie. I do not recommend this movie.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Much has been written about the quality of these blu-ray discs.  I am here to add my voice to the positives.  They look fantastic on our HDTV!  Considering the age of the films, they look a LOT better than other blu-ray discs of movies from this time.  If you are looking for something on the level of quality of the Avatar blu-ray, you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for the best quality versions of these films, look no further.<br /><br />The only negative I can find is that the director's cuts are not included.  But that can be found on the DVD versions for pretty cheap, so it's not a big deal to me.  I can only hope that the Animated Series, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise will one day get the blu-ray treatment.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is amazing. do quests, fight monsters, craft. I love it! join the tear coast server! monks are the most fun to play!
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|i like how the used ones cost more than the new ones. Not much of a suprise from a unoficial sellers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great way to waste time in a long car ride, or when nothing is on Tv! I'm glad I downloaded this FREE ap!
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|awesome movie , fast shipping , good price, no  skipping, glitches , nothing wrong with it at all , its perfect, will purchase again.
0439023491|5.0|Let me say, I started reading at 7p and finished by noon the next day...target audience is young adults, but all the adults in my family have finished the series and we bought it as a Christmas gift for my 12yr old nephew!
B0015DROBO|4.0|In truth,when I first heard of the novel I thought it stupid. Invalid really. Then the movie came out and I was curious as to if it was any good. I didn't think it would be. I'm glad I was wrong. This is a very attention grabbing novel that is suitable for many types of readers. I look forward to reading The Girl Who Played With Fire. I understand Mikael is a important character,but I think they should have done more insight on Salander. But nonetheless its a great novel id recommend to anyone.
0470901071|5.0|This book is invaluable to anyone seeking to obtain the CCNA certification.  The book arrived quickly and in excellent shape!
B000GCFO0S|5.0|Being a original Silent Hill gaming fan and owning most of the games I can say this is one of the few game to movie crossovers that actually does justice to the original Silent Hill mythos vibe. Sure one can improvements regarding screenplays that might include even more from the game worlds but they did an excellent job overall. This movie could stand alone as a classic horror flick for even those unfamiliar with the games.<br /><br />I hate writing reviews that reveal the entire story, so if you like horror/ghost type movies this is a must have.<br /><br />The HD Blu-ray transfer is quite good and i certainly hope they do the second movie.
0439023491|5.0|Definitely held my attention from the get go - what an imagination!<br /><br />I was completely immersed into the action and sometimes was not sure which of the potential boys would get Katniss in the end -- I loved them both.<br /><br />The portrayal of suppression and nearly impossible odds kept me wondering just how they were going to pull through it.  Thoroughly captivating - highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun mini games that are challenging!! I can play for hours at a time!  Worth a download now!!
B005KELQEU|4.0|I received the kindle case in the mail one day early. It was hard getting the packaging out of the mail box though. After that, I opened it and I put my kindle in it, it fits. If you want a cheap case get this.
1582701709|5.0|this book has changed my life for good.. I was never into reading and somehow this turned out to be first book and has been my fav books of all that have read ..... plz plz people do read this book atleast once in yourlifetime...
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I looked forward to this book.  What a far fetched, drug out story.  I do give the author credit for her creativity in writing most of  this book from a 5 year old's point of view.  This was my only positive in recommending this book to anyone.  Basically a drag.
0385040253|5.0|I was looking for a complete book relating to knots and how they were being used.  This book gave me that information and how many differant ties were related to the same knot.  The histroy behind each knot was the best part of the book.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Package arrived Super Fast. Brand New Orignal and in Sealed Package just as stated!<br />so Thankfull for My Twilight Movie to add to my collections
0062060562|5.0|This story begins with Christine a 27 year old woman who wakes up one morning<br />with a strange man by her side and in a strange bed.  She believes that the strange man beside her must be a one-night-stand.  she probably drank too much and couldn't remember.  She then goes into the bathroom and looks in the mirror and finds a unfamiliar, middle-aged face peering at her.  The man comes in and explains that he is her husband Ben and that she is 47 years old and was in a terrible accident 20 years ago, which left her with a head injury.<br /><br />Ben is a school teacher and one day while he is at work, Christine receives an unusual call from a Dr. Nash, a neuropsychologist who claims to be interested in her case and has been working with her, leading her to keep a journal of her daily activities and thoughts.  He lets her know that her husband is unaware of him, his calls and sessions with her.  She then hides her journal in the back of her closet and does not tell her husband.  You wonder if Dr. Nash is sincerely interested in helping her regain her memory or part of it OR is he interested in furthering his career?  She asks Ben what her life was like before the accident.  Why did she and Ben not have any children?  What did she work at before the accident?  What happened in that terrible accident that caused her loss of memory?  Everyday when she wakes up she has no memory of what she had done the day before, until she reads her journal, when Ben is at work.  She has flashbacks and records every little thing and every activity.<br />This continues until................<br /><br />The novel is paced very well and is believable.  Every page holds your interest until the thriller ending. This novel has to be one of the best books I've read.<br /><br />FELICITATIONS Mr. Watson for an outstanding debut novel.
B006M9NJFG|1.0|I really loved this Canteen at first. I've had it for 3 years now and I have rarely used it. The Cap has broken, it screwed on and then the top popped off. I contacted [Thompsons Tools] since Gerber offers a lifetime warranty. They have not replied, I just wanted to know who I had to deal with to talk about warranty. Poor costumer service from the seller, and a poor quickly Canteen. Very displeased :'(
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was beautiful and so much fun. Just hard enough to challenge without making one crazy. My boyfriend and I played together and it took about 4 hours. I only wish it had been longer. Well worth the 2 bucks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Personally, I think it is a good game. The more games you beat the more games you get. It is also very addicting. Some of the games are too many points but overall it is a good game.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This ap is amazing.  Works very well on Kindle Fire.  I never used Google calendar before, but have set up multiple calendars and they all sync well together so various types of events can have distinct colors in the display. I definitely recommend this one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Without spoiling the story, there isn't much to say about this last book.  I know exactly why I zipped through The Hunger Games and Catching Fire-- I am fascinated by survival of the fittest scenarios, and both of the first two books provided that in their own way.  The girlier parts of me appreciated the romantic element in the triology (::cough::teampeeta::cough::), but even if that had not been a factor, I would have enjoyed the books immensely.  Mockingjay did not share that terrifying, car-wreck-you-can't-turn-away-from feeling that drew me into the original story, and therefore, it wasn't as enjoyable a read.<br /><br />[Oh gracious... I should stop to clarify-- I would never condone the Hunger Games, obviously; that's not what I mean at all.  But you are granted a certain freedom in fiction to indulge those grittiest parts of your humanity, or inhumanity, and therein lies my \\"fascination\\".  I would be terrified if any of these events actually evolved into reality.<br /><br />Right, so I'm not a terrible person.  It's important that all the random Amazon review-reading citizens of the internet know that.  Moving along...]<br /><br />Mockingjay was to this series what Return of the Jedi was to Star Wars.  It tied up, or in some cases simply severed, loose ends, it brought what we all knew was coming to fruition, and it did so while introducing a new cast of characters, as had been done in each of the previous books, for us to adore or detest.  I wish there had been more development of some of the key figures in this final book, as many of the most interesting ones don't seem to last very long.  It's difficult to become attached to characters, and thus become emotionally devastated when they are inevitably killed off, when you don't have the opportunity to grow to love them.  Maybe the book needed to be longer, or maybe there needed to be more dialogue.  Maybe Suzanne should write another couple of books (I would never object to this) from the perspective of these characters to provide us with deeper insight.  At any rate, don't expect to find yourself on the emotional rollercoaster you may have experienced with books 1 and 2.<br /><br />That said, I still read the book with incredible curiosity and enthusiasm, if only to determine which of Katniss' love interests wins her fickle heart and how the final blows against the Capitol play out.  Some reviewers for this final installment of the series seem to feel very passionately that it was a waste of their time and money.  I have to disagree, and remind readers that you can't always get what you want... but Ms. Collins gives us what we needed, desperately, and that is, simply, the end of her fabulous tale of societal change.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I actually didn't even bother finishing this one.  It was very slow at the beginning and then when the story started to slowly pick up there still wasn't enough.  I ended with about 3-4 chapters left and was okay not finishing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this good games for the price I paid. I had some control issue on my kindle. it could be better.
0307891372|5.0|So comprehensive would be worth more. If it exists it is located in this game guide. Especially enjoy the complicated pictures and diagrams
1594203334|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying I have a lot of family in France and I am a total Francophile. So I cannot say that I'm entirely objective about this book.<br /><br />That said, it's brilliant. It's both interesting and informative. The principles outlined are actually quite basic, but very important. And for some reason, American parents have either lost these principles or never had them to begin with. For example, I cannot count how many times a child has come to my house for a play date and NOT acknoledged me with a simple greeting. The French would never allow that. and he author has a wonderfully thoughtful explanation as to why teaching children to greet adults is so important.<br /><br />Just like any a a renting book, you should not expect to agree with everything. For example, whereas the author devotes an entire chapter to the importance of French mothers having a job outside the house, I find that to be shortsighted. Stay-at-home mothers can have very, full rich lives without working. It's a matter of balancing personal needs and interests with domestic responsibities. Not hard to do, and the end result can be wonderful.<br /><br />My advice - if you have children then read the book. It's never too late to teach them new things and never too late for you to adopt new parenting tools.
B006ON41FC|5.0|One word &quot;EPIC&quot; this game is a blast the 3d is decent. It is pretty smooth some lag sometimes. All in all addictive and very playable.<br />Droid X2
0062082353|5.0|Book arrived early & in good condition. Can only rate the service as I have not yet read the book. However, I have read the info provided on cover flaps, & I believe it will be a good read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|My daughters favorite game. She plays it all the time in the car on the way home from school. Love it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Once I got started I couldn't put it down.  I introduced it to my kid and he got caught up in it, and according to him dad doesn't know what a good book is.  Well now maybe he'll listen to me, probably not.  Any way it was easy reading and kept my attention.
B0071QIN00|5.0|this game is so fun my sister is so good at it! she's even better than me! level 8 is so fun!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|If you like these type of games then you will love this one.  Great gameplay and music. Smooth graphics as well.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|i don't care what others may say.  this is a great movie and was very entertaining.<br />wish i would have seen it at the theater...................as well.
B005T86J0I|4.0|yeah... we all know Hugh from \\"House\\" and from other stuff too- but you have to listen to his music- good vibes and quite talented bunch of artists on this album- I often recommend this to others!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|when i bought this movie i was expecting it to look EXACTLY like it does in the picture. when i received it, it turned  about to be the limited edition of this movie with the glass lenticular slid-y case. at first i was kind of upset cuz it wasnt what i was expecting but i ended up liking it better then what was actually pictured.
B003BVK36Q|2.0|I read LeCarre for relaxation between more serious subject matter and this book was hardly relaxing. This offering from John LeCarre' was a tiresome read for me and I found myself on page 172 when the thin plot finally began to avail itself. Character development was painful at best as was evidenced with \\"Issa\\" the primary subject, whose story remains cloudy and not believable.Tommy Brue, a German banker holding what amounts to be a clandestine money account from a Russian officer that was guilty of crimes in Chechnya was the broadest stroke LeCarre painted, but a secondary player and still a bit thin. The same is true of Annabelle who is a German lawyer attempting to get Issa citizenship.Others pop in and out of the story line and left this reader constantly trying to recollect the various roles these men and women were supposed to be playing, simply aggravating. I've enjoyed other books from John LeCarre' but A Most Wanted Man was read and found wanting and a sheer disappointment in this readers eyes.
B0033Q5AUI|3.0|i like the whole twilight series in general but breaking dawn is my least favorite. for one thing there is no book where readers can read edwards thoughts and another thing i didnt like was the fact that WAAAAYY TOO much emphasis was put on bella. i feel like if the author didnt put as much attention on bella and focused on other characters besides her and jacob the book wouldve been better.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Totally addicting. Love that you can buy outfits for the squirrel! Wish you didn't have start completely over each time you hit something...
B00009TB5G|5.0|this movie is soo good. i love the whole series. i hate the huge cliff hanger at the end but hey thats why the producers did that so u can buy the next movie.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I am using this on a machine I run as a gaming server.  It is mounted to an AM3+ AMD FX-6100 6-core cpu on a Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 (Rev 1.0) board.<br /><br />With the stock cooler, I was overheating when my server was hitting high capacity.  Often, I was going over 70C- not a good sign.  I got one of these, as suggested by MaximumPC and was shocked at the temp difference.<br /><br />The machine no longer randomly shuts off, and the temps are ~30C lower.  I am a system builder and I know how to properly add the thermal paste (and amounts to use).  I tried re-applying the thermal paste to the stock cooler twice, but it still had the overheating issue with no OC.  While the system may only have 2 case fans, I think it should have performed better.  The highest temp I have observed with this CM cooler is 51C (much better than the 75C I was often getting on stock & underclocked).<br /><br />This cooler is extremely impressive, and the price makes it perfect.  The included instructions are not the best- so I would do what other commenters have suggested, grab the video on youtube if you have any questions.  I found it to be fairly simple after knowing what notches the backplate had to be positioned in for my socket.<br /><br />Also, measure your case.  This cooler JUST BARELY fits in my Silverstone mid-size tower.  When I was putting the cover back on, I was crossing my fingers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its great for when you're bore and have nothing to do. it makes me mad sometimes but it serves its purpose.
0756405890|3.0|Subtitled Day One of the King Killer Chronicles (which makes more sense after you've read a bit).<br /><br />I find myself struggling with this review just as I did with reading this book. On the one hand the author Patrick Rothfuss clearly has significant skill with words and with character building. On the other there was a spark of enjoyment missing from beginning to end.<br /><br />The book is cleverly structured to present a story within a story (and stories within that). There are echoes of both the storytelling craft and musical craft used throughout the book. It's too clever for its own good, because it repeatedly draws my attention away from the story and to the structure of the story.<br /><br />Characters are introduced and given remarkable depth with very short descriptions. Only to never appear in the story again. Leaving me to wonder why I was made so interested in them in the first place.<br /><br />Places are lovingly described as are historical tales. And yet the whole world remains completely unconnected in my head. As though it was nothing more than a handful of skillfully described places that don't really connect to each other.<br /><br />And oh the descriptions! Everything is described. In minute detail. Whether it is remotely relevant or not.<br /><br />None of this would matter if the central character was suitably interesting and the main thrust of the plot exciting enough. But he's not and it's not.<br /><br />There is an over-arching plot but it barely moves over the course of 700 pages. And our \\"hero\\" is an arrogant over-achiever who is apparently excpitonally good at everything. With that level of brilliance any setbacks he faces seem arbitrary and insignificant.<br /><br />Propping the plot up with references to some darker events to happen later are a cheap way to add depth to either plot or character and mainly just irritated me.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book. There are many good things about it and I can see why it has been well reviewed. But the real test is that I have no incentive to read the second volume.ell reviewed.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|The simplicity of \\"Take Shelter,\\" Jeff Nichols' critically acclaimed 2011 art-house film, is its brilliance. From the opening scene, when a man stands alone and studies an approaching storm, there's a deep instinctive chord that rings like the chime of distant sirens. Storms kill, and nature's ominous fury can scatter humans like so many insects. The storm's pall covers the film through a series of dreams, and its producing a dark rain drenching the land in \\"motor oil\\" sludge. On a regular basis, we read about global warming and its effects upon our planet. We watch Werner Herzog's 2007 documentary [[ASIN:B001DWNUDI Encounters at the End of the World [Blu-ray]]], in which a population of isolated scientists working in the Antarctica respond unanimously without hesitation that its affects are increasing on a monthly basis. Hurricanes and tornadoes are more numerous than ever before, slamming New Orleans and Joplin, Missouri. Ancient ice is cracking for the first time in recorded history. Something terrifyingly dangerous is on the horizon and it's marching towards us.<br /><br />The always interesting actor Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a modest Ohio family man who struggles to make ends meet. He wears a hardhat on the job as a contractor, sweating daily with machines that drill into the delicate earth to create trenches. He works alongside his best friend Dewart (Shea Whigham), brown-bagging lunch and having a beer afterwards at the local pub. In the morning, he has a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart). Their daughter is deaf, and they discuss the difficult finances that might allow her corrective surgery. The vivid dreams continue with the world wracked by storms and an unseen menace attacking his home. We learn mental illness runs in his family and Curtis, in a beautifully subtle scene, pays a visit to his mother (Kathy Baker) who suffers from schizophrenia. Finding no comfortable answers,he checks in with the family doctor and tries to explain his terrifying visions. Curtis cannot overcome a deep, growing dread of approaching danger, and he is soon constructing elaborate additions to the backyard tornado shelter.<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" is one of those rare films where one is never sure what is going to happen next. There is suspense, but the drama's driving force is Curtis' attempts to remain calm when terror is just beneath his panicked surface. Every fiber of his being is telling him to take shelter with his family, and he jeopardizes a good life to do just that. We're never sure if the visions are valid or if Curtis is suffering an extraordinary mental breakdown, but his irrational behavior soon alienates friends and neighbors.<br /><br />There is no convenient category to place \\"Take Shelter\\" into, though one could call it a quiet version of M. Night Shyamalan's underrated 2008 film [[ASIN:B001HOZWUG The Happening]]. This is also a darker version of Phil Alden Robinson's whimsical 1989 work [[ASIN:B001YV504U Field of Dreams [Blu-ray]]], in which a farmer (Kevin Costner) hears voices and risks his family and career to build a baseball field. But Costner's character was hearing a voice of God, while Shannon's Curtis is possessed by hellish visions of approaching doom. There's a small thread connecting these films in that, the undeniable strength of respectful love holds a couple together no matter the chaos. Chastain's Samantha (in an equally strong performance) is horrified by her husband's behavior, but chooses to stand by him because she knows the goodness within. Together they bore a child and life, and she's not going to give it up easily. With growing unease she takes the helm, making plans to overcome his choices that have risked their financial future.<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" is a disturbingly subtle document of modern times, when the fear of environmental catastrophe, financial recession and the destruction of America's working middle class looms over the land. Curtis' difficult attempts to find proper health care and financing for his daughter's surgery is another stressor having great relevance. It's no wonder all of us don't have breakdowns, looking for protective shelter to ride out a tsunami which may end American society as we know it. Curtis is crumbling from the pressure, but Samantha refuses to allow him to succumb, and together they nod in agreement to face the coming storm.<br /><br />With a few thought provoking moments, what Nichols' incredible work has done is provide profound inspiration to every family struggling to survive. \\"Take Shelter\\" is a film for adults wrought with the humble responsibilities of raising a family, who have avoided by necessity the numbing drugs of 24-hour technological consumerism. Lyrical and haunting, it is a classic statement of the 21st century.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds Free is 100% awesome but I mean really awesome!!It's even better than I thought!!You'll want to play it everyday of your life!GREAT APP!!!
0955153077|5.0|I've been using Photoshop since it's inception, and I'm learning a lot from this book. I highly recommend it to all levels of Photoshop users. Unlike a lot of tutorials or books\DVDs out there (I'm looking at you Gnomon), this book is not afraid to share \\"secrets\\" of their techniques. It's not a lot of filler, but rather some really great tips and overviews of how to use the tools, and how best to use them to achieve specific techniques. Even with years of photoshop experience I'm learning a lot from this book, as well as some nice reminders of basic foundation art skills. One of the best art books I've ever purchased.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this app because there is a free demo and has classic mode. That's what I like best.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|cool game I love playing this so much.it's. amazing you should love this it rocking my world. this game is cool and funny
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Wow, I agree w/other reviewers - awesome to find this unique little Magnolia gem!! The acting is great - I have seen and liked Katrina Bowden (30 Rock) and Alan Tudyk (lots, including Serenity) - but everyone is enjoyable and believable - I wonder how they do it without laughing! Tucker and Dale are a hilarious and edearing team. This is so fun, silly, and warped!! It's bloody too. I thought that this movie (the writing and acting) was waaaaaaay better than MANY other bigger comedy, slasher, AND spoof films. I plan on watching this movie more than once and I rarely do that.
0061906220|5.0|I teach elementary school music. I was nervous at first that this would be too baby-ish for my students but they absolutely LOVE it. Even my 5th graders enjoy it (and they are hard to please!) The song is catchy - they all sing along. Do not hesitate to buy this book. You will be very happy with it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|There just aren't enough of these old quest style games.  Despite some reviews to the contrary, I found the navigation very intuitive.  The puzzles were just challenging enough not to drive you crazy and the graphics were beautiful!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|What a great movie! I had planned to read the book before watching it but sadly I didn't get the chance. This movie really hit home with me because I was raised in the south during the time the movie was set. Unlike the white characters presented, we were not wealthy so my experience was somewhat different.There are several instances of disturbing racism in this movie, but I see them as important to use as a yardstick to measure just how far we have come in a relatively short time. I know there is room for improvement and this movie makes you want to try harder. Great casting, very believable characters and dialog!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I find this app to be very useful and helpful.  Web pages, emails, pdfs, they all go quickly into Evernote and then are on my iPad, kindle and smartphone.  Folders make notes easy to find, even on the smallest screen.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|To be honest, this album was a letdown the first, and the second, and the third time I listened.  My response was \\"wow, is that \\"pop\\"\\".  Something pulled me back, maybe instinct told me that like some of my other favorite albums, discovery isn't always immediate.<br /><br />I did keep coming back, and I finally got it.  It helped to listen to this at some volume on really fine headphones with a serious amp.  Wow.<br /><br />This album is amazingly complex and sophisticated, with stunning production bringing hooky but off-beat tunes to real life.  The album just rocks.  Fantastic bass lines, ambient synths, and a guitarist that plays so fast it's sometimes hard to keep pace...  In fact, on lesser gear his playing was so much defter than the system could resolve I had thought he was SLOW.  Sia's harmonies and over-dubs are spot-on cool harmonies.<br /><br />Don't dismiss this album until you listen on some serious gear.  The production is big, lightly compressed or maybe even not compressed at all (listen to the gorgeous \\"I'm in here\\" piano/vocal number to really hear how delicate the production really is. If your gear is really good you can clearly pick out some back ground synths that on first listen I totally missed...<br /><br />The bottom line is this is currently my favorite of her albums.  The sound went from \\"geese this is teeny bopper\\" to \\"Play that again, please\\".
B00005N6KG|3.0|These are an excellent value, but due to their unusual design, they may not fit your head. I have a large head, and no matter how I try to adjust them, they just don't stay in my ears when I move around, so I find them useful only for static situations.<br /><br />When I stay still, they aren't bad. But I don't stay still for long. So, 3 stars.
B00656C6KK|2.0|I was disappointed in the songs that were on the album.  I always enjoyed so many of her other songs, and<br />these ones on the album were very disappointing - slow and so serious.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|The acting is OK. The characters and character plot is compelling to begin with. But the ending s*@ks. Are we supposed to believe that some back-hills cult can find a computer and reverse phone number to an address to actually find Martha? Well, maybe. And the murder, that might explain such a ridiculous plot, appears so late in the plot line that it appears completely contrived by a sleepy headed script editor. Even so, no joy in the ending. Just a big ? Don't waste your time!<br /><br />The author should have added another 5-10 minutes to explain how the back-hills cult might actually have been tech-savy enough to pull this off. But if Patrick were that smart she never would have gotten away to begin with. She'd be dead, too.<br /><br />Seriously, its billed as a psychological thriller. 40 minutes in. No thriller, but definitely some psychological. 80 minutes in, still no thriller. By 92 minutes in, it starts to get a little thriller but mostly everyone who is looking forward to a thriller is asleep. If there had been an ending. Maybe even a thrilling ending, this would be a 5 star review, instead of a 1.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is awesome and I just can't stop playing it! its so addicting I'm up all night playing this flying squirrel game.
006112429X|5.0|This book by far has been the best I have read. It is compelling, interesting, and disturbing. The whole premise and story line is believable yet hard to actually accept that this could be true. I could not put the book down. A challenging and difficult read but definately worth the while. This book is especially interesting if you are into serial killers and ultimately the big question... \\"why?\\" At the end of the book you almost want the characters to be real so you can look them up on google and keep reading about their lives. Truly an amazing book.
B006UG909U|5.0|I received this CD the day it was released and over the course of a few days I listened to it non-stop. Why? It is that good, in my humble opinion! I don't know about you, but my favorite material from Van Halen was during the WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST  and FAIR WARNING period with David Lee Roth on vocals. Besides their first album, these are the most inventive, radical and heaviest albums by VH. \\"Tattoo\\" is the first song and a radio-friendly one at that. This is their first single off of this disc. \\"She's The Woman\\" reminds me of \\"Mean Street\\" from FAIR WARNING a little bit. After the third or fourth song all hell breaks loose and this album becomes more heavy and inventive ala WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST or FAIR WARNING. The production is GREAT! Not too glossy but with ALL of the Crunchiness of GREAT HARD ROCK!!!! I hope this disc will help to bring back the guitar solo as well as the hard rock genre itself. This album just might do both! the only song I do NOT like on this album is \\"Stay Frosty\\", because it sounds too much like a re-do of \\"Ice Cream Man\\". Overall, Get this disc if you are a David Lee Roth with Van Halen fan and you are tired of the stuff that passes for Hard Rock on the radio these days!!!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|it never opens to twitter i have to go through the appetite to get on... its pretty annoying but i like the way twitter is set up
B000IOM1RI|5.0|Ok, so for some reason my local radio station cancels the normal listener pick six on their \\"7th Day album show, and play Pick instead, get it, pick?. It is awesome, I made a Pandora channel from it and everything, this is a must buy.

B006ON41FC|4.0|I have not liked a game this much in a long time.  However it really irritates me highly that the further you advance in the game the more impossible the goals become for anyone to accomplish which in my opinion totally defeats the purpose of playing it in the first place
031236198X|1.0|This condescending fable was written by scholarly experts who can only imagine what life is like in the trenches.  As such they believe the masses are simply stupid and easily swayed.  A member of their leadership team is \\"Buddy\\" who also is simply stupid and easily swayed and thus has the role of spokesman.<br /><br />What is forgotten is that the other leaders may be just as stupid or inept as Buddy, but are too conceited or obstinate to realize this.  How does one get rid of or even recognize ineffective leaders?  How simple and grand can you be to just assume that the chosen leaders will always have a positive impact?  What does history tell us?<br /><br />Also, how does this condescending fable solve its problem and institute the change?  By taking tremendous risks to avoid it; by relying on sheer luck.  Great lesson.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I was really enjoying this game until it cleared my history and made me start over from the beginning. Overall a very interesting and different type of puzzle game. I was having alot of fun with it.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Very Myst like. Graphics are nice but not comparable to the Fire HD titles. It's fun while it lasts, nothing to challenging puzzle wise. It doesn't last long though, 2-3 hours tops unless you suffer from short term memory loss. The ending is awful, sorry. No resolution what so ever. Re-playability is nil.

0985081821|5.0|Upon reading the description for this book, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this, it was so unassuming, but the first few sentences captured my attention and it wouldn't let me put it down until I finished the book.<br /><br />In the beginning of a story we usually get insight into the main character's normal day to day life, and when we first meet Sophia Parsons it's immediately apparent that her life is far from normal. She hears voices, whispers and practises Wiccan arts in order to try and quell these voices. As the voices become more persistent and louder, Sophia digs through her family's past to try and find a solution, but what she finds and what finds her, is so much more than she bargained for.<br /><br />The cover of this edition is especially eye-catching, which features a girl dressed in Gothic Lolita style with gorgeous intricate black jewellery and lace parasol, set against the model's stark skin and blond hair with emphatic eye makeup creates a bold contrast. Especially when the background to the model is reminiscent of a colourful fall day.<br /><br />Hamilton's writing is so smooth and descriptive, it keeps you enthralled and lets the scenes play out graphically in your head easily as you read (especially the scenes with the whispers, they will haunt me for a while). The story takes the bare bones of many concepts such as vampires, witches and shapeshifters and completely reinvents them into something new. The story had so many supernatural elements in it, I wondered at how Hamilton would pull it together, but then she completely blows you out of the water with the reveals and everything clicks into place - which just ends up leaving the reader wanting to know more!<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading from Sophia's perspective. She's such a likable character because she's strong willed and doesn't let other's opinions phase her. She's loyal and uses whatever she can to defend her friends be it her smarts or her power, but she's also not an over the top super hero, she knows when to ask for help from her friends. She also has so much patience... her interactions with the super religious cult leader Mrs. Franklin and her brainwashed cult following mother are outwardly calm and logical, even though when I was reading I was screaming frustrations at the pages, they were such well written antagonists.<br /><br />When we first meet Charles, it's the banter between him and Sophia that had me rooting for him. They are adorable together! Then he gets really mysterious as the plot thickens and he has a major hero complex that gets worked out frequently and not always to the results he wants. As a boyfriend to Sophia, their relationship is pretty iffy at the beginning, but it eventually leads to some pretty steamy scenes.<br /><br />The other characters such as Adrian, Ivory and Lauren worked really well as supports for Sophia, but what really caught me off guard was how when I had pushed one of these to the back of my mind as a boring background character they suddenly come roaring back as an integral character to the underlying plot.<br /><br />All in all this was a really enjoyable read and I cannot wait to read more from Rebecca Hamilton!ver the top super hero, she knows when to ask for help from her friends.

B004BLDD9Y|5.0|I installed this in a basement stairway that leads to a home theater which is always in use.  Instead of installing a 3-way switch and running wiring, I just screwed in this bulb and leave it on 24/7.  I've had it almost a year now and it's still going strong.  Lights up the stairs perfectly to where it's not distracting while watching movies, but not too dark to safely use the stairs.  I'd say its about as bright as a warm white 13W CFL which is almost equivalent to 60W incandescent. Very sturdy construction and very soft warm light. Would buy more if they were under $10 each.

B002NXSRVG|5.0|i loved t GI Joe cartoon when i was a kid.i had friends that seen the movie and told me not to waste my money.they told me the acting was terrible,lousy plot.so when the movie came out on video,i went ahead and brought it.and i seen nothing wrong with it.i dont know what people were expecting from this movie,but it is better than i thought it would be.the plot is what the GI joe cartoons were based on..the acting was great.especially sirenna miller playing the Baroness(i wont lie.she looked great in the movie).if i had to pick one flaw in the movie,it was the Baroness and Duke love story.i could have done without that.but overall,a great movie.i will go as far as saying it is better than Transformers and alot of other movies based on tv shows,cartoons and comic books.some of the other movies are either too long or not enough action.i highly recommend this movie.

B007BLDFWG|4.0|Elizabeth Olson's premiere role is astonishing.  (Where has she been this entire time?)  This movie is disturbing on many levels, but the acting and plot and directing and cinematography are arresting and irresistible.  The movie is provocative in so many ways and it is impossible not to become completely absorbed.  I do not know whether to view this movie as a cautionary tale or \\"thriller\\" as the Amazon description stated, but it is a psychological study and once seen, never forgotten.  It is a violent movie with rape and bloodshed and if you do not like shock value sex scenes then this movie is not for you.  This movie, along with the film Melancholia starring Kirsten Dunst who is back after a long reprieve, are two of the best movies of the year, period.
1400049628|5.0|This book was really funny. Even though it's about a fictional subject it's logically written. I would like to see the other zombie books by this author.
0307949486|3.0|This book was glowingly recommended to me by a coworker, who then brought a copy for me to read.  After holding on to it for a few months, I finally opened it and started the read.  I generally love mysteries and this book weaves a very compelling one which holds the reader's interest throughout.  In fact, it is the general mystery and how it will all turn out that is the primary reason for continuing to spend any effort in getting through the book, because frankly it is not that well written.  It is likely the translation combined with cultural differences between the author's homeland and mine, but I found myself struggling to get through large segments of the writing.  Sentence structure is often overly simplistic and the author spends an inordinate number of words describing meaningless details which add nothing to the plot and do not provide the reader any true feel for the scene.  Great authors use words to pull the reader into the world he or she is creating.  In this book, there is so much cumbersome verbiage that does little in this regard; at times, it reads more like a college textbook than a novel.  I also agree with other critiques that pointed out the title character's completely uncharacteristic and inexplicable actions at the end of the book.  Even a 24 year old genius would not be able to pull off what this young lady supposedly accomplished as the novel reaches its climax.<br /><br />All is not bad in &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;.  As indicated above, the general plot is compelling and keeps the reader turning the pages, and there are some interesting periods of dialogue between major players. Had I discovered the book on my own, I may have rated it somewhat higher.  It just did not live up to the excess hype and attention it has received, especially since it has now been made into a major motion picture.
B004KSQN7C|1.0|There isn't a SINGLE SONG from this PIECE OF DISPOSABLE DUNG WORTH LISTENING TO ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!! I'd rather go eat a piece of my dog's poop in the backyard rather than sit through this album. I may end up committing hari kari if i had to sit through the expanded deluxe edition!
B005UKJX4E|5.0|What a beautiful film. This is a real gem, and it reminds me of \\"2001 Space Odyssey\\" in its scope. But I always thought that Space Odyssey was faux profound, as if it was trying to say something with depth and meaning about human existence and alienation, but it couldn't. This movie is much more successfully profound, because it has a religious and even theological dimension to it. References and appeals to divinity, to transcendent love, knowledge, and truth, has through the ages effectively evoked mystery, meaning, and magnitude to mankind.<br /><br />For this director, as perhaps that of Space Odyssey, the starting point for understanding and redeeming those aspects of human existence which are bewildering or painful is the contemplation of creation itself - of its age, weight, immensity, grandeur, power, remoteness, beauty, and fragility. As humans, with specific problems and specific pains (some mature and objectively heavy, others immature and subjectively petty), we have the opportunity to lose ourselves in the very stuff of our existence - our environment - which at once seems to sympathize with and also minimize our momentary angst. It think this is part of the reason why the director needed a very ordinary, particular historical setting and prosaic characters with which to set them against the awesome, impersonal scope of creation.<br /><br />I still think the film will be disorienting to many, but Christians have an advantage right off if they know their Bible well. \\"Tree of Life\\" begins with a quote from the book of Job: \\"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? (Job 38: 4,7).\\" Job is in pain, and he has questioned God's goodness and justice. He has begged (as many characters in the movie also did), \\"Where were you?\\" The larger issue here is how it is possible that a personal and good God could allow humans to suffer, either physically or spiritually. Why shouldthey be allowed to struggle, to sin, to lose their way? God's counter question is powerful but difficult to accept: \\"Where were you when I created the universe?\\" It does not seem like a relevant or comforting answer.<br /><br />There are a lot of movie goers who did not understand the lengthy interruptions in \\"Tree of Life\\" which portrayed the creation of the universe. They probably asked \\"How on earth is this relevant?\\" But that is exactly the point of Job, and it is the point of this film. There are no easy answers here, and \\"Tree of Life\\" wisely avoids the predictable platitudes.
B0000TG9E2|1.0|I put the DVD in and it didn't work.  I tried other DVD's so I know it wasn't my DVD player. When the DVD finally did begin to play I couldn't get passed the menu, the movie part refused to play.  I don't know what's wrong with the DVD but it was a complete waste of money.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Mr. Dawkins, as always, has done a superb job of outlining and presenting his arguments. For a legal analysis of religiosity and what constitutes a \\"true religion,\\" I recommend this book as a complement for anyone interested in First Amendment issues.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007AG2CF8 A Recipe for Religion]]
B006UG90RM|5.0|Just like \\"Fair Warning\\", I dismissed this record the first time I heard it.  I noticed the compression, the clumsy lyrics that don't always fit together very well, Dave's corny posturing, Eddie's occasional tendency to over-play, Alex's metronome style of drumming and heavy cymbals, the lack of any discernable melodies, etc.  After the 3rd or 4th listen, I realized what I had in my hands, and I completely changed my mind.<br /><br />Listening to Eddie Van Halen play the guitar is serious business.  This guy is out for blood.  He takes no prisoners.  He is letting the world know that \\"Hey people, I'm back and I can still do this better than anyone else.\\".  Like all brilliant technicians, however, Eddie needs someone to bridge the gap between himself and the audience.  Enter Dave-he provides levity, energy, fearlessness, humor, showmanship, and ah...he's never at a loss for words!  He's not perfect, but he knows that and doesn't really care!  Dave IS the perfect foil for an obsessive-compulsive perfectionist like Eddie.  The tension between these two equally strong personalities, and the way the drama unfolds, is what made this band so great in the first place-and the formula still works.  For anyone who came of age in the 1980's, listening to this record is like having sex with an old girlfriend-you may not get along anymore, but there's one thing that you can still do together perfectly!!!  These guys will be locked in a tug-of-war for the rest of their lives, whether they ever make another record or not.  Great stuff.<br /><br />O.K.  Down to business.  The \\"Fair Warning\\" comparison is valid because this record, just like that one, has no obvious pop-friendly hits upon first glance.  It's dense, unrelenting hard rock that only occasionally mocks itself on tunes such as \\"Stay Frosty\\".  Dave's much-derided vocal technique has actually improved over time.  He no longer has that girlish, high-pitched squeal, but you can really hear him going for it in an operatic falsetto on tunes such as \\"You and Your Blues\\" which lyrically sounds an awful lot like him expressing his views on Ed's personal problems.<br /><br />I've read some of the negative reviews of \\"HoneyBabySweetieDoll\\", and I have to say that I love this track.  After the obvious choices \\"Tattoo\\" and \\"You and Your Blues\\", this one is a stand out for the simple fact that it includes some of Eddie's sonic experiments (his take on \\"Revolution Number 9\\" from the White Album perhaps, along with a pinch of Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\") and if I'm not mistaken, this is the band's first really impressive foray into eastern music.  It breaks new ground, and after I overcame the initial shock, I found myself coming back to this one over and over again.<br /><br />If you were hoping to hear some new-found maturity from these guys, and some parting bits of wisdom before they move on to the next life, I can tell you that there is very little of that here.  The message I got was \\"Hey, we're just as tough now as we were 30 years ago, and in some ways tougher.  We're not ready to check out just yet.\\".  If you were hoping for some light-weight pop rock along the lines of \\"Dance the Night Away\\", I can tell you that they skipped that almost entirely.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" is a nice bit of levity that really rocks, but it's also wicked and satirical, so it doesn't quite fit the 80's radio confection format.<br /><br />I could say more, but basically if you're a fan of these guys, then you have to hear this.  It's astonishing and it does a nice job of harvesting from the past while at the same time breaking new ground.  It's vital.  It's virile.  It's tough.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B006OFN0SE|5.0|Leonardo Dicaprio seems to get better with every film he's in. Ever since \\"The Aviator\\", he(in my opinion) has shaken off the persona that he still acts like that golden-haired boy from \\"Titanic\\".But I have watched him grow with every moviemaking feat,and with \\"J.Edgar\\",he lands a knockout punch in evoking hoover's mannerisms and posture,as well as the man's voice(to some extent).Clint Eastwood's biopic is not a masterpiece,but it is masterful.His direction is unhurried,and he does manage to not make Hoover an All-American good guy,taking quick but hard looks at his abuses of power.Anyone who thinks Dicaprio still can't act,or who have strong animosities toward Hoover period- should leave their opinions at the door and give this film a decent viewing or two. One of the things that surprised me about \\"J.Edgar\\" was that it was not longer,compared to \\"Malcolm X\\",\\"JFK\\",and \\"Nixon\\".But I was not dissapointed,and the rest of the cast was impressive,particularly The Great Judi Dench as Hoover's mother.All in all,Eastwood's portrait of the very secretive and very troubled public figure is a tremendous acheivement,not just as a biopic but as a period piece as well.Leonardo should strive for more roles like this,but I am assured that he's well on his way as a dramatic actor.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|On the brink of a night of tinsel town and red carpet, a film comes along that brings back the shining light to celluloid.  The Artist is that film that will automatically draw one's attention to nostalgia and an era in Hollywood's ultimate heyday before the \\"Talkies\\".  Indeed, an exceptional recreation of a time when the actor was literally an artist at his craft, consider the greats Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford that have proven that fact.  But all is not lost of that era because if one were ever to venture off to the movies, there still exists films that capture the emotion, drama, and humor within a film similar to The Artist.  That type of movie will most likely be found in a foreign film across the oceans or independent film that tends to appear at the Sundance Film Festival.<br /><br />However, setting aside parallels, The Artist is a historical film testament of how holding onto the past may have much relevance to the present.  This was the case with the main characters of the film silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) up and coming Hollywood starlet Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) and supporting actors the Jack Rusell Terrier (Uggie), silent film director (John Goodman) and chauffer Clifton (James Cromwell).  With the film running a little over 90 minutes, the acting speaks for itself along with the cinematography and the soundtrack.  For viewers who are not accustomed to silent films, this indeed was a treat to have such a film made during this era of endless technology.  And within the film, George and Peppy also had to contend with technology during their lifetime that was either of decline or acceptance as Hollywood moved into a new decade away from silent movies to the so-called \\"Talkies\\" where viewers actually saw and heard all of the actions and words spoken by the actors; today that fact may be irrelevant but that major innovation changed the face of Hollywood and how films were made and drew an audience.  This is clearly shown when George is reluctant while Peppy wholeheartedly welcomes the advancement with open arms and eventually upstages George; this is a good example of how remaining stagnant does much harm while progressing paves the way for success.<br /><br />The Artist is an exceptional film filled with though provoking moments and bravado, especially the concluding dance number at the end of the film.  No doubt, the era has been depicted in the movie quite similar to the original films produced during the late 1920s and 1930s.  Full acclamations are due to the entire production team and director Michel Hazanavicius.drew an audience.

B002ZG99A4|1.0|Just a side note to be aware of.  Lionsgate who made the movie will not stand behinf the digital copy, please do not buy this movie intending on using the digital copy.  I even e-mailed them and still was unable to get the copy to download.  This is a problem with Lionsgate, not Amazon.  Amazon resolved their problem as stated below.<br /><br />I just opened the box.  None of the 3 disks worked.  I played anaother movie just to test my player and it worked fine.  These disks stop about 30 min in.  I didnot view prior to the deadline so I am stuck.  Now I have to go buy it again, but not from here.<br /><br />Amazon came through and proved that they stand behind what they say.  In less than 24 hours on a weekend I received an e-mail that a replacement order is on its way, and they sent the the forms to return the defective set.  You can not ask for any better service than that.  I will continue to be a loyal customer.  This is the first disk out of 20+ movies I have purchased had a problem.

In a world with so many artists hoping to see one or two hits from their albums, Adele has crafted an album full of potential hits.  Every track on this album -- even the deepest cuts -- has the potential to be a number one.  I'm not an Adele fanboy by any means, but this album is phenomenal.

1451627289|5.0|I have been a King fan since the first book. It's hard to pick a favorite but it would be between, The Shining, It, The Stand, The Talisman or The Dark Tower series. A lot of old time fans have given this one a bad review but I just finished it and must say it is an extremely well written book. Many have said he is too big for his britches now and needs to be edited, that the book is too long by half. I disagree. While it is more of a main stream novel than those I earlier mentioned, it is to me an instant classic. I learned a few years ago with movies and books that I could ruin them merely through my own expectations. I've gone back and reread books that I didn't like, this time with an open mind and no expectations, and have thoroughly enjoyed them the second time. After reading many of the poor reviews by long time fans I decided to read it anyway with no expectations and fell in love with this book.  GREAT JOB STEPHEN!!!

B004Z4LYU2|5.0|Einstein's theory of Relativity is incomplete, much like Newton's Laws are incomplete. While the theory and laws work well within their set of assumptions, they start to diverge as conditions move outside their envelope of comfort. Newton's laws, while intuitive, have been proven to produce wrong answers at high speed and intense gravity. Einstein's theory shows great correspondence with experiment - up until the user tries to apply it to Black Holes, or correlate it with Quantum Mechanics, also a well regarded theory in it's own right.<br /><br />The Standard Model can be used to investigate some of these areas, but it doesn't forge new ground. It produces answers when initial conditions are customized, but tells us little or nothing about why those initial conditions are what they are.<br /><br />String Theory is supposed to address these problems, but it doesn't. String Theory is really a large number of theories, each with it's own set of initial conditions, leaving us no further along than the Standard Model. Any advances made using String Theory can be made other ways, sometimes with less effort.<br /><br />There are 5 great, unsolved problems in physics today:<br />  1)  Combine general relativity and quantum theory into a single theory that can claim to be the complete theory of nature.<br />  2)  Resolve the problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics, either by making sense of the theory as it stands or by inventing a new theory that does make sense.<br />  3)  Determine whether or not the various particles and forces can be unified in a theory that explains them all as manifestations of a single, fundamental entity.<br />  4)  Explain how the values of the free constants in the standard model of particle physics are chosen in nature.<br />  5)  Explain dark matter and dark energy. Or, if they don't exist, determine how and why gravity is modified on large scales. More generally, explain why the constants of the standard model of cosmology, includingthe dark energy, have the values they do.<br /><br />The author argues that while the people that study string theory are all very intelligent and hard working, there has been little or no progress in physics due to their efforts in the last 25 to 30 years. These string theory proponents are highly confident that they will find the answers they seek (the answers are always just around the corner), and they monopolize most of the talent and money in physics in the failing effort.<br /><br />That is the trouble with physics.<br /><br />The author is very persuasive and provides a lot of data and good arguments for his points in this book, but more importantly, he provides suggestions for avenues of inquiry by the professional physics society, why this is important for lay people who are the readers of this book, and what we lay people can do to help. His suggestions sound reasonable and doable. Some of the problem descriptions he makes are so well stated and universal that they apply to all features of life, not just physics, and the suggestions gain credence from the association.<br /><br />The book is long and some of the arguments are so complete that the reader just wants the author to move on, but deep rooted problems need that kind of exposure to be heard and understood. Skimming, at those points, is recommended; you'll recognize them when you see them.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|I have both the \\"Oh By The Way\\" box set and the \\"Discovery\\" box set. Im my opinion, each one has qualities the other one doesn't have.<br /><br />In terms of audio quality, both of the sets are great. The \\"Discovery\\" box set may sound a little better because of the remastering work, but, still, the editions on \\"Oh By The Way\\" sound great too.<br /><br />When it comes to the packaging, \\"Oh By The Way\\" is a work of art, with the nice reproduction of the labels, the artwork and the high quality material used in the cd sleeves.<br /><br />The \\"Discovery\\" box set brings a modern feel to the packaging, and each cd comes with nice booklets with all the lyrics.<br /><br />So, for me, the question is simply decide what configuration you prefer. If I had to choose, I'd stick with the \\"Oh By The Way\\" box, but, for me, the \\"Discovery\\" box set is very close as nice as \\"Oh By The Way\\", and I give it five stars.

(Think Indiana Jones)  The music is pleasent  and the artwork is nicely done.  The game play and animations are very smooth on my Motorola Xoom.  It's worth the purchase price if you didn't get it as the FAOTD.<br /><br />Regarding the &quot;ads&quot;:  There are NO ads in the game.  The devs  added a splash screen that comes up when you first start the game that gives you the option to go see what other games they have available.  All you have to do is click the large &quot;play now&quot; button in the middle of the screen and the game starts.  No muss, no fuss.  A &quot;Don't show this again&quot; check box might be a nice feature for a future release,  but it is not bothersome the way it currently is either.<br /><br />Nice job, Devs.  You will see repeat business from me.
0399159029|5.0|Prague Fatale is somewhat unique for a Bernie Gunther novel as it does not shift around in time.  Rather, it is a linear tale of what starts out as a likely mugging in Berlin and then shifts to Prague where one of Reinhard Heydrich's adjutants has been murdered and Bernie has been selected to solve the crime. This all takes place a short period of time before Heydrich himself is killed by British trained Czech partisans.<br /><br />Philip Kerr has consistently shown a deft hand in popularizing real history with a thin layer of fiction on top.  I found his last book to be a bit too mean spirited, especially at the end, but in this book he is in fine form.  Of course, there's a love interest for Bernie that is more than it seems (isn't it always?) and that's always great fun.  But what really sets this book apart is the large number of historical Nazis Kerr puts into the scene near Prague, and the dialogue between Gunther and them as he interrogates them about the murder.  These scenes have some of the very best dialogue in the entire series, cracking with anger, sarcasm, and innuendo.  They're a welcome respite from the cardboard cut-out characterizations we see defining most fictional Nazis.  Given Kerr's obvious huge distaste for all things Nazi, it's impressive that he imbues these characters with real emotions and feelings, and even manages to present a few of them in a positive light.<br /><br />If you've followed the series, this is one of its best books.  If you're new to Kerr or to the Bernie Gunther series, then by all means, read the books in the order they were written.  Gunther is one of the most striking literary creations of twentieth century military and detective writing. Kerr writes plots that are like quicksand.  They suck you in, and before you know it, you've spent several hours in a chair, and the book is done.<br /><br />That's the mark of an inventive and skilled author.  Kerr has shown what he's capable of once again, and the reader can only be thankful. Although WWII is many decades behind us, Kerr shows the wisdom of what Faulkner once said:  \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\"e thankful. Although WWII is many decades behind us, Kerr shows the wisdom of what Faulkner once said:  \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\"
0812992792|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is as bleak as it is unexpectedly beautiful.  Adam Johnson uncovers the way in which citizens of a totalitarian society inevitably lead double lives--one life in dedication to authority (in this case, to the Dear Leader), another life in furtive pursuit of autonomy and dignity.  And who would have guessed that a nation of propaganda could create in turn an imaginative effort on the part of its citizens?  Since the people of North Korea are constantly being interrogated, they are also constantly making up stories for their interrogators.  It is as if each citizen must become his or her own Scheherezade, making up 1001 tales for the sake of simply staying alive.  The tale that Adam Johnson makes up to encompass this complexity is masterful and spellbinding.

B006OV7RQ4|3.0|Good acting. I basically liked the plot.  A girl, Martha Marcy Mae Marleen, played by Elizabeth Olsen escapes from a cult and it's charasmatic, manipulative and evil leader. There were some interesting parallels between the Manson Family and the cult in this movie.  She gets help from her sister and her husband, but is struggling with the adjustment to a more normal life and there is a dark secret. Martha's life with the cult and her time with her sister is presented as a parallel, switching back and forth between the two. It seems to be universally agreed that Elisabeth Olsen is excellent and John Hawkes makes a fine cult leader and psychopath. For me, the pacing was slow, but I'm kind of a fidgety person anyway. Also, this is not a movie for those that like a neat wrap up. The movie culls a lot of anticipation, but may leave you feeling unsatisfied.

0307719219|3.0|This was an OK book, but with all the glowing reviews by Nobel Laureates, I had expected to gain more insight.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that Nations thrive or fail based on how productivity is rewarded. If government and societal systems are set up to reward productivity, people will be productive. The case is made by looking at the systems of reward/oppression in various historical settings, including British and Spanish colonial settlements. Nations fail due to government corruption, and failure to reward those being productive for their productivity.<br /><br />I was hoping to gain more insight into methods by which we can help Nations improve. In traveling through Africa, I find examples of complete poverty in nations, and that poverty not necessarily due to corruption in government. In places I have visited, almost everyone has Malaria or other tropical disease. If people have Malaria, they will not be very productive, no matter the reward system that is in place. When you visit a country with a relatively stable, fair government, and see complete poverty, you wonder how to break the cycle of poverty. This book did not give me the insights I had hoped for in this area. When you see an area in which people are trying to survive with 1700's era farming techniques, it is a vexing problem to try and figure out how to get them into a more productive mode of existence, and one which is much, much more complex than simply government/societal reward systems.<br /><br />Authors should spend a year \\"On the Ground\\" in a third world country, and then reevaluate.

0060873027|1.0|I was bought this as a hardcopy book, but wish I'd read the reviews beforehand. Very (and I DO mean VERY) hard to believe this has any connection with the late and great Michael Crichton, since at least the science in most of his books was believable, and didn't require total suspension of credibility. Apart from the almost predictable storyline and cardboard cut-out characterisation, the science is just non-believable, and no effort is made to \\"bridge the credibility gulf\\". Presumably the \\"Super Magnetic Field\\" idea has come from the known  ability of high strength induced fields to \\"shrink\\" coins, etc., but there's NO MASS LOSS, unlike in this case where our Students are shrunk to \\"micro size\\" - well, 1.2cm (1/2 inch) is hardly \\"micro\\" - and they are of an \\"appropriate\\" low mass. Sorry, where's the 70kg \\"lost mass\\" gone - no explanation. Transformed into energy maybe - somewhere at the end of the book the \\"detective\\" notes that there's a lot of AC power being used. Well, a rough mental calculation gives us 200TWh per \\"person\\" in missing mass, so OK there's a LOT of power there - and for the  number of people shrunk, we're looking at a lot more than the instantaneous Global generating capacity. Don't get me started on the obvious quantum - level inconsistencies, including the \\"ability\\" to breathe \\"full sized\\" molecular structures - e.g. air.<br /><br />Although micro and nanoscale technology does exist, and has a well proven track record so far, the \\"science\\" in this book bears nil, nada, zip connection with \\"real\\" nanotechnologies. The book bears scant (if any) resemblance of the work that Crichton has produced in the past, and it is a scandal that the cover bears his name. I hope his ghost comes back to haunt the Editorial Staff that allowed publication of this travesty!<br /><br />Looking on the bright side, at least I was able to flog this off to the local secondhand bookshop for a few dollars.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great game. actually,a great collection of fun and challenging mini games. I like how the games get progressively more difficult.
1591844096|1.0|In one section of Godin's book he states that he has no problem with a business plan for a large low tech company to \\"use drones who you can scale, use, and disrespect\\". I tried to read on, and read into the context, but I kept coming back to that paragraph, and it infuriated me, and I became amazed that this business book could be so popular.  I returned the book and bought an Eric Clapton DVD.  I own my own business, and love reading about business, but I'm sorry of all people, a jewish author, being cognizant of all the atrocities committed against jewish people in history, Seth should be ultra sensitive to the utilitarian use and abuse of people, as a means to a business end.  Business' purpose is for enrichment and propogation of goods for people, NOT the reverse. That sadlly, is the model, Seth himself says he \\"has no problem with.\\"  Sorry Seth, but for this business owner's money, your theory has hung it self with it's own linchpin.  As a Catholic and capitalist business owner, I believe that business exists to serve people. This book promotes the reverse, with trendy and tired \\"be all you can be, you're better than that\\" me-ism tripe, and as such, has no merit or lesson for me.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|The latest update brings the favorite minigames to the Android version of PvsZ. Sure, this game port might run slower and at a lesser resolution than my PC version, but that's because I built that beast from scratch for high end gaming and we can't build our own phones...yet.<br /><br />This game features purely addictive gameplay and a truly unique score composed by Laura Shigihara. Both are well worth the purchase and will give you hours of entertainment!<br /><br />With any game there is room for growth and improvement and not all hi-res games are fun as Amazon's FAOTD has taught us. No matter the platform, this game is a pure gem amidst a sea of zombie fodder. Phone can't handle it? Try the original PC version or even the PS3 demo and see what all the sunflowers are singing about.<br /><br />Keep in mind, gamers, that most of the low reviews were due to the lack of the minigames and are now irrelevant. This game should have at least 4 stars now!<br /><br />R2DROID2

It gives you several word games as well.  It even gives your horoscope.<br /><br />I can't believe this is free!!<br /><br />Highly recommend.

B005T87QCI|5.0|I loooooove this game, and the movie is incredible; furthermore, the game only disappoints me compared to the movie. This game doesn't have all of the characters, or even the main ones: Zeus, Atom, and the two headed guy. I highly recommend that the people/company who made this to make a continuation, sequal, or update for the game that extends it or something. All in all, this game is a five star if you don't mind what they left out. It's short, sweet, enjoyable, and fun.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yes this book is a bit slower then the first 3. But the book is still very powerful. I loved reading this book. The cliff hangers are still there and there are still many characters that you love. I think this book is simply amazing.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie inspired hope where none was to be found in how life was for the African American community. It's a fine movie to watch with the heart-wrenching performance and heartache that the people had to go through.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I love Van Halen..  they are one of my favorite bands ever.  1984 is the benchmark for 80's rock albums (in my view, only G and R's Appetite can sit at the top with this record).  Anyway, I didn't really know what to expect on this album.  For starters, the song the released 1st absolutely sucks for a VH song.  Seriously??  This is a bad B-side song, and a horrible business decision to kick-off the record.  Anyway, luckily, the rest of the album is very old-school sounding (apart from a few songs).  What you get here is a time-warp back to the early 80's.  The songs are up-tempo and full of gain!  Terrific! absolutely Love Outa Space, ..Frosty and ..Woman; Seems like Eddie has punted some of the flangy effects he used to record all the Sammy era stuff; so, good to hear he's going back to business of old - good hard basic distortion. There are several other really solid VH tunes on the record.  Ok keepin' it real here...I have one minor issue, in that Eddie really is still Eddie from 1982..  I mean, that the guy is still doing all his trickery and it seems to me, that he's trying just a bit too hard on this for a 57 year old.  Maybe, I just haven't heard a guy blaze up quite like Eddie in oh.. say 1993 (last VH concert I went to).  It's kinda like he's trying to be way out in front of the rest of the guys.  I say that very respectfully, as he's one of the greatest, if not the greatest hard-rock guitarists of all time.  I still love this record, and any VH fan will also love it (apart from Tatoo - horrid!).

1451627289|4.0|I've always been fascinated with anything JFK related, so when I heard Stephen King was writing an alternate history book about JFK, I knew that I had to read it. I enjoyed the story. I loved the details of small-town life. When I read a book I like to feel like I've been everywhere the characters have been and have done everything they've done, I got that feeling with this book, and that made me happy. My only real complaint is one that I've had with several of King's books in the past. It was a little drawn out. This story certainly could've been told in less than 849 pages. The plot is not that complicated or detailed to necessitate over 800 pages. It's obviously told in so many pages because that's the way King chose to tell his story. I personally would've much rather have read the same story in 500 pages, which I think it could easily be edited down to. That's just my personal preference. It's obvious that many people love this book exactly as it is, but I grew a little weary of so many repetitious thoughts and actions that were not essential. I still thought it was a good read and enjoyed it very much.
B0035WRY7C|5.0|I read this book in Elementary School and I had to read it again when I was twenty. It is an intruiging, fast-paced, gem of a book!
B000HZD168|5.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviews in that this is the best movie in the original series. Maybe I'm a little bit biased though because I saw this when I was fairly young and it made a big impression on me. The earwig scene alone is burned into my brain forever. The scenes were just so powerful and demanding that they're hard to forget. The big question with movies like this though is not if they were good back then but if they are still watchable today. I did enjoy revisiting this movie. I have seen it many times since I was a kid, but it's probably been 10 years or so since I watched it the last time and it was still very enjoyable.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is an awesome app even on the kindle fire! you can download everything on youtube!!! I recommend this app to everyone. best app ever!
0307888908|3.0|I always find it interesting when a career book claims to provide \\"new\\" thinking about careers-- and then basically packages information that's been around for awhile.  This book is another in the line of thinking about your career (and yourself) as a business start-up.  By applying the same rules you would apply to starting a business you will be able to control your career.  It's not a bad idea, but the idea has been around since at least since the early 1980s when the book [[ASIN:0201095033 The Inventurers: Excursions In Life And Career Renewal, Third Edition]] was first written. That book talked about always thinking of yourself as self-employed, again, not a bad idea.<br /><br />And, not surprisingly, given that the book is written by one of the founders of LinkedIn, a large focus of the system is on networking and connections.  But networking as a concept isn't new-- there are just new ways to do it through social networking.<br /><br />The information is good and readers will develop good strategies for managing their careers-- but it's just one more approach, not necessarily the only or the best approach. The author doesn't place much credence in systems that tell people to follow their passions-- and he's right, to a point. Practicality often has to enter the process as well.  But plenty of people have done well in their careers by following their passions.  The point is, there is no one right way to develop a career or find a job.  Different paths work for different people. If thinking of yourself as a business start-up appeals to you, then you will probably like this system.
B0063GORYU|5.0|works very well on my Kindle Fire. It does have an add before every new game but that doesn't interfere with the game play.

B004A8ZWWO|4.0|TOWER HEIST follows in the tradition of most 'heist'-genre films in which it purports a great ensemble cast (Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Mathew Broderick , Casey Affleck, Gabourey Sidibe, and Tea Leoni). The film is not exactly OCEAN'S 11 (new & old), but comes close. The plot is very simple, a Bernie Madoff-type/Wall Street billionaire composit, Arthur Shaw (played by Alan Alda) 'steals' money from unsuspecting (the common man) investors and Josh Kovacs(Stiller),one of the investors, heads a group of five unlikely mercenaries to try to get some of that money back. [They] plan to infiltrate Shaw's penthouse because there's a tip that there may be $20 Million stashed in a hidden safe. The film then spends it's time by showing how the group comes together and plan the heist. In-between, you get some character development, but mostly it's the comic banter between the mostly mis-matched wannabe 'thieves' that makes the film worthwhile. A couple of slight-of-hand twists to the heist plot is thrown in for good measure, but it doesn't deter from the overall plan. Lastly, as with all great 'heist' films, there is always a happy ending, and this film doesn't disappoint. Overall, a decent heist film, with Stiller and Murphy heading a pretty good ensemble cast...with an inside nod/joke (or pure coincidence) to Broderick's \\"Ferris Bueller\\" character 25 years ago. In TOWER HEIST as Mr. Fitzhugh, Broderick is involved with destroying another red 250 GT Ferrari.

B000BYCAJE|4.0|First off, I am only a casual CSN fan. Their obvious strong point is the vocal harmonies. I bought this cd for nostalgia purposes, as the local album rock station in the 1970's/early 1980's used to play a favorite song of mine - Wooden Ships. Another minor radio hit, Long Time Gone, is also on this album. Of course, the gigantic hit on here is Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.<br /><br />A true supergroup with wonderful harmonious singing.

B002BWP49M|5.0|I'm not your average Twilight fan.  I'm retirement age, but something about the books and the movies has captivated me.  (I'm Team Jacob by the way).  I have enjoyed the romance, the photography, the music and the story. I have two soundtracks as well as some singles.<br />  Is it just me or do these movies/actors just get better and better.  Can't wait for the last installment.  I have been a big fan of the books, and the movies haven't disappointed.  I think there are some very talented actors in this series that we will be seeing a lot more of in the future. You can tell that they have a real connection outside of their roles too.<br />  I like that they've lightened up on the \\"vampire makeup\\".  They have improved a lot of the special effects, although they aren't the real draw of these movies.  The wedding didn't disappoint.  Kristin was stunning.  I enjoyed the levity of the wedding party even more knowing what lie ahead for them.<br />  My husband even likes these movies!!  Which of course makes it so much easier to watch them over and over....
B005LAIGSM|3.0|You probably won't ever see Channing Tatum ferociously chewing the scenery, but you must give him props for earnestness. In THE VOW he handles the voiceover narration, and you could feel him trying. But when he launches into his clunky theory on \\"moments of impact,\\" it's hard for me to buy it as credible insight. Maybe I'm biased. Probably I've pigeonholed Channing Tatum. Perhaps I was expecting him to bust an ill dance move or join a fight club. Me, I liked this film okay. And for the film's starry-eyed target audience, no amount of dis will sway them. Still, somewhere, even the staff writers at Hallmark are rolling their eyes.<br /><br />In wintry Chicago, Leo (Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are a young married couple still very much in love with each other. After all, they wrote their wedding vows on the menus of their favorite restaurant, and that right there probably qualifies what they have as some sort of legendary love affair. But then a runaway truck smashes into their car, and there's Paige catapulting thru the windshield. Leo, who had his seatbelt on, is relatively fine. When Paige awakens from her coma, she discovers that she's suffering from selective amnesia. She can't remember the last five years of her life. She can't imagine being this in demand sculptor and living in the city and married to Leo, this sudden stranger.<br /><br />I'm sure them womenfolk are swooning all over Channing Tatum (who also bares his behind in one scene, so, uh, yay). Tatum is rendered ridiculously sympathetic by his romantic gestures and by virtue of what he's put thru by the amnesiac Paige. Leo remains the sweet devoted spouse, desperately striving to win his estranged wife all over again. But it's tough, really tough. Once a free-spirited creature, Paige now seems like an entirely different person. One of Leo and Paige's mutual friends voices our concern: \\"I'm just worried if she doesn't remember you, how's she supposed to remember she's in love with you?\\" Somewhere, Nicholas Sparks is kicking himself for not thinking up this plot.<br /><br />Not that Paige is purposely mean or thoughtless. She's experiencing her own bits of turmoil. And, me, what I found really interesting are those moments which focus on Paige and the scary stuff she's going thru. Rachel McAdams is quite good at conveying that sense of desolation and confusion and helplessness one must feel when stricken with deep memory loss.<br /><br />From Paige's perspective, it's like this: She's never had a falling out with her rich, conservative parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange). She's still in law school and engaged to her old sweetheart Jeremy (Scott Speedman). Today, Paige can't comprehend what would compel her to move to the city or give up law study or not be on speaking terms with her parents. What made her break up with Jeremy? I remember getting mad at myself in the theater for getting suckered in by these concerns. But I found myself wanting to know what made Paige turn her back on her old life five years ago.<br /><br />Watching the love of your life just slip away from you, no matter how hard you try to hold on - what's a more irresistible premise, especially on Valentine's Day? Channing Tatum's got a long road to go before he achieves real actor status. He still tends to be stiff and awkward. Except that, for this film, his awkwardness works in his favor. It makes him even more of an underdog, especially when pitted against the urbane Speedman and those old acting hands Sam Neill and Jesicca Lange. It's a shame, by the way, that Jessica Lange only gets that one scene in which to strut her stuff.<br /><br />There are romantic beats in THE VOW that, for all their predictability and heavyhandedness, are still worth waiting for. And that's because McAdams and Tatum do create some sparks in their scenes together. Despite her newfound attraction to Jeremy, Paige gradually, cautiously becomes open to Leo's advances. She remarks: \\"I married him. It must've been for some reason.\\" This then leads to probably my favorite sequence, which is their \\"first date.\\" Since I'm a manly man, I won't swoon or have vapors. But I liked that sequence.<br /><br />THE VOW is based on the real-life story of Kim and Krickitt Carpenter. Apparently, Krickitt never did recover from her amnesia, and yet they're happily married with two kids. Not that I'm saying that's what happens in this movie. In fact, surprisingly, THE VOW veers away from giving us a grand romantic gesture in the finale. I like that the resolution unfolds unexpectedly and messily and almost in anticlimactic fashion. But the way the last 20 or so minutes unfold feels more believable. I was glad there wasn't a mad dash thru the airport or a dramatic \\"Stop the Wedding!\\" moment at the twelfth hour. The clich&eacute; police are overtaxed as it is.or some reason.\\" This then leads to probably my favorite sequence, which is their \\"first date.\\" Since I'm a manly man, I won't swoon or have vapors.

B001CZVVW8|3.0|I agree with the other reviewers about the high quality of Ms Fleming's and Mr Hvorostovsky's singing and acting.  The blu ray images were fine but not outstanding and the sound while OK did not have the level of sound stage presence that I have heard from other blu ray disks.  I hope however, that the Met got the set and staging for a discount.  Plan brownish yellow walls, pretty much the same from act to act.  Lots of leaves for the chorus to sweep, in fact that was the major activity for the female chorus, sweeping leaves. There were also lots of chairs -- I don't get the chairs.  The beautiful 3rd act opening polinaise was wasted by the static scene of dressing Onegin; I thought that the polinaise was a dance where were the dancers?  If sets and action are supposed to help set a time and place -- this set and stage direction failed.  You could close your eyes for long periods of time and not miss a thing except for not being able to read the subtitles.  So 5 stars for the leads, 2 stars for the set -- this comes to about 3.5 but Amazon requires whole star ratings.  Of course Tchaikovsky's music is at least 100 stars and even this production could not compromise that.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this trilogy by mistake in Dec 2011, while searching for the Millennium trilogy. Best mistake I've made in a long time!<br /><br />Suzanne does a brilliant job of making the reader identify with each and every character, even though Katniss steals the show! I was fortunate to be on holiday whilst reading the trilogy and could allow my mind to immerse itself completely in the story and its setting.<br /><br />I can still envision the locations for each of the hunger games and vividly remember the scenes where the author painstakingly reveals Katniss' vulverability and strength. It's a story told so honestly that you can almost believe such a world exists.<br /><br />I'm not looking forward to the movie, as the producers always short change the story for Hollywood glamour. Do yourself a favor and subject yourself to Suzanne Collins mastery before you watch the movie....

B004EPYZZ8|3.0|I'm a guy and this movie had me wanting to cry a couple of times.  This movie has a lot going for it and a couple of things going against it.  First off I wanted to like this movie (actual review is 3.5 stars).  Who doesn't like an underdog story?  The movie, inspired by the events that occurred to Bethany Hamilton who, at 13 lost an arm in a shark attack, does not sensationalize its subject matter.  At heart it wants you to look past the person/ character of Bethany (played here by actress AnnaSophie Robb in an understated performance) in order to see and appreciate a life of faith and a motto of \\"everything happens for a good reason; don't lose heart if that reason is not apparent to you, give it time and keep your eyes open to the bigger picture.\\"  I think the movie succeeds quite well in conveying its message (when Hamilton teaches Thai tidal wave refugees how to surf and, at the end of the movie, when she expresses how she was able to touch so many with one arm, far more than she could have touched or would have touched with two) but the depiction of Hamilton as such a saint, with her family circle and others all seemingly worshipping her (I know that's a bit harsh but come on! where was the strife between siblings and the teenager's rebellious spirit!?!) even prior to the arm-loss incident, distracted from the film's message.  Another thing that detracted from the film (IMO) were both Randy Quaid as the father and Helen Hunt as Bethany's mother (can someone give Hunt something to eat? she looks like the skin on her face is going to rip if she loses any more weight) as they were emotionally underwhelming in their performances (Quaid less so though).  Something that the movie has going for it is a depiction of a family whose religious values are taken seriously and credibly; it was good to see people go to church and then not to be played off as hypocrites or \\"crazy fanatics\\".  Carrie Underwood was wooden in her performance as Bethany's friend/ Christian counselor.  Perhaps the best part of the movie is saved for last when we see clips of and read about the real Bethany Hamilton.  It is worth watching.or.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining superhero fantasy about the son of Odin learning life lessons on earth (away from his homeworld realm of Asgard, glorioulsy conceived and rendered by the special effects artists) that help to temper his rash and brazen impulses that have brought the threat of war to the very edge of the golden realm.  Within this context we see the machinations and convolutions of Thor's half-brother, Loki, at once jealous of and zealous for Thor.  The family dynamics play out with satisfying twists and conclusions (will Loki kill his father? which father will Loki kill?) that keep a substantial feel to them while Thor's earthly mortal friends are light as feathers; they are engaging enough while they are there but easily forgettable when they are gone.  In truth Asgard feels more real than earth; a feat surely made plausible by Loki's use of magic on us, the audience.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a terrific free app. The ads only come up in between games, so they don't just hang out on your screen and annoy you constantly. The app is very clean without the irritating ad banners.<br />Easy to play, great app.

I hate to call them bit players, because they<br />really add to the movie. DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE!!
B0059XTUMC|4.0|I still wonder how the Academy Awards have been so receptive with these three author projects: Midnight in Paris, The tree of life and The Artist.<br /><br />This indicates a clear signal as well as a visible conceptual exhaustation inside Hollywood screenplayers. Let`s be honest. The artist is an emblematic and even nostalgic vision respect a forgotten era. The film scrutinizes around the decisive breakthrough of a succesful silent actor.<br /><br />We are aware that Greta Garbo's voice never collated with her classical beauty. In this sense what I most liked of the film (and perhaps its major originality)is the smart homage to great films of the past. The cites about Citizen KLane (notice the sequence in which Jean Dujardin is at the front of a typewriter; the clever episode in which we can enjoy the great soundtrack of Vertigo; obviously there's a blink respect Billy Wilder's  Sunset Boulevard and the final curtain in which the image of Fred Astaire is more than evident.<br /><br />The two other films in the past which adressed this issue were Cinema Paradiso  and Good morning Babylon (curiously from two Italian filmakers such as Tornatore and Taviani brothers). The flexible visual narrative, the rhthym of an agile script, the presence of this extraordinary actor (a blend of Rodolfo Valentino and Jorge Negrete) make of this original proposal the great surprise of the year.<br /><br />Here - between you and me - the Golden Globe awards have always been one step ahead respect the Academy Awards in which concern audacious proposals; but at the end, I guess this film will monopolize Best Motion Picture and probably Best Director and Best Actor (that would mean for France the second feat after the lovable Marion Cotillard in 2007).<br /><br />But, far beyond the prizes that can win this work; it represents -by itself- the fresh air intake so crowded of galactic special effects.<br /><br />An endearing film that will capture your heart from start to finish. Don't miss it.it.

B0016OOS16|5.0|Very  nice, very useful, very practical, specially  for  CAD Programs.<br />The only  limitation  is that it's too light when we pull the Cap up, some times stronger than we should, to move objects Up and it takes off of the table.<br />But that I was expecting, afterall it should be light to be for notebooks. It should be light.<br />I do recommend this 3Dconnexion for Notebooks.  It works great and does  help,  but  have in mind this point.

B0041I0N9A|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and me to build last Christmas and we love it. We have built several other Lego kits together, but nothing quite this large.<br /><br />First of all, it is stunning as a display piece. Its wings make this model seem very large and the detail makes it an instant conversation piece for any guests. The mini figs that come with it are also very cool and truly belong with the ship, unlike some other mini figs an their kits.<br /><br />Secondly, the build itself was much more interesting than I thought it would be. By looking at the box, I thought it was going to be an all-white block nightmare. However, it is mixed up nicely with some gear box builds and some really cool unique blocks. It took my 7 year old daughter and me about two weeks to build of about 1hour a night.<br /><br />On the downside, It is not a model to play with. It has lots of smaller pieces that fall off at the slightest provocation. It comes with a display stand, so I don't think even Lego meant for it to played with in living room battles!  Treat it with kid gloves for sure or you might find yourself crying about it later.<br /><br />Overall, it was well-worth the money. Great build experience with my daughter and stunning conversation piece for the display shelf. Highly recommend it to intermediate Lego builders, may be difficult for newer builders.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|this was my first iphone 4S case. i loved everything about it except the buttons weren't covered, this made changing volume and locking cumbersome enough that i bought a new case, the griffin reveal. i ended up liking that case better but the trade off was that the reveal was catchy and hard to reposition in my pocket and caught sometimes on my pocket when i took it out. also at first i thought this clear case would show off my iphone which it did at first, but soon dirt and dust were visible and i'm not a big fan of cleaning things, lol
0385342063|5.0|As a long time fan of Sophie Kinsella (not so much her real persona, Madeleine Wickham, though - I don't like the Madeleine Wickham books at all), I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER made me fearful. Not that I would be scared by the book itself, but that the book would disappoint me and ruin everything I love about Kinsella. CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is my go-to book for when I'm depressed. Well, let's just say that I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER, while not as impressive as CONFESSIONS, is a great addition to the Sophie Kinsella library. If you just forget that Sophie Kinsella is a pseudonym for Madeleine Wickham, author of the dreadful THE GATECRASHER, that is.<br /><br />I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER is the story of Poppy Wyatt, a young physical therapist living in London and engaged to the too-good-to-be-true Magnus Tavish, a genius from a family of geniuses. Poppy and Magnus barely know one another, but he's proposed, wedding arrangements have been made, and in a few short days they'll be walking down the aisle. By chance, though, Poppy acquires the phone of business consultant Sam Roxton's PA (who chucked it in a garbage can after quitting) after her phone is stolen and her ring goes missing. Poppy decides to help Sam out while using the phone for her own purposes, and of course antics ensue. This is a romantic comedy, after all.<br /><br />While she wasn't the brightest bulb in the box, Poppy was an adorable narrator full of problems, concerns, naïve thoughts, and a desire to help that is often misguided. Paired with the brash, workaholic Sam, and the relationship between these two is fun and electric. Magnus is a wonderful secondary character that really does come off as a strange love interest with some secrets that rock Poppy to her core. The plot itself was cute, fun, and unique. And seriously, sharing a phone with anyone? Sharing a phone with my mother when we're out is like pulling teeth, especially when she goes through my email thinking that she can find directions that way. Sharing it with a complete stranger? Agh noooo!<br /><br />I did have a slight problem, but this is related mostly to my eGalley (from Netgalley) copy on Kindle. Footnotes are a major part of the story, tying in Poppy's relationship with Magnus and putting in her own personal thoughts on situations. On my eGalley, though, the footnotes would appear on random pages at random places, making the experience confusing. I wish that Kindle would do a better job of incorporating footnotes, but I guess that asking anything of Kindle is a hard bargain.<br /><br />This is a longer book, but after you hit the 50% mark or so, the book flies by. It's quick and fun and definitely Kinsella's best book since CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC. Poppy was no Becky Bloomwood, but she was adorable and I was definitely rooting for her. And I loved Sam! He was such a great character in my opinion, but I am notoriously fond of strong business-minded types over action heroes. Magnus was equally smarmy and skeezy, creating the perfect atmosphere for the story. This book was plotted and paced well for the most part. It was charming, quirky, and adorable.<br /><br />VERDICT: A definite Kinsella success, I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER is cute and romantic while maintaining a wonderful comedic edge. If you're into cute chick lit, this book is definitely for you.g it with a complete stranger?

Even added a pouch on the bottom portion of the sheath very easily as well as wrapping para cord around that also.  Cannot beat this knife for the price!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Hardcore McCartney Buffs will remember Paul's practical joke on the world when an album called \\"Thrillington\\" appeared; a lounge-ish instrumental recreation of \\"Ram\\" credited to one Percy \\"Thrills\\" Thrillington. The album, once McCartney let on to the joke years later, became a collectors' item. But the whole thing of McCartney as socialite muzak maker is part of Paul's lore.<br /><br />Once I started listening to \\"Kisses On The Bottom\\" (a line from the opening song \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\"), I was wondering if McCartney was serious or playing up his audience for a laugh. He's played around with expectations before (the three albums as The Fireman with producer Youth, his ventures into classical music, movies, etc,), and he's pulled standards out for albums since the beginning of The Beatles. Nor is he the first performer to decide a shot at the great songbook of the 30's, 40's and 50's would be an artistic challenge. Think Linda Ronstadt's Nelson Riddle phase or Rod Stewart's ongoing \\"Great American Songbook\\" series. To McCartney's credit, he uses Diana Krall's ace band and producer Tommy LiPuma, who could do these arrangements in their sleep. Plus, they went to one of the best old studios in the world, Capitol A, where the likes of Nat King Cole and Fran Sinatra fashioned the kind of sound McCartney strives for here.<br /><br />\\"Kisses On The Bottom\\" succeeds for the most part because of the professionalism. Every note is perfect, every brushed drum stroke sounds bristle-soft, McCartney sings in a register that emphasizes every breath. Even McCartney's two ringers, \\"My Valentine\\" and \\"Only Our Hearts\\" hitch right into line like a jigsaw puzzle. It's - to quote U2 - even better than the real thing. Which is another reason why I'm having such a tough time warming up to more than a C Grade for \\"Kisses On The Bottom.\\" When McCartney and John Lennon teamed up to start The Beatles, these were exactly the kind of songs they were writing against. There's a strange sort of irony the man who buried the kind of standardized pop songs in the 60's simply by shaking his mop-top and singing \\"She loves you, yeah yeah yeah\\" is resurrecting the music he helped to sweep aside for a new big thing. Somewhere, Percy Thrillington is smiling.t.

B002ZG98UK|4.0|I'm a 3-D buff and purchase about half the stuff out there that is out in 3-D. This one worked for me with the great sets, the strong heroine and special effects. This is strickly action thriller fluff and not meant to be taken that seriously. Hey--shoot up the mindless zombies and do your best to get that henchman who is trying to control the world. That's about it it. I did like the scenes in particular that involved the airplane she drives around in. In that I like action movies I'd give this a 3 1/2 stars for my viewsing experience. If you need a strong plot with lots of double crosses and mind blowing twists, this is not it. [[ASIN:B004DTXJ4S Resident Evil: Afterlife]]

B004EPZ0AM|4.0|Ok, i agree what others reveiws says about this movie which include criticisms as \\"poor plot\\", \\"poor direction\\", \\"repetitive history\\"... but come on!, this is a kids movie, and HAPPY FEET is about dancing and feelings and particularly i think this sequels reaches its goal, obviously is not good as the first one but HAPPY FEET 2 has a powerful emotional force on every song escene, specialy on the \\"UNDER PESSURE\\"(cover) escene which make you stand-up with eyes closing singing while goosebumps and shivers runs through your body. Just for only this powerful reason i will buy this movie on blu-ray(plus, my little son love Happy Feet 2)<br /><br />PS: This song still humming on my heart, so please every body, why just can't we give love, GIVE LOVE, GIVE LOVE, GIVE LOVE...!!!

0811870413|5.0|So if you have the time to invest into creating your own starter from nothing more than flour and water and the natural yeast in the air and on your hands, this book is a really amazing experience.  The process of creating this book's basic country bread is something that anyone can do (thanks to the tons of photographs of the entire process).  The natural yeast starter also is a lot stronger than dry yeast packets, and while it takes longer to rise, it is much stronger is hard to kill when you follow the recipe.  I've had mine going for a couple months now and have loved every weekend baking day so far.  The book also invites you to add subtle variations to the same recipe with different flours or a handful of nuts or seeds, which allow you to create a whole array of tasty breads with just one recipe - which you will have memorized by the 3rd or 4th baking.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this book, its inviting story that it tells and its exceptional simple recipe for a truly unique bread.  Be warned though, you will be hesitant to buy bread at a store after making it at home a couple of times... once you see how simple it is to make such amazing bread at home.<br /><br />Go for it!

1250006341|5.0|When I ordered this book, what I really wanted was to read the text of the actual story.  What I learned was that there was no text.  Probably the program that Masterpiece Theatre showed was just from a script.  Yet the background of all the scenery, characters and history of the story was magnificent and prompted a very fast read.  I hated finishing it as much as I hated having  Season 2 end last week.  I am in \\"The World of Downton Abbey\\" withdrawal and as fast as life goes, I can hardly wait for Season 3.  What is extra special is that my spouse loves the show as much as I do.  And the casting was as perfect as is the acting.  SUPERB!  THANK YOU, AMAZON!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love this genre so I very much enjoyed this book. I watched the HBO series first before reading this, but I wasn't disappointed. The book and the series are practically mirrors of each other except for some details here and there. I enjoyed reading about details that the series did not really dwell into. In the book, you really get to know the characters and where they were coming from. It was interesting to know the inner workings of their minds. The book was also very visual and creative. I appreciate how George R.R. Martin was able to create this entirely new and interesting world. I am looking forward to the rest of the books in this series.

To me, practically everything in this book is like common sense since I've been applying them even when I was in college- adapt, network network network, always keep an eye out for the next opportunity, COMMIT based on limited information, invest in yourself.  I would even add my mom's saying, \\"never burn bridges\\".<br /><br />Who will get the most out of this book: students, entry-level, recent grads, anyone in business<br /><br />For everyone else: good book to read, lots of useful concepts that can be applied.

B006FTCH2E|5.0|As this film began, I didn't have high hopes for enjoying it, but I was intrigued by the premise.  Then, when Rhoda first sees John Burrough's at the roadside memorial, she peeks around one of the balusters of the steps where she is hiding and the dawn sun hits her face.  I was struck by the perfect and simple beauty of that shot.  From that point on, the film just became more and more beautiful, both visually and emotionally.  There were many, many scenes that I wish I could frame and hang on the wall as beautiful works of art.  You can really tell that great care was taken.<br /><br />The story itself was handled very quietly and thoughtfully, focusing more on the personal aftermath of a horrific event and the emotional evolution of the two main characters affected by the event.  However, there were a few scenes when the suspense was enough that I caught myself holding my breath.<br /><br />Even though the film moves at a slow, quiet pace, I was always completely engaged because of the wonderful acting of Brit Marling and William Mapother.  Never underplaying or overplaying their parts, they made me feel as though I were an invisible witness to their character's lives.  Their ability to create empathy in the viewer is very impressive.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|This addictive series continued its excellence into Season 2.  It succeeded in introducing a couple of new characters into the mix without watering or muddling the plot.  Most notably, it gave Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) a fianc&eacute;e - Lavinia Swire as played by Zoe Boyle - and Lady Mary Crawley (cast standout Michelle Dockery) a fianc&eacute; - Sir Richard Carlisle as played by Iain Glen.  Both additions are very effective...for very different reasons: Swire because she's likable and winning, even to putative romantic rival Lady Mary; Carlisle because he is wonderfully complex, scheming and increasingly unlikable (by design).  And, it turns out that Carlisle has the goods on both Lady Mary (news of her dalliance with the Turkish diplomat is something he both thwarts as press baron and wields as potential partner) and Lavinia (he also threatens to expose a family secret of hers).  How that foursome plays out is one of the dominant arcs of Season 2.<br /><br />Writer Julian Fellowes triumph is that he balances that compelling thread with a number of others of interest to viewers.  The next of particular note is maid Anna's romance with Brendan Coyle's Mr. Bates, valet to Hugh Bonneville's Lord Robert Crawley.  Coyle - an unlikely sex symbol if there ever was one (as he laughingly admits) - is put through the gamut of the highest highs and lowest lows.  The high: the hand in marriage to Joanne Froggatt's Anna, the emotional anchor of story.  She's the story's single most lovable character - pure, ardent, resolute, slyly beautiful.  The low: tried for murder for the death of his despicable first wife.  To say that Season 2 does not end on a high note for Mr. Bates is vastly understating the case.<br /><br />Season 2 is also notable for a slow-rising malaise in Bonneville's Lord of the manor.  His inability to play a meaningful role in the war has obviously eaten at him, as has his general disgust with the senselessness of the war.  Matthew's injuries have brought this home to him in the most personal of manners.  His low state comes out first with his increased irritation with wife, Cora (Elizabeth McGovern).  But from the second he intersects with new housemaid, Jane Moorsum, I said immediately \\"uh-oh.\\"  Jane's backstory - husband killed in the war, saddled with a young son to raise - resonates with Crawley's lament of war's tragic outcomes.  And, those piercing blue eyes of Clare Calbraith's give you a pretty good idea of where this part of the story is headed.<br /><br />My only complaint about Season 2 is that a couple of the plotlines seem too contrived.  Matthew goes from probable transected spine to miracle walker to a full-out, full-powered grappling with Sir Richard in a matter of a couple of episodes.  [It's notable that in the \\"Making Of\\" featurette Bonneville joking shouts \\"It's a miracle\\" as Stevens arises from his wheelchair without assistance...and Stevens all but rolls his eyes when he says \\"I'm assuming Julian did his research...\\"]  And the series threatened to go totally off the rails with an almost inexplicable visit to the house by a wounded, disfigured Canadian solider claiming to be Mary's ex-fianc&eacute; thought to be lost on the Titanic sinking.  His cause and claim are only believed by often overlooked middle sister, Edith.  That plot is quickly discarded, hopefully because Fellowes realized the ridiculousness of it.  The show is renowned for its well-scripted stories.  That one was a clear outlier...absurd in both its premise and presence in this otherwise excellent series.<br /><br />Can't wait for Season 3...especially after learning that Shirley MacLaine is the 'Grandmama' that Lady Mary aims to spend time with over the coming year (to let Sir Richard's loud, probable bombshell play out).o him in the most personal of manners.  His low state comes out first with his increased irritation with wife, Cora (Elizabeth McGovern).

That one was a clear outlier...absurd in both its premise and presence in this otherwise excellent series.<br /><br />Can't wait for Season 3...especially after learning that Shirley MacLaine is the 'Grandmama' that Lady Mary aims to spend time with over the coming year (to let Sir Richard's loud, probable bombshell play out).

B0035WTJFW|4.0|This movie starts fast and quickly immerses the viewer in a very strange world with dialog and action that blazes along making it difficult to keep up. The important thing is to hang in there and the pieces will all start to fit together. The movie is based on a novella by Philip K. Dick who is known for his highly original imagination and who has come up with ideas for stories unlike anyone else. This is another one of those original story lines and takes the viewer on a wild ride.<br /><br />Fortunately the pieces begin to all fit together and do so with dramatic use of the surround speakers and plenty of action on screen. The basic premise of the movie is a technology has developed that permits the viewing of a crime before it actually happens so police can step in and stop the crime before it has taken place. Just as this system of crime prevention is ready to go nationwide something happens that changes everything. The Tom Cruise character, a policeman named John Anderton, is suddenly plunged into a situation that threatens his very life.<br /><br />He must now use the crime prevention system called Precrime to find out the truth and discover who is out to frame him. His search for the truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie.<br /><br />I encourage the viewer to give the movie a chance because although at first it might seem confusing it quickly shapes up into a good sci-fi adventure movie.

B001PO53IO|5.0|I was definitely one of those skeptics who didn't think Star Wars would work as an animated show. I especially was worried about the art style. However, after hearing that Darth Maul was coming back, I decided to try it out - and ended up loving it.<br /><br />The show is very respectful of the movies and does a good job building upon the themes in the original and prequel trilogies while adding its own new characters and stories. Ashoka Tano, Anakin's apprentice, has a wonderful combination of sass and charm. Assaj Ventress, Dooku's apprentice, adds the first true female villain to the series. Even more impressive, the series makes you care about the clone troopers, who act much more like American G.I.s than Stormtroopers. The very first episode, which features Yoda, reminded me much more of Yoda from empire Strikes Back than anything in the prequels. His love for nature and emphasis on cunning over brute strength. Even Jar Jar and the Battle Droids, who come across as ridiculous in the movie, are genuinely funny in the show.<br /><br />While there are some \\"silly\\" moments, the show is much more mature than you might expect from a cartoon. In some of the better episodes, the show depicts the reality of war far better than Attack of the Clones. \\"Innocents of Ryloth\\" was particularly moving, with the little Twilek girl who tagged along with the clone troopers. Cad Bane, the new bounty hunter, brings a new level of awesomeness and brutality. Bane kills his enemies without remorse, even going so far as to kill Jedi babies.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Star Wars I'd recommend giving the show a try. It's not just for kids. I haven't once felt \\"silly\\" for watching it. In fact, it does some stuff better than the movies.
B000SEDDQ6|1.0|PLEASE NOTE: This is my opinion. There have been some commenters that apparently don't know that.<br /><br />This book is awful. Thank God it was only 176 pages. It had awful writing, a bad plotline, unrealistic events, and stupid explainers for basic words.<br /><br />If you look at my books you'll see that I don't hate sad endings. I don't hate it when bad things happen to characters I love, I don't angry when everything is full of despair. But only as long as it's realistic despair. The things that happened to these kids are just stupid. They're things that would never happen and it's dumb to write about them.<br /><br />I almost ripped out hair out from Snicket explaining words. I get that this book is aimed at younger kids, so it's fine to explain what a word means; it would be good for young readers. But it explain such basic words it was ridiculous.<br /><br />The writing wasn't exactly bad quality, but it was a style I didn't like. I won't say people shouldn't like it, I'm just saying it wasn't for me.<br /><br />If you liked this book... well, I don't really get it, but kudos to you. Doesn't make sense to me, but other people can have opinions, too. This wasn't a very low-quality book, just not my style. I'll probably read more books in the series just because I hate to start and not finish one, but I probably won't like those, either.<br /><br />Before you comment, please keep in mind that this is my opinion. I'm not saying the book is bad quality, I'm not saying you shouldn't like it. I'm saying I don't like it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|The content of this book receives five stars with ease. This version gets two at best. There are countless errors in spelling and grammar, which annoys me greatly. Despite this, I found this novel to be a delightful read. I haven't enjoyed a book like this in ages.

B0012909NQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this dvd,(although I only watch the 3rd dvd come rain or shine most of the time), it is an awesome show. When they came to the USA I was glad they did not change the setlist and still included \\"ripples\\" a true classic Genesis moment in time. From start to finish a Great set list a must have for all Genesis Fans and beyond fans like myself. You can't go wrong here.
0062513982|1.0|I really like Coelho's other novels, but this one was completely a waste of time. Nothing in the novel spoke to me, and the story line didn't make much sense. The ending blew chunks. Don't bother reading.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|Everything about this movie for the type of genre that its in is thrilling, and in the name of love which is more than i can say for most movies of this nature.<br />I loved LOVED ryan gosling.  he proves himself to be a real bad ass without losing his appeal.<br />I dont like movies like this bloody and violent...but this movie had me captivated the entire length of the film.  I am impressed for many other reasons left unsaid so as not to spoil it for others.  i enjoyed the realness in which it was filmed..no over the top suspension of disbelief scenes. better than other movies of its kind, its off beat, and simple but intelligent.<br /><br />good acting, good script, same ole mafia plot the climactic elements were spread throughout the entire film not just build up to the end...the ending will have you by the balls.<br /><br />great job guys!

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Are there seriously this many people reviewing this app so highly when it has no consideration or respect for the privacy of the users information? No one reads permissions nowadays? This app not only crosses that line but also takes from you without even needing what's being taken or at least provides an explanation for having access to! Shouldn't there be an option to allow these extras?! Why does it need my contacts? Why does it need to know all the accounts my device has used? What's it need to write that info somewhere else without informing me, asking for my permission given the circumstances, or informing me of where its going? etc. etc. This app either sucks or I must being missing out on whats worth giving up my personal info, my contacts' info, as well as the info of anyone who uses  my device! Exp: You have this ingenious idea and have been working on it for months thinking hoping it'll payoff, then when you finish and present it, somehow, someway, all your work that you saved with this app word for word, someone else has claimed for there own... just one example.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|When I purchased my Kindle Fire I reviewed all the cases available and this one caught my eye.  It is more than I expected.  It is soft, durable and very elegant looking.  When laying on a table, etc. it looks like an expensive book or journal.  I would highly recommend this cover.
0307956350|4.0|Page turner. Beach book.  Airport read.  I had trouble putting The Expats down at night.<br /><br />Author Chris Pavone has spun a web of lies around two couples: the recently relocated Kate and Dexter and the not-quite-what-they-seem Bill and Julia.<br /><br />Kate Moore quits her CIA job to become a stay-at-home-mom (SAHM) when husband, Dexter, lands a great job that requires them to move to Luxembourg.  Kate's difficulty in adjusting to her new life (and husband's long hours) is compounded by her suspicions surrounding another, very friendly expat couple.<br /><br />Kate takes readers through a maze of deception and danger, but author Pavone keeps it light by including details about her difficulties in being a SAHM in a foreign country.  This is not a typical spy thriller, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and tried not to figure out the next moves, lest I spoil the ride.<br /><br />The constantly changing timeline (flash backs, flash forwards) was not confusing, the publisher uses a different typeface in some chapters.  The only strange interlude was when Kate visited a criminal's hideout in order to purchase a gun.  The chapter seemed ripped from a different novel altogether.<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun reading a book in awhile. I look forward to reading Chris Pavone's next book--whatever that may be.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Its pretty good compared to a lot of them. excel is very much like desktop version. editing options are nice too.
0131103628|3.0|The book arrived promptly, and I put it away for a few days.  Then, when I looked at it, I saw that about 40 of the pages at the end of the book were printed upside-down.  Very weird.  Did I get a counterfeit?  Was this a binding defect?  In any event, I contacted Amazon and they made it very easy for me to return the book with no shipping charges and gave me credit for the everything I paid for the book.  I'll get another copy of it soon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun. not all the games are good but what do you expect. its free. but very addictive and fun, I recommend.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|Simply perfect. This control bring new life into my Gamecube games. I try a couple of generic controllers before this one and found nothing so good as the original Nintendo-brand stuff. Highly recommended.<br /><br />However I rate this controller with four stars in \\"fun\\" given I always found odd the Gamecube's controller design. This piece is the best amount all the options out there but the inherent design is weird.
0439023521|5.0|This product is stellar and a good read. Arrived swift and on time and in excellent condition. I plan on buying the other books in the series.
0375714839|4.0|I began to read the book with some curiosity and was not at all sure if the story would be able to hold my attention, specially as it is in the form of comic strips. The story line is itself a very intense one. One has to pause and digest all the political upheavals that impact the child - marjane. Her growing up years are full of love and the contrast to her years in Austria where she is so alone is truly a fascinating read. Fortunately she returns to Iran and her parents and family to complete her education and to recoup from her Austrian adventure. This period mirrors the trauma Iran suffered in the war during the same time. Thanx to this book I have a better appreciation of the people from the war torn middle east.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|An excellent movie that brings personal integrity, opportunities to 'fall', exciting sub-plots and the seriousness of Fatherhood to an excellent blend of a good story.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun app, I think the games within the game are a bit high in point's, but fun to play overall
B0025W68JI|5.0|I got this so I could use the Jaws theme on a video I made about diving with sharks.  Wow, the rest of the tracks all bring back memories of the movies.  It is now one of my favorite albums.  John Williams did so many classics that you will be amazed.

B000068FXR|5.0|The wonderful marriage between wry humor and pathos in the literature of O.Henry can also be found in the exquisitely crafted rock'n'roll of Supertramp. After reading the other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one who considers Crisis? What Crisis? to be the most outstanding Supertramp album, even more so than its illustrious predecesor, Crime of the Century. There are no weak links among the 10 tracks, and the band's distinctive Beatles/Beach Boys/Pink Floyd/jazz influences are all here in full force. John Helliwell once stated that Crisis? What Crisis? was the band's attempt at social commentary, but there must be other reasons to explain why it has mostly languished in relative obscurity:<br /><br />1) No hits. \\"Sister Moonshine\\" did receive some radio play, and \\"Ain't nobody but me\\", \\"A Soapbox Opera\\", \\"Another Man's Woman\\", and \\"Two of us\\" have all been performed many times at the band's concerts, but for the most part, this album's songs just have not been heard by the average \\"classic rock\\" listener.<br /><br />2) Comparisons to Crime of the Century. To this day, Crime is considered by many to be the band's magnum opus. Crisis? What Crisis? was produced under great pressure a little over a year later, and is a very different album. Crime was much darker and featured an elaborate concept (see my review), while Crisis is a lighter, more down-to-earth album. The cover concept (sunbathing gent with golden umbrella and radio oblivious to the dreariness around him) brings home the escapism element. The original inner jacket and sleeve were both painted an unblemished sunny yellow, as if to highlight the bright musical euphoria contained within. Crisis features much more acoustic guitar, and its more subdued moments display an innocence and simplicity that Crime only hinted at. Some reviewers have accused Crisis of duplicating some of Crime's musical textures, with \\"Ain't nobody but me\\" being this album's \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"Lady\\", the new \\"Dreamer\\", and the long instrumental close of \\"Another Man's Woman\\" reminding some of the center section of \\"Rudy\\". These can be explained by the chronological proximity of the two albums, and the consistency of the band's signature sound.<br /><br />3) The \\"throwback\\" ethos. The timelessness of Supertramp's music comes to the fore with this album. This is their last \\"English\\" album, as the band permanently relocated to the United States during its recording. \\"Poor Boy\\", a pub-rock shuffle, has a wonderful clarinet solo that's straight out of Benny Goodman or Pete Fountain. \\"A Soapbox Opera\\" (the album's high-concept piece, which some have interpreted as a critique of institutional Catholicism) has an uncreditted female vocalist singing the hymn \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\" between the second and third verses. Others have commented on the Copland-esque Americana of \\"Easy Does It\\" and \\"Sister Moonshine\\", the scat vocals at the end of \\"Lady\\", and the Hollywood soundtrack strings on \\"Just a Normal Day\\". While maintaining a contemporary sound throughout, many of this album's songs also have a \\"long ago and far away\\" feel to them.<br /><br />4) The mysterious ending. While Crime of the Century closed with the grand catharsis of its title track, Crisis? What Crisis? reaches its conclusion with two songs that have alienated many. For those who love it, \\"The Meaning\\" (never performed live) is hypnotic, and for those who don't, it's repetitive. Helliwell's soaring soprano sax leads the listener into the setting sun during a very long fadeout. After an extended silence, \\"Two of us\\" serves as the album's peaceful postscript. Rockers may be offended by this ethereal, gather-round-the-harmonium hymn, but it's hard to conceive of any other way this album could have signed off with.<br /><br />This may come as a surprise, but if you enjoy the Breakfast in America and Famous Last Words albums, you should have no trouble with Crisis? What Crisis?, even if you are not familiar with any of its songs.Admittedly, the songs are structured differently on the two later albums, but the classic Supertramp sound is present on all three. That different themes can be cut from the same musical cloth has never been so aptly demonstrated as it has with this band. Drummer Bob Siebenberg has never had a better album, and Roger Hodgson's most vicious guitar solo until \\"Waiting so long\\" appears on \\"Ain't nobody but me\\". For those willing to venture beyond the search for \\"hits\\", Crisis? What Crisis? repays in spades. Thank God quality is not intrinsically linked to popularity.
B00005OAID|5.0|Unlike most, I bought the vinyl version of this album. And I really have to hand it to amazon, they pack it very well. Not very fast shipping though. But still. The vinyl is indeed the 2001 version, not some kinda re-press. It comes with the record and a nice lyric insert with some additional information. For 16 bucks, go ahead and do yourself a favor and get this album.

B000P74BHG|1.0|The book was not represented in the description well.  This is a Reader's Digest Condensed book with an abbreviated version of The Nun's Story, among others.  If I had known this, I would not have purchased this.  The book title was \\"The Nun's Story\\" - by K. Hulme.  It should have been titled:  Reader's Digest Condensed book and then all of the titles should have been listed.  That would have been more accurate..........
B006JTS5OO|5.0|Warm, charming and funny, just like the Muppets I remember from my childhood. I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It's funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that's becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced.
B003AXAS60|5.0|I bought this puppy for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it! It is very cute and well made.  She takes it everywhere.  I have washed few times and still looks like new.
B00005JLWN|2.0|A conceptual Christian Bale sci-fi vehicle that can't quite commit to its one primary plot point. It's the future, and we're living in a totalitarian regime thanks to a government-mandated drug that saps humanity of its ability to feel. Bale plays the cold, emotionless head of the gestapo, responsible for tracking and exterminating the few remaining shreds of liberal thought in the wild. Curiously, after incinerating every shred of artwork, poetry and literature he can find, this super-cop then retires to his ornately decorated office where a big show is made of the beautiful architecture and lavish sculptural decorations. The story's failure to comply with its own focal point doesn't end there, as Bale's coworkers and bosses are surprisingly animated and emotive for men supposedly removed from their own feelings. The plot offers no revelations, with the protagonist stomping through a shallow character arc and an overly simple, black-and-white evaluation of the grand scheme. There's fruit to be harvested here, but Equilibrium is either too short or too lazy to reach for it. A few very good action scenes (leading to an unusually high body count) are its only saving grace.
B00594MB2M|2.0|Te movie \\"Paris\\" has nice takes of the city. But the plot is boring and confussing at times.  Too much cursing.  It has the interesting point about enjoying every minute of your life. Not what I had expected.  I am ready to sell this DVD.

B0077DBZXO|4.0|My 9yr old daughter has been bugging me for a month to get this when it came out.<br />So I picked it up today.  She insisted I watch it with her, so we had some father<br />daughter time.  I really wasn't expecting much from the movie, but I was quite<br />surprised to see there was a solid storyline and the characters were all pretty<br />interesting.  In no time at all I was laughing my a-double-s off.  The movie was<br />consistantly mixed with humor and interesting plott. It never seemed to have any<br />dull spots and was very intertaining.  I would suggest this movie to all ages.<br />Check it out it's well worth the watch.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the app is so great on the kindle fire. so clear !!!the bad part is that it has a very limited amount but its free!!watya expect?!!its similar as the original so u don't hav to worry.
B0058VW36U|4.0|its an amazing game fun addictive and FRUSTRATING!!!  but still awesome i only gave four stars viz i finished the game in about one week the need more levels!!!!

B006NFKUF6|3.0|It's pretty fun until like 2 minutes ago when it said I had to buy the full version to keep playing so I only got play one level but I'd propaply say 3&ahalf stars but yeah so I guess I liked it but right after this I'm deleting it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Love the game.  the only thing I dislike is that the games cost so much.  they should start you off with more or give you more for completing each one.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I thought there was some better games in here than there was. but i still think this is an overall okay game I guess.
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|This was horrible.  It was the EXACT same thing as the original.  I could have watched the first one, and I wouldn't have known the difference.  Acting was horrid, plot was horrid, very predictable in every aspect, and I was not once interested in anything going on in this movie.  I usually love horror/suspense movies, but I have no clue what this was.  I think the budget might have been $1MM....if it wasn't then they got screwed.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This movie was great. It was funny through out the whole movie. I was not expecting anything from this movie but I laughed so hard I almost started to cry. It went straight to my faves because it was AWESOME!!!!!
0812550706|5.0|My buddy recommended this book after I had just finished my other book.  Let me just say, the thought that went into creating this book was unbelievable.  I usually can predict, as most can, the way a book will end.  This one had me thinking a lot on what could or would happen.  The ending itself is a masterpiece.  I am currently reading the 2nd installment, but it has some work to do for me to actually finish it.  Ender's Game is something everyone needs to read.  I don't think you can put this book into one genre and that is why I love it.  As old as this book is, it sure as hell beats recent pieces of crap that have come out.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works great on both rooted nook color and SGS Epic 4G touch. generally im not a mahjong fan but i really like this game
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I returned the kindle version for refund after several chapters when I realized it would not be getting any better. Not only is the plot deplorable but the writing is amateurish. As others have expressed, I'm disturbed that this has so much hype and appeal to young readers. Grammatically it sounds like it was written by a teenager, with lots of incomplete sentences and other flaws. Unfortunately our youth seem to be losing respect for the English language and for literary excellence.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love this movie. It has a great message for the entire family. Everyone needs to watch it<br />  It's great
1455869880|5.0|I was in love with this book when I preordered it. I was in love with this book when my preorder was messed up and I had to wait an extra week. I was so in love with this book that I bought a copy at Target, read it, got my preorder in, and read it again. I even went as far to go to every Target/Safeway/Walmart/Barnes & Noble in my vicinity and set stacks of TFiOS under Employee Recommend shelves and end caps. I did this because I believe TFiOS is a book that, um, yeah, EVERYONE should read.<br /><br />Yes, it's a \\"teen\\" book, but no, that does not mean that only those between the ages of 13-19 will enjoy it. My mother read this book and she appreciated it. I've persuaded teachers into reading this book and they've appreciated it. If you are a human being able to appreciate any type of book, you should read this one.<br /><br />One of the biggest criticisms I've seen for TFiOS is that the dialogue and characters in the book are unrealistic. To those I say: pah. As a sixteen-year-old girl, I can relate to these conversations. A lot of young adult fiction includes simplistic, demeaning dialogue that in no way represents the way teenagers communicate. We have personalities and think strange things and make funny jokes and have wit. If you don't believe this, then you aren't hanging around the right type of teenagers.<br /><br />Also, the deep thinking of the book is said to be questionable of a teenager, even one that is dying. Um. Okay. Dude. Again, let me say reiterate: we have brains. We use them. While contemplating the meaning of life and the finite quality of our existence, etc., etc., may not be as \\"teenager-y\\" as compulsively posting meaningless statues on Facebook or walking loops around the mall, we still do it.<br /><br />TFiOS is realistic. It's heartbreaking. It's hilarious. It will stick with you. And if you don't believe me - read it for YOURSELF.
B004XQO90E|5.0|Of all the movies that have come out in the past year Source Code makes my Top Ten favorite movie list. It's action packed, mysterious, it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I advise everyone who enjoys movies to buy this one ASAP!

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund, and Olivia Wilde all in one movie, I can already tell it's a movie to remember. When this movie was in theatres I went to see it 3 times, I honestly couldn't get enough of it. When it came out for DVD and blu ray I preordered it and since I was madly in love with it I got the blu ray edition. This movie was honestly my favorite movie from Disney ever! I love the story behind it and the action in it. It makes you want a world where you can battle people with disks, or ride those cool bikes on a daily basis. I cried, laughed, every emotion I probably had during this movie. It's a great movie and I advise anyone and everyone to buy it! It's seriously wonderful. You will not regret owning this movie.
1451648537|4.0|This book was very thorough and really painted a picture of who steve jobs was.  no punches were pulled.  at times it was a little redundant.  a few hundred pages could have been cut out of the book, but it was a good read nonetheless.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I normally don't write reviews for things but this series was so awesome that I had to make the exception. I did a sample of the series to see if I would like it which gave me the 1st book and part of the second and as soon as I was finished with the sample I was buying the series. I finished it in about 5 days (reading at night) because I could not put my kindle down. It moved at a fast pace with something at every turn. There were many a times I would end the chapter and a \\"oh my gosh\\" would come out of my mouth. I can't wait to read more of what Hugh Howey has to offer and I hope we get to see more of the silo's stories soon.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this album on the same day & before Adele got the Grammy's.  I did not watch the Grammy's & found out the next day that she won quite a few Grammy's.  I loved her voice, so I bought it from Amazon.  I'm glad her voice has recovered.
B000005GUL|5.0|I compare these two recordings for several main reasons: they usually head the field in recommendations for the best version to buy; they were the first two I heard, almost simultaneously, when as an teenager I was first becoming enraptured by opera; lastly, I happen to own and play both  and listen to them with pretty much equal enjoyment. Neither is perfect but they certainly do justice to this wonderful period-piece which made the sadly short-lived Weber famous throughout Europe.<br /><br />I first heard the Wolf's Glen scene in an EMI sampler LP of operatic highlights and still feel that it is the most atmospheric ever recorded - better than the Kleiber version which, although still effective, doesn't quite capture the Gothic chill and has a rather ordinary-voiced Samiel compared with the hard, abrasive Fritz Hoppe for Keilberth. Where Kleiber particularly scores is in the crowd scenes with the dances and choruses. It was a on a remainder bin LP - only the first LP of the set - that I heard his overture and the opening scene with its natural-sounding crowd noises, mocking laughter and galumphing peasants struck me as enormously invigorating music-making; Kleiber takes the whole thing at a clip and really injects life into proceedings. Keilberth is steadier and more staid, with the grander-sounding BPO but his is also an affectionate and beautifully played account.<br /><br />I give Kleiber five stars even though I readily admit an antipathy to Peter Schreier's throaty, nasal tenor. I really cannot comprehend how some find his pinched voice beautiful but he is impassioned and characterful here, sounding really desperate as Max, so I let it pass. Schock has a more conventionally baritonal heroic tenor and sings agreeably if a tad blandly. Dramatic verisimilitude is enhanced by the fact that Keilberth's singers deliver their own dialogue whereas for Kleiber a very truncated script is employed and actors are used, with the usual mismatch between singing and speaking voices. That abridgement also means that some famous lines are cut, such as that quoted by Bismarck in the Reichstag in 1849: \\"Glaubst du, dieser Adler sei dir geschenkt?\\" (\\"Do you think you get this eagle for nothing?\\").<br /><br />Regarding the leading ladies in both versions, all are superb. There is little to choose between two of the loveliest German post-war sopranos in Elisabeth Gr&uuml;mmer and Gundula Janowitz, both of whom were lyric sopranos who could sing the lighter Wagner roles and to whose silvery voices I could listen all night. Both Lisa Otto and Edith Mathis are delightful as &Auml;nnchen. I prefer Karl Christian Kohn's mostly focused, black-voiced Kaspar for Keilberth to Theo Adam (sometimes unkindly known by his non-admirers as \\"Mr Wobble\\", but passable for Kleiber). Both hermits are impressive, even if a younger-voiced Franz Crass is steadier than the veteran Gottlob Frick - but both bring the requisite kindly gravitas to the role. The Leipzig chorus is livelier and interpretatively freer than the more \\"operatic\\" Berliners; the latter are less animated in their hailing of Kilian and barracking of Max but only comparatively speaking and they respond credibly in little incidents such as when Max draws a knife on Kilian. Both conductors relish the Bauer element in the music. There are a few clumsy tape edits on the EMI recording and its 1958 stereo sound, although fine, is less immediate than the fuller but slightly toppy DG recording from 1973.<br /><br />DG persists in gracing the Originals cover with what is a basic solecism: a double-barrelled shotgun rather than a marksman's rifle. I cannot choose between these two admirable versions but can endorse both as excellent, faithful renditions which do honour to a seminal German opera.voices.

0743243315|3.0|Nazneen agrees to an arranged marriage, which is a  traditional custom in Bangladesh.  But her free-thinking sister runs away to marry a local boy she loves. The book follows both sisters' lives over a course of 15 years.<br /><br />Nazneen's husband is a lot older than her and he often raves on what an educated man he is, he seems to love to hear himself talk.  Quite a few reviewers disliked Chanu the husband raving on, I felt it was necessary for us to understand him (even though we would have said to him  \\"You've said that 1000 times before stop going on and on.\\") .  The letters from the sisters to each other were an essential part of showing us the two worlds,  Nazeen living in England and her sister still in Bangladesh.<br /><br />This story was interesting well written but only deserves a 3 star.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Such an addicting game. Once you start playing you can't<br />stop! I love seeing how far I can get. And how the graphics are in the game
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome game fun for all ages would recomend so so so so so so so so so so cool love it
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Didn't know exactly what to expect from this movie, but was blown away.  Incredibly scary, violent, and thrilling.  One of the best horror films I have ever seen.  A must for any horror fan.
B006ON41FC|5.0|lots of fun and quite challanging good fun for all ages with varying degrees of difficulty and levels to keep you on your toes
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Very enjoyable and funny movie with great acting.  This is one of those movies you can watch repeatedly and still enjoy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a great math type card game. The options are lots of fun! The whole family plays it! Hours of fun!
B005OCFGTO|2.0|movies were in good shape but the case was all broken on three of the sides. I had to buy a new case
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like it! !!! it really makes you have to think. think about if I move this what other moves will I have......
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very challenging, lots of variety.  love the colors and symbols.  just started using this app and I'm hooked!  give it a try.
098478280X|5.0|Well... I admit that the first time I came across this book, it was completely by accident. Now I am so happy I did. Definitely worth reading. It is a perfect trade off between coverage and size. In other words, it covers the most important topics in the most compact form possible. The problems are very well-selected and if you use the book right, you will definitely improve your skills.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I originally watched this movie from a cd set from the library, but loved it so much I had to buy it on Amazon to watch again and share it with friends and family. And trust me, I'm not a person who generally watches a movie more than once. It is an HBO mini series, so it's very long, but I couln't wait to be able to have time to watch the next disc.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was excellent from the history lesson, to the dialogue, to the authenticity. Just a word of caution though, this was made using the dialect of the time so you have to really be attentive. Also, the character portraying John Adams speaks in very low tones. This is a movie you really have to watch and be involved in to get the true meaning and experience.<br /><br />If you care anything about the founding of America or are a history buff, then this is a must see movie. It's also a great teaching resource for childern. Just make sure they are not on a sugar high before watching and be ready to explain some things.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You can read and share Gods Word so easily. Many versions to choose from, and you can even have it read to you. An absolutely wonderful application!  I always have my Bible with me and that is very important to me.
B0071QIN00|3.0|I really like the game play, but on a G2 the throttle quits working and won't work until I restart my phone. Hope to see an update soon, if this issue is resolved I would buy their other game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good variety of games that keep you busy,  but be aware the games are not challenging, but they are entertaining
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|its a great game cuz there's different seasons and different birds and it has a accurate shot when it hits the pigs or pumpkins!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|- This is the first fantasy book I've read and I found the fantasy element to be a bit lacking. There are dragons and other fanciful creatures but not as much as I was expecting. So people wanting high fantasy may be disappointed.<br /><br />- This is the most engaging book I've read in the last few months. Although I didn't find it poorly written there are no delightfully written sentences, or delightfully read sentences I should say. I mean the story is great, the characters could be people you actually know, and the writing is neither wonderful nor distractingly bad.<br /><br />- I'm not gonna insult people who don't want to read depressing/gritty stories (I wouldn't say A Game of Thrones is depressing full stop, but some parts certainly are). Instead I will just echo what a lot of other reviews are saying: bad things happen to good people and people die in this book (if you're planning on doing the whole series your favorite character may die) and, what seems to be most damning for some people, bad things do not necessarily happen to bad people.<br /><br />- Every person I have met who has read this book has wanted to discuss it with me when they find out I've read it. Indeed this is a really good book to discuss with others because everyone has characters they love and hate and the bad characters aren't all bad and the good characters aren't all good and they are mostly well written. So people can discuss why such and such did that and why it was or wasn't x and how such and such was so y and that's really fun to do! Oh, and Sansa haters are jerks (see? it's fun!).<br /><br />- Regarding the Kindle edition: all of the issues I read about appeared to have been fixed now.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I really love these shoes, they come in the original box with the flag, sticker, and of course the shoe! They are pricey but they are very worth it. Buy true to size! If you are going to wear socks that are a bit big I would get 1/2 a size up. I wear the heel socks and they work very well and are not visible. I am def. going to get another pair in the natural color this time. Great buy, they are soo comfy and cute!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love killing time with solitaire! App works great, and the ads are fairly inobtrusive.  Running a DroidX with GB. Runs nice and quick
032147404X|5.0|This book covers a lot of information w/out making your eyes go crossed while the author pokes and jabs at you with just the right amount of humor and personality w/out making you roll your eyes. What makes this guide stand out the most is that Kellby delivers what would normally be an overwhelming crash course in photography in a familiar and friendly conversation.<br /><br />This is definitely a must-read for anyone that is the least be interested in digital photography!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|luv. this game get it i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i like this game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has helped me in my walk with God. My favorite features are the bookmarks feauture and the easy access to several translations. I can bookmark verses and tag them so if I need a verse that has to do with, say &quot;faith&quot; I can go to my bookmarks and see all the verses ive bookmarked about faith. Very useful!! I like the versions because instead of spending money on several different Bible translations, I can have them all in the same place. Super easy to use once you get used to it. The reading plans are great! And before you judge and say the Bible is fiction, sit down and read it with an open mind! God will speak if you listen! :)
B006UIYXL8|1.0|Slooooooow and Boooooring!!!  Turned it off with only 20 minutes to go---it was that bad. Didn't really care what happened to old J Edgar, by that point.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|this a pretty good app, however it can get kind of  frustrating at times. Before you buy it try getting the free version first, if you like it buy the full version.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great sets and actual locations, superb cast of seasoned Brit performers and a few \\"new\\" faces, compelling stories and characters one can really care about and/or revile. Wow! What more could one ask of a period soap opera? Well, for one, let's hope series three hits our shores soon. I highly recommend this fine gorgeous looking program to all. 'Nuff said!
B002RKSU3K|5.0|I liked this book. I have also seen the movie the move was related off of from the book. It had differences though. I like the book and the movie.The book had alot more details for the reader.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|'Something's Gotta Give' purports to be a comedy and romance that mixes two opposites that eventually attract. It does do that, but is WAY too long, involves too many personality and plot changes to be believable, and makes the viewer wonder why any woman would spend five minutes with a mostly overly shallow, sometimes positively unnerving Nicholson.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Well, I don't know how I did it, but I've spent a lot of time in Sweden! It's old news that Ms. Salander is an inspiring character, but she is. That said, this is very graphic, tough book, so make sure you're ready. But it is a satisfying ending.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|In my search for the perfect case, I've narrowed it to these categories:  face protection, sturdiness, bulk, ease of use, photos.<br /><br />I've bought 4 cases:<br />#1: the case you're viewing<br />AmazonBasics Protective TPU Case with Screen Protector for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S (Clear)<br />My favorite case so far.  Gave it 5 stars because there's no 4.5 and 4 isn't high enough.  The only knock is because stuff can get lodged into the edges...little specks of dirt.  But don't let that deter you from buying this case, because it's EASY TO USE, you can take it off and clean it and put it back on easily.  It is TPU material, so it isn't completely solid, but when you pick it up, THE BACK IS VERY STABLE, so no issues.  Not a streamline case, but not bulky, either...the design just works.  NO FLASH ISSUES when using the camera.  Finally, the edge on the front of the case protects the screen when lying face down.<br /><br />#2<br />Sinjimoru InLite Ultra Thin 0.9mm Bumper Case for iPhone 4S & 4 AT&T Sprint Verizon - CRYSTAL CLEAR<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VI898M/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details<br />Not using this bumper.  It's incredibly thin, but IT'S UNSTABLE because it just pops off...I guess that makes it EASY TO USE.  IT DOESN'T PROTECT THE FACE because the roll-over is on the back, so the back stays off the table, but if face down, the face of the phone rubs on the table.  Obviously NO CAMERA FLASH ISSUES...it's a bumper.  NOT BULKY...it's the thinnest bumper I've ever seen.<br /><br />#3<br />White Replicase Hard Crystal Air Jacket Case AT&T iPhone 4 4G 16GB 32GB (not for Verizon)<br />Not using this case.  VERY STURDY.  EASY TO USE.  MARGINAL face protection.  Camera hole is too small so the FLASH CAUSES A CLOUDY PICTURE.  Be aware, the picture in the description show two cases, one with a bigger hole and one with a smaller.  Very lean case.  There is no way to designate which one when purchasing.  I took a chance and got the one with the smaller hole and therefore am not using this case because the case causes cloudy pictures when using the flash.<br /><br />#4<br />iLuv Overlay Translucent Hardshell Case for iPhone 4S - 1 Pack - Case - Retail Packaging - White<br />I will use this case.  But be aware, it isn't clear, it's translucent.  It IS STURDY; IS EASY TO USE; PROVIDES MARGINAL FACE PROTECTION because of a slight roll over the front.  Very lean case.  IT DOES TAKE CLEAR PICTURES...so no issues when using the flash.<br /><br />#5<br />Apple iPhone 4S/iPhone 4 S-Line Hybrid Case (White)<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IEH7FA/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details<br />I thought this was going to be my favorite case.  IT IS STURDY; DOES PROVIDE FACE PROTECTION...because of a slight rollover the front.  It is easy to put on...but the on off button is covered, so it is DIFFICULT TO PUSH THE ON OFF BUTTON.  It isn't the most bulky...so middle of the road.  The camera flash causes SLIGHT CLOUDINESS.  This case is so close to working.<br /><br />#6<br />Yep, I'm a Dawg.<br />Washington Huskies iPhone 4 / 4S Case<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UQU2BQ/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details<br />It's my game day uniform for my phone.  IT IS STURDY; is A VERY LEAN CASE; PROVIDES MARGINAL FACE PROTECTION; IS EASY TO USE; NO FLASH ISSUES...does not take cloudy pictures.<br /><br />#7<br />Snap-on Rubber Coated Case for Apple® iPhone® 4 AT&T / Verizon, White / Black<br />http://www.amazon.com/Rubber-Coated-Apple%C2%AE-iPhone%C2%AE-Verizon/dp/B0059DLL8I/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1330192705&sr=8-12<br />Not using.  IS VERY STABLE; PROVIDES GOOD FACE PROTECTION because of slight rollover; is not very bulky...middle of the road;  IS FAIRLY EASY TO USE...snaps together; CLOUDY PICTURES are why I don't use this case...the hole is cut too close and causes cloudiness.<br /><br />#8<br />LifeProof iPhone 4/4S Case, Black<br />If you want ultimate protection, in a streamlined package, this is the way to go.  This is the case they drop in the water at Best Buy.  I love it...the only issue is you have to use the special adapter for a headset...but how can that be an issues if you want a water proof case?  That adapter makes this case more waterproof than any other case.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this was the funniest most addicting game ever!!!!!!!!!!even though it is 99 cents it I very fun!!!!I could play this 24/7

B004JK61K0|5.0|This works fine on kindle fire. I successfully set up<br />Gmail and Comcast emails. Some reviewers were saying that there isn't a send button. This is not true. On the kindle you have to bring up the kindle menu that is on the bottom center of most apps. You will see the option to send in there.  Everything is fine so far. Better than the stock email included withthe kindle os.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of my favorite games! They keep adding new levels every few months, love the game and updates! Thanks
B006C1DH92|4.0|Very Fun, almost everybody in my family plays it! I like the logo too! Very fun app, like I said.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this for a LG tv like i read in some other reviews i read here.<br />It works great.<br />No static or other noise.<br />I took about 5 mins to hook it up after i found the RCA cables that I knew i had<br />I would highly recomend this item!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like it. because I like rodents and and I like peanuts well walnuts<br />my favorate is the costumes and upgrades.

B000AQJPQE|3.0|Total price I paid with S&H was $33. Received the package within three days of ordering, not bad, S&H was great! Overall the product looked slightly cheap and flimsy, not really what I had in mind. By the pictures and comments I was expecting a Sun flush light fixture with planets that orbited. What it was, was basically a ceiling mount and plastic gears cogs and a motor. I made a few modifications to it and got away without having to drill any holes into the ceiling. The light is very dim and in a dark room won't show outer planets and the device is noisy when on. However my son and I are pleased with looks of it and does indeed look neat, but I don't agree it's worth $30.oo nor the hassle to install it.
0545265355|4.0|Nice hardback box set. Nothing over the top. Price was great. The shipping took longer than promised but I was not in a big hurry so I was ok with that.

0062119044|5.0|I just finished this book about twenty minutes ago and have been going back and forth between wanting to bawl and wanting to scream. I'm also a little over six months pregnant, which should have made me pause before picking up the book in the first place.<br /><br />Though I gave this book 5 stars (something I don't think I have ever done before) it DOES have its flaws: first, no child would have been this evil from birth (and no child would be so unfailingly innocent and loving as his sister was), people are just not that black and white; second, I could not understand why Eva continued to love her husband, Franklin (to me, he seemed officious, selfish, and deluded); third, the high-flown language and occasional rantings could be distracting.<br /><br />However, despite these flaws, I have to say that I have never been so moved, so disturbed, so utterly devastated by a novel. After all that Kevin did, no matter how terribly he came off the entire way through the book, I could not help but tear up at the end when he finally broke open. I could not help but recall the passage where Eva describes his terrible sickness at the age of 10 and how he clung to her so helplessly.<br /><br />Again, I am six months pregnant with my second child and I think that fact played a lot into my emotional reaction to the novel. Nonetheless, if you are looking to read something truly challenging, though-provoking, and just plain good, then make sure you pick up a copy of We Need to Talk About Kevin. One thing's for sure, you'll never forget it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I also have it on my phone. one of the few games I have continued to play for a long time. Baker Story seems good, I just started playing it. Pet Cate by Animoca is similar and you get to hire waiters.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Ok it could have been greater but I wont take away a star for a what if since I enjoyed the movie as a whole.<br /><br />Pros: 1. Selena was herself, she picked off the people in the lab building where she had been cryo frozen for 12 years and Im glad that time didnt mellow he almost ballet like dispatch of her enemies.<br /><br />2. Her daughter was delightful mix of her and Michael. The actress playing her was totally believable and indeed it takes a lot for a girl playing a 12 year old to his and snarl and be monstrous without looking stupid. She really was brilliant here beside adorabel.<br /><br />3. The revelation of who set off the chain of events of human/vampire/lyca fight for survival was a shocker.  It seems that the Lycans have been busy.<br /><br />Cons: 1. Time wasted on flashbacks not even done in sequential order. A wast of film time I thought. Who could forget the other movies to that extent.<br /><br />2. We really don't know what suddenly tipped off the humans as two the two different species living right under there noses, thought I suspect the Lycans needed panic in the streets to accomplish their goal of a super, hugh, silver resistant werewolf. Still though because the movie started with the human preventive measures already rolling on the TV screens it is a bit confusing. But then the Lycan scientists security precation may well have failed without outside interference with them being put down.<br /><br />3. The Lycans themselves were an odd bunch. They seemed more docile though no less deadly. They seemed to lack the grace they showed previously as they bounded after their prey and after catching, they were totaly absent that sink your fangs in and shake your head violently till you get a slice, they seemed less hungry then previous Lyacan generation's. Simply put, they were pretty clumsy and poorly tendered.<br /><br />4. How did the Vampires with their keen sense of smell and hearing not take note that something was going on in that big lab building which woul have stunk of lycans to all hell.<br /><br />5. What happened to the silver nitrate, the liquid silver bullets like the one that Craven used to finish of Lucian you would have thought they would be load with those. Thats a plothole and were were the Lycans Ultraviolet bullets? Both successful inventions seemed to go unused and the Lycans seem to die more by hide ventilation by regular machine gun bullets then silver.<br /><br />6. And where did Michael go? Didnt he sense his daughter? Male Parents are just as dangerous when it comes to their young as the female. Will another movie tie all these loose end together? Will Vampire and Lycan finally learn to live and let live?<br /><br />Basically what this movie needed was a moment called \\"The Prestige\\" as described in the Chris Bale, Michael Caine film. That one fantastic moment in the film that gets you jumping out of your chair and yahoooing that scene as the main one that made it all worthwhile.<br /><br />But if you like Underworld Series you will like this movie plot points and all, Kate is as beautifull as ever and the blood keeps flowing.<br /><br />In the end, on the roof where Michael was just seconds ago on camera Selena give a kind of we will rebuild and go on, almost Scarlet O Hara like. \\"As God is my witness there will covens in abundance again.\\"<br /><br />I guess its now up to Kate Beckinsdale and Len Weisman to see if they can bring this fantastic story stretching out over centuries to a respectable close?  I guess the best time to find out is to start googling in about a years time.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought this to use during filming that I had seen on B&H, I had a few people recommend it, I bought it and it was a great decision!
0307346617|5.0|Ive read a few zombie apocalypse book, this one is head over heels the best.Cannot wait to see the movie thats coming out about it.
B0000041LA|4.0|This cd is an example of a great purchase! My favorite is concerto #1 movement #1. Robust and abundant are the works here with overflowing attributes all around.<br /><br />I think Previn and the London Symphony did a fine and laudable performance. I feel Prokofiev would have personally congratulated Vladimir Ashkenazy for his playing on this recording ! listen to the passion and conviction conveyed in \\"Andantino\\" on the piano concerto no. 2.<br /><br />Prokofiev has so many popular and copious works, but sometimes I think he tried to hard to make statements (over kill) with his compositions and virtuosic skills; almost in competition with his fellow-countrymen Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel, Dvorak, Glinka, Bartok, Rachmaninoff, and Shostikovich among others.<br /><br />Good day !

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I knew that 'Courageous' was a popular movie among Christians, so I immediately bought 4 of them for ourselves and our family members not living at home.  After watching the movie, it was great.  Amazon got it here so quickly, it was a while before we had time to watch it.  Their service was fantastic.  The package was wrapped so well I didn't recognize it as DVD's.  If you haven't seen the movie, now is a good time to order it.

It was absorbing, it was exciting, and I got to meet a lot of interesting people whom I never would have known otherwise. But I was always an expatriate.\\"<br /><br />So Cain summarizes her experience as an introvert among extroverts, and likely the experience of many of the hundred-million-plus American introverts -- a third to a half of the US population -- whom extroverts deem to have \\"a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.\\"<br /><br />Her book is part history, documenting America's move from the farm to the city and from an introverted \\"culture of character,\\" intelligence and creativity to an extroverted \\"culture of personality.\\" It's part biology and psychology, exploring genes and culture/environment toward a thesis that the amygdalas of introverts' brains make them threat-avoidant while extroverts' make them reward-seeking (\\"Introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with\\"). And it's part how-to, with tactics to better involve introverts in the workplace, tips for parents raising introverts, and rehab (my word) for \\"expatriated\\" adults (\\"[T]hink back to what you loved to do when you were a child [...] pay attention to the work you gravitate to [...and] what you envy\\").<br /><br />Written accessibly and for a wide audience, the book will be revelatory to extroverts who are confounded by quiet people. And for quiet people (like me, also formerly a workplace expat), the book feels like coming home.

B005B0QYMM|2.0|Spoilers<br /><br />I saw the trailer for this somewhere on the internet, it was getting passed around and it looked pretty good, a rather low budget film passing along through word of mouth, who knows? Could be the next blair witch/paranormal activity, and the story was pretty interesting as well, ghost hunters being stuck in a mental asylum? The possibilities are endless!<br /><br />But then you meet the characters...<br /><br />The 'main' character you're apparently supposed to relate with is a total a**hole, he has his token love interest that says nothing worthwhile, the token black guy who has lines like \\"man i could be smokin' some trees right now\\", the old guy that looked like Mick Jagger, and the idiot cameraman who looks like Shaggy from scooby doo. Wow, I mean I get that they're making some comment on all those ghost-hunting shows but you could at least put a little more character into these crude stereotypes to make the audience care about what's happening.<br /><br />And this was my biggest problem with Grave Encounters, dumbed down lame two dimensional parodies of what Grave Encounters is trying to lampoon while imitating. Confused yet? Don't worry this movie doesn't require much thought. The handheld camera genre works best if you like the characters you're following around, because you're essentially stuck with them, and here I'd rather be hanging out with the ghosts/demons/whatever than these tools.<br /><br />The story itself was intriuging but ultimately a letdown, the set up was nice, they paced it out ok and some of the background stories (fake or not) helped set up the sense of dread which clashed nicely with the crew's naivety. Once the scares kick in though there's very little that's original and hasn't been seen before from Grave Encounters. Although I did like the film's answer to the ancient question \\"why don't they just leave the building\\", as it gets interesting when the mental hospital becomes a twisted maze.<br /><br />One of the things that worked in what I consider the best handheld camera movie [REC] was they were zombies/demons and they had a physical threat that you could understand. Here what exactly is the threat with the ghosts, they lift some stuff up sure, but that's about it. Maybe someone could've gotten possessed or something to make a real threat instead of windows opening. Oh and speaking of [REC] this movie shamelessly ripped off the ending where the last person confronts the 'original monster' or whatever and gets offed, AND they ripped off the death scene in [REC]2 where someone gets pulled into water and disappears; it was cool in [REC]2 when it was original, but it was just pathetic in this film. The 'Vicious Brothers' couldn't think of anything else?<br /><br />Also when it ends, it just ends and doesn't wrap itself up full circle with the opening of the movie where you see a producer or something introducing the audience to the 'lost footage', it might as well have been the directors saying 'we hope you'll enjoy Grave Encounters!' since it served no purpose than to open the film. If you're a fan of ghost movies or handheld camera movies, chances are you've seen everything in Grave Encounters before and done better, except the arms scene, that was pretty cool. Oh wait did I say pretty cool? I meant pretty RIPPED OFF (watch?v=VcQdP0YxAfk)s that worked in what I consider the best handheld camera movie [REC] was they were zombies/demons and they had a physical threat that you could understand.

B000002GYN|5.0|I finally got sick enough of hearing Hotel California that I broke down and bought the first three Eagles albums on CD - what a relief!  Their music at the beginning was great - beautiful harmonies, unafraid of crossing genres when most in rock were afraid of getting a \\"country\\" label.  This early stuff is more like what i wish i could hear on a country staion now than the tarted-up rock junk that is mostly getting airplay
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie is awsome if nothing else for the music. I have surrond sound and when this movie is in I crank it up because the music sounds so good. It doesn't hurt that there are alot of good looking women in it also.

B000002UAR|5.0|It's really quite a futile task.  What, you say?  To try and come up with your favorite album ever.  Unless you don't really obsess over music like I do, then maybe it's not so hard.  That Santana album with that dude from the crappy radio band has the most plays on your iTunes player, so that must be it.  Or that one Hootie and the Blowfish album with the song you played when you proposed to your wife back in the summer of '94.  Maybe that's your favorite.  I wish it was that simple for me.  It's not.  I feel like Rain Man around a tub filling with water when asked about my all-time favorite record.<br /><br />In all honesty, picking an artist to sit on the throne of all time favorite  records wasn't that hard.  I knew it would be the Beatles.  I mean, of all the amazing bands I've loved over the years, none have had the impact on me that the Beatles have had.  From the very early years of my life they've been the soundtrack that's played in my head.  I'd hear `Bungalow Bill' on repeat between my ears at school as the teacher would be talking about Indiana History.  As I'd try to fall asleep at night I'd hear `Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite' echoing in my head and I'd have the craziest visions.  When I was down I'd play `In My Life' and its' melancholy longing for a loved one would somehow bring me out of my funk.  'Across the Universe' would let me disappear into it's surreal landscape and envelope me.  'Getting Better' made me see Paul McCartney not as the lovelorn teen heartthrob, but as possibly some ruffian with several broken hearts under his belt.  'I Should Have Known Better', with Lennon's ever present scratched up and imperfect voice, lamenting about a girl that broke his heart( and knowing from the start she would).  There's the obvious choices: `I Want To Hold Your Hand', `Yesterday', `Twist and Shout', `I'm a Loser', `No Reply', `Drive My Car', `Strawberry Fields Forever', `Taxman', `Got To Get You Into My Life', `Let It Be', `Hey Jude', `A Day In The Life', `With A Little Help From My Friends', `Glass Onion'......well, you get the drift.  You see, pretty much any Beatles record could sit on top of King Music Mountain.  For the sake of argument, and for me to learn to make a damn choice, I've chosen Revolver.<br /><br />Listen, I can't write anything that hasn't already been written, and written far better, with more flowery language and fancier and heartfelt prose than what's already out there regarding the Fab Four.  So quite simply, this is why I've chosen Revolver over The White Album, Sgt. Pepper, Rubber Soul, Beatles For Sale or Abbey Road:  They found their edge.  They got gritty and found an  attitude on this record.  Starting an album out with a track like `Taxman'?  There was a jagged point at the end of that riff.  It wasn't meant to scare, it was meant to hurt.  George Harrison finally got the respect he deserved on a Beatles record.  He got the opening spot and this song is one of their absolute best.  The songs on this record are very distinct to one another.  'Eleanor Rigby', `Dr. Roberts', `Here, There, and Everywhere', `I'm Only Sleeping'.  Each one no longer had numbers in front of them indicating the chronological order on the vinyl.  They had lines drawn in the sand separating them.  Lennon and McCartney had gone from being a musical partnership to an all out musical competition.  And with each song they wrote they were daring the other to top it.  I'm sure there was competition between these two before Revolver.  But it wasn't nearly as prominent and obvious as it was once this album hit listeners ears.  I think this musical one-upping is what made this record stand out so much.  It was also the last great rock album before the highly ornamented(and timeless) Sgt. Pepper came out.  In my mind, I feel this was the end of that rock band that could wipe the stage up with any other band out there, and the more experimental, \\"we can do what we want cause we're the Beatles\\" band were born.  I'mnot complaining.  I love both.  But to know these guys could set up in some small club and bang out `Dr. Roberts' or `She Said, She Said' in front of 50 people and make that crowds faces melt, it gives me a warm feeling inside.  Though by this time it was more like 50, 000 people.  But still.<br /><br />Another striking thing about this record is that their tight live sound was finally captured on this record.  Thanks to George Martin, all their records sounded great.  But there was always this feeling that we weren't hearing that great live band in the studio.  Maybe it was too perfect?  I don't know.  With Revolver I think the essence of the Beatles live sound was captured.  The drums and bass were tight.  The guitars were lean and crisp.  The vocals were right where they needed to be; front and center, but never overpowering the music.  The bass on this record is astounding.  Every nuance, every flowing melody line.  Paul shined on this album.  And without his bass line where would Lennon's experimental, one chord mini psychedelic masterpiece `Tomorrow Never Knows' be?  It wouldn't be nearly as epic.<br /><br />I've gone on long enough about this.  You know the deal.  The Beatles changed popular music history.  The Beethovens of pop music.  I pulled a name out of the Beatles hat and Revolver was chosen.<br /><br />Now go put on `And Your Bird Can Sing' and sing till your voice is gone.  Then sing some more.not complaining.  I love both.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I can not begin to state what an excellent production of the musical this is. This is not a concert but a full blown show with three times the cast of the normal musical. The cast and costumes are outstanding as well as the audio quality of the blu ray. I have seen the musical several different times including the original London production in 1987. I did not like the 2004 movie and I thought that Gerald Butler should not have been cast as the Phantom. They should have cast someone who could sing like Michael Crawford. Both Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess do a great job as the Phantom and Christine. If there was one regret, it was that Michael Crawford returns to ovations as the end of the show but does not sing. But Sara Brightman and several other former Phantoms pull off a great finale.

0374275637|5.0|The book elegantly and accessibly summarises decades of research by a brilliant mind and Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman. This is a book about thinking and mistakes that are easy to make without being conscious of them. I really liked Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Black Swan and it is interesting to see the several references Kahneman makes to this popular text. The world is quite a bit more random than our mind would have it and our mind is quite a bit less rational without us realising. Kahneman employs what he labels System 1 and System 2 of our mind to explain some of the dynamics. Excellent, thought-provoking and highly recommended.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am about 20 days into this 30 day shred. I have skipped 2-3 days a week depending on my schedule, or if I simply needed a break. I will say, I did things a little different, and jumped straight into level 3. I worked out pretty often before starting this DVD,so I had some energy, and wanted to see results a.s.a.p. I am 5'6, about 150. I am not what some what call \\" overweight\\", but that doesn't mean that I too do not want to see results. I wanted to see results in my stomach more than anything. I had about a 33 inch waist, and that was not ok with me.Last year, I was going to the gym about 4 days a week for 3 months, and STILL did not see what I saw with this DVD did to me in less than a month.. and I'm still not done. I already see definition in the top part of my stomach. The lower part of the stomach is always the hardest to lose and tone up, but it is going down. My arms are toned and I get compliments all the time, my legs are hard and toned, and my booty has a nice lift :). At first I thought\\" how could 20 minutes be enough\\"? ... but it is. I am winded at the end of the video, and sweating. I love how I look, and am excited to keep this up. After this 30 days, I want to try the 6 week 6 pack which looks insane. I do not do the exercises that deal with the arms or weights anymore on this DVD, as I already see muscles, and do not want to look masculine. Instead, I do more cardio or ab work.<br />  I absolutely love this DVD, love Jillian, and am so glad I found her. For those who complain about her 2 minute intro is insane to me. If the only bad thing you have to say is that you cant fast forward her talking for 2 minutes in the beginning of a workout dvd.. is a compliment to her in my opinion. Her workout is amazing. Shes motivational, likeable, and you really feel that she is YOUR TRAINER.<br />  This DVD is for everyone. Anyone who wants to see change, anyone who wants to lose some extra pounds. ANY size. I recommend this 100%. I cant stress enough that inless than 30 days I already see a \\" 4 pack\\" in my stomach than months at the gym. 20 minutes, everyday, give or take a day for a break. We need that day of rest.<br /><br />Get the DVD. - Team JILLIAN-

B006OFN0SE|5.0|Clint Eastwood is probably a better director than actor, and this movie proves it. J. Edgar is a masterful rendering of the life of J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, a political figure far removed from today's public's memory, and we're all the better for it. For those who are not familiar with the person, J. Edgar Hoover was a vain, vile, heartless, media-mongering mama's boy, a paranoid control-freak who had no regard for the Bill of Rights or to anyone he perceived to be a \\"danger.\\" He had the appearance of a bulldog, but as Groucho Marx would say, that would be insulting to bulldogs. He exerted his influence by digging up dirt about public figures, all in the name of national security. Yes, he had the goods on everyone in those files of his. He wreaked much damage to the constitutional fabric of this country, and would order a wire tap at a moment's notice (sound familiar?)on anyone he perceived to be a threat and, as put more fittingly by the Clyde Tolson figure in this movie, someone whose memory will be reviled by history.<br /><br />All these adjectives accurately describe Hoover the man and are brilliantly and brilliantly depicted in this film. For those of us who did not have the honor of living while J.Edgar was with us, probably the most titillating subject the film could portray would be the issue about his sexuality. Eastwood could have covered the subject in several ways, either by showing Hoover as (1) cross-dresser, as some maintain; (2) a closet case; or (3) an indignant clod incapable of having any genuine affection, of whatever variety. Eastwood handled the subject with understatement, but all these possibilities are alluded to, but understated. A more flagrant portrail would have diminished the legitimacy of this moviue, and Eastwood wisely decided for understatement. In an interesting twist, he makes Hoover the victim of Tolson's own aggression, ironic for a person who had so little regard for anyone or any thing which did not conform to his own standards, whatever in heaven's name that might jhave been.<br /><br />Eastwood is underrated as a director. Think of Invictus and Gran Torino. His use of flashbacks and flash forwards didn't work in Flags of Our Fathers. In J.Edgar Eastwood he successfully makes use of these devises, and the flashbacks and flash forwards aid in showing Hoover's fragmented, messed up personality. DeCaprio's depiction of this hated person is equally masterful. This is the first movie in modern memory where he melds into Hoover's character and the viewer can forget that this is Leonardo DiCaprio on the screen playing a movie character, a satsifying and good piece of acting.<br /><br />Eastwood again wisely is not judgmental in his depiction. The events of Hoover's life are shown pretty much as they unfolded. It effectively showed how Hoover blackmailed politicians from whom he sought favor. For example, by that time Hoover sought to stay in his position as director during Kennedy's administration. He did so by requesting Robert Kennedy inform the President that he had reports of JFK's affairs and that they could be \\"damaging\\" to the President's reputation.<br /><br />For non-Baby Boomers, Eastwood's movie should be watched to get an idea of what life was like before Bush and Cheney. For the Baby Boom generation this movie is old news, and reminds us all what a self-righteous hypocrite the man really was in life. Perhaps the real message of this movie is not very much has changed.form to his own standards, whatever in heaven's name that might jhave been.<br /><br />Eastwood is underrated as a director.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game to play and fun to earn points. I like sushi game and darts. play it everyday on my kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app keeps me entertained for hours. it is so much fun I would recommend it to anyone. its one of my favorite apps on my kindle
B003TML0VO|5.0|This CD is the greatest cover album ever.<br /><br />Almost all the songs here are much better than the originals.<br />I am so enjoying and happy to hear such songs played by Santana and many top artists.<br /><br />I strongly hope the sequel CD will be released including songs requested by fan if possible.<br /><br />Anyway, Santana is the greatest artist and guitarist as well.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|We just bought a new 65\\" 3-D TV and a new Blu-Ray player so I got this to check out the parameters of our new gear AND because we have a fondness for the Hubble in this household. We were not disappointed; it is a knock your socks off presentation that really shows off the 3-D capabilities and Blu-ray quality of our gear. I am sure it will be a go to disk when someone wants to see what home theater 3-D can be like. It is also a fascinating look at a side of the Space Shuttle program we will never see again. Educational and visually delicious.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best thing for me. I have put this on audiable and have gotten more than I thought I would! AWESOME, thank you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool cool cool cool cool cooler than all of the other games i use to entertain myself... i love this app!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's easy to pull up and you can flip through the hour by hour weather with the swipe of a finger. Same goes for the day by day option. I also don't have a constant wick connection at home so it's. perfect for a quick browse at the weather before I leave work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like having lots of games to chose from but it is hard to earn points to get new games.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is great!!!  It is really fun and super addictive.  I love to watch Om Nom get his candy.  Even though it costs money, you should get it!!!
B006OAB2WK|5.0|The electronic & spacey sound isn't necessarily unique, but pair it with the odd vocals and you have something quite special. Like other musicians with \\"odd\\" voices (Joanna Newsom, Ian Curtis, Billy Corgan), either you get used to it or it'll never do it for you. At times the sound scapes sound very Japanese music influenced, alien, or ambient. Really something special in a world of familiarity. Repeated listens are rewarding. Great music for long drives. One of the best of 2012, for sure.
145162445X|5.0|Krauss makes the greatest case for a universe from nothing in this book. His evidence and description of why not only is the science behind the big bang true, but it leads us down many new paths never thought possible.<br /><br />If you have any interest in astronomy, this is an important book to read. Its the On The Origin of Species of our generation.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a nice app it is fun like temple run albut temple run is a little bit more fun but over all its a great app
B0053O89RY|5.0|This is by far the absolute best tv series you can watch.  The writers really work at their craft.  Instead of \\"in your face\\" vulgarity and gutter talk, they put thought into the script resulting in a very engaging dialogue.  Great comedic actors and great script.  a win-win comedy!
B006ON41FC|5.0|i think it is fun but also challenging there are many goals that will keep you playing watch out for the trees and the green acorns
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is really fun and I haven't found any problems with it.  It is free, and you should totally get it!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun game.  Different and requires logic.  Would be a good training tool for grocery bag packers because sometimes bags are packed where things break.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in so many years. After watching today, it amazes me how the feeling I had when I first saw it. Is the same feeling I have now.<br />ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! R.I.P WHITNEY
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just simply amazing!  The entire family uses this app. The best app that I have downloaded since I've had my phone and kindle!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game so much because it is really entertaining for kids and good for sleepovers and party's so kids could play mostly a lot of kids are a big tn of angry birds.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Love it so far.  Haven't had a touch of problems yet.  It provides me all the information that I need during my run and a lot more when I look at the detailed site at garminconnect.com .  Easy to navigate through screens while I am running.  Highly recommend.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game.is really fun!!! the only improvement would probably be the upgrades. the controls are really easy! I would most definetly recommend. warning though this is an.incredibly addicting game :)
B0002VFXFE|5.0|There is a reason why this is the best.  Pay the extra couple bucks and get the best because the thermal compound does matter.  It is the cheapest part of keeping a computer cool so why not just pay the extra to protect your system.  My i7-2600K is overclocked to 4.5 and is still in the 30-40 degrees Celsius range in a room that is fairly hot!  Good Product
B0063IH60K|5.0|wonderful for passing time, especially in waiting rooms. keeps your brain working, great for children to learn. def recommended. even better, its a free app!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|could be better if u was able to earn more coins when u unlocked them to advance on faster and not have to keep playing them multiple times.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|awesome games and very fun to play with friends and for playing games in party and entertaining to play so I think it is a really awesome game to play
B0034G4OZE|5.0|This movie will rock your world. It is a must own. As I now do. Zach is amazing in this heart warming story. He makes it feel real, while keeping a serious topic light heart-ed. It really is a kind of funny story... expect super funny.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun for work school bus rides road trips cam p. fires the whole 9 yards I don't know a better quiebt game that you can play other than starring wars
B002G1YPH0|5.0|As many have said before me this thing works great.  I don't think the optional fan on the other side is work it (you only lose a few degrees Celsius by adding the extra fan).  Works great and installs easy.  It is big but that's how it preforms so well so do your homework before you buy it and see if it will fit in your case.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Thanks for creating a game we can enjoy any time. I would like it even more if there were more logic puzzle games.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|\\"The Tree of Life\\" is a brilliant new form of cinematic art and a masterpiece by director, Terrence Malik.<br /><br />The best way to appreciate the film is to flow with the imagery and drop all expectations of a conventional narrative. This is cinematic poetry, passionate and true, that is richly layered with the euphoria of human experience.<br /><br />The premiere of \\"The Tree of Life\\" at the Cannes film festival last year hauntingly echoed, in a way, the premiere of Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring.\\" Now considered a magnum opus, Stravinsky's towering work caused a near riot when it was first performed; and at Cannes, the boos and hisses during the first showing of \\"The Tree of Life\\" were punctuated by intermittent cries of \\"Genius!\\" Isn't it interesting how so much dissension is generated by anything deemed \\"different?\\"<br /><br />I scanned the scathing reviews posted here and was saddened but not surprised. Most people would rather worship the sterile conformity that feeds our consumeristic nation than step outside the feeding frenzy and savor a new and startling flavor. I wonder how art will continue to survive in a world where its occupants are so tragically losing their ability to see and hear. In an artistic sense it is like Puritanism come full circle, where a creative act of staggering originality incites a witch hunt.<br /><br />\\"The Tree of Life\\" is \\"The Rite of Spring\\" of cinema. You may feel ambivalent about it -- or even hate it -- but like other great works from the past that were once maligned and misunderstood at first, I predict \\"The Tree of Life\\" will reveal its brilliance with age and become a film classic.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I like the game but I don't like that even if it is free u still need a payment method they should just let you down load it
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|When I first got Evermore, I liked it. I used it a lot. About 3 months after I got this app, I had totally FILLED it. I even had some important notes that took forever to write. The next time I got on Evermore, all my notes were GONE. I would give this app 0 stars, but 1 is the least.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I don't really mind the ads as they don't pop up in game play. And it is entertaining in it's way. 3 ways to play. Classic is what you'd expect. Endless is well endless unless you mess up. Gets boring, but if you want that prize be ready to sit for 3+ hours at it. Quest is cheesy, but sort of fun. If you like history tho you'll be banging your head at it.<br />Problem is that the gameplay is too easy. Too many tiles that let you cheat pop up and you have to use them to clear the board. That and if you mess up they pop up right afterwords.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great now on galaxy nexus. Next up is to see how it works on TF101. Addictive game to say the least
B005UKJZ10|1.0|Unfortunately my wife and I rented this movie for 48 hours. It was so bad the dog left the room and went to bed. We were stupid enough to sit thru the entire painful 2.5 hours thinking that there would be some plot or redeaming value to the film. There was none. This movie equals \\"Howard the Duck\\" or \\"Mars Attacks\\" as the worse movie ever made but without any attempt to entertain. Brad Pitt and Shawn Penn must have made this movie as a dare. Hopefully this movie will end their careers. I still have 30 hours of the rental. Does anyone want to visit us and see the movie? Bring lots of beer!
B001HN6918|4.0|This film is missing the heart and character growth of the first film. However, the flashy action sequences were still entertaining for the average viewer.
B006ON41FC|3.0|this game needs a line for the edge. cause you cant tell how far you can go till its too late.
0765356139|2.0|I was going to give this book 3 stars, if solely for the last 100 or so pages. I honestly checked to see if the higher rated reviews was about the same novel I was reading, so I kept on going, if only to see this great twist ending I kept hearing about. But then I decided, you know what, no, I'm giving it 2 stars. The reason I decided to dock it so low was because after the first one succeeded in having me riveted, this dragged me through a banal 600 pages before I actually cared. And not in a sophomore slump kind a way, more like a, creatively uninspired kind of way. I can tell you now, the ONLY reason why I stuck this one out is simply because I bought the trilogy boxset and felt like I would have wasted my money if I didn't read it. The unfortunate trade off came when I realized I had wasted weeks of my time instead of my money. If it wasn't for that reason alone, I would have put this book at the bottom of my to read pile and not cared to finish the trilogy. Getting through this book was a chore. In my humble and honest opinion, this shouldn't have even been a novel, or a trilogy for that matter. The first Mistborn just should have been a stand alone novel, such as Elantris.<br /><br />The biggest reason I can think to give this book 2 stars is that it just didn't know what it wanted to be. It split itself into thirds; a political societal warfare novel, a campy teen romance novel, and a save the world from the fallen Gods/mist novel, and it did none of them well. The latter by the way, literally doesn't even become relevant until well after half way through the book. You'll spend much of your time wondering why this is even called the Well of Ascension. I'll break things down:<br /><br />1.Plot- I love political conflict in fantasy stories, but this missed the mark. Elend Venture is the new king of Luthadel, and outside his walls sits two armies, one being his father Straff, and the other being Cett, a king from an opposing dominance. It begins with a great fight scene involving Vin intercepting Cett's assassins, but.... That's about as much action as you will see for a VERY long time. Fine, I don't need action to be entertained, but it is the way things play out that leaves much to be desired. This is largely what this book is about, and it falls into the biggest flaw Sanderson has with this trilogy; characters sitting in a room speculating about what to do with other characters. If this was meant to build 'that impending doom' like I've heard others say, it just doesn't come off that way. And Elend is such a boyscout of a 'good man' (by the way, Vin calls him that at least 100 times) that I found myself actually disliking his character. No one is that whole heartily 'good'. Unfortunately, speculation is what most of this book is. Speculation, no development, no action, no consequence. It is simply boring.<br /><br />2. The characters- I gave the first book a pass on lax character development simply because I knew this was a trilogy, and that there was room for growth. And in all honesty, Kelsier was awesome enough to make up for more than all of his unremarkable crew members, including Vin. If anything, Sanderson made Kelsier too likable, seeing as how he's only around for one book. I think even Sanderson realized this, because almost all of the main characters resent and even demonize Kelsier throughout much of this book. As if that would negate just how awesome of a character he really was. I didn't buy it, and I REALLY missed Kelsier in this one. I was praying that he would spring back from the dead and take over as a main protagonist. I didn't realize how badly this novel would suffer without him until I spent a couple hundred pages having Elend as his replacement. What the heck happened to his character? What happened to the charm and quick witted remarks he had in the first novel? He just isn't interesting enough. And Vin is no better. She is so insecure in this novel it hurts. When she's not flying through the mists, she's worrying about Elend and if she loves him or if he loves her. She is so whiny and frantically over emotional that it comes off as unbelievable for her to be instinctively right on so many things in the novel. NONE of the characters, save for Sazed and the newcomer Mistborn Zane, are interesting enough to hold their own. And the villains Straff and Cett are so one dimensional that they are borderline cartoonish. The only relationship I found enjoyable was Vin's ever changing relationship with her kandra OreSeur. Oh and the Terriswoman Tindwyl was a nice addition, if only for her ability to berate Elend, which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />3. Redundancy- Lastly, but certainly not least, is the fact that Sanderson will repeat himself, over, and over, and over, and over again. This is a glaring and infuriating flaw that forced me to skip as many as 10 pages into the book at any given time and still be on board with what was happening. Things that are explicitly said in the narrative are then repeated in the dialogue regular and often. Not the least of which is the fact that we are reminded that Vin was beaten, has an ear ring from her mother, and had an abusive brother, at least once every viewpoint turn. It is almost an insult to the intelligence how much he repeats how allomancy, feruchemy, and other magic works. By this point, its water under the bridge. It would be nice to let our hands go. There are times when the flow of action stops cold in its tracks simply to explain how the magic works. It reads more like Mistborn for Dummies, rather than a Mistborn novel at times. If you think that I'am exaggerating, highlight how many times Vin slayed the Lord Ruler, or Vin was a street urchin, or 'they will all abandon me' thought phrase, and you will lose count like I did. This is the reason why this book is too long.<br /><br />I will have to finish the third book, if only to get my money's worth.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have for serious Bible students.  It is fantastic that while looking at a text in The Message, for example, you can look in as many versions as you like to see how they have translated that same text - all without losing your place.  I am using one of their plans for daily reading and find it well thought out.  Would be good if a commentary could be attached, much like dictionary look up
B007BLDFWG|1.0|slow, boring and waste of time. Lousy acting, terrible story, could have been summed up in 15 minutes. AWFUL!!!!!!!! DO not see this show, dont rent it and please dont buy it.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Been wanting to get one of these for quite a while and finally pulled the trigger when I decided to upgrade my video card.<br /><br />Very easy install on an Intel DH55HC motherboard in a Antec 300 Illusion case.<br />It fits just fine, there is plenty of clearance.<br /><br />Only problem is the fan mounts over one of my RAM sticks so it's actually up on the heatsink about 1/2\\" - not a huge issue.<br /><br />CPU (i5 750) is now idling under 30c which was the objective.<br /><br />If you're nervous about installing this just watch the how-to video on YouTube.<br />It's really not all that difficult once you understand how the backplate mounts on your motherboard.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Lovely app, works well on my HTC desire Z, the clarity of the text, and controls are very impressive. I wish I could use this app for my mobipocket titles which I may lose as I completely move from the symbian platform to Android.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell is a good puzzle game with lots of levels. It is replayable, with move targets. The music and sound effects are soothing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the new games r really fun and challenging. I hope they keep updating so I can get some new games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game. a good time waster. it has many games to choose from. only downfall is, u have to beat some games to unlock others.
B004L35GAQ|2.0|Like everyone else, absolutely loved Sail. The unfortunate consequence of this is I expected the album to sound at least somewhat similar - Dark, melodic synths - a progressive grunge, of sorts. So as you can imagine, I was surprised, to find this was actually a pop album. I suppose that's my own fault for placing expectations on it (we all know what they say about expectations...). Hopefully, and I say this selfishly, they capitalize on the sound that they produced with Sail and come out with future releases that have more of that dark progressive grunge style. It's pretty badass. I'll refrain from commenting on the other songs because there's nothing constructive that will come of it. I'm a listener of all sorts of music and genres. From Mozart, to Metallica, to Method Man and everything in between. Needless to say, I enjoy different sounds, particularly when musicians can touch on different styles and explore their artistic limits (Radiohead, anyone?), but I do feel a certain amount of deception when listening to Sail and expecting a different kind of album. It's akin to buying a Metallica album based on hearing Enter Sandman, only to find that the rest of the album is filled with 'NSync type tunes. At the end of the day, yes, it is my own fault for having this expectation, but it doesn't remove my disappointment from the rest of the album that other listeners probably feel. If you liked it, great, this is merely one man's opinion.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I loved the game but the update wiped all of my achievements.  I had already beaten it twice.  please do something to restore!!!

0439023521|5.0|This book was really good. It was a quick and entertaining read... i finished it within a day. It is great if you are looking for something fun and thought provoking.
034552554X|5.0|the book arrived in great condition from the seller.  i have shared it with two friends already and they too enjoyed the book and the story. although sad at times the story was special.  i loved the reference to flowers at the end and will keep it handy to use with special occassions
1582701709|5.0|Great purchase, great condition and cheap. Well worth buying. I have to admit i was a bit skeptical initially, as i was thinking the book selling so cheap would be in terrible condition.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I just finished some G5 entertainment games that were awesome.  Thought I would try this one.  There is no help or hint icon (althought the description says there is one) and can't get it to go beyond the 2nd page - it is like it is frozen.  I wish I would not have bought it.
B004MKM8L8|5.0|This movie is very action filled and I couldn't wait to watch it.  It includes the awesome epic battle between lord voldemort(you know who) and HARRY POTTER.  It is so amazing.[[ASIN:B005UG542S Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2]]
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i got this app a week ago and i am ADDICTED! It is great!...if you like puzzles you will lovs this game. Worth the money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is truly ablessing. ONLY Because of Gods grace can we now have these technological tools at are finger tips.  This app is a must have.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|angry birds is a dumb app.although kind of fun for the first few minutes, it becomes frustrating and boring quickly. I have no idea why angry birds is one of the most popular apps....I only gave it three stars because it is an average free app, but if this were for the paid version I would've dropped a star.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible App. Great on Kindle Fire. Really enjoy the reading plans. Easy to move to specific verses. Like the bookmarks &amp; notes options.
B006ON41FC|5.0|well its a great game but i hate when i have to collect 15 golden nuts its really hard unless ur a pro at this
B0057C8OP4|5.0|arrived on time. Lady Gaga rocks as usual. Should had ordered a CD with more song on it. I will next time.  Great CD. A must buy.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like the kindle reader for many things, all of them non-technical. Just like a book but better actually. I hate it for technical works. My biggest mistake was purchasing the Bakers Dozen book on ADC and related topics. I would have rather gotten it in PDF format so that I could open multiple copies at the same time allowing me to refer to tables, diagrams and charts while reading the relevant text. Can't do that on a kindle. Also the charts are hard to size and on smaller devices are nearly to completely illegible. In short it is only procrastination that keeps me from contacting Amazon to get a credit for this book toward the paper version. I can not even convert the #$%# thing from its current DRM'ed (synonymous with d@mned) form to a more usable form. Kindle for fun YES! Kindle for technical work, H3LL NO!<br /><br />Frank
B006UG90RM|5.0|The awkward Van Halen/Hagar synthesis is over.  Nothing against Hagar, but his best work is his solo work, and his Chickenfoot work.  THIS new Van Halen album, however, is like stepping in a time-machine and going back to right after the album 1984.  THIS is the mature but still powerful and incredible sound of Roth-vocalized Van Halen! Almost 30 years too late, but hey, better late than never!  This album is truly AMAZING.  They've lost nothing--if anything, they've mellowed into a more cohesive sound, and it absolutely ROCKS.  Give these guys the props they deserve, folks; this album is AMAZING. Get it.
B000244FDW|1.0|Love the other versions so much I purchased this one with high hopes, dissapointed to say the least. No chemistry between the characters, looks low budget and found myself distracted by the awful lighting which casts unflattering shadows on everyones face. Darcy walks around scowling with a stick up his arse and is completely unlikeable, Elizabeth appears to be just reading her lines and Mr. Bennet is miserably mean.
B006UAWJS0|5.0|I've never gotten into a show like I have this one. Excellent cast and writing! I hope it is renewed for a 4th season.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|nice easy app, fun to play. like the various levels.  great free app of the day,  enjoyable, no stress game!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got this as free app of the day and love it! Ads don't bother me at all. I honestly didn't notice them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love everything about this app, it can work as an audio book and one can pick which book and chapter to read.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|switched over from GTasks (paid) and I'm very happy with this app. Easy to use and very quick syncing. Shocked this app only has a 3 star rating.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|I am a long time Screaming Trees/Mark Lanegan fan since back in the day (yes, I'm old). My late husband and I always thought the Trees were so very underrated. So we have everything Trees and most of the side projects and random songs that Mark has sang on (my favorite being the songs with QOTSA). I couldn't get into Bubblegum and the stuff with Isobel Campbell as complete works, even though there were songs on all that I really liked. My fave solos are the first two: The Winding Sheet and Whiskey for the Holy Ghost - and I would say Blues Funeral is my favorite since those ones. For me, the whole album is just very listenable like those 2 were. I like the \\"electronica\\" twists - the MOJO review of the album (Feb '12 issue) said that Mark had been listening to a lot of Krautrock when BF was recorded, and it comes through + I think in a weird way it is a good match/vehicle for his vocals. Each song is great, no skipping over any tune. I love that it is just Mark and his beautiful gravelly, world-weary voice featured here. I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with this disc.
B006ON41FC|4.0|did know. what I was getting into with this game it is a lot of fun.  a definite download. choice
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I luv this game it is so much fun I also farm story, bakery story and fashion story. if only there were more stories.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very engaging for my kiddos and self. I cant wait for any other games in this vain by Fire Maple!  I have at least 2hours of time and maybe 60% done. great game
1416575464|5.0|Quite simply this book is a must have for anyone interested in interior decorating.  I was not interested in this subject at the time Domino was issued as a monthly magazine so all of the information and pictures are new to me.  I originally didn't purchase this book after using the 'Click to look inside' section of Amazon because it led me to believe there were a lot of illustrations vs real-life pictures.  After reading so many positive reviews I decided to purchase it anyways and I'm so happy I did.  This is a must have for anyone interested in interior design and I think it's a great source for beginners like myself.  I love how the book is laid out.  It certainly made it easier for me to understand and absorb information.  The pictures are fantastic as well and I love how there are numerous examples of each design type, not just one picture/one example.  I can see myself using this book for many years to come.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very interesting story and nice playing boards. it gets challenging also. its worth the money if u like mahjong. love it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it gives you something to do when your bored! has bunches and bunches and bunches of games! it is fun.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Alright, I bought the album, I've listened to it repeatedly, and have, for curiosity's sake, read numerous reviews of the album here on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Let me pre-empt those who will say of my review, \\"well, he's just an old guy from the 80's generation that's trying to relive memories\\" or \\"he's one of those VH fans who will love anything Roth does with the band for old times' sake.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, I do admire VH, especially the DLR era albums 79-84 but was never a huge fan back in the proverbial day. I've actually come to like them more as I've gotten older and become completely disheartened by the lack of talent in the modern music scene. Heck, even the bands I hated in the 70's and 80's are starting to look like Mozart when compared to most of the s**t that's been thrown at us by the current music culture. Call me a dinosaur if you will. I've been playing guitar since I was in 5th grade (now I'm 45...do the math) and have been teaching the instrument since I was in college. I feel fairly confident that I can tell a decent album when I hear it.<br /><br />I'm not a bandwagon type of guy and thus I hope you will take me to task when I encourage you to get this album if you like hard rock music.<br /><br />Eddie simply blew me away with his playing on this album. My rankings for all the VH albums in order based on quality would be: Women and Children First, VH2, VH1, A Different Kind of Truth, Fair Warning, Diver Down, 1984 then yadda yadda yadda (all the pop baloney with Sammy). I never listened to the Cherone album so I can't give that one a rating. Thus, in my opinion, this is the 4th best VH album of all time.<br /><br />I did not pre-order this album. I had no presumptions about it. Though I clearly enjoy the DLR albums more than the Sammy stuff, I was not prepared to give it a positive or negative rating one way or the other before I thoroughly listened to it. Was I hopeful that it would blow me away? Of course, I was. Did I have an axe to grind (pardon the pun)? Not at all. I'm actually a bigger fan of players like Michael Schenker, Gary Moore and Ritchie Blackmore than I am of Van Halen; however, I've always admired Eddie's unique playing style.<br /><br />All that said, get this album. It's worth every penny IMO. Certainly, there are some shortcomings as the nay-sayers have exhorted. David Lee Roth's voice is not the same as it was in the 70's or 80's but give the guy a break. He's old enough to be the grandpa of most of today's music audience! Can your grandpa sing like he can? I highly doubt it. All the older rock singers have lost a step or two; it's part of growing older. I liken DLR's performance on this album to some of the Robert Plant solo stuff. Once Plant got a little older he lost some of his range but wisely adapted his style to one that suited his age. He no longer wails like he did on Whole Lotta Love but he can still lay down some impressive vocals. Roth's performance here is clearly not of the same ilk as the growls and screams from VH1 or VH2 but he has adapted and his vocals are still powerful, in a more refined way perhaps.<br /><br />There's a chemistry with some bands that you can't ignore even when the principal members may hate each other through and through. Dokken and UFO come to mind. Don Dokken and George Lynch clearly dislike each other as do Michael Schenker and Phil Mogg. However, when these groups make music together with their traditional line-ups, there's generally some sort of magic that happens. Van Halen with DLR is like that. I'm not a Sammy Hagar hater. Far from it. In fact, I was into Sammy's solo stuff more than I was into VH in the early 80's. I tried to listen to 5150 the other day after listening to the new VH album and I had to stop it halfway through. There's a sickening poppy-ooze that made my stomach turn.<br /><br />Conversely, the new VH album will totally rock you. Though there may be some compression of the dynamic range, I think it still kicks you in the teeth if you play it through a REAL stereo (not ear buds).<br /><br />If it means anything to hear an honest review from someone who's not a die-hard VH fan then my work here has been worthwhile. I think this album has the potential to show some of the young pups out there that want to be guitar players, what a real guitar album truly is. I hope this album drives young musicians to once again strive for technical precision and for mastery of their instrument.<br /><br />I'm always saddened by the apathy that has come out the 90's and 00's. In our instant-gratification society, people don't seem to want to work hard to achieve something worthwhile anymore. Kids WANT to be great guitarists but they don't really want to work at it the way players like Eddie Van Halen, Michael Schenker and Gary Moore (God rest his soul) had to. To quote some Greek philosophy, \\"Nothing great was ever accomplished simply by wishing for it.\\" I'm a school teacher as well, and can sadly attest that this is true of the attitude towards schoolwork today. Pardon my stance on the soapbox if you will and GO GET THIS ALBUM!<br /><br />By the way, my 3 year old and 6 year old sons want it to be stated that \\"Bullethead\\" is their favorite song on the new VH album! I'm partial to \\"Honey Baby Sweetie Doll.\\"<br /><br />God Bless and Keep Rocking!eeth if you play it through a REAL stereo (not ear buds).<br /><br />If it means anything to hear an honest review from someone who's not a die-hard VH fan then my work here has been worthwhile.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|Around June 2011 Amazon/Kindle shocked many authors by announcing the first author to sell a million books on Kindle was thriller novelist John Locke, and he'd done it in only 5 months. Not coincidentally, this book was released about the same time.<br /><br />This book angers many writers by clearly advising they write first for a chosen niche of readers. This is marketing 101, and good for nonfiction, but novels . . . ?<br /><br />Traditionally, novelists have written to please themselves, perhaps making changing to please editors and genre standards, but still transmitting their own personal vision. If what you happen to write resonates with millions of readers, you're a bestseller. If what you happen to write resonates with very few, you remain obscure.<br /><br />It's partially about genre, but not entirely. Less than 40 years after horror pioneer HP Lovecraft died penniless, Stephen King began making a fortune from his horror novels. The market greatly changed and expanded. But it's also true King writes about ordinary people in unordinary circumstances, not the weirdos Lovecraft did.<br /><br />Yet Locke advises picking a niche, studying those readers, and writing books that appeal to them rather than to you.<br /><br />I believe that's worthwhile advice, especially for writers who, spoiled by their success, have forgotten what appeals to their usual readers.
B003K16P50|1.0|Heavens help the movie if they follow the book very closely at all.<br /><br />I didn't mind the writing style after I got used to the diary format and occasional memo thrown in to herald impending events, but the story itself never materialized.  Just when you though it was all about to jell, boom, it falls apart in one of the sorriest endings I have ever endured.  While there are moments of brilliance (very brief moments) the story often bogs down while it beats you over the head with its own simplicity. The result comes off flat and pointless, and a waste of several hours.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Several hundred years or so in the future, the former United States is divided into zones based on economic function and controlled by a central city of advanced technological capabilities only hinted at. In effect, most of the US is plantation where people struggle for a subsistence living while working to enrich the city.<br /><br />And to distract the populace, once a year they stage the hunger games, where teenagers from all the zones are forced to fight each other to the death, last one left alive the winner.<br /><br />None of this makes sense to me, but if you accept the initial premise, it's a good story. I admired how the author twisted events so not only could the heroine remain alive, but her coplayer, a boy who loves her, as well. I\\"m not sure I believe the rationale. Why do they need a winner? It's not improbable that in earlier games people could have battled to the death, and the last one alive was mortally wounded and died only minutes later. If they'd both died, what would have happened to the dictatorship? Nothing so far as I can see.<br /><br />I'm divided on how the author failed to explain the ground rules. Many things happen that are explained only when they happen, and some not at all. And I for sure didn't understand the mutant dogs in the final games scene, except their symbolic emotional value.

One was \\"Human's Being\\" with Hagar\\" and \\"Me Wise Magic\\" and \\"Just Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" with David Lee Roth. Then on 2004's Best of Both Worlds it features some repeats from Best of Volume 1 (marked with a star *) plus tracks that should have been on there in the first place and also the first new tracks with Sammy Hagar on vocals since \\"Humans Being\\" from 1996.<br /><br />Van Halen's phenomenal 1978 self titled debut album is well represented by five tracks which were \\"Eruption\\"*, \\"Runnin With the Devil\\"*, \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" and \\"You Really Got Me\\".

B003BWERF8|4.0|This little gadget (in combination with LG HBS700 bluetooth headset) helped cut my iPod umbilical cord.  Here in Chicago, it's becoming more and more important to hide the fact that you've got something to steal when you're out in public and this allows me to keep the iPod completely concealed during my daily train commute.  It's simple to use, tiny and delivers a good signal - BUT - it draws power even when the iPod is shut down so I have to remember to disconnect it when not in use.  That gives me one more \\"thing\\" to keep up with and makes it a bit less handy than I was aiming for.  Even when I'm careful it seems to pull quite a bit of power from the iPod, as I used to be able to go two weeks between charges with wired earbuds and now I have to charge up at least once a week. Good gadget in most respects, but not quite perfect.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I will admit, my ears must be odd shaped because I can't keep ear buds in at all. I've tried all the options and none of them work.  This is especially true when I go running. I run a lot and I need headphones that will stay in place and I don't have to think about them. The only headphones that seem to work for me are the over the head version, and there aren't many options out there anymore. These headphones are light and sound great and they stay secure and in my ear. I've paid a lot more for headphones that don't sound half as good. Don't waste your time, go with these. Take it from someone with very particular requirements, these will work for you.
0061537969|2.0|As an ardent dog-lover, I was more than happy to pick up this book, which unfortunately turned out be literary poop wrapped in a cute cover. The only thing positive to say about it is the main character Enzo. He is not your ordinary \\"I've-just-met-you-and-I-love-you\\" Lassie type of dog. On the outside, he acts all nice and cuddly, but he can be quite calculative and nasty when he wants to. And he is cocky about it, too. It was quite interesting to read about this guy's life.<br />HOWEVER, I couldn't help but feel the story gets ridiculously cheesy towards the end. It could've culminated with a sutble hint of mystery. The cheesiness, however, reaches its climax in the epilogue, which I won't give away but an expurgation would do much better.<br />Also, I didn't really appreciate the life lessons peppered throughout the story. Too many \\"you should this, you should that\\" crap. Well, guess what a good story SHOULD do. It should CONVEY a message, not INSTRUCT one. And are those life lessons anywhere close to insightful or inspirational? Sadly, no. A cheap soap opera could offer more original lines than these: \\"The true test of a champion is not whether he can triumph, but whether he can overcome obstacles,\\" or \\"The race is long - to finish first, first you must finish,\\" or \\"You should shine with all of your light all the time.\\" Oh so cliche, although I must admist they are slightly more helpful than The Secret.<br />Overall, the book was too cheesy and corny for my taste. More nachos, please.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|I have watched J Edgar a few times since it has come out on DVD and love it.  I had a little bit of knowledge about J Edgar Hoover but nothing compared to what I learned by this movie.  I thought the acting was unbelievable.  The main stars did a great job acting and sounding the way people seemed to talk during that period of time.  I read reviews that the makeup was poorly done.  I thoroughly disagree with that.  The make up was done very well to show the aging of the of the stars.<br /><br />I thought the story line was consistent and and easy to follow.  I know the bounced back and forth between when J Edgar was young and when he was older but it was still easy to follow.<br /><br />I have not read the book J Edgar Hoover but do intend to read it to get a better understanding of the man.  I did see the mini series The Kennedys and saw J Edger Hoover's dislike for Robert Kennedy and that carried through in J Edgar.<br /><br />The film was done well and showed a side of the man that most people did not know about.  It was an eye opener about what really happened.  This was a movie that I waited for to come out on DVD and the wait was well worth it.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to any one who like biographical movies that are not dry.  It has many twists and turns in it that makes it interesting.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|Nothing could have prepared me for the nonstop hilariousness that is Paul!!!<br /><br />It's about two British comic book fans who, while visiting the desert and Area 51 in the hopes of witnessing an alien sighting, actually MEET an alien and... this is no ordinary alien to say the least, haha.  He's crude, sharp-witted, and highly advanced.  He says offensive things and blend in extremely well with human beings and acts totally American, and even has clever reasons why.  For example, the part where he says he HAS to look like a typical alien because that's the image and portrayal people have had of aliens for over 60 years.  Great writing there.  His ability to turn camouflage is exciting too.<br /><br />This is most definitely an adventure movie but I MUST warn viewers that the film is probably totally inappropriate for kids due to the amount of F words flying around (mostly from the alien himself!)  When the police eventually realize the two British guys are hoarding an alien, this is when the chase is on and the gang constantly finds themselves trying to escape from the law and hide out somewhere.<br /><br />By FAR my favorite part is when the alien was having a discussion with a woman who gets picked up along the way about the existence of God.  The alien actually manages to convince the woman that God isn't real to the point she not only believes him, but completely changes her attitude and then goes around acting incredibly obnoxious with her choice of swear words, lol.  This leads to plenty of hilarious moments.<br /><br />The entire storyline is brilliantly told however, so despite the many obnoxious segments, you'll be sure to enjoy a comedy centering around aliens and especially the way the one alien interacts with people.  I highly recommend it.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|This is hands down my all time favorite movie! I am a HUGE John Hughes fan, I've seen almost all his movies but this movie stands out from all the others.  Besides the fact that the \\"The Brat Pack\\" were outstanding in the movie I just love the raw honesty in this film. I'm not a fan of cheesey unrealstic films so this movie was really genuine to every generation even 'til this day. Every scene is entertaining, funny, and memorable. It's amazing how even after all these years it still reaches a new generation of people and still has the same impact it always has. I think the best thing about this movie is that no matter who you are, where you are, or how old you are you can relate to at least one of the characters. The best part is the ending- it's not a particularly happy ending but it's real and believable which is what the whole movie is about. Great writing! Great acting! Great movie : )

B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like this cover in that is very compact and does not add bulk to my kindle fire.  Love the color and slim design, with the cover folding and holding the kindle in place.  I have a dog that sheds a lot and the fabric on the interior of the cover collects hair, so that is a little of a problem for me.  And I also hold my kindle at the bottom corners when I am reading a book.  If I am reading for a long period of time, the thickness of the cover at that point is a little annoying.  But that is the way the cover holds on and I have seen others that are thicker...so I just remove the cover and put it back when I'm done or for storage. So on the plus side, the cover is very easy to remove and put back on.

1451648537|5.0|This book changed my mind about Steve Jobs and taught me many lessons. I wrote a detailed blog post with my thoughts on this book and Steve Jobs on Keyvan.MS.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt:<br /><br />\\"I read a lot of books. In fact, reading is a common part of my life whenever I don't want to bother myself with technical computer stuff. Whether I'm wasting time at Starbucks or wandering on my bed to go to sleep, I read something, and I usually select interesting titles to read not classic novels. Among all these readings, it's only a few books in a while that may be exciting for me and make me happy, and Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson was definitely one of those. I'll explain below why this book came to make a revolution in my mind and inspire me a lot, but for now, I'd say that I want to write this post about this book and Steve Jobs because I owe this to him and this inspirational book.<br /><br />Before digging into the main parts, I have to point that although the book is well-written and well-organized, it still has space for improvements especially in the latest chapters where there can be more details about the last few years of Jobs' life that happened to be very productive with the introduction of iPhone and iPad. I heard that Isaacson is working on a second edition with more interviews and information that can improve the book.<br /><br />Having this said, I can say that this book was one of the best I've read in the past couple of years but it doesn't mean that everybody should have the same opinion. I guess I like this book mostly because it corrected many mistakes and misbeliefs that I had, and inspired me a lot particularly because I could relate more to Jobs than my childhood hero, Bill Gates.<br /><br />One of the strengths of this book is the unbiased view of Jobs' character by talking to friends, enemies, and ex-friends who became enemies later. Such an unbiased view can give you a better perspective on where a successful person has succeeded and where he has failed, and I should admire Steve Jobs for asking Isaacson to work on this book before his death to leave such a valuable source of information for people.\\"eded and where he has failed, and I should admire Steve Jobs for asking Isaacson to work on this book before his death to leave such a valuable source of information for people.\\"

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I went into this series on vacation with zero expectations, expecting that I was \\"too old\\" for it....I finished the entire trilogy in the span of 5 days. It's addictive and gripping and riddled with metaphors that every woman or girl can relate to. Hardly a challenging read (which is great for a beach book) and not entirely original in parts, but still very endearing characters and a plot that, while sometimes predictable, keeps you glued to the page holding your breath and sending silent prayers to the author that your beloved characters live. The romance/love triangle is prominent, but doesn't reduce the heroine to just another girl with boy problems. Which I appreciated. Enough love to keep the romantic in me interested, but not so much that my inner feminist gagged.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it to my female friends, especially those on the younger side (I'm in my late twenties, and I think I could have related more had I read it younger).
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This is a great movie. I wish it had Calculus and the Bird Brothers though. I thought that the voice casts were great. The animation was awesome. Also check out The Adventures of Tintin Season one. Or The adventures of Tintin on Wii
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very entertaining. it provides hours and hours of endless fun.I highly recommend this game for game lovers everywhere.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This is really a very sexy book. I think that females are the target audience, and the appeal is to the 30 - 70 group. Very erotic. The main characters could be anyone's friends or relatives. What is so unusual about this book is that it is not written as smut, but as a mystery/love novel. Really enjoying the read.
B000069HJL|5.0|Ouço este &aacute;lbum desde que tenho treze anos de idade. Não apenas não me canso de ouvir, como o aprecio cada vez mais.<br /><br />Hoje em dia vejo a gurizada baixando dezenas de m&uacute;sicas, não ouvindo de fato nenhuma delas. M&uacute;sica virou algo descart&aacute;vel, ouvida &agrave;s pressas. Alguns trocam de faixa sem sequer terminarem de ouvir a atual.<br /><br />Na &eacute;poca eu tinha treze anos e a falta de dinheiro fazia com que a gente escolhesse muito bem o LP que ia comprar. Geralmente segu&iacute;amos a sugestão de amigos mais velhos, que j&aacute; curtiam h&aacute; tempos aquela banda. Aprendi a ouvir este LP de forma contemplativa, sem pressa.<br /><br />Digo isso para que um eventual novo ouvinte se dê ao trabalho de escutar v&aacute;rias vezes esse CD e não tente decifr&aacute;-lo antes de dez audições. Sim, dez audições! &Eacute; assim que se ouve m&uacute;sica de verdade, que se aprecia a riqueza dos arranjos, que se percebe a verdadeira arte.<br /><br />A sonoridade &eacute; perfeita e a performance da banda, genial. \\"Paris\\" se tornou para mim mais do que um &aacute;lbum, uma referência est&eacute;tica. Uma indicação e inspiração de que se pode buscar a excelência não apenas na m&uacute;sica mas em qualquer atividade humana. A &uacute;nica coisa feia deste &aacute;lbum &eacute; a capa, mas a m&uacute;sica torna esse deslize irrelevante.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Really needs more accomplishments beat them all too quickly. I really like the game though it was fun, look forward to updates with more challenges.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this app. you will never ever get bored of it and will never want to stop playing. its just so addicting.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|Reviewed on a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />*Edit* The most recent update added in-app purchasing. Removing two stars as I tend to completely avoid IAP apps, and would not have purchased this app had it been IAP at the time.<br /><br />If you love tower defense-style strategy games, this app was made for you. Your mission is to defend a space station from waves of attackers by mining resources, building defensive positions and upgrading them. Each defensive position must be linked to the station via a series of connected power nodes, which only allow four connections per node. In the later stages of the game your station is literally encased in a spiderweb of connected constructs. The HD layout looks great on the Fire, and I would recommend using this layout on any HD device. The playing field is zoomable, allowing you to isolate specific areas of your defenses or pull out to see the entire field.<br /><br />The game provides a campaign and three genre-standard \\"endless\\" modes, the endless modes each having a different strategy (survival, mining and protect). Unlike many similar games, the endless modes in this game are NOT simply to entertain you after you've completed the campaign mode, but rather are necessary to accumulate enough credits to buy the units/upgrades necessary to complete the campaign missions. Because of this, I think that I have played and enjoyed the \\"endless\\" modes more than any other such game.<br /><br />The game operations function flawlessly, it is EXTREMELY conservative with battery power, there is a quit button in the main menu and OpenFeint, while included, is unobtrusive and activated only if desired. The only complaint I would have is that due to the sketchy nature of the fire touchscreen and the icon size of the defensive emplacements it can be a bit tricky on occasion to select the  unit you are trying to upgrade. A stylus pretty much eliminates that problem, and again I put this down to the responsiveness of the Fire rather than an issue with the game itself.<br /><br />If you haven't snapped up this game at $.99 yet, do so. If not, the $1.95 list price is still a bargain for the hours of playablity this game provides.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I enjoyed this novel.  I used to read every Grisham as soon as it came out, but it had been awhile since I had time to catch up with some of his latest ones.  The Litigators takes me back to some of his earlier works, and I enjoyed every page.  He has a way to end his chapters leaving the reader wanting more and flipping to the next page.  It kept me up late, and that was a good thing -- highly recommend!

B005DF2QMC|1.0|Audacity is a great program.  I've used it for years.  I have no problem with it at all.  I also really like the service I get from Amazon.  Great company!<br /><br />The \\"DB Tech Audio USB Portable Cassette Tape-to-MP3 Player Adapter with USB Cable and Software Cd Also Features Auto Reverse - FOR PC\\" (DB-TP01) simply does not work.  I've used dozens if not hundreds of electronic devices in my life - some good and some bad.  This ranks very close to the bottom.  Granted it was only $30.00, but I expect that if I pay for something that it works as advertized.  The audio output quality is horrendous.  Adjusting the volume control to maximum on the device at least provides some sound, but adjusting it to a lower level on the device produces no sound at all.  (Yes - I did have my audio controls on my PC and in Audacity set correctly).  I just want to transfer a cassette made at our wedding years ago (quite a clear recording) transferred to a digital format.  I'll keep looking for an inexpensive way to do it, but the time spent opening the package for this device was a waste of time.  Save your money and buy something other than this.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a very fun version of angry birds. I liked the movie and the game so grate combination. it is so worth the $0.99
B005K0HDGE|4.0|When I first heard about this one, I was really excited to see how he would correlate a novel to events that actually happened, and I was not disappointed.  King does it in a way that was both interesting and exciting, not to mention creative.  I am always amazed at the continual ideas he comes up with for his novels. This is one of the best I've read by him.
B000006V5H|5.0|My wife is from Australia and grew up on this performer's songs.  She loves the anthology that I bought her for her birthday and assures me that this album pretty much has all his greatest hits on it.  I personally haven't listened to much of the album, but the song \\"You're the Voice\\" seems pretty cool.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|Great vinyl. Up there with Adele and Amy Winehouse. Subject matter is trite, but vocal control is awesome. Lack of a catchy chorus is something I love about \\"Video Games.\\" It's so different from a Brittany Spears pop song. Here voice is amazing. Definitely worth getting the vinyl to hear the fullness of her voice and passion. I had been listening to MP3 versions in anticipation of the vinyl release and I'm glad I bought the LP.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is very helpfull. it is also very easy to use. I also like how it reminds you to read the bible
B004WR125O|4.0|*UPDATE* 12/4/12<br /><br />This product continues to work fine for me. I haven't had any issues connecting with the Onkyo since my initial WiFi connection using this device.<br /><br />**<br /><br />After reading the negative reviews from others that warned about this small unit (who knew such a small piece of equipment could cause so many headaches?!), I decided to go ahead and take a gamble with this product. I must say, I ran into some of the exact some issues that others have mentioned. In the end, with a little patience, research, and luck, I was able to get the unit to work. Here is the process I took.<br /><br />First off, when I plugged the wireless adapter into the NR509 (I followed the manuals instructions through this whole process), I decided to go with a manual connection. The receiver allows you to choose between a manual connection (basically entering in your router's info and password after the receiver locates the router) or an automatic connection (entering a PIN code or pressing a WSP button to initialize connection through the router). When I began the manual connection, multiple wireless routers that were present appeared, including mine. I selected my wireless router (it's a Linksy's E1200 with WPA2) and entered in my password. I entered my password in incorrectly the first time, then correctly the second time but still had no connection. This is when things got interesting. From this point on, the receiver no longer showed any present wireless routers, including mine. I then looked into using an automatic connection. Well, the receiver was supposed to display an eight-digit PIN code, but it either displayed no code or simply an \\"@\\" symbol, which did not work. I also tried the WSP button to no avail. After reading about this problem online (I'm not alone), I decided to run a factory reset (see Onkyo online about this) and start over. I would be careful about being rough with the receiver just because the wireless connection is acting up. I wasgoing to call Onkyo support if it wouldn't connect after one factory reset. After the factory reset, the receiver picked up all the original wireless routers; however, I ran into the same manual connection problems as before. I decided to try the automatic-connection option again. This time, the automatic-connection, eight-digit PIN code was present. In order to use this, you have to connect to your router via the advanced options and manage your router through your web browser. I entered the code in my router's correct advanced options field, but the connection failed once again. I also ran the WSP button in the advanced options again, and this also failed connection again. After trying each scenario twice, I still could not get a connection. After working on this for a couple hours, I was about to call it quits, get some sleep (the small UWF-1 adapter probably would have haunted me in my sleep), and call support the next day. However, I ran the automatic, WSP-button connection option one more time (you have to go to the advanced router options in your browser, and this automatic-connection option and the automatic PIN-code option should be listed under the \\"Wireless\\" menu). To my surprise, it actually worked. I ran the firmware update for the receiver, and I have not had any connection problems since (of course, it has only been one day, so if I have any issues, I will update this review). My wireless connection has a strength between 50% and 80% and continues to work the next time I boot up the receiver even if I unplug the router or turn off the receiver. I have since been able to listen to streaming internet with Vtuner. I would say, if you think you can get this to work, it is worth it. The Vtuner (included membership with my receiver) option alone is worth it, as it allows you to choose between dozens of genres of music or talk radio, from dozens of stations, in dozens of countries from around the world.<br /><br />Also, I should say that my receiver with UWF-1 wireless adapter is only about 10 feet away from my wireless router, so i can't speak for how far the wireless signal can go. Considering how small this wireless adapter is, I wouldn't be surprised if it does not have great distance signal strength (of course, I have no idea if wireless adapter size correlates to distance signal strength).<br /><br />In the end, if you have a little patience, do a little research, and if, IF, lady luck is on your side, this wireless adapter can work just fine. I am not a computer expert by any stretch (probably an average computer know-how), and I was able to meander my way through the maze to get this to work. If you take the time, and can get this to work, it is worth the purchase.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|OK, I think this review would attract some violent attacks and rebuttals.<br /><br />Just let me express my views and reasons before the fans would like to lay fists on me.<br /><br />I admit that the story has nice designs and plots, and one can be addicted to it once he starts to read it. There IS a nice flow. BUT, after finishing the book in two days, I felt that the characters are but superficially developed. There is not much ink spilt on any prominent characters but their actions and words, so after finishing a large portion of the book I could not help thinking :\\"what have I read so far? so?\\" I can't really recall any feeling deeper than wanting to know how the characters would eventually come to their fates, which, inevitably, can be guessed right at the start.<br /><br />When I have finished reading, my worry on superficiality was even further justified. When it ends, it ends, I could not really do thinks I usually do after reading a book such as sit back in my chair and ponder upon the story, characters, their fats, the ends, etc. There is nothing to be thought of, it is a simply story with a simple set up! I think that this is the main reason that I have such a feeling, and also the main reason some people fall in love with it too!<br /><br />Anyway, I think I will wait some time before thinking of starting on the second book, and I am not saying that this book is bad, it is just maybe not my kind of taste. For someone who just wants a good read with intensity and twists, this would come handy. Hence, I gave the book a three star comment, it is neutral.
B005WGBOZM|3.0|I *love* Walking Dead but will never again pay this much for a single episode.  I canceled my cable and this is the only show that I am unable to find online to watch (I have Netflix and Hulu).<br /><br />AMC deserves a slap on the wrists for their inability to put their shows on their site.  This is one watcher who will be waiting until it comes to Netflix next season.
B006ON41FC|5.0|you would be nuts to not play this game so play play play play play play play play play play
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews, but there's a rare quality in her timid and yet deep voice that fits incredibly well with her musical tone and lyrics. It's really the complete package. There's a feel of ochestral 60's trip-hop, if that makes any sense, but somehow she manages it perfectly. And again, that voice! You believe every word of Lana Del Rey's youthful confessions. It's an honest and refreshingly deep set of songs with powerful melodies to solidify the world her voice and lyrics breathe in.<br /><br />A fantastic Album worthy of a listen.<br /><br />Personal Stand Out Songs:<br />\\"Born To Die\\"<br />\\"Off to the Races\\"<br />\\"Blue Jeans\\"<br />\\"National Anthem\\"<br />\\"Dark Paradise\\"<br />\\"Million Dollar Man\\"<br /><br />Looking forward to her future efforts.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is the best! I've never played mahjong before, until I got this app. it's easy to learn too! I got it for free a couple days ago when Amazon had it as a paid app free every day. If you didn't do this, u paid 5 bucks for a good app. I give it Five Stars even if it has ads, they don't pop up that often and its not a distraction.
B004RE29WW|5.0|Having just finished watching the Assembly Cut of this film, I feel compelled to write this review.<br />Let me say that I love this series. The Alien series is one of the most significant sci-fi series of all time. As such, I completely understand that some people hate this film. To be completely fair, it had quite the pedigree to live up to. It fell short, but not by much.<br />I first saw the theatrical version of this film, and like most, I was completely unimpressed. It seemed shallow in comparison to the first two films. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it seemed like this film was a pastiche of ideas merely thrown together. After doing some light research, I found that my suspicions were correct. This was indeed the horrible offspring of the merging of 3 scripts. Add to this the fact that a young David Fincher was taken advantage of by 20th Century Fox, and you realize why this film (the theatrical version) was such a disjointed disappointment.<br />Watch the Assembly Cut. Witness what Fincher had in mind for this film. The Assembly Cut is a joy to watch. It fleshes out the characters a bit more, it feels less wonky, and, in my opinion, it comes close to being a masterpiece. Severely flawed, and lacking in a few areas, but a masterpiece nonetheless. In some respects it holds a candle to both Alien and Aliens. It takes the story full circle, and even manages to give it a pretty decent ending.<br />Should Alien 3 have been an entirely different movie? Absolutely. But the Assembly Cut is the best cut of the film that was eventually released. Enjoy it, and don't worry about what could have been.<br />Whatever you do avoid Alien Resurrection like the plague. Now that is just a horrible movie no matter how you look at it.<br />For more technical details, the picture quality is amazing and the soundtrack has never sounded better.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well it has interesting games but you have to unlock them and get \\"money\\" ... you dont have to buy it ... its ok i guess losts og different games but you have to \\"pay\\" for them.. :(
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This a great bible to use. I appreciate the different versions that are available at the finger tips and the extras that are included all for FREE
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game downloaded onto my kindle well enough. The game play is smooth and easy to follow. There's usually at 1 ad before every game but if you play it long enough and just x out of the ad it stops popping up.  It's addictive which is good for me since I am a night auditor at a hotel. It kept me entertained well enough all night. I also like the fact that it has a replay deal button so that you can replay the last deal you were given. It's a fun challenge trying to see if you can make it a winning deal.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Seriously, all 4 Alien movies for 33 bucks? What is there to think about? Nothing at all.<br />So, the only difference between the American set and the British import is literally the packaging. In the American version I believe you get a book type thing that is encased in cardboard sleeve. In the British version you get the same amount of discs, but in a plastic box that is encased in a cardboard sleeve. The quality is amazing. A reviewer previously stated that he was very unhappy with the remastering of these films, but I have to disagree. All 4 movies look spectacular. Alien has NEVER looked this good. All 4 films come with both the theatrical and alternate version. Also included are two discs that are full of extra features. For those of you who are worried about regional blocking, don't worry. I've seen all 4 films already and there hasn't been any problems whatsoever.<br />Buy with confidence.
B006OFN0BQ|1.0|My husband and I missed this film when it was in the theatre, so I bought the blu-ray version last week, thinking this would be a film we'd watch again and again [as we do DiCaprio's other big celebrity film, The Aviator]. It turned out to be one of the worst films we've seen--ever. We're puzzled how it could be so bad. Perhaps designed to create a visually dark mood to match Hoover's reputation, the scenes are so dark you sometimes can't see what's going on. But that's very far from the main problem. The story--a back 'n' forth between old age and the main events of his life--is so choppy that it's often hard to follow. These main events are told as vignettes, such as the Lindberg kidnapping and various hits on Commies, interspersed with guesses about his private life as a closet homosexual with a long-time partner [that may never have been consummated]. But the script was so bad, and even the acting was so bad [except for Judy Dench as his mother], that even the most emotionally painful scenes were just painfully embarrassing. DiCaprio seemed to be so focussed on getting the weird dialect right that nothing else, or even the dialect, rang true. We kept saying to each other, 'When is this going to be over?' Compared to The Aviator, a very similar film in structure, this film is a zero.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is an adicting app!! I love it!! I can not stop playing it !! this is my favorite app!

B006362ZR6|5.0|I recently rediscovered The Fray as a band early last year after hearing \\"How to Save a Life\\" on the radio. I'd heard the song many times before, but this time the lyrics hit home and I realized what the song was about. I purchased the first two albums, and fell in love with all of their songs. As albums should, each has its own story and its own feel to it, maintaining their amazing \\"The Fray\\" sound.<br />As an eager pessimist, I was looking forward to a let down on the third album, thinking how could they possibly follow-up, but they did.<br />The radio-present \\"Heartbeat\\" has a great sound to it, a worthy single, but I think they did their best in many of the other songs as well: \\"1961\\", \\"48 to Go\\" is on my favorites list, but the best in my opinion, sound and content-wise, is \\"The Fighter\\".
0756405890|4.0|It only took me 4 days to finish the book and then another week for The Wise Man's Fear. Absolutely captivating. I found myself thinking about the plot even when I was not reading it. While there are not that many new ideas in the story, the author did combine the best classic ingredients under one cover (think the Lord of the Rings on the Ender's Game's steroids), which made for an amazing read. I wish I could recommend the series to my six-grader kid, who would probably enjoy reading it, but I cannot, as the story gets more and more inappropriate for kids - which is my only complaint.<br /><br />I intially rated the book a 5, but then took away one star due to the increasingly adult-oriented (drinking and sex) content, which becomes more prominent in book 2. A lot of that could have been omitted or at least dialed down without any impact on the quality of the plot.<br /><br />This reader's fear is that PR will not be able to finish the story in book 3 (as he promised to do) and the whole thing will turn into a version of the never-ending monstrosity like The Eye of the World or the Game of Thrones. Given the ground that was covered in the first two books, it is easy to see the author having to go into book 4 at least.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I know some people will think this movie shouldn't have gotten 5 stars because of the acting.  I did not go to this movie for the acting, I went to see our real life Navy Seals pay tribute to those who sacrificed everything for our country, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I have read several books by Seals and about Seals over the years, starting way back when Dick Marcinko's first book came out, and I always watch any movie or tv special about them.  I feel it takes a special kind of person to do this job and it fascinates me.<br /><br />This movie has a fictional plot; however, the extractions and sacrifices in the movie all have actually happened in the field and they are re enacted in this movie in different locations.  How awesome was it to sit their and watch the things I had imagined in my head in real life.  I say real life, because these are things they actually do, real technology actually used, real split second decisions actually made.  The action was fantastic and I will go see this movie again on the big screen to make sure I caught everything.<br /><br />What was most profound to me was the way the team worked together and their commitment to each other.  The fact that they can see something horrific happen to their best friend, and keep doing their job, put their emotion aside until their mission is done.  I have read in countless books about men that keeping going while wounded not for themselves or to get back home, but so they don't let down the person next to them, the person they go into battle with.  This movie shows that.  It shows these men to be multi faceted.  They are not war mongers.  They are men with families and a deep sense of history and honor.  This is what I feel should be taken away from the movie.<br /><br />So if you are not sure what you are getting into with this movie, they were not shy about head shots and brain splatter, they did not focus on it, it was all done in a very matter of fact way, but it is there.  There is a torture scene that made me squirm, not graphically shown, but you knew what was happening.  Overall though if you have let your child play Grand Theft Auto or 1st person shooter games, this is not any more violent.<br /><br />This movie is not a propaganda or recruiting film it is real life. Remember that when watching, don't look for something to be there for a political reason, as an american look at this film and be proud, appreciative and thankful that we have men like this willing to give everything so that we can be safe.  I for one am, and I was really glad they listed the Seals that sacrificed everything for us at the end.  This movie broke my heart while instilling a huge sense of pride for our servicemen and first responders.  I hope everyone goes to see this movie on the big screen it is worth it.  I don't know but I hope the producers/studio whomever is in charge makes a substantial donation to the Navy Seal Foundation as the men in this movie were not, nor did they want to be compensated.<br /><br />Anyway I will be purchasing this movie as soon as it is available and encourage you to do the same, it is important to know what someone will sacrifice for you.s a torture scene that made me squirm, not graphically shown, but you knew what was happening.

0385534639|3.0|When I first started this book..I was really really into it!! Halfway through, however, I hit a road block and it was really heard for me to finish this book!<br /><br />At the start I was really interested in the magic and the mythology of the Night Circus! I really wanted to learn more about the Circus and more about Celia and Marco.<br />The one thing that really bothered me about this book was that it was so confusing!! There were way to many flashbacks, flash forwards and I couldn't keep up. Also, there were too many characters for me to keep up!!<br />I did really like the forbidden romance between Celia and Marco and how they interact with different characters.<br /><br />Overall, while there were certain points to this book that I really liked, I was unfortunately confused and it was hard for me to read at times.

1451648537|5.0|I'm not one to read books too often, but as an avid user of Apple products this biography was a subject I was interested in reading.<br /><br />It did not disappoint.  Almost 600 pages thick it looks a little overwhelming at first glance, but I was able to breeze right through.  I often found myself saying \\"I can finish another chapter before bed\\" more than a few nights.<br /><br />This paints a very realistic picture of a great person, with both the bad and good sides of Steve.<br /><br />I urge you to pick this book up.
0525423281|5.0|Wow what an awesome book!!!!!! I was a little bit skeptical about this book at first because I LOVED Anna and The French Kiss! However, I immediately fell in love with this book once I started it!!<br /><br />I loved Lola! She was an awesome character! She wasn't afraid to be who she really was and I really liked that about her!<br /><br />I also loved Lola and Cricket's relationship throughout the novel! Of course, I don't want to give anything away but I liked seeing it progress throughout the book.<br />Another part of this book I enjoyed was surprise appearances by my two favorite characters: Anna and St. Clair! Stephanie puts them in as the perfect balance to this novel, not too little but not distracting from the main characters of the story.<br /><br />Once again, Stephanie Perkins writes another AMAZING contemporary novel! I HIGHLY recommend this book! I can't wait for Isla and the Happily Ever After!
0679809015|5.0|This book is only about 3x3 inches, but it is packed with fun things to open and our baby loves it! She consistently chooses to \\"read\\" that book more often than almost any other book and it fits easily in my purse to carry around. GREAT book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is decent but I have seen better. but they have some extremely stupid games on here that are childish.
B006Z2XTBY|5.0|I found myself enthralled by this thoughtful, enjoyable thriller about a young climatologist, Adam Kindred, who has left his position at an Arizona university and has come to London for a job interview. After a chance encounter in a bistro, he finds his whole life and identity completely overturned. Suddenly he is the prime suspect in the vicious murder of a pharmaceutical research scientist, whereupon he decides that his only recourse is to flee and join the vast underground of the homeless and the missing.<br /><br />It's a fascinating tale, in which we meet all sorts of eccentric characters, including an evangelist who leads a cult called the Church of John Christ, which holds that the apostle John, not Jesus, is the true savior; a policewoman and her pot-smoking, aging-hippie father; dodgy Big Pharma executives; and an ultraviolent mercenary employed by a private security firm.<br /><br />This novel is beautifully written, with the third-person point of view alternating among several different characters and the subplots involving them. The pace is more leisurely than in most thrillers, with lots of detail, but I found the narrative always gripping and the book nearly impossible to put down. I recommend it to readers who might enjoy a thought-provoking suspense novel that deals with the fragility of identity and conspiracy and corruption in big business.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just can't seem to stop playing this game. It sucks you in and before you know it, hours have gone by. I hope they keep adding levels.
B004FECNIO|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Here is what is in my opinion, director Steven Spielberg's greatest sleeper, an masterpiece of science fiction!<br /><br />Truly epic tale of a young android human robot, who was made to be the first android to love. To have feelings of human bonding & mother love. To be, a member of the family.<br /><br />A sad, tragic tale. A wondrous journey into the world of intelligent robots. A disturbing tale of humans, less human then the robots that serve them, & most of all, a search for a mother's love.<br /><br />Truly a beautiful film!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is quite fun and highly addictive.  Fun trying to complete the goals to level up!  My kids love it too!  Worth 99 cents!  Simple but fun!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|....And read this book!  I stayed up all night reading this last night, and I think I'm gonna start reading it again today.  Travis is the perfect mix of bad boy/sensitive soul, and Abby \\"Pidge\\" is strong, smart, and funny.  I loved America, Shep, and especially Finch, also.  Just a fantastic love story.

B004SUWR2C|1.0|it takes an extra 80mb. i got it thinking it was good for my kindle fire. its very stupid. i wish i could get my money back
B004UHSB5A|1.0|Tiles overlap at random. To make matters worse, the game is ugly. I got it for free, but I uninstalled it.
B001EN71DG|5.0|The good<br />-has the new updated versions as well as...<br />-has THE ORIGINAL MOVIES on the bonus disc just like they were first seen in theatres (the first movie just says \\"Star Wars\\" in the beginning without \\"A New Hope\\", Han shoots first, no skinny cgi jaba, no \\"NOOOO\\" yell at the end, etc.)<br />-original movies are still good quality. It is better than your old VCR tapes but not quite new DVD release<br />-I loved showing my gf these movies like they were meant to be seen<br /><br />The bad<br />-the original movies are not anamorphic ...but I honestly don't really care. They still look very good even on my 60\\" widescreen.<br />-the discs are not held in well inside the individual disc boxes. The plastic grippers don't hold the discs in and they slide around.<br /><br />This is a Star Wars fan's dream. This is the only set with the actual original theatre release movies. People are complaining about how they aren't anamorphic or w/e, but they still look better than any VCR tape. Buy it used, but make SURE you get this exact set. It's a blue box with Darth and Luke fighting on the front and made in 2008.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game. awesome and have a great time playing.  would recommend this app to my friends who want to have fun
1619492911|3.0|It's hard to believe The Beautiful and Damned was written by the same author as The Great Gatsby.  It's like Fitzgerald wrote this before he met Hemingway and Hemingway taught him how to write.  I should like this book: I love The Great Gatsby, I enjoy ornate prose, and I appreciate watching a character slowly spiral downward.  But it just does not work for me here.<br /><br />The main character is the scion of a wealthy family, a 1920s socialite, and a terrible drunk.  The book mainly consists of his alcohol-soaked escapades as his life slowly disintegrates.  What else is a wealthy couple to do?  The ending is more than a bit manufactured and takes away from the rest of the novel.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Love this game... Got through the adventure levels twice. Then it updated. Said all data will be saved. It lies! I have to start the whole game over! What a waste of time I put in to level up...just to do it all over again! Aggravated! Ugh!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a fabulous game if you like mahjong definetly worth what I paid it is challenging enough for me but also easy enough for my seven year old daughter
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was an interesting story, fun and flirty, but with enough of an edge in the plot to keep you turning the pages.  This was a very solidly written detective story.  It was very much a character-driven book, with Nikki Heat as a sexy lady cop, as opposed to the usual butch version of police woman portrayed today.  I look forward to reading the next one.
6305127638|4.0|The Star Trek crew has gone back in time to the mid 21st century when following the third world war the first warp drive capable of powering a ship faster than the speed of light was invented. Thus, true exploration of deep space was made possible. However, there is a problem. The Borg want to interrupt this process, assimilate millions of humans, and thereby prevent the Vulcans from seeing the Human spaceship traveling through space at speeds faster than light and making first contact. Of course the Borg are defeated and the course of time is not changed. The final scene is the landing of the Vulcan ship and the meeting of the two peoples. This is another entertaining show for Trekies and other fans. There is humor provided in the character of the scientist who invented the Warp Drive. He is a rock and roller and does not fit the image which the 25th century humans have of him nor does he want to be put on a pedestal. After the first trip at warp speed and meeting the Vulcans he somewhat modifies his views.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was my favorite Twilight movie so far. I've got to say, I was a little nervous about this one. With a wedding, honeymoon, and a baby, I didn't think they would be able to fit all of that in a two hour movie. I am completely Team Jacob(Taylor Lautner) but, I also found myself liking Edward (Robert Patterson)in this one. I always thought he was cold-hearted. He showed emotion and he had a personally in this movie. I never saw that before. He was also a good husband. Not to big on having a baby, but he had good reasons. He came around in the end when he knew the baby wasn't a demon, and that's all that matters. It is rated PG13 and comes with Special Features.
B00632HWOG|5.0|because it works just fine, shows way more than ten emails at once.  this review is for kindle fire.  bad reviewsvmust be from an older version.

B004HO6I2E|1.0|This movie was not what I saw in the previews.  It had nonstop F word this and that.  I thought it would be a fun movie to watch with my friends and I am glad I previewed it.  The movie was full of nasty frontal nudity.  I tossed my copy as I couldn't recommend anyone watch it in good conscience.  What a disappointment!
B0026S98TS|5.0|Really great album. Almost didn't get it because of the negative reviews on here. Glad I got it. Wish H&H and Mob Rules was recorded this well. If you like Dio, Iommi, Buttler and Appice, you'll live this too.

0439023513|4.0|What a crazy series conclusion!  Just when I thought things couldn't get more intense, they up the ante with the war and rebellion in this one.  This is full scale, brutally violent war.  No sugar coating anything, no saving someone just because they might be a favorite.<br /><br />Like Katniss, I'm not sure if I would want to join up with the rebels either - not because I think they're wrong, just because I would hate to find out I'd been used so badly without knowing it at all.  But unlike Katniss, who seems willing to take responsibility for every death since her first trip to the arena, I would walk into this with a lot less on my conscience.  And I think I would decide to become the Mockingjay too, simply to hopefully end so many of the injustices that go on in this world.<br /><br />This does not take everything sad and wrap it up in a happy little box at the end.  As is the case in real life, everything has a consequence and you can't blindly do what you want in war and expect there to be no fallout.  Katniss makes some choices that I didn't agree with, but in the end, I think that's part of what makes her such a believable and likable character - we're all flawed, and Katniss reacts to things in a very human way.<br /><br />I didn't necessarily realize it was possible for this series to become more violent, but it definitely did.  If you thought the arena was bad, just wait until you get all the same people involved in a war.  It's heartbreaking, and unfortunately exposes an area of humanity that does actually exist.  Obviously our society is not like this one, but I think a lot of the actions people take in this book are taken in one way or another in our wars.  So if you can get through this without crying, my hats off to you.  And I might wonder if your soul is in a horcrux somewhere.<br /><br />This was an excellent conclusion to a series that I enjoyed from start to finish.  I had a hard time putting any of it down and read each book in under a day, coming away feeling confused and sad, but like I read something worthwhile.  I hope everyone who reads this feels the same kinds of things and still manages to enjoy the series like I did.ing away feeling confused and sad, but like I read something worthwhile.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is challenging, but not frusteratingly so. The music and ambience helps you feel relaxed as you play. It is totally worth that one dollar it costs, and them some.

0425238091|5.0|This is a great book. I appreciate and thank the auther for sharing a true experience. The journey to become a physician is not an easy one. And I think it helps if one know what they about to get themselves into. It burns me that people gave the guy that wrote this book a difficult time. Ignorance is not bliss. It's important to know what is going on in our world and schools so we can help make the human experience as pleasant as possible.<br />I enjoyed this book. It was hard to put it down. I highly recommend it.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Of the three office apps I've used, Documents to Go, Quick Office and Officesuite Pro,  Officesuite Pro is by far the best one.  It has a few formating conversion issue with Word documents but nothing too bad.  In excel documents it was the only one of the three that honored Locked cell formating.  It's great for light editing on my Toshiba Thrive Tablet using a blue tooth keyboard.  (All the apps that I compared were full versions thanks to Amazon)
B0063GORYU|4.0|very good implementation of this game as a mobile app. quick to load great for a few minutes of diversion.
B001JNNE64|1.0|Since the middle 90s I have a beautiful laserdisc of the theatrical version of this movie and I'll keep it as long as the theatrical version won't be available again. I bought once the director's cut and I hate it and threw it away. Most of the time, the director's cuts are wonderful but this time, it's awfull.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has a bunch of different fun games and I like the unlock game with polnts feature I loved it a lot and love to ol
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has made it easier for me to get into the word, and the word brings life! It has it's bugs but any other app with this many options would charge you. Thanks for a great app that actually has purpose!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun, but the games are easy to beat, and you have to play them over and over in order to get enough points to unlock new ones
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Enjoyed the movie very much.  I laughed and cried.  Loved the characters and think those who played the parts did an excellent job in their portrayals.  I actually felt like this was one time the movie actually lived up to the previews, doesn't usually happen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how this app &quot;reminds&quot; me to read my Bible. So far I haven't had any problems with it at all. It's easy to use, lots of options, SO much better than carrying around a heavy Bible, especially if you're going to Bible study and need a paralell Bible....those things weigh a ton. Great app, can't believe it's free.
B005RYF5JA|4.0|I find I'm not watching \\"Believe\\" as much as earlier products of Celtic Woman. Perhaps it's because, though beautifully done, it is too \\"controlled,\\" too much the same and not quite as enchanting. It lacks the \\"spontaneity\\" and excitement of earlier productions. -Anne Moore

B003EI2EH2|3.0|Timothy Ferriss discusses exercise, the slow-carb diet, using ice to speed the body's metabolism so that a person can lose weight, adding muscle with a minimal amount of exercise, improving a person's sex life, sleeping better (by recommending power naps at certain times), running faster, and living longer.  It is a tour de force of health topics.<br /><br />Ferriss recommends a form of the slow carb diet where a person eats the same basic foods and portions six days a week, and then totally pigs out on anything and everything one day a week.  This will manipulate a person's metabolism and significant weight will be lost.<br /><br />Ferriss is not a trained medical professional, and some of the things he says sound questionable, such as the use of ice to lose weight, and the complicated exercise routines he touts.  In the chapter on sleep, he does have a few good ideas (keeping the bedroom temperature close to seventy degrees, eating a large fat and protein dominated meal, which will induce tiredness, within three hours of bedtime, taking a cold bath an hour before bedtime).<br /><br />Ferriss even suggests putting ice on your neck thirty minutes a day to speed up your metabolism so that you will lose weight.  But he doesn't saying anything about putting your fork down and going for a walk.  It's hard to believe anyone would be swayed by this, but this is one of the top selling books on health and wellness available.  It shows how interested people are at learning how to live longer and better.  God's Word has something to say about this issue.\\"
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. It's easy to use, intuitive, and practical.<br />Cheers...to making, in my opinion, the best app on the market.
1469984202|5.0|So I haven't picked up a book since Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game nearly 15 years ago - not sure how that's happened, but it did.  After buying a Kindle Fire last month, I decided to try reading a short book on it and grabbed the first of the Wool books.  Well, I was finished with that before I knew it and needed more.  So I started on the Omnibus edition, and just finished it last night...still wish there was more, so I'm looking forward to the new First Shift books that sound like they're coming soon from Mr. Howey.  In the meantime, I think I'll have to try out the Molly Fyde series as it seems to get reviews as glowing as the Wool series.  Can't wait to see for myself.  Definitely give this a read...you won't regret it.
1863514260|5.0|Lovely Embroidery and enjoyed it very much with so much detailing in it.<br />It gives me lots of ideas and colors of threads too.<br />Its highly recommended if one is into embroidery, wonderful book!!!<br />Loved every minute from looking at it.

0439023521|5.0|I think Ms Collins has written a very effective satire on the US. The pompous aristocrats and their hangers-on in the Capitol rule as they wish. Does this sound like the US Congress? We have subsidies for farmers, ranchers, manufacturing, automobile industry, coal mines. All regional, disparate, and isolated. We do not form a national team, we are a collection of individualized regions. The West, the South, the Midwest, the Northeast, New England, the Left Coast, the Northwest. Little is done to integrate the whole by the US government unless it is to the benefit of the US government. Using children fighting to the death is the ultimate satire of the US Military. The President and/or Congress decides where to send our children to fight to the death. What did we gain from the deaths in Iraq? What are we gaining from the deaths in Afghanistan? The arenas are worldwide, the action is shown on TV every night.<br /><br />I think this is a very biting book and right on the money.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|I was trying to find a place to rent this but it does not seem to be anywhere to rent digitally.  I just ended up buying it but I did enjoy it.  It has a good cast and is very amusing at times.  The animation was very well done which one might expect from Dreamworks.  It was different than I expected from what I saw in the trailer and maybe that is why I was satisfied with it.  The story is very simple although there is some adult humor mixed in but all in fun.  It is almost like an animated version of Zorro except puss in boots is not a vigilante but a falsely accused fugitive.  The cat humor was my favorite!  I gave it 5 stars because I think it deserves a 4.9 since I don't think anything can be purrrfect but it would not be right to rate it a 4.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Alot of fun to play. I like how leave the game and when I come back I can pickup where I left off.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great option for those of us who find little time for workouts.  Jillian packs a tough calorie burning workout into 20 minutes and it works every part of the body.

B0077ATSU4|1.0|If you've had the unfortunate experience of sitting through the 9/11 sapfest ELAIC, I'm sorry. It's the film that proves that if you add Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock to anything, you will get an Oscar nomination. I expect next year there will be a two-hour movie where Meryl Streep simply reads from the phone book with a foreign accent and the Academy will honor that too. It's utterly disgusting, but reinforces the old saying \\"it's not about what you know, but who you know.\\"<br /><br />Telling a story of a child on an unrealistic journey through the streets of NYC, bad parenting is really the only impression I was left with during this overlong exercise in patience.  Using 9/11 is disgusting, and was used as a way to sell tickets.  Maybe the book is better, I didn't read it - and now I have no plan to.  This is the worst movie to ever get nominated for best picture - but if you like it, watch the equally awful (and similar) [[ASIN:B0013D8LBS Grace Is Gone]].
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I recently bought an android tablet and was hoping I could use it to read the 100s of Amazon Kindle Books that I already own. Unfortunately the Kindle for Android app is the worst eReader I've ever used, bar none. If you want to read Kindle books on an Android tablet and want more than just the most basic features, then you'll have to use the Kindle Fire. With any other Android tablet your best bet is buying ebooks elsewhere.<br /><br />I bought my first ever B&N eBook this week.<br /><br />EDITED - Just downloaded an update which greatly improved line spacing on my tablet. Still cannot adjust spacing or margins, but the default seems perfect for me anyway so no need to adjust (for me). I changed my rating from 1 star to 3.

0062082353|5.0|While this book does not always read easily and at times lacks some of the detail I would have liked,it is nontheless a very good book about the service of an elite warrior. It gives a good account of some of the BS that our guys had to put up with in fighting this war and the political impact our media and couch potato congressmen had on prosecuting this war to our fullest.  The talents of this great soldier are unquestioned and it makes you proud to have such great men serving our country and protecting us. I think some of the details had to be withheld due to the secret nature of the subject matter, but even so, I think he gives an excellent sense to the reader of what he faced.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The major difference between the Swedish version and the American version, is the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />First: If you read the novels, you know that Lisbeth Salander was only 5 feet tall and weighed 90 lbs.  In the Swedish original, Noomi Rapace is actually 5'3\\" tall, and in the American remake Rooney Mara is 5'6\\".  Folks, there was a reason author Stieg Larsson made his heroine 5 feet tall.  He wanted this little girl to be a gallon of nitroglycerine read to explode -- like she did when she kicked ass on two Hells Angel types.  This was an essential part of the plot -- that someone so small, could be so violent.  Making her 5'6\\" loses this dramatic point.<br /><br />Second: Facially, in the novels, Lisbeth is not pretty, or would even be considered attractive on any level.  She is described as having a boyish figure and facial piercings.  This is accomplished in the Swedish version with Noomi Rapace -- nude, she is flat chested and her body and face are just so-so.  In bed she is not truly sexy or sensual -- she gets on, gets off, and is finished.  She does not make love.  The Swedish director deliberately cast this actress to accomplish this faithfulness to the novel.  The American director made Rooney Mara look -- at times -- beautiful.  She does not have a boyish body; she has a very young womanly body with normal size breasts. In bed, she is very attractive.  Very sexual, very sensual.  She makes love.  This is not Larsson's Lisbeth.<br /><br />Third: Psychologically, Lisbeth is an introvert who is filled with hostility.  In the Swedish version, the reporter slowly works his way into her confidence, and she (somewhat) lets her guard down for him.  The American version carries none of Lisbeth's borderline psychosis.  Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth, just \\"acts\\" like she is pissed off at the world.  It doesn't take much for the reporter to get her into bed.<br /><br />Conclusion: Stieg Larsson in his triolgy set himself a monumental task:  He asked himself, can I make a small unattractive girl, who is extremely introverted and hostile, and continually acts antisocial and like a bitch -- have the reader (audience) come to like (maybe love) her? This is a girl that we would never sit next to on a crowded bus -- but by the end of the novels (movie) we'd have her over for dinner.  Make no mistake, probably 90% of everyone who saw the Swedish film disliked this obnoxious character from the opening scenes, but by the end of the movie we were rooting for her.  The American version loses this quality of character.  Rooney Mara is tall, attractive, and her Lisbeth is not really super obnoxious or completely introverted.  Once again, her version of the character just \\"acts\\" pissed off.  The director missed the point.<br /><br />Sure, see both versions, and maybe read the books.  If you want Lisbeth Salander, you will only find her in the Swedish version.  The reviewers who thought the American version was as good or better than the Swedish version, did not understand the character of Lisbeth.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I highly recommend spending the extra money on the original Sony PS3 Dual Shock Wireless Controller.  I have three of them and never have had an issue with them.  My 3rd controller was based on me buying a generic controller that died at 30 days after having it.  There are a lot of controllers that look similar, but trust me, it is worth paying extra for the real thing!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I have been using the Sharkoon X-Tatic SX headphone for a while now.  Those are great headphones by the way.  Especially for the price and if you don't mind the wires.  I have been playing the Xbox 360 more with my headphones on so I thought I would step up to a better pair and go wireless as well.  I really liked my Sharkoon headphones, but the X41's are in another class all together.  I had no idea how much I was missing.  I play a lot of MW3 and the difference is amazing.  It took me about 3 or 4 matches to adjust to how much I was hearing and to get the bass the way I like it.  After I got everything set though I could not believe how much my play improved.  I think I am still adjusting to what I am hearing right behind me vs what is further away.  It is just taking some time, but I am getting used to it.<br /><br />The headphones are nice and light and feel great even after a couple hours of wearing them.  I have not had any issues with static since I found a good place for the transmitter.  My wireless router is in another room so maybe that helps.  I use wifi on the Xbox 360, but that doesn't seem to be an issue as long as the transmitter is a couple feet away.<br /><br />Overall I can recommend these headphones.  Especially at this discounted price I feel like I got a great deal.  If you have a lot of wireless gadgets in the area you may want to wait for the X42's that will be coming out in the next month or so.  I understand that they will do better with the static issues some people have.  Of course along with the newer version will come a higher price tag.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|''Rio'' is amazing, beautifully animated movie. Characters are lovable and story is interesting. Right from the start I was sitting without twitching until the very end. The movie, the characters captivated me. While I may not like some of the songs, the movie is no less than incredible with a good humor. I adore the characters, plot and how they put it all together. This got to be the best of the best! I would give it a million  of the stars without a greed.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Just discovered Joe B. April 011 and is all my wife and I listen to. Seems he can do no wrong except BCC 1 and 2 Joe did not put his name on those CD'S. Bought this from W-Mart in June 011. It came with a bonus CD.It took about 5-6 plays on low volume. Thats when the whale also swallowed me! Than the entire CD started to cone together. What a great mix of songs except Heartbreaker which I can tolerate. Note the special sound on the guitar in The Whale That... Also I would love to see if Joe would team up with a country singer. I think he  would throw the country music world on its' ear. This CD shows how versitile Joe's music is.If you like JB than buy it. To answer one reveiwer with a quetion. Did the Beatles music stay the same? PS I do not type,but I try to review products that are important to me and help others.

081297381X|2.0|As someone most familiar with the mainstream view of things from an academic education, a morbid sense of curiosity and iconoclasm, I'm always interested in well argued challenges to the establishment. This made Taleb's work seem a rather fitting read.<br /><br />Given the many excellent existing reviews here, it would be repetitive to run through well worn ground again. The short take is that there are some interesting ideas mixed in with a health dose of narcissism, and examples meant more to than convey a point than historical accuracy. A decent enough effort, at 3 stars at best in that context.<br /><br />Rather, the point of this bit is to share an brief experience with the author himself. I ran into a small online community he runs, and with the curiosity getting the better part of me, I was motivated enough to read and then write some well thought out short critiques of ideas he was sharing for his new book. To be more specific, they were more of a suggestion to think about an issue of \\"dependence\\" from the viewpoint of dependents as beneficiaries in the relationship instead of only as subjects. The same curiosity also led me to check the day after to see if there was perhaps any reply.<br /><br />Now, I'm not one with enough vanity to expect a response as an equal, but I didn't expect well worded suggestions to be deleted and my ability to ask for the reason to be rescinded. From this it wouldn't be unreasonable to conclude that Mr. Taleb is more interested in surrounding himself in yes-men to prepare his ego for his next work rather than allow any flexibility in his thought process, and I believe this should be relevant to his many fans who take his seeming sense of inerrancy seriously.
B006LNOOW0|4.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />OOS EFFECTS:<br />There are about 110 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. There are about 42 from 15% - 20%, 32 at 25%, 7 at 30%, 4 at 40% and 2 at 50%. These are some large numbers but the bulk of the OOS effects are very quick.<br /><br />IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:<br />Like most of the newer animated 3D films, the in-screen 3D looks very good but I found the background lacking at times. The shading and detail of the characters are an enhancement to the 3D experience.<br /><br />I rarely comment on video content but as an adult viewer I was unimpressed by the storyline. IMO the film is geared for a young audience but conversely has a large amount of cartoon violence.<br /><br />ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:<br />There is some crosstalk sprinkled throughout the film but most of it is barely noticeable by being hidden within objects.<br />(crosstalk varies from system to system)<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.<br /><br />Click on my name for the lowdown on other 3Ds

0399159029|5.0|After several novels dealing largely with the postwar, Philip Kerr brings Bernie Gunther back to his roots as the last honest cop in Nazi Germany. This installment takes place in fall 1941 and concerns Gunther's peculiar relationship with the feared Reinhard Heydrich, now the National Socialist overlord of the former Czechoslovakia, where he will later be assassinated.<br /><br />Gunther is invited by Heydrich to a social gathering at Heydrich's elegantly appointed villa near Prague. Many top SS men are there. The guests enjoy luxury unknown now in Berlin, where the mobilizing of 3 million men on the Eastern front has put virtually everything in short supply. It's not just a social gathering, though: Heydrich has another agenda.<br /><br />And Gunther is suddenly pressed into service when Heydrich's aide is shot to death. Gunther gets carte blanche to interview everyone there, regardless of their rank o scary reputation, in search of the killer.<br /><br />Gunther's not alone in Prague. He's brought with him a bar girl from Berlin whom he recently saved from being assaulted in an incident with links to two murders and possible espionage overtones. She's smart and sexy and Gunther is falling for her. But as trouble develops in Prague, he realizes she's in danger.<br /><br />The book smacks of an Agatha Christie novel, with the detective interviewing all the house guests, finding much to hide and connections between them going back decades, plus the obligatory consideration of whether the butler did it.<br /><br />But no Agatha Christie novel features both detective and victim tormented by what they've recently seen in the East, where, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, genocide is under way.<br /><br />And Hercule Poirot never had to find a murderer in a country house where nearly everyone already is a murderer.<br /><br />I've enjoyed all the Gunther novels.  Getting back to his roots as an honest cop navigating his career and his principles through the sewer of Nazi corruption is a delight for readers after his more complicated sojourns in Peron's Argentina, Batista's Cuba and Cold War West Germany. This story is right in Kerr's wheelhouse. And he hits it out of the park.er of Nazi corruption is a delight for readers after his more complicated sojourns in Peron's Argentina, Batista's Cuba and Cold War West Germany.

B005Z271Y6|3.0|I bought this set unseen and immediately popped the DVD into the player as I worked and loved it!<br /><br />Then I looked at the Bluray and saw an \\"Advisory\\" sticker and did a quick search online and found out about the foul language inbetween the songs during the concert. Due to that, I have yet to watch it and doubt I will ever give it a spin.<br /><br />The DVD alone was worth the $10 I paid for it.<br /><br />I'm okay with leaving the BD in the case forever.

B0059XTUEK|5.0|\\"My Week With Marilyn\\" was at the top of our to-see list when we first heard about it, and especially after we saw a trailer.<br /><br />We checked and checked and finally found it only at a mall theater about eleven miles away, but we shrugged and said to ourselves, \\"Well, this is a special occasion.  OK.\\"  Then when we got to the theater and after we bought the tickets, we found that the movie was available only in one of those so-called dinner theater setups, with a total seating capacity of 32, and no seats available for us to sit together.  Now we like to have meals out, and we like to go to movies, but we just don't care to do both at the same time.  To us it is incongruous to watch a meaningful film with the smell of French fries and burgers or whatever, wafting over everything.  So we got a refund and went home very disgruntled.  And kept looking for the possibility of the movie showing up in wider distribution, as sometimes mysteriously happens.  Well, finally, we found it at a `normal' movie theater, fifteen miles away, and now we were flat determined to go see that movie.  And oh, how glad we were that we did.  The story was beautifully written and directed, the actors were all superb, and we walked out of the movie and all we could say was, \\"Wow\\".  And we passed the word along to all our friends, along with the less than encouraging difficulty it was to even find the movie being shown, much less in what we consider a suitable venue.<br /><br />Apparently the receipts on this film are remarkably low because no one could find it, and yet the film has garnered all sorts of awards and nominations, including Academy nominations for two of the actors.  And we simply cannot figure out why on earth this jewel of a film was not as carefully marketed and displayed as it was carefully made.  Some of the films nominated for \\"Best Movie\\" made a lot of money.  At least two of them, in our opinions, weren't worth the digital material it took to film them.  There's no accounting for tastes.  But for all the folks out there who love good movies with good stories and good actors and wonderful settings, get the DVD of MWWM.  Ours is already ordered.  We'll want to see it again.  And again.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|I ordered this cover for my \\"Christmas gift\\" Kindle Fire. As far as what it is designed for, which is to protect the device, it works perfectly. I probably would have been happy with it for a long time but I happened across a leather cover that you don't have to take your Kindle out of to use. It also came in prettier and brighter colors, but that's my personal preference.<br /><br />If you only want protection for your Kindle this item is still a great choice.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have used this alarm clock for several months now and it is definitely a great replacement for the stock alarm clock. This alarm clock is so versatile that I can't imagine anyone not being able to find a good use for it.<br /><br />I love that you can set it to make you do math problems before disabling the alarm or hitting snooze. And the ability to adjust the difficulty of the math problems is also very nice.<br /><br />Another great feature is the gradually decreasing snooze time! I love this feature - you can customize it so that the time between snooze button presses decreases incrementally after each press of snooze! This is great for people like me that like to press snooze frequently.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you take the time to navigate through all of the settings and menus the first time you use the app, in order to familiarize yourself with the numerous options that it provides. Then after using the alarm clock for about a week, go back through all of the settings again to adjust them according to your needs.<br /><br />The only problem that I have had is that on a few occasions (less than 5 times in several months) the alarm just rings and rings and rings without me being able to shut it off.  I don't know if it was due to me being too asleep to figure it out, or if it was actually a glitch with the app.<br /><br />Anyway, I solved that problem by just tearing the batter door off my phone and pulling the battery ... unfortunately, that is always a possibility (or your phone's battery could die in the middle of the night if you fall asleep without plugging it in), so it is always wise to have a back up old fashioned alarm clock just in case.  But waking up early for work has been significantly easier for me since I started using this alarm clock. I definitely recommend it!

B001R0KH3M|5.0|I ordered this DVD with a bunch of other \\"Funk\\" related live shows and just recently got to this one this morning.  It's probably the best out of the batch which shocked me.  There's many reasons I give this 5 stars...Stevie sounds incredible, he has a tighter band than some jazz fusion groups out there right now, and the setlist choices were dynamite on this DVD.  The show is over 2 hours long, and he plays a lot of his album \\"Hotter Than July\\" which I thought was awesome.  You can see some stars in the audience dancing throughout the show, and they show an equal amount of screen time for all members of the band. Stevie's daughter Aisha joins him throughout the entire show on backup vocals. I Haven't caught the group in concert yet but I plan to after watching this. 5 STARS, a must have if you are a Stevie Wonder fan or a general R&B/Funk fanatic.

B001AQO3WY|2.0|I didn't object to the language, being an Army brat, and I don't claim to know whether the series is realistic or not. The main attraction for me was that Generation Kill is based on the writings of an embedded journalist. Unfortunately, something major has been lost in translation from memoir to cinema. In the second episode, the acting and directing is so bad, you just wait for the next gaffe. A character who supposedly watched Al Jazeera news mispronounced it profoundly, as anyone who's ever heard a single Al Jazeera report will attest. Other obvious errors were incredibly distracting. I found myself unable to get into the story, and distracted by wondering whether it was a very professional production. I decided to stop watching for the moment, until I hear which episodes are worth watching - the first is far better than the second.

1594203334|5.0|My wife and I are having our first child this spring and this was such a wonderful book to read together. This was one of those books we could not put down. It has a lot of very practical ideas that Pamela applied to her own children from her experiences living overseas. She is also a witty author and weaves humor throughout the book. Both my wife and I plan on using some of the ideas presented in this book in our own upcoming parenting. As to the negative reviews (with titles such as \\"Won't read this book\\" meaning they are reviewing something they never read) we think it is important to take the best of cultures around the world and apply them. Isn't that supposed to be what America is all about? For example, my wife and I are going to breastfeed and have a natural childbirth - both ideas that are discussed as very unpopular in France. But why not do things like \\"La Pause\\" and other things that the author notices parents using in France, but not here in the States?

0201633612|4.0|This book is a must read for all software engineers. It defines a vocabulary that you will need to communicate effectively with other engineers in your day to day work.<br /><br />Four stars only because it's a little dated, and the pattern blueprints don't translate well to dynamic and prototype based languages (there's a lot of overhead designed to overcome the limitations of Java, C++, etc...)<br /><br />Still the best book on the topic of Design Patterns I have ever read.
6304490119|2.0|I guess this DVD does not utilize any high compression because the entire movie is not on one side, but rather it is split across each side.  I think I remember buying DVDs like this years ago, but I assumed that any sold these days would not require one to manually flip the dvd over in order to continue watching it.  Then again, it's a 1994 movie so perhaps the DVD was manufactured back then.  In any case, I am buying another edition and hopefully the next one will have the entire movie on one side.

I liked it even more than season 1, as the plots were interesting and fast-paced. The earl's daughters finally grow up and mature as they learn to care for others during wartime. The earl's heir, William, becomes a dashing hero. The earl's valet, has the most tense storyline (Brendan Coyle, who was riveting as Nicholas Higgins in BBC's North and South tv series).

I was at Walmart one day and just saw this and thought perhaps it will work but at the same time I was iffy bout it because my camera was not cheap and I did not want to ruin it.<br /><br />I bought it and did some research prior to use. The cleaning tip makes your hand black when touched but it won't damage your lens. I have used it on my lens along with the screen of the camera. Works better then a lens cloth by far!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|After waiting for an update to PvZ for months, my kids still can't play because it still does not work with Android 4.0 at all. Absolutely ridiculous. Before my Xoom was upgraded it worked passably on 3,  but didn't multitask (remnant of the iPhone version?) and had lousy pixelation problems. Whatever you do, don't buy this.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|interesting games but no instructions so sometimes takes a few tries to understand what each game wants you to do
0345529057|5.0|Loved the historical feel of it.  Made it seem like there probably really were dragons and zombies and shapeshifters back in those days.  Mesmerizing.  The 4th book was a bit of a letdown in the beginning, but I'm certainly anxious to get the Dance of Dragons.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I have to say that when I first started watching this movie, I was not sold on the characters but by the end I was. I am not going into plot since you can read the description yourself. What I will say is that I was at the edge of my seat for a good part of the movie.<br /><br />I have read the reviews and everyone has a thought on how to survive and what they thought the characters did wrong. Yes the female lead puts her hand on the bar so the skin can get frozen. But how many of us would do the same thing, grab something in front of you for security while you are miles up in the air and fall asleep while you do it? The premise is young adults going for a a day at the slopes but get stuck not Man vs Wild!<br /><br />The scene where she was talking about her puppy and when she has to urinate on herself were I thought great moments in the film. Why wouldn't she think about her dog, that is all they have up there...time to think. I thought the scene when she finally has to go the bathroom was so raw. On top of all that has happened-getting stuck, seeing your boyfriend in agony only to die, frost bite on your face...you have suffer the ultimate act of hopelessness and helplessness by having to pee on yourself. To me that was the horror part of this movie. You are at the mercy of things that you have no control over.<br /><br />I thought everyone did a great job in this movie in conveying those emotions.
B004132HZS|5.0|Being a loyal fan to the classics written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I was initially skeptical about the adaptation to modern days.  However, this new series is genial.  I find myself absorbed into the plot once starting to watch the first episode.  While being developed in our modern era, this new series has successfully maintained the essence and atmosphere of our beloved classical Sherlock Holmes' adventures. Highly recommended for lovers of detective stories.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|I want to move to Serenity, stat.  Joss Whedon is crazy innovative, adding a husband and wife team on a space ship full of flawed, yet lovable characters.  Sci-fy has always been about new frontiers, and how better to show this than inundating the screen with Western style elements?  I also enjoy seeing it's actors in different shows, such as the lovely Morena Baccarin in [[ASIN:B005LAJ16I Homeland]].  The only other show that comes close in it's style and substance is a British show called [[ASIN:B0051SFT34 Outcasts: Season One]], a must see for BSG and Firefly fans like me.  Strangely, these kind of brilliant shows never go viral for the mainstream, the way that True Blood or Lost did for millions.  As my old man used to say; \\"Can't argue taste\\".
B004FOA84A|4.0|just a matter of time with this puzzle game, a few places where thinking is a must, but pretty much you keep looking till all pieces are found. the lost city is much longer and more thinking is required.  it is a five star game.  fire maple games are doing it right

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I ordered the \\" The Hunger Games\\" trilogy for the Kindle app on my android device. A friend from work had suggested it to me. At the time I ordered it, I wasn't aware that it was supposed to be a youth book, but decided to read it anyway. It was great! I loved the main character. The book was so beautifully written that I felt I was watching her grow up before my eyes. Great read even for us old folks!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game.  the music sets a meloncholy atmosphere.  the sound and effects are also interesting<br />my grandson (3 yrs old) and I can do this together without feeling we are racing against a clock as with most games.  one of my favorites.

B000025Y9I|1.0|Was very excited to receive this music CD but the sound quality was really poor, it is full of static and barely audible. The CD and its case looks pretty fake. Truly disappointing! Have requested for returns and refunds and the repsonse from the seller was prompt and courteous.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I bought this watch when my $300 Hamilton quartz began to randomly stop running overnight from time to time, requiring me to tap it to get it going again.  I decided if I was going to have a watch that stopped on its own, it might as well be one that I didn't have to put a battery in.<br /><br />I like this one a lot.  While it doesn't look expensive, it does look like more watch than you ought to be able to buy for $70. The crystal is not sapphire, but it's not plastic or glass either (it's Seiko's Hardlex which is supposed to be highly scratch resistant).  It's very clear, and appearances are that it will not scratch easily.  The second hand appears to move continuously rather than \\"ticking\\" (although close examination shows it is stepping about 4-5 times a second).<br /><br />The watch keeps decent time, very good time for a non-quartz;  I've owned it less than a week but it appears to be gaining less than 8 seconds a day. It may get better or worse with time.<br /><br />As an IT practitioner I'm surrounded by devices with perfect time.  I use radio-controlled clocks at home and I use time-synced computers at home and at work.  Only the time on my wrist is ever off by more than a second.  I can live with being a few minutes early by watch's time, and I'm happy to give up the need to replace batteries in my timepiece.<br /><br />Of course, you do have to wear the watch to keep it wound and running.  Leave it sit for a few days, and it will stop, but I like this watch enough to wear it everyday.
B000007WK4|4.0|CD was intact but the case had some cracks but I can live with it. The quality of recording is much better than the one on the other album(Road to Hell), which I also orderd (but returned) from Movie Mars Inc.

B0057VDGNK|5.0|Listening to this CD alone in your dark room with your headphones on.  Just focusing on what is going on.  The music becomes ethereal, no longer is it just sounds.  It becomes fluidity, serenity, and grace.  Intangible as you simple glide through each set seamlessly.  It's not an experience, it's a journey.<br /><br />In this masterfully edited, and pieced together Soundtrack - Cliff Martinez gives us one of the best and most complete album of the last 10 years.  Listening with my Panasonic RP-HTF600-S, I can hear the tension and cut it with a knife.  The dark deep Trance Psy-Goa inspired electronic sets.  To the rhythmic pop up tempo beats.  The richness and fullness of the bass is unparalleled.  The constant sweeping mids and the tight focused treble is inspiring.  Eerie at times, uplifting at others.  This brings out every emotion at just the right time.  It's a timeless masterpiece.  With the right setting and headphones, this album will blow you away.  The extension of the bass notes vibrates my head, while the melodies in the background provide comfort and serenity.<br /><br />The album itself is a progression, from the upbeat happy female vocal gorgeous rendered songs in the beginning.  To the building of something special, to the deep rhythmic engrossing harmonies and engorging bass.  Ending with the piercing devastating darkness of pure destruction.  Aurally one of the most beautiful well composed compositions of all time.  If the movie was a 9/10, this is entirely off the rating scale.  This is my 7th continuous listen today, and out of the 20+ overall - each time it keeps getting better.  We will look back 20 years from now, and say \\"That was not only a masterpiece, but will be eternally relevant.\\"<br /><br />We may be reaching the limits of what music can produce because Cliff Martinez, this is beyond legendary.  This is the kind of album you only see once in a lifetime.  Such fluidity, poise, and atmospheric beyond belief.  Listening to the 18th track right now with tears flowing down my left eye.  Cliff Martinez, we want and need you to know how influential this album has, is, and will become.  It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  The pure beauty of it cannot be understated.  It goes beyond words that you have done the impossible, for you have brought all of us this much closer to perfection and the hope and dreams of each and every one of us.  In unity, and in perfect synchronization.  It's more than just music, it's everything that we hope and strive to achieve, to become - to live for, and for that we are eternally thankful.ight now with tears flowing down my left eye.

It really helped me learn how to structure my answers and know how to get to the right solution efficiently.

0486284735|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is one of the few books that I can honestly say earned its status as a classic with a huge fan base. It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her best<br /><br />Synopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)<br /><br />The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness.
0061801313|5.0|Hanna, Spencer, Emily and Aria are four estranged friends who slowly drifted apart after the leader of their posse, Alison, suddenly and mysteriously disappeared at the end of seventh grade. Three years later, Aria has returned from Iceland, Hanna has given up her unmentionable habit, Spencer is interested in yet another boy she can't have, and Emily is going through some life-changing emotions. Oh yeah, and they are all receiving mysterious texts from someone who calls herself A. A knows all their secrets. And A plans to reveal them all. Does she reveal them? Will the girls ever have a normal life? Does Alison ever show up again?<br /><br />I was a very hesitant about reading this book. My friends all raved about it, but I had watched the show on ABC Family, and I thought the books would be just as ridiculous. But after an emergency where I didn't have a book to read (which, if you've never experienced this, is the worst feeling in the world) I finally consented to borrowing the first three books from my friend. I am SO happy I did. I finished the first one in 5 hours, the second one in 2 days, and the third one in a day. I am not exaggerating when I say I couldn't put it down. I fell asleep at night while reading, woke up in the morning, started reading again and only took breaks for meals. I strongly, strongly suggest this book to any girl from ages 12 to 18. READ IT!
B002APU580|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books and in my opinion this version was an excellent rendition. :) I tried watching the BBC version, but I just could not plough through it... The scenery and soundtrack in this version was beautiful, and all the characters fitted their roles perfectly. Keira Knightley was a great Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew McFayden was a great Mr. Darcy! They seem perfect in this time era!<br /><br />Excellent cast + scenery + soundtrack = excellence!!
B004Z4LVZK|4.0|I often find it difficult to get into a \\"boy\\" book. It's usually just weapons, fighting, and unceasing action. Now, I'm not all about \\"feelings\\" all the time, action all the time can be a little much for me. What can I say, I'm a girl. However, The Maze Runner was not one of those books.<br /><br />The action and mystery here were absolutely perfect. Every time I thought I had things figured out and there was going to be a little break, something new jumped out of nowhere taking me by surprise just as much as all the characters.. This scenario might be annoying in another setting, but it totally works here. It was just enough mystery and intrigue to keep me furiously flipping pages to find out all the answers. In fact, I had to keep covering up the next page so I wouldn't get ahead of myself in my excitement and skip forward.<br /><br />No one character really stood out, but I liked most of them. I wish Teresa had been more present in the story, but hopefully there'll be some more about her in the next books. I was also a little confused about Thomas and Teresa's relationship since it popped out of nowhere, but thankfully, so were they.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This was an absolutely fantastic start to the series. If you're up for a fast-paced action-filled dystopian-esque mystery this is the book you need. Seriously, if you've been putting this one off, you definitely need to pick it up. Also, it's an especially good \\"boy\\" book if that's what you're looking for.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|We had this game for Nintendo DS and enjoyed it. No it is not a &quot;Wow, my life is COMPLETE!&quot; game.  It does give you motivation to get better at each game and while the operation of each game is not complicated, that doesn't mean you will conquer them with ease.
0525423273|5.0|This book in one word? Fantastique! Seriously, I loved everything about this book. The characters were great, the setting was great, the writing was great. I'm could just go on and on about this book. Why have I not read it before now?!?<br /><br />First off, I absolutely loved the characters in this book. Anna had such a great voice. I thought I'd read books with believable high school girls, but she totally blows everyone else right off the page. Her thoughts were the kind almost everyone can relate to. Especially the inner SCREAMING in capital letters. Of course, I want to hit her on the head and tell her she was a dummy sometimes, but I'm sure others would have been doing the same to me had they been following me around and listening to my every thought. Everyone else was great too. So great, in fact, I wanted them to be my friends instead of Anna's sometimes. And, of course, who could forget St. Clair? Personally, I prefer his first name, but I shall not delve into French on the keyboard. He's totally droolworthy, but not just in the looks department. He's funny and just naturally charming. And amazing. Enough about Euro boy though.<br /><br />How could someone not love a book set in Paris? All of the descriptions whether it be about the weather or Notre Dame were great. I also loved the little peppering of French words throughout the story. It really helped in making me feel like I was actually in Paris. Plus, the whole French thing adds to the hilarity of Anna's situation (I love when she orders lunch for herself the first time!). And speaking of food: the descriptions alone made me want to shove some things in a bag and board a plane for the city of lights immediately.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the relationship drama in Anna and the French Kiss. It was a totally new take on the high school boy-meets-girl scenario for me. It was much more emotional and engrossing than I ever could have possibly imagined. I hurt for Anna when she hurt and was pulling out my hair right along with her in frustration.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This book was amazing. You absolutely must read it. I was cracking up all over the place and loving every minute. This book is a great escape that takes you not only to the city of lights, but captures your heart in the process.y hair right along with her in frustration.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This book was amazing. You absolutely must read it. I was cracking up all over the place and loving every minute. This book is a great escape that takes you not only to the city of lights, but captures your heart in the process.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun but takes a lot of time. each level and game has its own thrill. would deffinatly reccomend this game.
B0054U56B4|3.0|I am pretty unimpressed by this book. I finished because it wasn't bad and I prefer to finish whatever I start unless it's completely unbearable. The problem with this one was the character changes. I know they're important when it comes to a series, especially the second book. I also take issue with the fact that every second book seems to always be about problems in a relationship. I know that can be a big help in making the story go somewhere, but man, it's getting pretty old.<br /><br />I really didn't like Lena much throughout the book. In fact, I enjoyed the parts she wasn't in quite a bit more. She was pulling the same ol' tricks as last time and her attitude was quite annoying. I liked Ethan pretty well, but I just wanted to scream at him \\"Hello! Can you please stop letting Lena treat you like garbage?!\\" I can say that I really liked Link's character and we got to see quite a bit more of him this time. I was also quite interested in the new twist in his story.<br /><br />There were a few surprising and interesting parts that will help me want to read the next book, but overall I wasn't that impressed. Somehow, it managed to be predictable and confusing at the same time. I found myself just wading through to the end. An end which I wasn't that impressed with, but was just intriguing enough to make me go pick up the next book.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't too impressed but it really wasn't bad either. Just slow. Most of the good parts are so intertwined with the story that I can't really mention them.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Don't bother with this app unless you're into Charmin toilet paper commercials and movie trailers popping up and opening your web browser to do it!  Totally over the top unacceptable!!  MobilityWare apps all suck now and all have this crap!
0061726834|5.0|Oh. My. Goodness. This book was amazing and breathtaking and astounding. Basically, this book was any fantastic word you can think up. The beauty that Oliver is able to conjure up from a world so lifeless and dull is fantastic.<br /><br />At first I thought Lena was too average and I couldn't possibly imagine her ever doing anything to the contrary of what she's always known. Slowly, though, she transforms. And it's perfect. It doesn't feel forced or at all wrong. And of course, I was sympathizing with her the whole way. How can one not sympathize when love is in question? In a world where a love for one's children doesn't even exist it still manages to rise up and take hold of some people. I almost wanted to shout for joy when love started grabbing hold of Lena.<br /><br />Delirium is amazingly well crafted. I loved all the little snippets at the beginning of chapters that were from books and writings that only existed in this made-up world. It's little touches like that which make it real and truly draw the reader in. The disease itself is incredibly believable. At one point it lists all the symptoms and I couldn't help but thinking it does sound exactly like a disease. With all the diseases that scientists are constantly \\"identifying\\" it seems only a matter of time before things we take for granted become known as a disease as well.<br /><br />The writing is simply beautiful. I was devouring yet savoring each and every little word because they were all special. I wrote down one of the things that struck me near the beginning: \\"[bright buildings] glistening like teeth over the slurping mouth of the ocean.\\" There's so much more like that, but you'll just have to read it and find out for yourself.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I can't say enough good things about Delirium. It was amazing and thought-provoking. And you seriously have to read this book. Be prepared for an awesome cliffhanger, though. It left me seriously antsy for Pandemonium.
B0058M632Y|3.0|The book is large because of the awesome amount of detail that is given- incredibly useful. The DVD is less helpful though.<br /><br /> The anatomical images are the same as the images in the book.<br /> The DVD is handy because you can switch from different tissue views more quickly flipping pages in the book.<br /> The biggest con is the that DVD images don't show the posterior views...or I can't figure out how to access them.<br /> The adjustable MRI scans show ascending or descending transverse views quickly but the parts aren't labeled.<br /> You'll have to go back to the book to see, which makes this aspect redundant.<br /> I bought this book for the DVD interactivity, I'll have to find something else.
0385738765|5.0|These books are quickly becoming some of my very favorites. They're just so stinkin' awesome! I really think I could just go on and on about how awesome The Maze Runner Trilogy is turning out to be, but I suppose I should get down to the nitty-gritty details (no, not the spoilery kind.)<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I have nothing bad to see about The Scorch Trials. There was so much action I wasn't bored for one minute. I found myself being torn between wanting to relish the story and wanting to flip pages as fast as I could. There was just the right amount of mystery that I continued wanting to discover the answers instead of becoming fed up with all the unanswered questions. And boy, are there questions. It starts with a few and then they just snowball from there, but luckily, answers are slowly given along the way. It leads quite nicely into the last book.<br /><br />All the unexpected twists and turns were perfect. My mind kept being blown over and over. It was awesome. There was a tinge of horror to this one even more than the first, but it's a raw, real horror instead of paranormal or anything of the like. It was such a surprising aspect that only made me love it more. Each new horror just made me sympathize with Thomas and his friends moreso.<br /><br />The writing is also very well done. I think the third-person POV makes it even more realistic and easier to feel what Thomas is going through. I think I went through the gauntlet of emotions just as much as him. Everything felt so realistic, I was turning around checking to make sure nasty monsters sent by WICKED weren't right behind me. Especially Cranks. You'll have to read it, I definitely don't want to ruin the full effect for anyone.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This is a seriously fantastic follow-up book. I actually liked it better than The Maze Runner but only slightly. If you're in for a good action-filled book full of mystery with the added rarity of a main boy character definitely pick this up. I'm begging you, read these books! They're seriously amazing.ing you, read these books! They're seriously amazing.
B0030IIZ3S|5.0|Who didn't love Toy Story?  If you didn't, then take a look in the mirror and ask yourself, \\"Where did my sense of compassion and humor go?\\"  Now, stop reading this review, buy the movie, and watch it until you laugh.  Which should take be right before the titles.<br /><br />If you loved Toy Story, you will adore Toy Story 2.  The characters are just as funny and you can see how their bond has grown.  It wouldn't be a very good story if there wasn't some controversy.  The toys go on a rescue mission for Woody after he is lifted from a garage sale.  Shenanigans ensue and a few new toys are added to Andy's gang.<br /><br />I bought the combo pack because I discovered the DVD edition my mom had in her collection was badly scratched, which affected the playback.  My folks just got a Blu-Ray player for Christmas, so I thought getting the two-disc set was a great deal; I get to keep the DVD and they have the Blu-Ray disc!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked within the first few pages and could not put it down. This book is very engaging and took over all my free time!<br /><br />The story line is brutal and rough to read at times. I actually became emotional while reading this. I guess that's the mark of a great book, when you cry, laugh, gasp and get angry, all because of the picture they author has painted.<br /><br />This book has something for everyone, adventure, love, humor, shock value....it's fantastic. This is now, my favorite book, ever. I have never become this engrossed in a story in my life.<br /><br />Thank you for creating Katniss Everdeen. I will miss her when the story ends.
0385342063|5.0|I had been eagerly awaiting Kinsella's latest novel and this did not disappoint.  I loved it.  Loved it so much that I read it in less than 6 hours.  And I'm considering reading it again.  It is a light-hearted, feel good, funny, wonderfully sweet romantic comedy.  Poppy is such a cute, relatable character.  I can only hope there is another Poppy Wyatt book!  I'd love nothing more than to continue to read about Poppy's \\"happily ever after\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the first book in one day and started on this book immediately afterward. I wasn't too sure I was going to like this book because I became obsessed with the first book, and wasn't sure if my love for the first book was centered around the \\"game\\" itself.  I agree with one or two reviewers here who stated that this book was confusing in parts...but it was nothing too distracting.  The story is still amazing..and Katniss still kicks butt!<br /><br />This is a story that will stand the test of time, and it now my favorite story of all time. If you are on the fence, don't hesitate, everyone should read this book! I was so engrossed in this book, I walked on the treadmill for two hours and forgot I was still walking! Lol...read this book! Amazing story!

B00007LTIB|5.0|Before you compare this with another 3 song Yes album released 2 years earlier, the only thing this album seems to have in common with Close To The Edge is that it has 3 songs- one epic and 2 shorter pieces. Aside from that, this is almost the \\"evil twin\\" to CTTE (not a putdown, just that the 2 are totally different styles). It came out after the ambitious Tales From Topographic Oceans (4 songs which took up each side of the double LP). Rick Wakeman had left after the tour and so Yes brought in Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz, whose style gave Relayer a more jazz feel and the album was supposedly recorded at Chris Squire's house in his basement. Some people say this is Yes's harshest sounding album and it's hard for me to disagree, though much of the harshness especially on the sidelong opening track is quite appropriate. \\"The Gates of Delerium\\" is Jon Anderson at his most direct lyrically, \\"Stand and fight we do consider\\", as he goes from singing softly (\\"Listen...\\") to almost shouting the lyrics when appropriate (\\"...the devil's sermon\\"). The middle section features an extended instrumental section complete with militant marches and sounds of battle, though the mood peacefully changes like a breath of fresh air at the \\"Soon\\" finale. Steve Howe's guitar solo on \\"Sound Chaser\\" is eerie, while Patrick Moraz features some cool spacey jazz fusion on the keyboards. Meanwhile, Chris Squire and Alan White bash it out on the bass and drums, respectively. It ends in a free-for-all jam with Jon singing \\"cha-cha-cha.\\" He took a little crticism for it, but to me, it shows Jon having a little spontaneous fun. \\"To Be Over\\" is a more peaceful but still semi-moody track, melodically reminiscent of Yes' early days, albiet with more modern touches with Moraz's keyboards and Howe's guitar and sitar work. Jon's lyrics are both persuasive (\\"Think it over\\") and spiritual (\\"Be ready to be loved.\\") All in all, this album serves as a new milestone in Yes' ever-changing style (one that wouldn't be repeated, as this was Moraz's only studio LP with Yes).
B000WC3864|4.0|A true classic...a well-crafted horror movie that provides exhilarating laughter and screams. I will always appreciate any film that uses special effects like Evil Dead does.
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|This is in my opinion, the best since the first. The previous entry was a big slap to the face. The second and third were ok, but the third failed when compared to the second. The newest brought back what the original started and in full force. The effects were top notch and that is always a plus. The acting was pretty decent as well.  For starters, the producers took time to put some very thought out death scenes in full effect. You can tell that this movie was not just slapped together to cash in on the franchise like The Final Destination was. When I heard the news of a 5th Final Destination was in the works, I had to roll my eyes and brush it under the rug. I decided to pick up the Blu Ray as a simple impulse purchase, and I am glad I did. I loved this film, it was intense from the very start. I am watching it again now for the 3rd time. Even if you are unsure of the franchise after the last few entries, give this one a watch, it is the best since the first and even ties the first in with this one. This is A+ entertainment, and a must see if you like the franchise. This one is actually a prequal to the original so I would say to watch this before the first film, then things will fall into place when watching the original.
1439170916|5.0|This book is an extraordinary achievement on many levels.  Besides being beautifully written, it is vast in scope, astoundingly detailed, erudite without being arrogant, and accessible to non-scientific types.  Cancer has touched my family and friends more times than I like to think about, but this book opened my eyes; it not only educated me about the history of cancer, it also revealed to me the exquisite elusiveness of this, the true \\"emperor of all all maladies.\\"  My husband urged me to read it, saying, \\"You're the one who always likes to read about diseases!\\"  This is true.  It seems that the only non-fiction I read has to do with diseases:  influenza, the plague, cholera.  So although I began with some trepidation, I was so pleased to have done so.  Mukherjee weaves history with poignant and sometimes tragic patient stories and cleverly applicable quotations.  This is not just a book written by an oncologist; it is a work of art and philosophy.  It also exposes the cat-and-mouse game often played by researchers and pharmaceutical companies, who care mostly for profit, not curing illness.  I got somewhat bogged down in the last 100 pages or so, amid the discussion of the genetic components of cancer and the sequencing of the cancer genomes, as well as the mutations which must occur for cancer to develop, but I absorbed most of it.  I recently saw an article in a newspaper about genes and cancer and I knew what it was talking about! Most important, for me, is that I gained a much deeper understanding of cancer and a new respect for this, perhaps medicine's most formidable foe.  The thousand year old war continues today, and as Mukherjee says, \\"The question then will not be if we will encounter this immortal illness in our lives, but when.\\"  Memorable piece of work. Highly recommended.
B00003CXB6|1.0|Yeah the special effects rocked. I couldn't get over the very bad casting of the young black girl. It just absolutely didn't work. The writing was horrible too. These people who supposedly know animals and bring a young injured t-rex to their trailor? This brought on a Big WTF when I saw this. Then wearing a bloody shirt around and wondering how these creatures are finding them?<br />Loved the original and really enjoyed the 3rd in this series. This one was beyond stupid.

B000IOM1YG|5.0|The third APP offering continued to demonstrate the orchestral genius of Alan Parsons in his thematic albums.  PYRAMID focuses on Egyptian mythology involving the cycles of life and death, the quest for immortality.  One of the Project's shortest albums, PYRAMID is nonetheless a notable addition to the Parsons catalogue.<br />What makes Parsons music so much fun is his ability to layer the songs thematic elements with imaginative flourishes to keep them interesting.  Andrew Powell's brilliant arrangements make both the instrumentals and vocal tracks extraordinary.  From the opening VOYAGER to the heartfelt SHADOW OF A LONELY MAN, PYRAMID is a marvelous journey back to the symphonic rock Parsons did so well.

0142000671|4.0|Seeing as it is a classic with great summaries and reviews written many times before, I'll keep mine short. Of Mice and Men is one of the shorter classics that really captures the emotions of drifters during the early 20th century. I was actually surprised at how glued I became to the book as I was feeling sympathy, anger, and sadness for each of the characters.

0385523912|5.0|The book \\"Nothing To Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea\\" caught me so much attention that I forgot the annoying cold symptoms, such as coughing and constant headache. I finished the book in one day. My heart was overwhelmed by those bitter and happy stories told by Northern Koreans.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|Boring, stupid, and cringeworthy.  I gave the saga a chance after the decent first movie but it has gotten worse with each episode.  Embarrassed that I went this far into the series.  Won't bother with the last.  Beyond fantasy...just crap of the lowest order story wise and disappointing effects for the resources devoted to it.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|I've waited a few days to write a review about this novel because I needed the effect of the book to sink in and be distilled a bit over a little time.  I did find this a somewhat challenging read because of the way it moves back and forth through time and how character's identities change and reality shifts.  That is clearly one of the points of this novel, which is sort of a bizarre retelling of Casablanca stacked on many levels of social satire.  This novel has it all...it is intelligent and well written, a great story with humor, terror, heroes, villains, satire, and the triumph of simple human dignity against overwhelming and oppressive circumstances.  I wish this were an easy and fun beach read so I could recommend it to all my friends and I know they would actually read it but it's not and they won't.<br /><br />But you should!  This is one the biggest, brightest and best works of fiction I've read in the past 5 years. Anyone who cares enough about books to read this review should buy this book and read it.  It is a masterful work that soars above most other novels in its ambition and achievement.
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|The animation and fight scenes were good, but the story itself seemed misguided. Not worth buying, just rent or watch, I already bought it though.

0743496736|5.0|I don't read much unless a book can kept me interested, so that alone deserves 5 stars. The first chapter had me on the edge of my seat and horrified which made me want to finish the entire book, so props to her because a boring beginning will often lose me. The first chapter details the shooting that morning at Sterling High School. You hate Peter (the shooter) at first, but throughout the book, going back and forth between past and present, you learn about Peter's life and why he did what he did. It wasn't right, but you start to sympathize with Peter. At the end of the book, the trial was sort of longer than I would have liked and it was the only part of the book that began to bore me and the ending turned out differently than I had expected or hoped for it to end, but overall it was a good read and I would recommend this book to anyone. It was recommended to me by a co-worker.

B005GTLPPY|5.0|I recommend this fascinating book. It describes how life form development is not always as simple a matter as a basic description of genetics might lead one to believe.<br /><br />e.g. the big B little b explanation for blue eye inheritance.<br /><br />Carrying out or \\"expressing\\" the instructions in the DNA code at the center of chromosomes is regulated by epigenetic markers on the surrounding molecular packaging. These markers can be changed to varying degrees during development and the effects can be expressed later in the development cycle.<br /><br />For example the book describes how most of these markers are reset when a sperm fertilises an egg but some are not, allowing inheritance of acquired traits based on the environment which have not been encoded at the base DNA level. This explains why the off-spring of clones can be healthy while their cloned parents are not as their epigenetic markers were not reset by the cloning process.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Excellent movie! It's a real eye opener on how we got into the financial crisis. I recommend this movie to everyone I know.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|Utterly awful in every respect, from the acting to the rendition of the story to the ludicrously campy gothic setting. Get the 2007 masterpiece version instead.  This one is a pathetic travesty of a wretched mockery of the novel.
0743496736|3.0|I don't have children, so all this bad-parenting-that's-really-not-that-bad doesn't resonate with me at all.  This book is about a Columbine-style massacre in which the perpetrator lives to stand trial.  The time period oscillates between the time before and the time after the killing spree and focuses on the boy (Peter) who did the shooting and a girl (Josie) who survived the incident--and their culpable parents.  Josie and Peter were childhood playmates, but then Josie started dating one of the despicable guys who tormented Peter, and therefore Josie stopped intervening on his behalf.  The author is not extremely judgmental about the parents but certainly faults them for seeing only what they want to see in their little darlings.  Case in point:  Peter's older brother Joey died in a car accident caused by a drunk driver.  Peter's mother found heroin and needles in Joey's room after his death but didn't tell anyone, because she didn't want to taint Joey's perfect image.  Asked if Peter and Joey were close, the mother responded that Peter worshipped Joey, when, in fact, Joey had bullied Peter his entire life.  The main characters behaved badly at every juncture, and they all seemed to be outliers.  In other words, the story would be more plausible if characters like Matt, Josie's boyfriend, had at least one or two redeeming qualities.  My favorite characters were Peter's lawyer and his wife, who attempted to defend Peter as being a victim of something akin to battered woman syndrome.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is awesome it complete worth the dollar but is one of my favorites you got to college the nuts and custumes
B00650SSWG|3.0|Cute, funny, and okay for the rental price. I wouldn't rate it as strongly as many of the other reviews, but it's definitely better than so many cheesy romantic comedies.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I watched this while I was babysitting and I had never watched it before. It was sooo cute! Even in your teens this is a cute movie if you find it on TV or can watch it, I say you do!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the rope is a great game with a simple goal. Get the candy to the little green guy. But actually it's not that simple as you expect it to be! Sometimes I found the challenges of the higher levels making me actually have to think about how to work it out. Something that I liked is that the game has the option to skip a level. The sound effects are cute and so are the graphics. I love the spider's cute expressions as well as Omnoms. Overall a great app for 99 cents.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love this game I am definitely addicted to it. my only dislike is the ads even in the paid version.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|fun game until it dumps your progress. wifi only sucks also. would Download faster on 4g. needs some serious bugs worked out
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love it.  I feel it cost \\"way too much\\" for what it is......but the reason I finally bought one, after looking all over, is because even though all Kindle covers are overpriced, I needed a cover to protect it.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|I just finished watching the 3d version-great cgi effects. Entertaining adaptation of childhood fairytale characters with a Latin twist. Sort of like Antonio Banderas as Zorro the Kitty-You'll love it. Must have for your 3d bluray collection.
0385344325|4.0|This is the story of how Reacher left the Army and became the wandering hero we all know and love. It is basically the 2nd prequel (after The Enemy).<br /><br />As I Reacher fan I loved reading about how he left the Army. It was also a great story with typical Lee Child thrills. I wouldn't say it is my favorite Reacher book by any means, but it isn't the worst. It is great for people who are already fans. One other thing about this novel is that it is far more descriptive in the sex scenes which didn't particularly bother me, but it might bother some people.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a great version of mahjong for android. works great on my LG vortex. first version I've found that i really like. especially like the autozoom feature.
B007B8GI28|5.0|When I first saw the first episode on season one i was hooked. I personally think the show only gets better and better. What could be better than a great zombie movie (every week) with a great story line as well. The characters are great, acting is wonderful and the make-up and special effects are spectacular. I look forward to watching each episode and will continue to purchase each season on dvd. A true zombie fan will love this series.
1400097029|5.0|A gentleman reflects on his life, especially his youth, after the death of his wife. He returns to the formative landscape of his childhood, a modest seaside town and inn in Ireland. It is also the site of the formative tragedy of his childhood. In effect, we have a coming-of-age novel as reflected upon in later life. Instead of the psychological depth of Danish author Jens Grondahl reflecting on his marriage in [[ASIN:0156012979 Silence in October]], we get lush descriptions and beautiful turns of phrase.  Thoughtful, slow reading; a treasure with many lines to savor. The Sea won the Booker Prize in 2005 and was picked as Novel of the Year by the Irish Book Awards in 2006.
B0063GORYU|5.0|in love with this game!! I cant stop playing it. I have never had any problems with it on the Kindle Fire!
0316926345|5.0|Not only are Catholics a minority in Britain, but the Anglican Church is the official state-sponsored religion. Our narrator, a non-Catholic officer based on the home front in World War II Britain, revisits a mansion he first visited as a young man and reflects back on his close relationship with a Catholic family. A non-Catholic himself, he reports to us about their habits and customs almost as if he were an anthropologist visiting a tribe in the tropical rainforest. It's a great book and, of course, it's been made into a Masterpiece Theatre series years ago. There are many reviews of this work already, so just to illustrate the excellent writing, I will just say that I think the romantic episode on an ocean liner during a storm at sea (her husband is absent; his wife is laid up with seasickness) is the most romantic passage I can think of in literature.
B0063GORYU|5.0|absolutely love this app! no problems at all. great way to pass the time waiting for an appt. would definitely recommend for solitaire lovers!

0739384198|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" concludes Stieg Larsson's \\"Millennium\\" series of three sex crime books featuring the hacker/detective Lisbeth Salander and her journalist friend Mikael Blomkvist.  (A fourth novel reportedly was left unfinished on Larsson's laptop when he died of a heart attack.)  While the first two books (\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\") may be read independently of the other, \\"Hornet's Nest\\" requires reader familiarity with both of the earlier volumes.<br /><br />\\"Hornet's Nest\\" picks up right where \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" left off.  At the end of that second book, Salander was awaiting transport to a hospital with a bullet in her head after being shot by her sociopath father, Alexander Zalachenko.  \\"Zala,\\" as it turns out, was a Soviet agent who had defected to Sweden.  When Salander was only 13, and after Zala had brutally beaten her mother, Salander tried to kill him with a Molotov cocktail; she succeeded only in severely burning him.<br /><br />Much of \\"Hornet's Nest\\" is concerned with Blomkvist's uncovering the rogue Swedish security police element that had protected Zalachenko and kept Salander locked up and mistreated in a mental institution through her teens.  Late in the book, the story takes up the trial of Salander for the attempted murder of her father--or so it was presented, but after the testimony focuses on Lisbeth's mistreatment by the state, the attempted murder gets lost as the conspiracy unravels.<br /><br />This points to a weakness (or a charm, depending on how you look at it) in Larsson's writing: his expository sections tend to go on ...and on.  We don't really need all the background history of the Swedish Security Service, for instance, but we get it, seamlessly blended in with the fictional events of the novel.  Also, the account of the trial, after slaking the reader's thirst for justice, drowns the reader in continued court dialogue.  When the judge offers to let Salander go if she promises to return to court and Salander admits that she would flee the country if he did so, you're ready to go with her.  When she at one point does leave Sweden for Gibraltar, the chronology becomes confusing, and in any case the sequence seems pointless.  An editor needed to take scissors to manuscript, methinks.<br /><br />A rather substantial subplot involves Millennium editor-in-chief Erika Berger's decision to accept a position with the prestigious if stodgy newspaper, Svenska Morgon-Posten.  Once ensconced in her new job, Berger is threatened by a mysterious rival and detractor.  This entire story line, though, aside from underscoring the overall men-who-hate-women theme of the series, appears to be a plot device to allow Berger's frequent lover, Blomkvist, to take up an unlikely affair with a security service officer.<br /><br />The denouement is made for the movies: it is suspenseful, dark, and grim.  The payoff is big, with a violent but satisfying finish.  (One might say Larsson, ahem, nails the ending.)  The coda, too, wraps (most) things up nicely.<br /><br />All in all, it is the characters that make the story work so well.  Salander is a compelling character: an anti-social, counter-cultural, almost idiot savant, technogeek, woman warrior.  Blomkvist, too, holds great appeal, despite his lack of any apparent personal integrity in his intimate relationships.  The three books have well-constructed stories, if overripe exposition, but it's the smart, strong and occasionally vulnerable characters that draw the reader in.<br /><br />I can't praise the reader, Simon Vance, highly enough.  His interpretation of the material really made this story come alive.  I know I've elsewhere criticized his Count Chocula version of private security chief Dragan Armansky, but all of his other voices, including Salander's, are superb.  He is the rare male reader who can convincingly do women's voices.  Vance's reading is definitely worth springing for the audio book.udio book.
1619492881|2.0|I am writing this review weeks after finishing the book.  So please excuse the generalization.  Although I found the prose to be beautiful, the story line was slow moving.  I understand this was written during a different era, so perhaps this would have been considered a page turner nearly a century ago. However, it was interesting to compare society's perceptions of infidelity and having a baby out of wedlock during Forster's time to those of today.  Really, things are really not that different!
B000VHPZXE|5.0|This two CD set does a very good job of culling most of the prime tracks from Stevie Wonder's most creative years. All are the original album versions, not shortened single versions. Included among its sixteen tracks were four new songs, \\"Do I Do\\", \\"That Girl\\", \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\", and \\"Front Line\\". Conceivably these four songs could have been saved for Stevie's next album, leaving room for a more complete selection from these years, but new songs entice fans to buy collections of music they already have. When the mp3 era came along I filled out the Musiquarium setlist with downloads of favorites not included, [[ASIN:B000V64PEU Golden Lady]], [[ASIN:B000V62UCO Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing]], [[ASIN:B000V68PG4 Creepin']], and [[ASIN:B000VH4MAG As]].<br /><br />If I were to do it over again though, I'd go for the 4 CD box set, [[ASIN:B000WLYSUK At The Close Of A Century]]. It includes every song here except for \\"Front Line\\" and digs even deeper into the classic albums that cover this time period; every hit or well-known album track is present and accounted for. It also judiciously selects the two highlights from Stevie's emancipation album, [[ASIN:B000VWPMX2 Where I'm Coming From - MotownSelect.com]] which immediately preceeds this time frame. It's no small potatoes that the box set also happens to include virtually every hit Stevie's had before or after this Grammy-laden phase of his career. (Paul Simon's 1975 Grammy Award acceptance: \\"I'd like to thank Stevie Wonder for not making an album this year.\\" Stevie won Album of the Year in 1973, 1974 and 1976. )<br /><br />Whether you choose this collection, its individual albums, or the \\"Close of a Century\\" box set, you're guaranteed to have some of the finest music of our time all in one place.

B006O5Y0SS|4.0|One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors), Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often turbulent relationships between men and women.  Almost exclusively a New Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the writer/director at the top of his game.<br /><br />Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux).  At the fabled Giverny, Monet's source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble constantly.  An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car drives by and gives him a ride to a café.  Gil realizes that he has been transported to 1920's Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Gil is struggling with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein (amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures Gil's fancy.  Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.<br /><br />This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy, storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy.  You do wonder how Gil and Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about most everything.  It's also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an obvious connection.  Such is love.<br /><br />Gil is a surrogate for Allen's inner voice. (One could even picture a younger Allen actually performing the role.)  He is also a romantic in contrast to Inez's friends who are intellectuals.  As for Paris, it plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story.  It is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his home base of New York City.<br /><br />There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later (and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great effect in a brief scene.<br /><br />Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but it's been a long while since he made anything as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time.  Vive le Woody Allen!

B0072GPQNG|4.0|The courage of a horse and its bond with a young man amid the horrors of war serves as the backdrop to a saga of loyalty and survival in Warhorse, Steven Spielberg's take on World War I and its effect on a British family.  Adapted from a novel and inspired by the stage play of the same name, this is old fashioned filmmaking that could have easily been made 50 years ago back when epic war dramas like Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago ruled the screens.<br /><br />A teenage boy, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), and a colt, Joey, form a bond amid the English countryside. Albert's mother (Emily Watson) worries over the house being repossessed as his father (Peter Mullan), an alcoholic and war veteran, struggles to harvest crops from the harsh land.  Threatened with eviction, Joey is sold to the army to assist in the fighting in Europe during World War I.  Heartbroken, Albert vows to find Joey and be reunited.  We can see early on that Joey is a special horse who is smart and brave whether he submits to being a plow horse, outracing a motor car, or lugging German war machines up a mountain.  As the years pass from 1914-1918 and the war amasses its destructive toll on men and animals on both sides, Joey's ownership changes hands, but through it all, he finds a succession of kind souls to watch over him.  When Albert joins the battle, an unlikely series of events will bring him closer to Joey.<br /><br /> Joey is an allegory to slavery as he is being sold as a commodity to hard labor and taken as property by either side in the war.  The story is primarily told through his eyes, and each set of people Joey encounters has a personal story: the British officer who makes a promise to bring Joey back to his rightful owner, a young German soldier who dotes protectively over his brother, or a German farm girl who is cared for by her grandfather. In wartime, making friends and losing them is a way of life, and Joey is no different whether it is a human or fellow mare.  Some common themesemerge from all these people, namely their affection for Joey and the toll that war exacts on loved ones.<br /><br />Production values are superior especially the vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who employs color schemes especially at the end that emulate the palettes of Gone with the Wind.  Irvine is ideally cast as the son who refuses to give up on his horse and friend.<br /><br />There are not a lot of the trademark Spielberg moments that you expect; Clint Eastwood could have been the director without much difference.  There are memorable scenes that resonate including a tragic charge by British cavalry on a German position and an auction with an army `band of brothers' pitching in for a worthy cause.  Then there is the harrowing, desperate escape by Joey that culminates in him getting tangled in barbed wire in No Man's Land and help coming from an unlikely source which results in a most unusual standoff.  Such scenes may seem clichéd but register nonetheless.<br /><br />The ending does have an emotional payoff, but there are some missed opportunities along the way.  There are relationships that could have been developed more like Albert's father who is a one dimensional character but has suffered trauma from a previous war.  The possibility of romance for Albert during a race between Joey and a car carrying a pretty girl never develops.  Spielberg also meant this as an antiwar film as in the scenes of brutal trench warfare where Albert witnesses his own comrades die, but such scenes are relatively brief and do not linger like his World War II saga, Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />Warhorse is about the bringing together of a family torn apart by war.  It's about the common humanity that unites strangers. It's also about a boy turned man and his love for his horse.
1846140935|2.0|Pinker has been one of the main advocates for the integration of the natural sciences with the humanities (a point powerfully made in 'the blank slate'). This is itself a very good intent given the uncertainty and intellectual nebulousness that pervades many areas of the academy. His is own attempt of doing so, however, is rather disappointing. The main thesis of the 'better angels of our nature' is that violence has relatively declined in human history and that this is due to a number of positive and valuable factors, including the formation of the state, the birth of 'gentle commerce' (perhaps a gentle term for capitalism), feminization of society and the development of reason and the Enlightenment. The whole book is sprinkled with graphs showing the plummeting violence rate in certain periods of history. At the end, the moral of the tale is that we should stop criticizing modernity and appreciate the benefits that it has carried with it.<br />This looks like a superficial analysis of Pinker's book but it is on these very simplistic terms that the argument is articulated. For example:<br /><br />- there is no ethical discussion of why violence should be bad on the first place (a point that accordingly legitimates the fact that we should be 'better' now). Is death penalty against a multiple homicide good? And what about the war to counter the Nazi during World War Two? Many people would agree that such violence is good and justified. Now, if we look back in time or even elsewhere, we find that there are systems of justice that works according to different principles. Anthropologists repeatedly tells us that there are societies that employ forms of counter-power in trying to prevent exaggerated forms of authority or domination. In these cases, violence is directed towards whom is considered the 'bad guy' by the majority. Now, one could advance the argument that nowadays, from a world-wide perspective, the situation has overturned; that is, people who get killed, tortured or led to starvation are hardly the potential dominators but generally those from the lower social strata.<br /><br />- I mentioned the importance of anthropology because if one makes claims about 'human nature', such claims should be comprehensive enough to include the whole range of societies studied (in these ambits I always have to specify that I'm not a naive cultural relativist. Actually, I regard the earlier work by Pinker and other evolutionary psychologists as highly valuable). There are long paragraphs about the notoriously violent Yanomamo. But where are the other thousands of societies living on this planet? Many anthropologists have come up with statistics that would suggest a different conclusion as that presented by Pinker (look at the Piaroa or Zafimaniry, for example). Pinker's point is therefore unrepresentative of 'human nature' on the whole.<br /><br />- one could say that Pinker is the farthest thing from being a Marxist. His conception of history, however, bears a worrying resemblance. He argues that with anarchy we inevitably have a certain violence rate that almost mechanically declines with the advent of the state and a few other factors. But this of course neglects so many other complexities. It has been argued (Brian Ferguson) that the Yanomamo themselves were witnessed in a particular historical moment where many contingencies (including Western incursions) were destabilizing their social structure, thus leading to warfare. Also, assuming that 'man' has been the same from the Paleolithic to the birth of civilization is simply wrong given the full range of anthropological and archaeological evidence that we have. As well as being flawed, this mechanistic view of history prevent us from imagining alternatives and possible solutions to further the decline of violence.<br /><br />- arbitrary is also his range of periods he analyses. There is a whole chapter on the civil rights movement of the 60s that is aimed at showing that the violence against animals, children, homosexuals and women has declined. But one might wonder what this has to do with the entire history of human beings. This conflation between thousand years long periods with very short periods of history muddles the main thesis of the book. Ironic is also the fact that these rights have been achieved through grass root movements, something that Pinker does not generally like.<br /><br />- we are told that, at the certain point in history, humans grew tired of continuous violence and intelligently decided to institute a state. In fact, this is wrong. Historically the institution of the state has always been enacted through violence and oppression. Before the state, people have always and everywhere preferred real occasional violence rather than the systematic threat of it.<br /><br />- capitalism is defended because it has made commerce less violent. The consequence of it at the level of global quality of life is nevertheless neglected. Of course, the 'horror statistics' that annually come up in contexts like Subsaharian Africa are a direct consequence of neoliberal economy (if you are a denier, please read a bit about it, then comment!). But for Pinker this is structural violence, that is something entirely different from physical violence. On this line, Pinker praises the institution of human rights but, as another reviewer (cassette playa) has pointed out, neglects to consider that we talk about human rights violations only when government kill or torture individuals but not when they implement economic policies that lead to famine and deleterious conditions. In short, it seems to me that defending capitalism for allegedly having decreased the physical violence rate and consider the dark side of it as non-violence is quite misguided and unfair. If that piece of 'horror statistics' were included in Pinker's anaylsis, I am not sure whether we could still talk about a decline of violence.<br /><br />In short, with this book Pinker has made clear that advancing large claims departing from a selection of statistics does not lead to amazing results. Also, from the manner the arguments are exposed, I am very suspicious of the way Pinker have come to support his thesis. I might be wrong but I guess that he proceeded by 1) gathering the particular statistics that allow to identify a general trend; 2) supporting them with explanations in line with his own political stance and neglecting those that suggest a different conclusion and 3) relating them (quite incoherently) to neuroscience and evolutionary psychology so to give the argument a more authoritative look. I am also suspicious that the people who have given a 5 star review are overall ignorant of the fields of knowledge Pinker naively draws from (history, archaeology, anthropology) and I am proven by the fact that historian and anthropologists of violence are little by little demolishing Pinker's points. But above all, I am increasingly convinced that most of American popular psychologists, with works such as this, contribute in the overall attack on any sort of political imagination, ultimately making people more stupid.ce against animals, children, homosexuals and women has declined.

B006IGZWB2|4.0|Based on the best seller by Kathryn Stockett and adapted and directed by her childhood friend Tate Taylor, The Help is a personal film that is affecting in its depiction of social injustice in the treatment of black females who served as nannies and maids in the Old South during the turbulent 1960's. As an ensemble piece, it features a host of memorable, Oscar caliber performances.<br /><br />A black female, Aibileen (Viola Davis), in Jackson, Mississippi, during the 1960's relates a story of life during that period where white families relied on black housekeepers to cook, clean and even raise their white children. These housekeepers in effect became second mothers to these children and did so for generations.  Aibileen works in one such household, as does her combative friend, Minny (Octavia Spencer), who works for the stern Hilly (grandly played for nastiness by Bryce Dallas Howard).  Fresh from college, Skeeter (Emma Stone) has a reunion of sorts with her old friends (including Hilly) from the community.  Absent is the local outcast, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who is shunned by the group.  Dreaming of being a writer, Skeeter has been curious about the life of these house servants and the injustices and humiliating treatment they must face that border on outright racism that has been passed down from family to family.  Even as a child, Skeeter has fond memories of her own housekeeper Constantine (Cicely Tyson) who left one day under mysterious circumstances.  Encouraged by her publisher, she decides to write a book based on the experiences of these servants.  Under the fear of being discovered and fired (or worse), one by one these black women come forth to tell their stories.  When civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, is murdered, it creates a firestorm of violence as these women risk everything to get the truth in print, and the results will forever alter their lives.<br /><br />As a chronicle of a lesser known civil rights issue and injustice, this film offerssome interesting insights into a modern form discrimination.  While most of the white community is portrayed as villains and almost caricatures, perhaps that's just the point: that such a backwards culture existed not that long ago.  There are a number of subplots including the attempts to set up Skeeter on a blind date and Celia's awkward attempts hide her domestic inadequacies from her husband by hiring a maid.  Then there is the fate of Skeeter's Constantine that is heartbreaking.<br /><br />As much as the acting is superior across the board, the film does not quite work as a whole as well as one would hope.  The narrative seems a bit uneven so things don't flow smoothly from scene to scene.  It's the only thing that keeps the film from being even better than it is.  In a way the parts or scenes are better than the whole, and many of those scenes are quite good and authentic.  Despite its serious subject, the film does have its humorous moments especially in the infamous confrontation between Minny and Hilly where justice is served!  It is the highlight of the film.<br /><br />There are any number of performances that shine particularly Davis (a standout), Spencer, Howard, Chastain, and Stone.  Even Sissy Spacek has a witty, offbeat role as an elderly mom at odds with her daughter Hilly.  But it's the film's moments that will stay with you; they buoy The Help into our hearts.
1933633867|5.0|This is an extraordinary book. Fascinating, convincing and important insofar as it addresses a very central issue. However, this is not the only work of his that should be read. I regard his books 'Possibilities: Essays on hierarchy, rebellion and desire' and 'Fragments of an anarchist anthropology' at least as great as the this one on debt. He is also a very skillful ethnographer as the monographs 'the lost people' and 'direct action' show.<br />And - with the possible exception of the last one, 'revolutions in reverse' - he also has a fine taste for book covers.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Alexander Payne has written and directed films (Sideways, About Schmidt) about men at unique crossroads in life and coming to grim, sobering realizations that cause a reevaluation of the past and an uncertain future.  In The Descendents, he focuses on a man's family dealing with grief and the hidden truths that threaten to tear it apart.  George Clooney is outstanding as a naïve husband and father who must confront life after a terrible series of events.<br /><br />A water skiing accident in Hawaii has left a woman in a coma and her husband/lawyer, Matt (George Clooney), grief stricken and stunned by the news that she was having an affair with another man.  It seems that everyone knew about the affair but Matt who was too busy with his work to even notice, and he must come to terms with it and rebuild his family.  Matt's daughters are a troubled ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and his older teen, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who has a spacy boyfriend, Sid.  As the family realizes that their mom may never recover, they must make some major decisions, and Matt must find the truth even if it means confronting the man who stole her heart.  Meanwhile, Matt, as the primary trustee for the extended family, has an impending major land sale he must decide upon that could be a financial windfall for his relatives.  Determined to meet his wife's lover, Matt does some detective work and, with some help from his daughters, finally arranges to meet the object of his obsession which causes him to reassess his own life and his relationship with his daughters.<br /><br />This is Clooney's film all the way, and he gives a thoroughly convincing portrait of a man betrayed and oblivious to his wife and his family. He is not the handsome, dashing Clooney of Oceans 11 or Ides of March but rather an unglamorous fellow who is vulnerable. The pain and realization he emotes is heartfelt. Woodley lends excellent support as the knowing daughter who helps her father's quest.<br /><br />Through much of the story you wonder if Matt will exact some kind of revenge on the creep or do something impulsive.  That bit of tension only adds to an engaging plot.  In the end, Matt does the right things and brings closure for his family.  The final shot is great as Matt tries to become a dad again to his girls.  A major subplot involving the land deal gets even more complicated as surprising information is revealed when Matt investigates his wife's lover.  There are occasional moments of hilarity as when Matt is at the end of his rope and resorts to asking Sid for advice. It is a riot of a moment.<br /><br />There are good details which add to our understanding of Matt's family including his cranky father-in-law (Robert Forster) and a mother-in-law who has Alzheimer's disease.  What is special about a film like this is that each major character evolves through events and changed to a degree by the end (including spacy Sid).  That marks good character development.  These are not cardboard caricature but fully etched individuals with weaknesses like anyone, and our initial impressions about each are dispelled by film's end.<br /><br />The Hawaiian scenery is gorgeous but never used as a travelogue.  It merely sets the scene as did the wineries in Sideways and in some ways, the tropical paradise serves as counterpoint to the despair and angst that Matt must endure.<br /><br />You could imagine a Broadway version of this story since it relies more on characters and situation.  The film makes you care for and sustain interest in the main characters (brought to life by a strong cast) and what happens to them.  In the end, there is sadness and regret but also hope, the kind of hope that strengthens and bonds a family.

B006MQRLSA|5.0|Truth may be stranger than fiction, but when the sports world is shaken by a methodology that will revolutionize the business of baseball, it becomes an amazing story born out of need.  Adapted from the Michael Lewis' bestseller by Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and directed by Bennett Miller (Capote), Moneyball is a fascinating look at how the sport of baseball was turned on its head and its implications that reverberate to this day. It's also about the bond a father has with his daughter that is stronger than any contract.<br /><br />In 2001, Oakland Athletics general manager and former player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is trying to keep his star players from being bought by financially wealthier teams like the New York Yankees.  Desperate to field a winning team with a hopelessly limited budget, he happens upon an analyst for the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (a winning Jonah Hill) who has statistics to back up his theory that the best players are not necessarily the costliest ones.  Rather than compete with the big teams, Beane realizes that the underrated players who are statistically on base the most will translate into runs scored and ultimately wins.  The remarkable thing is that these players can be obtained at bargain basement salaries. The concept goes against conventional wisdom and immediately creates friction among the veteran scouts and even the A's manager (played to perfection by Philip Seymour Hoffman).  A former star recruit himself, Beane blew his chance for stardom at an early age and is now sharing custody of his teenage daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright). He loves his girl and fears that losing his job will force him to move farther away from her.  As the team begins to show signs of becoming a winning organization, a remarkable string of wins begins that will make history and have far reaching consequences for the game of baseball.<br /><br />This is one of the best roles Pitt has ever had.The dialogue is perfectly suited to him, and he delivers flawlessly.  It's the kind of role you could easily picture with a younger Robert Redford.  When he says things that stun his personnel staff by deviating from common practice and status quo, it is a hoot.  I mean he really shakes things up because he is willing to try just about anything to win games, and it also means changing a culture of losing into a winning attitude.  Just watching the negotiations and deal making behind the scenes is fascinating.  You also get a realistic perspective from the clubhouse as players come and go, but these are people too with families, and the film does not shortchange this point of view.<br /><br />What elevates this film from its novel plotline is the genuine relationship between Billy and his daughter that influences his priorities.  He isn't just a general manager but a father, and the film never loses this perspective to its credit.  When the team's fortunes change dramatically by the end, an astonishing opportunity presents itself to Billy that puts him at a career crossroads, and the baseball world takes notice.<br /><br />Even non-baseball enthusiasts may find this a fascinating story because it is character driven with strong performances by its cast.  (Sports movies get made with semi-regularity, but when did a studio make a film about personnel management of a major sports team?)  When you think about the recent championship success of teams like the Boston Red Sox and look at this film, the connections are mind boggling.  And while this new age in personnel management is a story onto itself, the one constant through it all is a father's love for his daughter.  Top notch all the way.

Not since Mel Brooks had the clout and audacity to make his Silent Movie in 1976 had a silent film been shot on a grand scale.  Brooks had the advantage of blockbuster name recognition from his previous films and enlisting A list stars to do his film in color no less.  The Artist has no superstars, and instead the film relies on telling a compassionate story that is surprisingly accessible to modern audiences.<br /><br />In 1927 Hollywood, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinee idol whose films are popular with the masses.  At one Hollywood premier, he shows off his loyal dog (Uggie), and at the red carpet, he bumps into a fan, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), who has dreams of making it in movies.  George's home life is not so happy as his eccentric wife (Penelope Ann Miller) disapproves of his carefree antics. Meanwhile, Peppy auditions for and wins a bit part in a chorus line and by chance meets Valentin again who hires her for his film despite the grumblings of the studio boss (a wonderful John Goodman).  During a dance club scene, the two have instant chemistry and a romance is blossoming even as Valentin has doubts and feeling guilty as a married man. When the studio begins to embrace the sound era, he refuses to change with the times and finds sinking box office grosses and waning popularity while Peppy is a fast rising star.  When the stock market crashes, Valentin is ruined financially and, his career in a heap, all hope is seemingly lost until a shining beacon comes to his aid with a novel plan.<br /><br />This is a silent film that caught everyone by surprise with its deceptively simple plot of romance, drama, comedy, and pathos.  If that sounds like a Charlie Chaplin film, the kind of film they don't make anymore, it's becausethey haven't for over eighty years!  People who respond to this film owe it to themselves to rediscover the classic silent films like Chaplin's City Lights and The General by Buster Keaton.  The Artist is an ideal introduction to these and other masterworks.<br /><br />The film borrows liberally from past cinema, and its main plot is right out of A Star Is Born.  When Valentin is seated at the dinner table with his judgmental wife, it begs comparisons to the famous transitions at the dinner table in Citizen Kane.  The scenes where the studio is switching to sound pictures is reminiscent of the same dilemma in Singin in the Rain.  The dog, who steals the film, is terrific as comic relief and figures in a scene where he attempts to rescue his master from a burning building-Rin Tin Tin anyone?<br /><br />Although the musical score by Ludovic Bource is quite good particularly in the playful main theme, it uses several minutes of a love theme from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo for a climactic sequence.  It works just fine, but purists who recognize Bernard Herrmann's haunting score may find it a tad annoying.  There are also a couple brief instances when actual sound is employed to great effect.<br /><br />There are memorable moments including a loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) who refuses to leave Valentin during his decline.  There is a sentimental scene where Valentin has sold all his belongings and stands wistfully at a pawn shop, his refection superimposed with a tuxedo on display.  And this may be one of the only times you see someone flip the bird in a silent film!<br /><br />Sure, some of the scenes are filled with old fashioned movie clichés, but what is noticeable throughout the film is an energy and enthusiasm that becomes infectious even after the novelty of watching a soundless film wears off.  And consider this-an engaging silent film with no nudity or violence that is riding a wave of sentiment and love all the way to the Oscars.

B005UKJX4E|4.0|The Tree of Life is the latest film by reclusive director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) whose previous films displayed a simple narrative abetted by haunting imagery.  This film takes a step further by telling its story in grand strokes of imagery.  Though its technique may lead some to wonder the point of this exercise and dismiss it as confusing, others will hail it an ambitious masterwork.  Let the viewer beware.<br /><br />One family deals with a personal loss as it ponders the meaning of life through the point of view of its oldest son (Sean Penn), now an adult in the business world.  Celestial forces of nature signal the very creation and existence of the universe and provide a majestic background to the birth and evolution of life on earth.  We witness the beginnings of an American family from the Midwest in mid-twentieth century.  Led by a stern, proud father (Brad Pitt), and a doting mother (Jessica Chastain), three sons experience the joys and pains of growing up.  Through a rapid series of short scenes, this tapestry of sounds and images forms a mosaic of life's precious moments.  All the while a voice asks the great questions of life and God.<br /><br />Certainly the most ambitious film in the enigmatic director's career, it is also the most challenging.  This is pure cinema, and it is remarkable how the film is able to communicate visually albeit without much in the way of lengthy dialogue.  These fragments of life almost seem surreal as if from a Fellini film.  In a way it is kind of an experimental film on a grand scale.  It seems to ask, `what is the purpose of existence amid great loss'?  (Despite being a very spiritual film, creationists might not like the premise of some of the scenes that strongly suggest an evolutionary development of life on earth.)<br /><br />Those who are able to decipher the abstract nature of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey will likely have a clue on how to access the style and meaning of this film.  Indeed, some of the impressive visuals were created by Douglas Trumbull (Blade Runner) who did the 2001 special visual effects and helped to realize Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has captured some stunning visuals of landscapes and life that are at times overwhelming in their beauty.  The musical score alternates between classical and operatic pieces although one almost expects a minimalist, Philip Glass-type score to pop up.<br /><br />There are many unanswered questions. Which brother died and how? And what is the background of the oldest brother as adult?  How has the father changed since the loss of his son and how does this affect the family?  As much as the oldest son asks for answers, we want more information and must settle for pieces from a larger puzzle.<br /><br />The film serves as a search for meaning and hope amid the vastness of existence.  As we see the father teach his sons about manners, chores, music, fighting, and death, we may see something in our own common, shared experiences. Life is portrayed as a series of events that sometimes blur over time.<br /><br />This exploration of the meaning of life may prove to be too abstract and a turn off for some, but to those who are open to a visual experience unlike any other, it may prove to be a fascinating exercise in pure cinema.  Kubrick would be proud.
1451627289|5.0|I'm don't like horror at all, but I am always amazed by King's story-telling talents, on the non-horror type books.  11/22/63 is simply amazing.  Dont be scared of the length.  I never would have made it through if not worthwhile.  He really is the master of story telling, and this one is in line with \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"Shawshank\\".  Continual sense of supernatural forces at work, but not gross or graphic at all...Great characters and he makes the time travel issues work.  Could have trimmed the middle a bit, (very little bit) as to the surveillance of Oswald, but thats really nitpicking.  Someday, somewhere (probably in Maine) King's works will be taught as amazing literature, rather than the perception that it is \\"airport reading\\" pop fiction.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|A Boy's Quest in EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE<br />Ambitious in concept, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is the love story of a troubled boy whose bond with his father transcends death and events beyond his understanding.  Director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott, The Hours) has put together an interesting study in post trauma and rediscovery.  It doesn't always work, but it still registers on an emotional level.<br /><br />A funeral signals the death of a family member and a boy's alienation to the world.  In flashbacks, Oskar (Thomas Horn), who has trouble communicating and may have Asperger Syndrome, adores his father (Tom Hanks) who challenges him with riddles and treasure hunts to meet people outside his apartment.  Both father and mother (Sandra Bullock) are loving parents, and the world becomes an interesting laboratory for exploration and discovery.  Life is idyllic until 9/11 when everything changes and Oskar is witness to his father's last moments trapped in one of the Twin Towers.  A year later, looking in his father's closet, he discovers a key in an envelope with the letters `black'.  Who or what does the key belong to? Oskar sets out to find out by systematically tracking down every `Black' in the phone book and visiting each person for a clue.  This big scavenger hunt is at best a daunting task.<br /><br />His grandmother who lives across the street has a mysterious renter (Max Von Sydow) who does not speak and can only communicate by jotting on a note pad or displaying `yes' and `no' written on each hand.  The renter takes a liking to Oskar and accompanies him on his quest.  This is a search that proves overwhelming as each person they find has a story too.  When all hope seems lost, the road leads back to that fateful September morning and opens Oskar to the truth about his parents and himself.<br /><br />At first you wonder if this hunt will be meaningful and be rewarded or if it is a waste of time.  Oskar's obsession keeps him connected to his father; to fail is to lose whatever he has left of that relationship.  In a way, it is about trying to make sense of his father's death and coming to terms with it.  It is also about the forgiveness of guilt that nearly consumes Oskar.<br /><br />You kind of think that at some point a miracle may occur or that something profound may happen, but what does reveal itself does not quite answer all the questions, and maybe that's just the  point to the film, that life is part mystery and we never truly understand its riddle.<br /><br />When you take stock of all the people that Oskar encounters, you realize that every one of them can sympathize or has suffered some kind of loss, and how they react to that in relation to Oskar shows how the trauma of loss can be a common bond.  You wish you could learn more about some of these people.<br /><br />Von Sydow gives a memorable performance without uttering a word as the renter who has a personal, family secret.  Why does he remain mute?  Was he a survivor of something so traumatic like the concentration camps of Europe that he does not speak?  In a supporting role, Viola Davis is effective playing a character who figures prominently at the beginning and the end.<br /><br />In the end, Oskar has learned something about himself and his family, and through his journeys, he has matured in a new post-9/11 world.  Ultimately, the revelation at the end is bittersweet and that without the power of forgiveness, closure is incomplete.  It also speaks to a part of humanity that we all share.

B001BGTWQK|4.0|The company who produced these did a great job. The sound is great, they appear to have remastered the originals (never owned slayer's first four records on vinyl) and I hear all instruments clearly except for the bass--was it lombardo who played the bass? I can't hear him playing for the life of me. the guitars are life-like, and you can hear an exceptional drummer as well. The vocals are human (unlike on a cd) and it sounds like you're right there.<br />Love the different splashed blood and whatnot covers on these discs, so cool to see a bloody blade-looking thing spinning on my turntable.<br />One caveat is they give you this sheet of plastic to protect the vinyl. How about a real sleeve, fellas? You cannot put the disc into the sleeve, it's just a flat single piece of plastic. I guess you put the vinyl in between the lyric sheet and the plastic. Oh well, you can always buy sleeves for peanuts at record stores.<br />Cover art is excellently done and in no way murky or cheaply done.<br />Finally, this was my first experience with slayer's first four albums. Figured if I was gonna eventually get the big box set, might as well try the first four albums if I could get my hands on them. I had never heard these even on cd, and what immediately shocked me was how good this band was even in the olden days. Just from one objective listen, you can tell that slayer was a band full of potential and talent right from the get go.<br />Even from album one I understood why Rick Rubin wanted to work with them. Dumba**es listen to slayer and think they just do the same thing every time. Listen to Antichrist. Antichrist is such an amazing song. From song two on this record my jaw dropped to the floor. I literally couldn't believe what they were doing. The two lead guitarists unleash an attack on my eardrums that to this day stuns. I cannot imagine an audience hearing such rapid tempo changes, dexterity, and rapid note successions, when the only thing leading to that was a metallicatape (hit the lights) and king diamond. To hear how well they wrote songs even then, how well they composed melody, it is breathtaking.<br /><br />It's very cool to hear this band evolve, but I daresay they were more a complete creation from the get-go. Slayer was vikings in a ship come to pillage lands and win bars. They were damn good even when I couldn't have expected them to be (1983). You're missing out if all you know from slayer is reign in blood on. These first albums are essential as well.<br /><br />(I think slayer were more derived from motorhead and a little judas priest--and were perhaps lent speed by Iron Maiden--than metallica. metallica were solid writers as well (or at least dave mustaine was, while cliff burton actually knew what he was doing) but were never this good at playing their instruments (slayer's drummer kills he-who-shall-not-be-named).)

0792843584|5.0|The most important attempt to present a realistic portrayal of the founding of the American West in American cinema. Love it or leave it, a must see. Read against Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" [a novel] it makes perfect narrative sense. Sabotaged by the studios, denounced by the \\"critics\\", abhorred by the establishment press, see it and judge for yourself. Really could use a good DVD Blu-Ray, at its original length, which would allow the film to be seen as intended. Fat chance. The end of the director's career - for obvious reasons. Final scene: shoot her and abandon ship. No interest in inserting a \\"product link\\".

B00009W0U4|1.0|I'm always excited when movies have mostly 5 Star and 1 Star Reviews, this means it's either going to be great or horrible, in this case the latter wins. The movie attempts to be \\"Arthouse\\" but only achieves annoying. The infamous Rape scene is vulgar, the only good thing about it is, it eventually comes to an end. The Head Bash scene is almost too hard to see (I suppose that's a good thing too) and the rest of the film is anticlimactic. I'm sort of ashamed that I bought it.
1400095204|5.0|I am Nigerian. Yoruba.<br /><br />Having met Chimamanda at an event and heard her speak about how she almost went into a bout of depression after she finished writing this book, I was reluctant to read it till I was ready. So I picked it up a year and a half after I purchased it when I felt sufficiently detached, on purpose of course.<br /><br />But I can tell you that it got to a point in the book when I decided that every Nigerian needs to read this book, especially every Igbo person. I cannot recall the history books painting the same picture, at least not the history books we read in Western Nigeria. I was glad that I'd decided to read it but sad and ashamed that we'd gone through that as a country and are still having similar issues, even now, with tribalism, prejudice, religious divisions and such.<br /><br />Chimamanda doesn't write books with a happy ending. She is too much of a realist for that. And there'll always be a strong female character. The feminist in her. But she's still real because that character that you can see as the feminist in the story is not always victorious in the end.<br /><br />No matter how much you laugh all through the novel at some of the comedic moments, amidst the dark truths and hardship, you will walk away from this book with a renewed sense of some form of reality. As with all her books. Even when there's a happy ending, it's too realistic to have you jumping for joy.<br /><br />After you close the book, you'll have to sit still for a moment.

0307949486|2.0|While the writer may have been a good journalist, his story-telling skills were heavy with cliche and tired metaphors. The idea is good but the book rushed. He should have taken some time, maybe completed one more draft. I couldn't finish the series. This series is popular because the media told us it was. Stop listening to the media! Just because they (publisher) spends millions on the advertising campaign does not mean it's good.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is a movie that is humorous, exciting, inpsiring, dramatic, touching, and realistic--all at the same time. This story reflects real issues of real families and lets the characters be genuine. This makes a great movie for everyone: children, teenagers, young and old adults. I thought it was mainly written to speak to men and their duties in the home and family. But as a wife and mother, it shows me how I should be serious about my responsibilities to encourage and stay in tune with my husband and family.
B000WTBMBK|4.0|This CD is quite musical, if a little repetitive. It is not too intrusive so it will work for an ambient soundscape with listeners who might not expect to like (or tolerate) electronic music. Quite textural, rhythmic, and interesting enough for attentive listeners also.

B000YAA68W|5.0|This animated film is frequently funny, sometimes sad, and ultimately very moving.  It is critically acclaimed, and deservedly so.<br />The author clearly has a truly profound love of her homeland.<br /><br />The film is a coming-of-age story in which every aspect of the normal desires and aspirations of teenagers, and any kind of fun, chafe against the restrictions of a police state, with its utterly false morality, inumerable hypocrisies, and inevitable corruption. It is set aginst the backdrop of tumultuous events in Iran.  It need not be Iran.  It could be any dictatorship, any puritanical regime.<br /><br />The film relies on showing, rather than telling, to lead to understanding.<br />If you have ever tried to explain to teens-and-twenties-aged children why civil rights matter, why intolerance - and paricularly religious intolerance - is so dangerous, this film would be a good place to start.<br /><br />The predominant use of black and white, and the very spare style of illustration, is genius. The film is relatively short.  The dialogue is economical. Nothing is wasted. The imagery is so simple, and yet so clever.  The illutrations carry the story, in a far more economical and effective way than could ever be done with live actors on film.<br /><br />The out-of-tune singing of \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" is priceless.<br />(You can't buy advertising like that. Iron Maiden must rue the day they asked too much.)<br /><br />Finally, good on Catherine DeNeuve, Iggy Pop, and Kathleen Kennedy for being good sports and lending their talents and names to the production.  None of them could possibly have been paid anything like their usual pay for this work, but they did it all the same.  There are things that are important in life.
0316056863|4.0|In most celebrity memoirs, you will find that the celebrity had to rely on another writer to actually get the words on paper.  I doubt this is the case with Tina Fey's Bossypants, because unlike many other stars, she was a writer first and a celebrity second.  For better or for worse, Bossypants is her book.<br /><br />And for the most part, it's the better.  A more-or-less autobiography (for the sake of humor, some stuff is undoubtedly fictional), Bossypants is told in Fey's \\"Liz Lemon\\" voice:  the one that's self-deprecating without being self-hating, depicting herself as less clever and attractive than she is.  There are, however, points in the book which show an assertive side that Lemon would never have.<br /><br />If you're a fan of 30 Rock, you should enjoy this book.  If you hate 30 Rock, you should probably avoid it.  If you haven't watched 30 Rock, take a chance with this book; it's a fast read that is likely to make you laugh.

B004T4KQJS|1.0|[[ASIN:0199753814 Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness]]<br /><br />\\"Nothingness\\" is not something. Nothingness is the default reality of the material world (\\"world\\" meaning \\"everything\\"). Without human consciousness, nothing really exists in the material sense of \\"existence.\\"<br /><br />That is a fact demonstrated early in the 20th century by physicist Niels Bohr in his earliest discoveries of quantum mechanics.  And quantum mechanical reality has ultimately been proven absolute by Bell's Theorem and his followers in the last quarter of the 20th century. Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental and most proven scientific theory. And quantum mechanics proves \\"nothingness\\" is the necessary default position without the involvement of human consciousness. There is no material \\"anything\\" without human consciousness.<br /><br />The proponents of this book seek to ignore such necessary, proven scientific reality. Either that or they are simply ignorant. Writing a book on such a topic as \\"A Universe From Nothing\\" and not understanding the necessities of quantum mechanics is inexcusably lazy, if not intentionally disingenuous. I contend the latter is the case.<br /><br />In fact, quantum mechanics has demonstrated for almost a century that when material \\"things\\" are placed in superposition experiments, that those same \\"things\\" become \\"nothing,\\" at least by materialist standards. There is no \\"thing\\" to measure. Instead there is simply a mathematical potential for its material existence. But mathematical potentials are simply numerical concepts, not a material \\"thing.\\"  Mathematical concepts require human consciousness to even matter.  Otherwise, \\"nothing\\" knows nothing about mathematical potentialities.<br /><br />Yet without human consciousness to \\"collapse\\" the superposition of any \\"unobserved thing\\" into the \\"material thing,\\" that formerly material \\"thing\\" (an electron, atom or even macro-molecule) is non-existent! And quantum mechanics insists and requires that this is true not only with small \\"things\\" but large things as well.  Large things like your cat, or your car, your house, or the earth, the sun, or even the universe. The universe is absolute nothingness in the material sense until its unobserved superposition has been collapsed by human consciousness.<br /><br />Einstein wasn't being funny, but angry, as he addressed this issue when he said, \\"I like to think that the moon is really there, even when I'm not looking at it.\\"  He understood even then that quantum mechanics requires, in fact, that the moon is not \\"there\\" if it is not being observed by human consciousness.  And by \\"not there\\" he means \\"it has no material existence.\\"  To complete the definition of terms, \\"material\\" means \\"matter, energy and the products of their interaction.\\" (Einstein also said \\"I've thought 100 times more about quantum mechanics than general relativity.\\")<br /><br />So Einstein hated the fact that quantum mechanics required that there is no moon, or anything else, when it is not being observed by human consciousness.  This reality is what changed his paradigm from materialist/atheist to a small \\"d\\" deist. Einstein was forced by quantum mechanical necessity to further accept the absolute necessity of a first-cause \\"Consciousness\\" which transcended human consciousness.<br /><br />Without consciousness nothing exists. That's not my opinion, it is the absolute reality and necessity of quantum mechanics.  If that were not true, you couldn't be reading what I've been typing here on Amazon; and I couldn't have typed on Amazon either. The devices you and I are both working with right now only operate if that same applied quantum mechanical reality exists and functions in practical, experimentally certain ways.<br /><br />Since we know for sure that this reality of quantum mechanics is true, then the rest of the gobbledygook in \\"A Universe From Nothing\\" is just as erroneous as the notion that \\"nothing\\" is \\"something.\\"  Either that or its author, and forward writer Richard Dawkins, have never studied, or at least understood, the realities of quantum mechanics.  They, along with the rest of today's tenured scientists, have been instructed to not worry about how quantum mechanics actually works. Instead since their days in grad school they've been instructed to simply \\"shut up and calculate.\\"<br /><br />Nothingness is more prevalent than you can imagine; it is ubiquitous and universal.  Without human consciousness there is indeed \\"nothing\\" in the materialist paradigm of \\"material.\\"  That includes this universe and however many infinite universes hardened atheists like Dawkins, his fellow horsemen and their Worm-tail-minions would like to postulate.<br /><br />As an edit I've inserted the link for the essential book \\"The Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness\\" by Rosenblum and Kuttner.  I didn't invoke this source initially to see how many ad hominem attacks of my post would be posted. Dr. Krauss' and many others make my point.<br /><br />They can take their arguments to Drs. Kuttner and Rosenblum, as well as Nobel Laureate Charles Townes, who endorses their amazing book.<br /><br />If you don't agree with my review, read Quantum Enigma first and then reply.hor, and forward writer Richard Dawkins, have never studied, or at least understood, the realities of quantum mechanics.

B000002GYR|5.0|I just heard this album for the first time, and I'd give it ten stars if I could.  If you have at least one ounce of romance in your body you have to love it.  It breaks your heart.

031618201X|5.0|I hadn't read the Parasol Protectorate series before I heard it was turning into a manga. I came upon it by accident while looking on the Yen Press website. I thought the cover was lovely and the story sounded very interesting (I hadn't ready anything about a soulless person) so I decided to catch up on the series before the manga arrived. May I say that was the best descion of my life! The Parasol Protectorate series is one of the best series I've ever read, a brilliant mix of steampunk, mystery, and romance.<br /><br />so after reading the first four books I was looking forward to the manga version of soulless and I can say for me I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Rem drew the characters gorgeously, some came out as I pictured while others looked nothing close to what I expected but they were still fantastic. Some scenes from the novel were cut, like Alexia's outing with MacDougal and the wedding was shortened. One scene that I particularly liked was when Alexia was trapped with Conall and she grabbed a certain part of his male anatomy, that was (unsurprisingly) cut from the manga as well but I didn't mind this at all. The carriage scene was kept (to my surprise) and was edited to be not too revealing but was still a very passionate scene.<br /><br />All in all it was a wonderful manga adaptation, you might have to have read the original manga to grasp everything but even if you haven't it should still be enjoyable. I'm looking forward to Volume 2 and beyond.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded on good reviews. Not sorry I did. Great app. Clear, great smooth movement of cards. Highly recommend. Love that you can change the look of the cards.
B0055SWM08|3.0|if you are bored its a ok game. other than that I wouldn't play it. it worked well on kindle fire!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really fun I love it so much I play everyday and get so many points. I would reccomend to takers.
B004FOA84A|3.0|this game is ok. One part does not work at all. I even looked up help on it.  It didn't help.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|So many great reviews here so I won't repeat all that, ditto to it all!  I'll just add that Adele is such a true and natural talent, the likes of which we haven't seen for a long time.  She needs no gimmicks, only her beautiful and emotional voice, a microphone, and her songs.  I love her down-to-earth, honest personality, and her audience identifies with that.  There is no pretense, and she doesn't copy anyone else either in song or in how she dresses.  She doesn't aspire to be a \\"skinny-mini\\" as she puts it.  She is so completely refreshing as an artist, and these are among the many reasons her fans simply adore her, me included.  But above all, it's about that glorious voice!  While Adele doesn't sound at all like the late Eva Cassidy, she is the first singer since Eva to pack so much beauty and raw emotion into her interpretation of a song, and she makes us feel that raw emotion.  This concert DVD is wonderful and I certainly wouldn't nit-pick with any of the production values.  I was mesmerized beginning to end and saw nothing to really criticize in that regard.  This concert is a complete treat and an absolute must-have for any fan of Adele.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I really wasnt sure about Nicholas Sparks books because I had never read anything he had written before. I wound up enthralled in The Lucky One because it was well written and entertaining, but I was left wanting more for the ending. Sorry to say I was a little disappointed with the conclusion. I wish he would have just come up with a more elaborate ending. I really did love the book though, so I will probably read it again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Played a few of the games and it is a good source of entertainment.<br /><br />FUN!  Great value - FREE!!!  What more could anyone ask for?
0439023513|4.0|First off, I would like to say that I really did not know what to rate this book as. I have a lot of mixed emotions for this book.<br />BEWARE! THIS REVIEW IS GONNA HAVE SPOILER ALERTS!!!!!!<br />Okay, I am gonna write a little bit of what I thought about each book in this series...<br /><br />Hunger Games: Violent, yet a great book. After I finished it, I nearly went insane with anticipation for the next book. My favorite characters were Katniss, Rue, and Gale (even though Gale had a somewhat minor part in the first book.) I am sorry, and I knew as I was reading this that it was going to have an effect on what I thought of the books later on in the series, but I had a grudge against Peeta. I think it was because that I liked the character Gale more than him.<br /><br />Catching Fire: Honestly, I thought that the fact that Katniss was pulled into the Hunger Games again was a bit to predictable. It was a great setup for the next book, though. One of the problems I had with this book was that I wasn't sucked into this book like I was with the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Mockingjay: Okay... well, I finished this book about an hour ago, and I am still trying to understand what I just read. While I was reading this book, I couldn't decide who Katniss was going to choose; Peeta or Gale. I thought it might be Peeta, since that is who the author was trying to get us to like, and also that Katniss kept holding onto the pearl that Peeta had given her in Catching Fire. But I thought that maybe it could be Gale, since he had been talking about how he would never be able to compete with Peeta. After reading the end, I was already unhappy that Katniss chose Peeta, but I noticed another problem that disturbed me. Near the end, Katniss just assumed that on his mission in District 2, Gale had met another girl and moved on. I seemed almost mean... and the worst part was that at the end of the book, you didn't even know if Gale was still alive! It didn't say anything about him.<br />Thelast thing negative I want to say about Mockingjay was that it threw way to many new characters at you at once. I can't even remember what Plutarch was supposed to look like.<br />Okay, now onto the positive things about it. Despite the things I didn't like about this story, it was beautifully written. Prim's death made the book all the better (don't get me wrong, I really liked Prim, it was just that it was so unfortunate and moving, my eyes are tearing up as I write this). I couldn't put this book down, no matter what.<br />What really sticks in my head is the last paragraph of the book, when Katniss is talking about her children;<br />\\"I'll tell them how I survive it. I'll tell them that on bad mornings, it feels impossible to take pleasure in anything because I'm afraid it could be taken away. That's when I make a list in my head of every act of goodness I've seen someone do. It's like a game. Repetitive. Even a little tedious after more than twenty years.<br />But there are much worse games to play.\\"<br /><br />I don't understand exactly what it is talking about, but never the less, the words were gripping. It makes me repsect Susan Collins as an author.<br /><br />What is really odd is that as I am writing this, I am beginning to respect this book, and accept the ending that I was not very fond of. Instead of giving this book a three, I think I'll give a four. Doesn't that sound fair to you?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great game with many different options and great graphics. Runs smoothly on my asus transformer tab. I find it highly entertaining. The only ads that other people seem to find annoying are on the first page and are of other games G5 entertainment makes. I don't find the ads to be bothersome nor do they detract from gameplay.
B004I744AS|2.0|Its a good app I dont like how it doent have all the words I want. DONT GET THIS APP no wonder its free.
B004WOJ7C2|5.0|This was the best album of 2011. Every song rocks! Get the 2 cd set the songs on disc two make the cd complete.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|\\"Keep us.<br /><br />\\"Guide us.<br /><br />\\"Till the end of time.\\"<br /><br />These words come whispered, hushed, at a key moment in Terrence Malick's \\"The Tree of Life\\"; we hear these words spoken as the universe itself flickers into oblivion. Clearly these words are the words of prayer, but they sound not like the prayer of petitioning but rather more meditative, as if the speaker already believes in everything sacred, as if the spirit voicing these thoughts already knows that guidance is given, eternally.<br /><br />For those without the imagination or faith to embrace such a moment, Malick's film will be tedious, meaningless, perhaps even infuriating. For anyone, though, with even a shred of religious feeling, \\"The Tree of Life\\" could stand as one of the greatest films ever made. Yet it requires no dogma, no denomination; if you haven't set foot in church in twenty years, still it will move you if you allow it.<br /><br />Malick has done many fine things with this movie, which is so unlike any sort of traditional Hollywood film that it's hard to believe it got made. It's almost impossible to find a comparison, though one does come to mind: Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" For \\"Tree,\\" Malick coaxed \\"2001\\" special effects genius Douglas Trumbull out of retirement. The scenes of the universe, and of life developing on Earth, are so stunning and beautiful they will bring tears ... and will remind the careful viewer of the visuals Trumbull helped create for Kubrick.<br /><br />Yet while Kubrick's prime concern in \\"2001\\" was the human intellect, Malick's is the human soul. I am not one of the people who find Kubrick cold; I think his films inspire awe, but I have to agree that Malick has a different tilt.<br /><br />Put simply, the plot description seems so mundane: A boy remembers growing up in the 1950s as his father struggled to make a mark for himself and his mother struggled to emphasize to her sons that \\"making a living\\" isn't nearly as important as ... LIVING. Yet Malick has placed this simple story in such a grand frame that it becomes much more than just the story of a few individuals. The conflict between cruel nature and the state of grace ends up applying to everything in creation. Water and rock, earth and sky, creatures ranging from dinosaur to human ... All is in motion, and nature and grace are at work constantly.<br /><br />This is a superb, searching film that dares delve into the very bedrock of existence. Certainly it asks more questions than it answers, but great art does that.. LIVING.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|the lack of themes made me to move on ,smartkeyboard is less boring ! otherwise the suggestion and the fact that it can inport your sms history is unique.
B005IGDW24|4.0|I picked this movie up during an initial buying frenzy right after I bought a 3D blu ray player.  When I originally watched the movie, I thought it was cute and kinda fun so I took a shot with the 3D version.  Glad I did...the added depth did a lot for this film.  The 3D effect really brought the Smurfs to life and showed off the streets of Manhattan perfectly.  There were lots of nice 3D effects especially towards the end of the film.  Popouts were mostly at a minimum which is fine by me...3D can get gimmicky real fast.  Curiously, sometimes the humans seemed a bit cardboard cut-out but they really are there in service of the cute little blue guys (and gal).  That said, I still loved Neil Patrick Harris, Sofia Vergara from Modern Family and even the germ freak from Glee. I think Hank Azaria was GREAT as Gargamel....is there anything he can't do?!  Although this won't be the 3D movie you pop in to impress the 3D virgins (get Polar Express for that....TRUST ME), this movie will put you in a good mood....with an assist from a few glasses of your favorite cocktail :)

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it keeps me busy when I'm bored. And I get bored a lot so it's great for me. I would recommend this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you need to unlock most of the games by playing the ones that are unlocked. the games are basic but its a fun way to pass time
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted to this game!  Love that you can actually win more times than not.  Good break from solitare. Try it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best Book I have read since twilight.. Katniss has 20 times the strength to me then bella did.. Peeta is awesome, love his character and everything he stood for.. These books are such a moment or scene of our past but due to the way of life and resources now, they could be our future too.. They are a must read for anyone who enjoys Twilight, Harry Potter or any other such series. These books really make you think about possiblites and a way of life that may come one day. You need to read these books there really is nothing like them. Mia
0316098329|3.0|This was a book selected by a book club I belong to; otherwise I'm not sure I would ever have heard of it!  I thought it was quite extraordinary and well-written (the author's ability to write from the perspective of a five-year-old is nothing short of amazing), although I found the subject matter difficult & gave it a 3-star rating only because it's not a light read even though it is a short book.  I don't know how to categorize the book:  maybe as an exercise in social awareness.  It is worth reading but will not leave a reader feeling fulfilled because it is very apparent that the true ending will be a long time in coming.
0439023483|4.0|The only thing I have to add is this is definitely \\"not\\" a contribution to the thoughtful genre of dystopian sci-fi.  But it's a fun read.  It's like vampires for Twilight - it's using the genre to tell a tale but little else.<br /><br />And that's fine so long as you let it be what it is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game iz fun but it iz some things dat I don't get like y all da games aren't unlocked dat iz jus dumb but it Ix fun u should get it
0307269752|3.0|I'm only half way through the book, and at first I liked it: I thought the mystery was interesting, it was suspenseful. But as I continued, I got confused with all the characters who are basically dull, they seem to be there only to make the murderer more difficult to suss out. The writing (or the translation at least) was actually kind of terrible, although it may not be the author's fault. There were descriptions that hardly needed to be there, and tons of horrible cliches. I'm not sure why, but at first I thought they were almost a sarcastic thing? I just hardly thought that a book with such good reviews had such awful writing. However I am still interested in the mystery, perhaps only because it's \\"shocking\\", as others put it. I started reading this book because I wanted to see the movie, but I always like to read the book first. At this point I think I'd still watch the movie, the book seems like it was written for just that purpose. All the suspense & mystery of the plot, and none of the plain bad writing that fills up the rest of the book. Overall, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was disappointing with really no good things going for it except the plot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is probaly the best app I downloaded on my kindle fire.it has easy games on it too.and there even is a cool sushi one aaaaawwwwwsssssooopmmmmmmeeeee!

B00004ST9Q|1.0|The tragic loss of Whitney caused me to go on line and quickly order as much of her music as I could in one album.  In my hurry I missed that this was a remix, not just a remix but a horrible remix.  All those gorgeous iconic songs were drowned out by a mind numbing beat and synthesized overshadowing of her beautiful voice.  Save your money and spend the time looking for the original sounds. If updating means destroying, they succeeded.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I have seen this movie before and simply wanted to own it.<br />When this product came in the mail, the DVD Case as well as the DVD has a Title of INCEPTION/ORIGINE.<br />I was very confused and was afraid I got a Non-English version or something?<br />I put in the DVD and it played fine and was in English. No issues there.<br />I just printed out a different cover photo I found online, and put it in the DVD Sleeve.
B004C5M282|5.0|Wonderful. Energizing. Amazing. This band will take over the US and rock it for years. Give them a listen. They truly are amazing...
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I love this movie. It truly is a favorite of mine. My daughter can't get enough of it. Had to play it over and over again.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|OMG, I have read several 1star reviews and totally disagree with them. My question is did they ask the child they took to the movies did they like it. I just asked my grandaughter and she said she would give it 6 stars. What people need to realize these movies r for children or the child in us. I thought the movie was going 2 b boring, but I did enjoy it.  I would not give it a 5 but a 4 is still pretty good. Also children think and see things differently than adults.  Good movie in all.
B005ZUR724|4.0|game is great to pass the time at WORK/lunch. graphics are good and game play is simple enough. alot of content so the game lasts.
B005V20JKI|5.0|While the wifi LAN feature has some minor issues with registration and packet loss from time to time... It HAS WIFI LAN. It's AWESOME! Super fun game, especially when my wife and I are going to bed. It's a great alternative to reading. :)
068484267X|2.0|This book is overrated and makes me wonder how McCourt got all those glowing reviews. My book club read this and most of us gave it less than one star. \\"Disappointing\\" was the word I heard the most as we discussed it. It was very hard to get through as far as I am concerned. The writing is not that great and it is boring and repetitive. All I could think was \\"When will this be over and when can I get through this so I can go on to a good book?\\" I got my copy from the library and couldn't get it back there fast enough.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I found The Forever Girl a completely satisfying read.<br /><br />Rebecca's style of writing suits my reading rhythm perfectly. The story itself is excellent, and grabbed and maintained my attention right from Chapter One.<br /><br />The characters have depth and interest and the locations are well-pictured and fully engaging.<br /><br />As a novelist myself, I am a teeny bit jealous that I haven't written this! ;-)<br /><br />I am so relieved I followed my instincts and bought this book. It won't disappoint.

B000LPS4BG|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />They didn't put a whole lot of money or effort into this Blu-Ray release of \\"Goodfellas\\".  First off, the video aspect ratio was 1.85:1, instead of being 2.35:1, but I don't know if that is a limitation of the film.  Second, there was no DTS-HD Master Audio or Dobly TrueHD; just Dolby Digital 5.1.<br /><br />The video quality was not real great.  I didn't notice any grain at all, but the picture just wasn't that impressive.  But, it was still okay to watch (it wasn't bad enough to be distracting). I give it about an 8.0 to 8.5 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />The audio was very good, but there wasn't much sound from the surround speakers.  But, there was good left / right separation.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie, which lasted about 2 hours and 21 minutes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|l love. love love it I like it a lot this game is very fun. I love this game a lot
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Although not the last album released, this was the last one recorded by The Beatles.  And, it captured them near their peak.  Although maybe not quite as good as Rubber Soul or Sgt. Pepper, it was still one of the ten best albums in modern pop music history.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like having the book & verse on page when reading, especially w/long chapters. Getting to another book or verse is also easy, touch bar at top & off you go. Great selection of Bible versions, study plans & easy to navigate. You tailor this app to what you want. Down side : some verses repeat in itself (Gen 35:1, among others) . Up side : works great on KF.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|This is a great album that's simply a musical galvanization of both th film and book versions of \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" Each track is distinct and interesting in its own right. From the ballads to.the.upbeat tunes, there's nothing not to love.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I did not expect to have ads on a paid app. If it was not for the ads it would probably be a 5 star.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|There is only really one word that comes to mind when I think about this movie: WOW!!! This movie will leave the viewer knowing what a true FATHER is, and what it really means to be truly DEDICATED to his/her Heavenly Father and family. This movie, without hesitation, can be summed up as being POWERFUL!!<br /> I would not take young kids to this movie...but with proper parental supervision, I think jr high school level kids can handle this movie. There is some violence, but no sex, nudity or fowl language.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got this as faotd a few days ago.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.  Background music is ok and can be turned off.  Working through quest mode.  The levels I'be done so far are not overly challenging, but they are increasing in difficultly as I move on.  Fun app if you like mahjong.
B005VGMYZM|5.0|Andre Rieu and his orchestra give an EXCELLENT<br />performance where ever they present a program.<br />He is a collectors dream.  In my opinion this<br />team gets better with each performance.  Well<br />worth the time, effort and the money to collect.
B0059XTTXC|4.0|This was a strange experience for me. I adore [[ASIN:B005DXCO94 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]], the 1979 mini-series. I dreaded the idea of a remake when I first heard of its production, then grew to be generally excited when I heard about the strength of the cast. I really looked forward to its theatrical release and went as soon as it showed in my city.<br /><br />The production is superb. I have seen very few modern movies that have taken such extreme care in a period piece. The details are exquisite and flawless. It even looks as if the film they used to film the movie was from the late 70's to early 80's. I grew up then, and the time-line details gave it a very authentic and reminiscent feel.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch. Gary Oldman is one of the great character actors of our time. Colin Firth is entirely in his element as the upper crusty snob. John Hurt has been playing great bad leaders since his performance as Caligula in [[ASIN:B006JY3OHW I, Claudius]]. However, the best performance in this film was from Benedict Cumberbatch, who has recently wowed everyone with his revolutionary performance as [[ASIN:B004132I20 Sherlock: Season One [Blu-ray]]]. His performance is perfectly understated and riviting, he steals the show and hold the production together.<br /><br />This is a perfectly competent rendition of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. It captures the essence of Le Carre's novel. The actors do a splendid job. But there is something that just falls flat about it. And I would probably think higher of it, were it not for the previous adaptation. If you've never seen the previous adaptation, you will enjoy this production more. I'm absolutely certain of that.<br /><br />If your an invested fan of the original production or the book it will be impossible to not draw comparisons between the two adaptations. Its rare that a television mini-series can trump a film. However, all that makes this current adaptation good, was already done in the original. No actor could equal Sir Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley. That version looks like it was filmed in the late 70's as well, because it was.. And it has an equally competent supporting cast, including the great Ian Richardson.<br /><br />I'm all for each generation re-interpreting great works for themselves and adding their new voice to it. But thats what falls flat here, there is nothing essentially new added to this production. It is simply a remake - not a new rendering or interpretation. This production is drafting off of the greatness of the first. By all means watch it if you've never seen either version or if your a fan of the original. Its not bad, its rather good and worth viewing, but it is not great.ould equal Sir Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley.

B004529NKC|3.0|I can't say I hated this movie, but I don't love it either.. I guess it falls into the guilty pleasures category. The story, if you want to say it really had one, was really bland, bad & str8 out of an 80's throw back break dancing movie a la Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo meets an abc after school special. The acting was simplistic, unbelievable and corny.. and it's very hard to believe that with all that dancing, there's not one gay character... I mean, c'mon guys, know your demographics when making a movie such as this.. Because it was so Str8 laced and wholesome, I don't get the PG-13 rating on this one; there's no sex, no harsh language or violence, no sexual controversy which could upset anal retentive conservatives, no substance abuse. It's a mild PG at best... This film was a TV movie at best.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's not bad, cheesy though XD It's good for what it's made for; mindless entertainment. The worst part is my terrible reaction time XD
B000002GWN|4.0|this is a great album live joni backed with tom scott and the LA express. What more could you ask for. She as always demonstrates her wonderful voice and some of the arrangements are very interesting showing what a great singer can do when they are backed with a great band!

B0067Q42BY|5.0|A lot od thought was put into the production of this game, as it really caters to please the gamer with a multitude of (amazing) options. I love the various modes to choose from but I would have to say the quest, by far, has been my favorite. Specifically, each mission provides you with a puzzle piece (consisting of several smaller puzzles within a large one) which means you probably wont get through in a weekend which is good too:) Oh, and if you do well with a specific game you will get a little medal, which is totally awesome too! I also love the comc book style stories that accompany each mission and the ever changing tile designs keep it fresh. The music is also very relaxing and one of the MANY great aspects of this game.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book was for a younger crowd.  I had seen several recommendations for this book, but I didn't gush over it the way other people did.  I don't really have anything bad to say about it other than it's for a younger generation.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it all the time. it's especially helpful to keep an up-to-date list between my wife and me (like our grocery list).
B0052U59F4|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this series!  Christian is absolutely fabulous.  I love how his tortured past shaped him into the man he is now. Touching...that is the one word I could use to describe this book and series.  I laughed, cried, got pissed and swooned throughout reading.  AMAZING!
