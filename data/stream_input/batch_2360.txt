B009H2PC46|5.0|Brian Eno continues to mine the sonic landscapes of ambient music - a field he more or less singlehandedly created back in the 1970s.  His tonal palate continues to evolve but his ability to assemble tracks that are always interesting yet do not insist on active listening has not faded.
B008602KQI|5.0|Second time re-watching it! Still original and memorable and fun to watch. It is truly an inspirational one.<br /><br />Can't get enough of it ... So good(The Hunger Games)!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Product arreved on time and works like a champ! I have a smaller but a high quality ONKYO stereo system that fits nicely in my living space. Buyin a sound bar or a new receiver/amp is not practical for me. It would take too much realestate and cost too much. FiiO D3 converted optical out from my new 55&#34; LED to an analog input that my ONKYO reproduces into a great sound. No humming, just GREAT!&#34;
B000GOSVEW|5.0|Classic John Travolta as a [sorta] bad guy.  He's just great at that.<br />Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman are great as well.  The story line is interesting, there are unexpected twists, and fantastic action/explosion scenes.<br />Highly recommend!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is a CLASSIC. Read it many years ago and enjoyed reading it just as much this time. Great story and great characters

B00AB7HESI|1.0|I bought this game at 1:30 this morning. It is now 11:30 same morning and it is STILL downloading. It has been stuck at 91% for twenty minutes now. I just read some reviews and feel like my patience will go unrewarded.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Friends recommended for my husband and I to try out the series.  We both love it!  Even my husband admits that he didn't expect much, but enjoys watching it with me.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|I have to add this to my list of all-time favorite movies.  I loved it.  And of course, Paul Newman...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. My kids also like how real the horses look and act. Keep up the good work.
B000MDDSB8|4.0|I liked that it tied into history and the special effects however the story seemed unfinished at the end and would have liked either they finished it up there or a sequal
B003B02O3C|5.0|A compelling read with copious amounts of behind-the-scenes intrigue and discovery. The details Grisham brings to the reader makes this work highly entertaining and believable. I especially enjoyed the details about downtown Memphis, the various other venues where the drama unfolds and the deviousness of certain &#34;big business&#34; interests and the attorneys who defend and stonewall the ongoing court case. Illuminating and very riveting.
B008602KQI|3.0|Another dystopia/sports film, teenage-style.  Similar to Rollerball and The Running Man, crossed with the Shirley Jackson story &#34;The Lottery,&#34; it offers nothing new.  It's full of images of the heroine's pure face nobly coping with an unfair world and ultimately prevailing over its dark and overwhelming forces.  More simply, teenager good, world bad--hardly anything new.  Woody Harrelson was the best thing in it.  Donald Sutherland is horrible as the overarching villain.  It was okay.  I watched it to the end, but it didn't inspire me to pick up the book.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Great  success quality for my kindle I am just stuff I bought it. Then I download on kindle. I studded loved this story behind me back to by childhood.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|I suppose if you were a fan of Matthew McConaughey you might like this flick, but I got tired of him mugging his good looks for the camera during a blase plot involving improbable characters.  I couldn't wait for the end, and shut it off just past the halfway mark, and haven't felt compelled to see the conclusion.  Pure tripe.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's fine in my kindle it did up huge on the key load. Does the job works great. I almost always use a calculator in my devices
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Started watching Downton Abbey with Season 1.  Have watched all the seasons so far in about two weeks!  GREAT show.  Hope they make a LOT more of them!!
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I like stories based in an older time setting and it was something different to watch for a change. Overall good
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My four year old grandson wanted me to buy this and he has loved it. He is already on level 35 after only a few hours. I had to make him go outside. I can see how kids would quit doind physical exercise for a game  like this. We are thoroughly enjoying this.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We bought this for our oldest daughter.  She loves these movies.  Description was accurate and she was super excited when we gave them to her for her birthday.  Thank you so much!!!!

B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I love this movie.  It was painful from start to finish in its loving attention to the progression through adulthood with our aging bodies and marriages coupled with our teenage spirits and inner youthfulness.  So relatable.  And of course you aren't expecting this to be a clean family friendly movie- right?  Very funny.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't normally read Stephen King, but felt the need to read this one. I absolutely loved it. It kept my attention from the first page.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Such a fantastic read! Great for young adults and old adults. I couldn't put it down, such a great adventure.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Very Funny Movie, and it could not be more true. Charlies Theron is great in this part she does an excellent job
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love this game!  Give you many levels and never boring and can be addictive!  I love that the scenes change and is challanging to your mind. Great game overall!
B003VANOFY|5.0|The Logitech G930 tops the Corsair in these areaS:<br /><br />1. Price: This item is cheaper.<br />2. Quality of build: Solid build<br />3. Features: You can have fun with the voice modulator<br />4. Ease of install: A true Plug and play, when I had G930 turned on, the other speakers turned off through the software.<br />5. Software: It comes with a disk!<br /><br />And these are just a few.  I've always use headsets for gaming and these are my favorite.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I suppose I am cussed and as everyone seemed to rate this book I was rather inclined to find it - well not a good read.  Of course I was utterly wrong and you have to admire and be amazed that Martel could make such an incredible story credible.  So glad I read it and oddly found the film pretty damned good as well.<br />Bravo
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I enjoy her music a lot. I just put on this cd and I just enjoy how gifted she is. I love her movie star looks. I think she should do movies too. I just think her talent is just above all the most amazing thing about her. Love her music.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have purchased all the music she has offered and I love her choice of songs. Keep the music coming.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Appreciate the candid insights into the world of technology.  Having 20 years plus experience in the same field, after reading this book, there are definitely things I should have done differently.
1439102813|4.0|The subject of Alzheimer's is difficult to read as I have experienced it with my own mother. However, telling the story from the point of view of Alice was interesting, getting into her thoughts and watching the progression of the early onset variety of this devastating disease.
B001NLKT60|4.0|The excitement starts early in book 2 and doesn't let up until the mystery is solved and a sufficient amount of bad gyms are dead. Larsson does a good job of creating detailed and intricate back stories for his characters, although sometimes maybe a little too much so. Overall, a good book. Good enough that I was excited to keep on reading and did not want to put the story down, but not so great that I was sad when it ended.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|The makers of Family Guy can't do any wrong. Great movie, great actors, and super funny slapstick humor!!!! The fight in the hotel...funniest part ever!!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|Kept reading out easily. Another great book in the series. Continue on! It is worth it if thou read it.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|The movie is really in short a highlight of several cirque de soleil acts from various Vegas shows. The storyline is an acceptable but probably poorly done. However I understand the ultimate goal is to advertise for those Vegas shows, which in that respect succeeds. Done in 3D with some of the best talents, shot and directed very well otherwise. The package is the total package, you get 3d blu ray, DVD, Blu ray, iTunes and vudu/digital. If you are lookin to reminisce of the Vegas shows or want an introduction to the shows, awesome, you will love it. If you are looking for a movie with a storyline, you will be disappointed.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Never have I used a headphone amp before but this is a godsend for my little upstairs apartment bedroom studio.  My wife and I now play into the wee hours of the morning with only our voices breaching the silence!<br /><br />Two qualms I have so far:<br /><br />- No off button.  I don't like to leave equipment running and I usually make the rounds of shutting everything off and I just can't with this device.  I have been turning off the strip that it's plugged into but it makes me nervous even though I know what's plugged in.  A minor problem I suppose but still would be nice.<br /><br />- The device is just not heavy enough and all the cords plugged in really make it quite difficult to find a nice useful place for it to sit.  I wanted it more accessible and thus on my desk or on a stack but the cords tip it over.  The best place I've found is less reachable but keeps the cords from tipping it over.  A wider build or just some weights to counter balance the cords would've been nice.<br /><br />- One other completely and utterly minor thing, aesthetically and functionally I would've liked the power connector on the opposite  side of the 1/4&#34; jacks.  It just feels weird and cluttered.  As I said this is just a weird minor quibble of mine.<br /><br />Honestly the device is great, works extraordinarily well. I haven't pushed it beyond 3 headphones so YMMV going to the max of 4.  Make sure to get a super short TRS cable for the input!
B000021YQV|4.0|\\"Toxicity,\\" System of a Down's second album, remains their best effort. They mashed together thrash metal and melodic hard rock (yes, I said that seriously) to the point that Serj Tankian, could jump from his harsh shouting to the tuneful but complex \\"Aerials.\\" Guitarist Daron Malakian even picks up an acoustic for \\"Chop Suey!\\" And like brothers in arms Rage Against The Machine, System of a Down weren't afraid of taking on political rocking, as in the CD's opening \\"Prison Song.\\" At the same time, there's a weird sense of humor, like in \\"Bounce,\\" where the bans seems to be taking a whiz at their own brand of metal, or using a flute in \\"Science.\\"<br /><br />It helped that a producer like Rick Rubin could come in and make order out of chaos, much like he did with Slayer's best albums. He's one of the few producers who can take bands that make music as jagged as SOAD create and stitch it into a complete and coherent album. When this kind of sound was all the rage in 2001 (think Korn, Rage and Deftones), \\"Toxicity\\" was the album that stood above the crowd in terms of sheer originality and stylistic verve.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This one is a hit with the children. I get motion sickness just watching them play this game. I never like these kind of games at places like Dave&Buster and Chuckie Cheese.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good, entertaining, read that is easy to pick up and put down and pick back up again. Enjoyable \\"read when ou can\\" kind of book
B00BLGY8X2|5.0|I loved this movie. It's visually amazing. However, it pretty much makes no sense, so if that bothers you, you may hate it.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I did not enjoy one bit of this movie. It was a sad story that was drawn out and the singing was terrible. It reminded me of Sweeney Todd, and it even had some of the same people acting like the same characters!
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I bought this to replace the original one that came with the 2gb mSDHC chip that I bought a couple years ago.<br />PROs:<br />I'm still using an old phone with a *cough* removable microSDHC chip instead of a smart phone. Having this handy card reader on my key chain makes accessing the chip from the phone simple and convenient. With it, you can copy the pics and video from the chip/phone to a PC quickly AND use the chip as a thumb-drive in a pinch. Nice, handy little gizmo.<br />CONS:<br />A bit cheap in construction because it doesn't have any way to cover the outside teeth/prongs when not in use. The original one had a cover that slid over the teeth/prongs but to replace it I would have to buy a new chip that had the reader included as a bonus, which would have been a waste of money.<br />All-in-all, I'm happy.

B0090P98Z4|4.0|It is too costly to play this game one a person gets to a certain point because then they have to pay
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Cute and funny. Good for adults and kids. Some of the voices are really good. A bit corny but the storyline is clever enough that it doesn't matter. Enjoy!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I've tried several players and this one worked the best, great user interface, and the price is right. . .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE these games.  I find that I run my batteries down playing them.  I highly recommend it.  It is with the cost.  Just keep a charger handy.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|The audio ran ahead of the video an a Power Point I converted to MP4. The Video ran fin on other applications.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This CALCULATOR does math correctly and is simple.  Works and looks great on my kindle fire and my HTC phone.  Nothing crazy just a regular well functioning CALCULATOR. Yay!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This works great but it seems to start over with the same mp3 each time the vehicle starts up. Suggest you create 99 directories in vFat 32 (dos) and place 200 mp3's in each, then change directories at start up
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very entertaining with great characters. Love the way Mrs. Florrick is drawn to her old flame when her husband cheats on her. Her decisions are made throughout society on many levels with many lives. When things go bump in our love lives we tend to revert back to past relationships and the emotions that endear.<br /><br />Combine this emotional rollercoaster with some great storylines and court cases and this is one very good series that I am enjoying.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|wish these types of games were available without the wifi.  there are times when i just want to play and i am not competing with others.  it is downloaded to kindle.  why does it have to have internet connection?

B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game. I and my grandchildren have hours of fun.  I just wish the game had more levels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the actors that play the characters so well.  I feel I get to know them personally and I cannot wait to see what happens next.<br />I enjoy the period costumes,the beautiful scenery, and the castle.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Great documentary, put together very well. Lots of great music, and musicians. Definitely worth the purchase if you like music. Great historical info, and talented musicians collaborating.
B00062IDCO|4.0|I like it, although there was no language options and the only availabel subtitle was in english, for instance for latin america ( a great market), spanish should be available, at least as subtitle.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I've had these for about 1 year and they're great. They break very easily thought, I sat on them the left thing popped out but it still works, I put very little pressure on the top left and broke the casing and the wires got exposed, the solution for both was very easy, and it doesn't bother me. The plush on the headphones is great, I recommend you wash it because after a while it smells bad. I bought these for about 35 these were great at the price they are now I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />One more important thing the mute button gives static when talking to someone and it annoys them more being on mute then doing w/e you're doing.
B00005JLF5|4.0|I like it, although there was no language options and the only available subtitle was in english, for instance for latin america ( a great market), spanish should be available, at least as subtitle.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Kid Rock is one of the most versatile musicians in the music industry today.  His new album, \\"Rebel Soul,\\" is at the top.  It is a great diversified album that rocks with rhythm and soul!  Go cop this album if you like good rock or music in general!!!
B004PR71JC|3.0|You would think that this being an upbeat movie there would be more dance and upbeat music in the soundtrack but in truth there is only 1.  That is the song Hot Wings song from the dance scene.  Yes there was foot tapping music but not much and my song ignores the other songs. Good cd yes but not a favorite.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I did like the book very much. There are some truly classic bits of knowledge, but I enjoyed the reminder of what &#34;the system&#34; has done to women working within it, be it corporate, societal, or ecclesiastical. Good stuff, this!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|My niece loves this movie so of course she watched it a good 10 times while we were visiting.  Which of course made my son love it. He is young so he doesn't have a long attention spans to watch the whole movie so we generally watch the dance and singing scene over and over because he loves to dance to the song.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I was first introduced to the films of Paul Thomas Anderson when I watched There Will Be Blood many years ago. With that film, I was initially puzzled by it, but couldn't help but be completely drawn in, eventually declaring it one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It was only a matter of time before I went back and saw every other PTA film. As I was watching them, I realized that each film Anderson makes is better than the last, at least for me anyway. He keeps topping himself with each subsequent film, and as soon as I realized this I had firmly believed that There Will Be Blood was his peak and everything after that would savor of anticlimax. That said, I went into The Master just as excited as I was not sure what to expect--how could he improve upon his previous achievement?<br /><br />Then, two hours were gone. I walked out of the theater much like I did when I first saw TWBB--not totally sure what I saw, feeling highly unsettled, and the film haunted me for weeks. I couldn't get it out of my head--did Freddy get anything out of this? Does Lancaster really believe what he preaches? Where is The Cause going? Who even is Lancaster Dodd in the first place? Any many other questions buzzed around in my mind. During these weeks, I was becoming more and more convinced the The Master equaled the level of There Will Be Blood--the writing, the acting, the beautiful cinematography, the score...everything is in place. But before I declared The Master my favorite film of 2012 and one of the best ever, I had to see it again to confirm my thoughts. I did, and I was blown away yet again.<br /><br />So, what's with all of the negative reviews? I was rather surprised when I saw the scathing amount of one-stars on Amazon and the dozens upon dozens of low reviews from critics. It seems like every review is either \\"this is the greatest thing I have ever seen,\\" or \\"this movie was absolutely dreadful.\\" I believe this is a sign of a misunderstood genius; the kind of polarity that had been received by most of Kubrick's films. But of course, they were praised many years later, as I am sure The Master will be--Paul Thomas Anderson is ahead of his time.<br /><br />I can understand the criticism, though. One thing a lot of detractors had a problem with was the loose, seemingly aimless plot. The story goes from scene to scene asking more questions than answering them, we know very little about the characters, the film ends with so many loose ends and unsolved riddles, and so on. I, on the other hand, think it's part of what makes The Master so powerful, because stories don't happen in real life. In life, there is no exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution. Things just happen, without any structure or progression to it. Things are brought up and are never resolved. We know very little about the world. And a lot of the time, life just doesn't make sense. This applies especially to The Master's main character, Freddy Quell, who spends his life aimlessly drifting hither and thither, never understanding anything, never doing much to fulfill his life because he doesn't know what he wants out of life. And that's part of what The Master is about. I think once you are able to appreciate (or at least get acquired to) the unusual storyline, the film might just unfold to you.<br /><br />Let's not forget The Master himself, Lancaster Dodd, who is the most mysterious character PTA has ever written. He is charismatic, outgoing, intelligent, and yet still has this undercurrent that makes me think, who ARE you? As I was watching the film, there were many parts where I thought Dodd truly believed the pseudo-scientific nonsense he preaches in an attempt to steer mankind in a bold new direction, where other parts I felt like it was all just an act he played up, posing as a scientific genius just to gain power over whoever bought into his words. But by the time the movie was over I couldn't come to any certain conclusions about him. Perhaps he's just as lost as Freddy is, but convinces himself he has the key to the universe while Freddy is openly lost. Maybe that common insecurity is why they stuck together for as long as they did. Who knows. Much like TWBB, The Master is a character study film, but upon two characters this time. The interaction between Lancaster and Freddy is the focal point of the whole show, and of how they have affected each others' lives. By the end of it, neither men seemed to have gained much from the other, as if Freddy was Lancaster's guinea pig in a failed experiment. A lot of people said they didn't \\"get anything out of it\\" which is yet another thing The Master is about. Trying to achieve something great, or reach a fulfilling goal, and turning around the corner just to discover a dead end. That in itself is an incredibly powerful thing to me. That is a lot to get out of a film.<br /><br />Another thought that popped into my head as soon as I left the theater for the first time was \\"how is the Academy going to take this?\\" Of course I would have given this film Best Picture, Best Actors, and all of the other awards, but I was not surprised to find that the Academy was turned off by it. I was at least expecting a nomination for Best Picture. Nope. But still they couldn't ignore the brilliant performances of Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams, if only through nominations. If Daniel Day-Lewis wasn't in anything this year, surely Phoenix would have won Best Actor. I love DDL, but it's kind of unfair to have him in the Oscars because you know he's already won it as soon as a new DDL movie is announced--and he deserved it, too. You can only hand out one Oscar per person, but I digress. At any rate, the acting in The Master was some of the most powerful acting I've seen in a long time--many complained that Joaquin Phoenix wasn't good in it because he was too over-the-top and unrelatable, much like a cartoon character. I disagree with that notion. Yes, he was quite a scoundrel in this film, butI sensed real feeling in that role. There are moments in the film where you see the sweet and gentle side of Freddy, among all the violence and chaos in his behavior. You can see genuine suffering and isolation, beyond just an ornery drunkard who's pissed off at everything. Many viewers, much like the other characters in the film, completely misunderstand him. As for Hoffman, this is his finest performance to date--like I said, you will see on the surface a charismatic intellectual who gets along with everyone, but he has all these strange little quirks that make up the highly contradictory character of Lancaster Dodd. I can't say much other than to watch The Master even if just for the acting.<br /><br />For all of its criticism now, I'm positive this will be hailed as a classic in ten years from now. Genius is not recognized in its own time, as proven in the film medium by Kubrick. All I can say is, watch The Master more than once with an open mind, and with each subsequent viewing you will find more and more to appreciate in it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It has a lot it needs stuff from the pc though and also the multiplayer never works it will search and will never work if u have any suggestion please help
B00845MRKE|4.0|This is one hell of a box set! The special features and different versions of cuts of the film seemed endless.<br />The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 its mainly because of the condition of the box when it was delivered. The disc box could not be closed properly because some parts of it were damaged and the actual box had tears on the corner.<br />But besides that, the movies were great. The discs were in great condition. I love the spinner merchandise and the lenticular picture included in this set! It is a real treat. I love this movie and it is great to see something different in every cut of the film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome most awesome game i have ever played i like the grapics and the chracterlitazion on it it is a really fun and adicting game
B006H5120E|4.0|I have to say, when I was watching Titanic in 3D at home, the experience was incredible.<br />The discs are in great condition. There sure are tons of special features in this version. I simply love it!<br />The cover is nice as well.<br />The problem lies to the fact that there were some damaged folds at the spine of the disc case. I am normally not affected by these type of fault but it just made the disc case look so ugly.<br />Other than that, a satisfied order indeed.<br />And need I say more, Titanic in 3D is incredibly amazing. It's as if I was on the ship and makes the viewing experience more intense and exciting.

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Well done, both acting and setting are excellent.  Historical context is well done but doesn't overburden the story.  Nice Job.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love this show.  I love the actors, music and storyline.  It's a great show.  It is so well done that you almost feel like you are transported back to that time period.  I think sometimes during this particular season  you also realize that we are still working through some of the same social issues today.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book & this series. It was one of my favorites of all time! Unfortunately I had read some of the very negative reviews first & it biased me against this last book. I wish all the negative reviews weren't first. I understand what they are saying, but none of what they said affected the flavor of the series, the good vs. evil & the wonderful ending. I read for escape. I read for happy ever after. I got these in spades!!

B001ANSSDC|3.0|This novel was an easy read . I was intrigued with the name of the main character Pat Peoples. I found the novel depressing . There were many questions unanswered . Why Pat was in a psychiatric hospital for so long and why everyone was so afraid of him. The author left you wondering why everyone was so afraid of Pat. The only incident mentioned was his encounter with his wife's lover. That didn't seem enough to warrant so many characters afraid of Pat. And enough about the Eagles.
B004YOEFG8|4.0|The pictures of the universe are spectatular and I have to say I enjoyed it.  I realize it is IMAX so they show the story of how they put the Hubble into space.  I wanted to see more time spent showing what it can photograph than how they put it there and repaired it, though that is interesting.  I will watch it again and again for the spetactular photos that it is capable of taking.  Had it spent more time showing actual photos I would have rated it 5 stars.
B000FA675C|5.0|The novel held my interest. It is a good thriller. Dan Brown's work was also thoght  proviking. It was better than the movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This at least the third time I've read this book. It is such a great read. Even knowing how it ends does not detract from the enjoyment. Read this book then read the rest of the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love Solitaire and this is easy to play and use anywhere.  I have it on my tablet and on my FIRE.  Love to play on the go.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The beginning was intriguing when you hear about her boots.  Then the story kept my interest through the rest.  Would definitely recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great Alarm clock on the go.  I can use when I travel or at my bedside.  Easy to read, easy to use.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a story.  Love the twists and turns in this story.  Would never have guessed the ending.  Looking foward to reading something else from Flynn.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Would love to constantly see both C and F, or at least have a quick way to toggle between the two. Multiple cities viewed at a glance is nice. I think it's a great little app.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|My brother asked me if this was a &#34;factual&#34; movie...how do we really know what it true and what isn't true in history?  All we know is what someone wrote and what we are taught.  However, whether it was completely accurate or not, I did enjoy this movie.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|One of my all-time favorite cd's in the last 20 yrs.  Nice to get the bonus track as well.  Quality music.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|this was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Totally unexpected and wonderful.  Talked my husband into watching it with me after I had seen it in the theater with some girlfriends, and he was completely surprised by how much HE loved it!  French movie with subtitles, but you don't even notice that you are reading...so well done and superbly acted.  Treat yourself to this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Couldn't say enough about how good this calculator is. Does it all from regular old math to squares and square roots. Thanks
B0063IH60K|5.0|Exciting to play various styles and try to beat the clock / scores.  Time flies by while playing this game.  Very enjoyable.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Cassandra Clare has become one of my favorite teen fiction authors, after reading The Infernal Devices trilogy and now this first book in the Mortal Instruments series. I cannot wait until the movie comes out later this year.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Got this on sale for $53.99 and after a week I am more than satisfied.  Comfortable band, no issues with keeping time or run stoppage to date.<br /><br />Would recommend this for someone who is looking for a well built watch that borders between casual and dress, perfect for dress down days and looking forward to summer wear in NY (no metal links to get caught in/on things with short sleeved shirts).
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Detective Vic Mackey. You will love him, you will hate him. You will absolutely love to hate him and hate to love him.  Great character development for the whole cast.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a wonderful book!  Lots of suspense, drama, and action!  I love it and so do most of my students!  A great read!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package that it not only came in the original case, but was  a brand new copy of the game. I started playing almost immediately and cannot put it down. Overall a great game for a great price.
B000UYJR7I|2.0|Pretty bad - weak storyline.  The film is centered around Christina Ricci being in her underwear. I knew what I was in for when I read the script summary....the movie chronicles the relationship between a nymphomaniac and a deeply religious blues musician who wants to turn the &#34;afflicted&#34; woman's life around....really?  He leaves her in her underwear tied to a 40 lb chain for most of the movie,....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each season gets better. I can't wait for season 4. Especially how season 3 left us hanging. The characters are all so well written.
B000002L61|4.0|listen to this on spotify and it's as good as i remember. and couldn't beat the price of item it's not my favorite but still very good and nice to add to coleection of all 10 of the studio cd's
B0063IH60K|4.0|Download and install on the Kindle Fire was simple and straightforward.  Gameplay is enjoyable with smooth drag of cards b/w stacks. Ads at start of each deal are a little annoying, but short or easy to skip over.
B001AUKUTU|4.0|this was one of my fav cd's of all ten of them listed to this on spotify and liked all the songs and got it at very good price here on amazon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the way you travel around the world and how each countries subway track is unique. You also do a different painting at each country.  The setup is easy to uses and the graphics are great.  The various characters and hoverboards are great.  Hope this helps you decide whether or not you want this app.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|My husband & I have watched the first 4 seasons in about a month - he rarely watches tv and couldn't get enough
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Lost 10 pounds in a month following these suggestions. The science makes sense.  As an MD I have started to suggest this book to my patients.<br /><br />Why did I not learn this in med school?
B00AMHFMIG|5.0|I realy like the series and enjoy being able to watch the episodes commercial free.  I bought all of the seasons currently available.
B0023S50DO|5.0|I know that a lot of people don't like this movie for various reasons. But it's one of my favorites -- something I watch on a sick day. The last time I watched, not long ago, I realized that, although one of the main chars is a girl, the movie is NOT about her relationship with some guy. Instead, it's about her relationship with her divorced parents in the face of the end of the world. I love it -- leaves me blubbering each time I watch :)
1449410243|1.0|I was not familiar with the author, but I expected the book to be funnier.  I have a sarcastic sense of humor (so does my cat) but this book left me underwhelmed.<br /><br />If you like other things by The Oatmeal I am sure you will like this as well.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|New movie, interesting to watch, not a favorite but added to My J Depp collection.  Will share with friends if ever asked to
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink and this CD does not disappoint.  I own all of her CD's and I find that there is always more to love on one of her CD's than just the one or two hits you've already heard .
B008Y7ED5O|5.0|I had this recorded on my DVR and when ithe hard drive died, I lost this recording.  I was so please when it popped up on Amazon Instant Videos, I bought it without hesitation.<br />The interaction between the young Victoria, then Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, are such a joy to watch.
B00454U1NS|5.0|If you like Pink, and I do, this is a great CD to have in the car.  I already have all of her other CD's and I do miss hearing all of the songs in the order I'm used to...but this is a great CD to pop in when you just need to hear Pink at her best.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I found this book to be really great for adolescent students. I love it because it presents two very serious issues that we are dealing with in schools, bullying and suicide! This book should be taught in schools!!
B000003CMC|5.0|If you love the Allman Brothers for their guitar work this is the CD for you.  I loved the albumn version and finally got around to buying the CD.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I'm not the best driver, and in order to reach each timer, you have to be! So I go a little bit, then back at the beginning! Just ease up on that a bit! Otherwise I really enjoy the game!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|If you like great guitar work you will love this CD.  A friend suggested I listen to the Tedeschi Trucks Band on YouTube, and I was hooked.  Follow that same advise before you purchase.  I do that all the time now with artists I'm not totally familiar with and it really helps with the purchasing decision.
B008VBYN80|3.0|This game has more than a few technical problems however it's actually fun and very addictive if you can be patient.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Holy crap, my inner goddess doesn't want this book to end!  This is my second time reading this series and its still hot!  I need a Christian Grey in my life.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This movie is now one of my favorites.<br />The actors were fantastic and the scenery was beautiful.<br />Over all, it was a very cool movie.
1932100660|5.0|Book was shipped quickly and this is a must read. Very pleased with full experience from ordering to finishing the last page.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it cant wait for the version on my phone to be updated because then I have 2 profiles and twice the fun
1423140605|5.0|As usual, I put off laundry, grocery-shopping, and even sleep in order to read Riordan's newest offering in the Heroes of Olympus series. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was riveted, engaged, enthralled and totally entertained from the typically humorous first-line zinger to the last engrossing page. Riordan does a great job of helping the reader identify with and care about each character. The plot moves the story quickly, and the humor keeps the scary or sad parts from dragging one down. Loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a mindblowing train surfing amazing game! I love the new update to thisgame also! You wont regret getting it
B007JMW46U|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was a good collection of tales that kept your interest and led the reader to read more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, I am completely addicted! I cannot wait for the next season to start, I am sure I will be purchasing it on Amazon!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Kept me busy for several hours. Really liked this game. As usual G5 games did it right again. Download time was VERY long but worth the wait. Going to buy full game.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's to short. I love the graphics and it has simple controls too. The cool thing you can on the good side and on the bad side.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|This cover is fantastic on my Kindle Fire.  It is easy on and off, easy to use, and I've gotten lots of comments  (&#34;Oh, what a beautiful book!  What are you reading?&#34;) I've long admired French and German antique books with similar decorative covers, and now I have my own. It closes easily and stays secure, even when I carry it around in my bag. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B007MJSQSK|3.0|I liked it. Some of the physics was way over the top, but fun. My wife, on the other hand, went to sleep.
B003E35MQC|5.0|I purchases this before Alvin left us. I always felt he was the master of the day! His lyrics and voice knocked me out.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I'm getting old and time is growing short. Consequently, I'm trying to be quite selective with my escapist pursuits so as not to waste my remaining, finite reading life. David Mitchell didn't disappoint. This is a brilliant novel, boys and girls. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. If you appreciate multi-layered stories, smooth prose, evocative descriptions, characters brought fully to life within paragraphs of their introductions, you'll agree with me. If you can't stand a bit of time travelling along the way, stick with your safe, pedestrian fare.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|Sweet music in my head and it put pictures into my head that will always be there (even to this day). They played out of the box!! I dug it and it was sweet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun! I didn't realize this before but you can even take pictures of your horse. You get to groom it and other fun stuff. If you don't want to wait for long periods of time for tasks to be ready to do this game is not for you. The only thing I don't like is that if you want to get another horse you have to have a LOT of gems or coins.
B001GH1KQ4|5.0|Hey, you gotta have this if you're a CCR nut!! This music was played on my record player all through the night; rocking and rolling to a new and different beat. American beat!!
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|Considering how much I love the movie 10 Things I Hate About You, I'm pretty surprised by how long it has taken me to finally read The Bell Jar. I think it is because I have heard so much about it's depressing nature that I was wary. How could such a depressing book be so wonderful? But since it is on my 2013 TBR Challenge list, Classics Club challenge and 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list, I finally read it. And now I know why it's such a hit.<br /><br />A semi-autobiographical book, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath tells the story of Esther Greenfield, a high achieving young woman who spirals downward into depression and insanity. What surprised me about this book is that I didn't find it nearly as depressing as I expected it to be and was able to follow her rationalizations for her thoughts and actions. This is one of the reasons for the book's long-term success, but experiencing it firsthand is a totally different ball game. It reminds me of Elizabeth Wurtzel's book More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction (she also wrote Prozac Nation), where the reader jumps headfirst down into the rabbit hole with the author.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book, I had never really paid much attention to Sylvia Plath. I considered her an author that I would get to someday and finally, years later, I am reading her for the first time. While I knew that she committed suicide at a young age and was known for The Bell Jar and her poetry, I had no idea that the book was as closely aligned with her real life as it was. The introduction and biographical section at the end of the book gives the reader a great insight into the development and publication of the book, which was just as interesting as the book itself. I was totally surprised to learn that The Bell Jar was originally released under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, then you definitely should. While it's dark in nature, it's not the depressing cry-myself-to-sleep book that I thoughtit was going to be. Instead, it gives the reader a birds eye view of what it's like to slowly unravel. Anyone who has battled anxiety will relate to certain aspects of this book, and it, dare I say, normalizes insanity.
B001NTZGFQ|5.0|It's hard to find the music of your youth. When I do, I must have it. This was part of my vinlyn collection from way back when.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|You know how Adam Sandler used to be crass but hilarious, back in the 90s with movies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison? He actually managed to bring back the cute humor of those days, but without the crassness. Maybe it helps that he wasn't in charge of this movie, simply providing the voice. It's heartwarming, humorous, and genuinely enjoyable to watch with your kids.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Shipping : So I bought the album and it had got lost in the mail and i was very upset. I emailed amazon and I got a reply in less than 24 hours. They took full responsibility for it and gave me a replacement order with overnight shipping and I got it this morning.<br />Wolf: 9/10 To Me. to be honest he could have made a couple better songs but I love this album anyway. It tells a great story and it is better than Goblin And Bastard, and the best part about it is that it was the deluxe edition and it came with a dope calender, a wolf sticker, a little lyric book, a slater patch that you can iron onto your clothing, and a wolf album art cover poster. Very happy with this buy. The overnight shipping made up for everything and wolf is a great album, WORTH BUYING.<br />GOLF WANG.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game has plenty of unlockables yet get boring after a little while. There are plenty of other games that are more addicting like Subway Surfers.
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|When this show first came out (prior to DVRs) I was working 12 hour rotating shifts and only saw one or two. I'm enjoying watching the series on my KINDLE FIRE...
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|OK - but after the Trilogy I expected more.  Hopefully the remainder kick it up a notch with the remaining episodes
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This book will keep you turning page after page, glued to its every word. The writer has a great way of using stories, ideas, and situations to keep you enthralled in the story.<br />From the beginning you are launched into the story of a very modern character from an ancient time. This is all brought about by such vivid and surreal description that the first few chapters will leave you begging for more.<br />For any fantasy nerds (I can say this because I am one) or maybe avid novel reader, try this book out! You will not be disappointed.
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw in on the big screen and couldn't wait to watch at home. Just rented from Prime and loved it!  Think I'll have to buy the bluray.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins has done it again, fully addressing the issues that plague society today. Namely, the plague that is the religious scourge and the falsehood that crusades as the believers in god.<br />With this book, we see that Dawkins fully addresses the reasons why we believe in god, where these beliefs originate, and the psychological reasons underlying these beliefs.<br />This book is welcoming to atheists, agnostics, and theists alike with its subtle and informative writing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My husband is blind so I read this book aloud to him.  This was one of the best we read together, as both the reader and listener!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Just pull the trigger you won't regret it. Good pure sound--just don't go in expecting Foo Fighters music.  Take the time to look at whose working what on each track too.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Nothing special to write. This app seems smooth enough. I don't Facebook enough to give a true comparison. That's all.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|LOVE IT. USE IT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. USE IT FOR NAPS AND MEDITATION, ALSO.<br />I HAVE BEEN TELLING AND SHOWING ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS AMAZING SOUND APP.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I would reccommend this to anyone who likes cats and needs a good laugh. I had a great time playing with this with my grandson.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever watched. We have watched it twice, alone and then with some grandchildren. They too loved the movie. Richard Dreyfus is an amazing actor. The movie is in great condition and a great one to have in our movie collection.l Thanks a gain<br />Pat Larson
B0072V394E|1.0|This is without question the most godawful flick I have ever seen.  Could not stay with it to the end.  I found myself thinking that it must be some sort of campy put-on but even if it was it was just dreadful.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|it runs slow and you need to wait for it to load for five minutes. also sometimes when u go to your underwater park it takes you back out of the game
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I have read and watched a lot concerning Lincoln this year being a student of political science since the mid 1950's. I always considered Lincoln as one of our best Presidents leading the country through one of its most difficult times. This movie depicted it in an extraordinary way. Daniel-Day-Lewis was amazing. I felt like I was there in the various scenes as they rolled on. I highly recommend this movie and should also be watched my high school students across the US to get an understanding of this truly Great President!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Probablly the best holiday movies I have seen in years. Both me and my daughter loved. Watched it over and over again.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|What seems like an odd plot-line gets you hooked. Bla, bla, bla, more review word stuff, bla, bla, bla, bla.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The delivery of the game was quick and easy. It was not the game of Mahjong that I was hunting for, which was my error..I am sure this would be fun also, just wanted a different version.
B003B02O0U|4.0|Started off a little slow but quickly turned into a very satisfying suspenseful read. Grisham nails it. You really become invested and can't wait to see how it ends. Highly recommend.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is another good example of the fast moving type of game that uses the tablet as a controller.  Nice graphics and some cool touches, like the crabs that cross your trail.  To me, it is frustrating that you need to start over after not completing a section quick enough.
B009AMANBA|4.0|When Americans think of Abe Lincoln, we picture a marble icon, an axe swinging tree chopper, an animated lanky president with an even taller hat.  After you see Daniel Day Lewis and how he sees the Lincoln character, you will forever change those previous opinions you had that I mentioned.  He breaths human life into a very complicated man. He shows how the 4 year Civil War and ending slavery took it's toll on him and his family.  Not just words in a history book, but you live the anguish and torment Abraham Lincoln sacrificed for our country.  Just like us, he's taken down by stress, self doubt, depression, family tragedies....and the joys of victory, a sense of humor keeps his world pushing forward.  I didn't just see a movie but a portrait of our greatest president.  It almost inspires you to go out and accomplish a great feat.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I have played a lot of hidden adventure games, and this is a quality production.  The graphics are all crisp and make sense.  The hidden objects include a variety of easy and hard to find, and the timer is reasonable.
0525953728|4.0|This was an interesting story about the Bin Laden take down.  Behind the scenes in the SEALs and the discovery of where Bin Laden was hiding
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was fun game. Very good. Kept my interest. I liked it! &&)&8:)___66 PM\\"the first time for kin to be in the new year ago I was able and joined Facebook page for more information about obsession with friends free download of the McKinley mall in the same time for sure to check out the new Kindle Fire and I couldn't guess the drawing board of directors of the McKinley mall in the same time for sure to check out of hand and I couldn't get together with friends and joined Facebook account and joined by an independent worker who is Aqua teen pregnancy
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been enjoying this app on my iPhone for sometime now and have really enjoyed it. Was glad to see it was available for my Kindle!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although this been gets off to a slow start, the writer really took care to fully develop the characters. I feel as though I have intimate friendships with both Anastasia and Christian as well as the secondary characters. I have never been one to read romance novels, but this was really steamy. I'm glad to know it is a fictional piece, because Christian REALLY borders on stalker behavior... with him tracking down her address, her mom's address, etc. Reading the e-mails and IM exchanges got me really excited...you can just feel the tension and electricity between Ana and Christian. I can't wait to read the second book to see how they will get back together(you know they will, because the magnetism between them is too strong to ignore). Hopefully we'll learn why Christian doesn't want to be touched and see how they can reach a compromise between his hard core BDSM ways, and her obvious willingness to try some of the milder practices of discipline. Even if you're NOT into bondage/discipline, I think you will find the characters in this book hard to ignore. I read this book in one long night and my spouse benefitted ;)
B005LAII80|5.0|I loved this movie in theaters and bringing it home to the (relatively) small screen makes it no less awesome. The HD experience is great at home and I was able to experience every shot and daring escape of Dredd and Anderson. If you are a fan of the Dredd comics or just love a good movie, this is for you!<br /><br />I really liked this movie because the female lead starts out seeming a little fragile but ends the movie as a total bad-a**, without becoming slutty. She is a very empowering female character and I really enjoyed how tastefully she was characterized, especially with it being a comic book movie.<br /><br />The movie is full on Quentin Tarantino-esque violence fest, but I think they handled it surprisingly artfully. A very nice balance between, wow I want to throw up from the gore and being too little violence and blood to pay homage to the comic books. Certainly a fun ride for anyone who needs a little gratuitous arty violence.
B00004Y3OU|5.0|this is such an amazing movie! any film buff should give this one a gander,,,it's all you can ask for in a movie...the sellers are on the mark,and the quality is great
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think coin dosed is such a fun game. I had to get a new kindle And this was like the only game I played after that. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!
B000FVE3BG|5.0|To be honest. I wasn't big on online ordering because of past difficulty. This has changed my view point<br /><br />Satisfied customer
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was drawn in from the very first page. This was such a riveting book. I couldn't put it down, nor did I want to.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I am a long time fan of the writing of Paulo Coelho and have read most of his books. I looked very much forward to his latest book, Manuscript Found in Accra to be published in English. I can firmly say that the wait was worth it. This new book is yet another pearl of wisdom. Like in his other books, Paulo gets us to think about who we really are and what is of importance in life.<br /><br />This book takes a bit of a different form than most of his other books. It is set up as a discussion between a wise man and the inhabitants of the city of Jerusalem in the year 1099. As the city is under siege the Coptic, an old wise man, gets the citizens to capture and transfer the wisdom and knowledge of the city before it gets destroyed by the crusaders. In many ways the format is the same as in Khalil Gibran's book The Prophet. For those that expected a novel with an underlying theme of teaching you something, like Paulo's other books that may be a bit of disappointment, but the amount of teaching and wisdom that Paulo gets across using this format is much higher and I enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />So for those of you who are like me, that read to challenge my own thinking and way of life, then this book is a must read.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Clancy . You can't put it down. Love the complex plot! One of his best! A very &#34;today&#34; topic!

B004LP3AYI|4.0|I enjoyed the overall story. However, this Kindle version has lots of editing errors. They did detract from the overall enjoyment of the book. Hopefully, the editors will soon correct this.

0385523912|5.0|I can't put this book down. EVERY American should read this book. We think ourselves to be impervious to such happenings...scary that this all happened in my lifetime.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I loved this series.  It was like eating potato chips, I couldn't stop watching.  Very disappointed that the series was cancelled.
030758836X|3.0|I loved this book, until the last part. I loved the twists, but it got a bit ridiculous and over-the-top unbelievable. I was looking forward to passing this book along, until I finished it. No way would I recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Easy to use...multi language. Fair pricing. This is the best keyboard so far for android. Can even complete sentences. Choice of theme colors also.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Its a really fun app but it could use an update.But its still a good app.One of the best spiderman apps.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Many, many surprises, all of them just right after the shock wears off!<br /><br />Keep reading and continue to enjoy.<br /><br />Wonderful!
B009D0LBRO|4.0|Great visual style and a fun finite auto runner. I enjoy games with levels that change and have an objective far more than endless runners. I do hate how slow Amazon is in getting their updates posted. No points taken off for that, just annoying they can't keep up with iOS Appstore or Google Play. Waiting for the 20 level update from a couple days back. Will be interested to see when the update hits us.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|My number one all time game on my kindle fire. I love the gameplay and the set up like Diablo and it's challenges. I also love the large hoarded of enemies that spawn.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Thank you so much. I have always enjoyed Hobbit movies. You did Super and deserve 5 stars. Thanks so much
B007SGM084|5.0|I haven't read an erotic novel since my honeymoon on Maui in 1982. It was a Harold Robbins a novel and I kept it wrapped in brown paper to avoid the questions. The Fifty Shades Trilogy leaves Harold Robbins in a paper bag dusty and yearning. Sexy, haunting, arousing and extremely fulfilling of fantasy...disappointing to arrive at the ending! Thank you!
B00947N6D8|5.0|Than you so much. It is such an adorable movie. Everything was great, You deserve the 5 stars, thank you
B0036BK6MW|5.0|this is a wonderful movie about taking chances and what happens when the chances don't find you<br />family is the answer
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the CD was great and I love Bon Jovi, thank you so much, You did great.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining and Bale is exceptionally good as star.  I vote this movie as best one in Bat Man series to date.  Look forward to more Bman from Bale and company.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Make sure you have tissues and a good long time to read because you won't want to stop.  The story itself makes it a 5-star read, but when you really get into the characters the message is incredible.
B0094MFITS|5.0|This is the first produced, but actually second episode, of an exceptionally good mystery - suspense - criminal plot ''movie'' video series that is produced an starred by Tom Selleck.  The series is apparently produced on an irregular schedule over several years by Selleck, as his regular movie and TV work permits, but each new episode takes up where the preceding episode ended, so that viewing in proper series lets the viewer see overall plots, circumstances and character development occur as if watching the small town sheriff and his staff handle normal ongoing life and professional situations.  It's very easy to get engrossed in each movie, root for Selleck and his crew/friends to overcome challenges, and try to solve the particular crime mystery in each individual movie.  Our family finds itself constantly anxious to see another new movie in the series become available.  We don't know whether Selleck intends to continue, but certainly hope that he will find it attractive to continue making more jesse Stone movies!
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|This book is a great path if you want to excel in presenting. It has really helped me improve. Follow the books rules which are basically Jobs' rules and you'll be an amazing presenter.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book!
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Watched several times, and see more, different elements each time viewed.  Totally engrossing story and end-to-end action.  Grabs and keeps your attention, and keeps your mind working throughout entire movie.  One of my very top choices in movies.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Matt Smith is a fantastic Dr., a believable continuation of Tennant's near perfect incarnation.  \\"Lets kill Hitler\\" is one pf the best episodes of the new series, destined to become a fixed point in time in the Who universe, it brings together elements of a story arc that began with the kidnapping of Melody Pond and continues with more of the origin of the amazing River Song. It would be spoiler city to say any more.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The home video quality is great, but it doesn't come up with a surprise ending:o).  This set comes with an extra features disc that is worth the purchase.  There are 4 or 5 hours of behind-the-scenes footage, and like the extra features of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, the extra features are as good as the movie.  If you are a middle earth fan, this purchase is a no brainer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 may have dragged out a little but the writing, acting and character development is just great. I can't wait for season 4.
B006GLT8FK|4.0|I liked it, it was fun. I liked the wrapping up of the loose ends from their first movie, Whole Nine Yards.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved it! It was truely a love story with sports and family involvement.  It was well written and I could not put it down.  I loved all the characters.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|If you loke action, you will like it.  There are a lot of veteran actors and the story follows that as well.  Enjoy!
B0053O89JM|5.0|I cam aboard this show  later on, but enjoyed it.  Sorry they ended their run, but I have enjoyment watching the times they were on now.<br /><br />Thanks for all the help in tracking down things at lower costs.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|A good way to keep notes of whatever ... I found it a little hard to write with my finger so I need a &#34;pen&#34; of some kind to do that.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|First season was interesting and I liked that the writers took time to develop characters.  I think the casting is great!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Can't wait for next season to begin. One of the best shows on AMC. Always waiting to see what happens next.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The show is still interesting, but I can tell that Alicia is going to wear thin with me.  I don't like self-righteous people.  She is starting to annoy.  I will still watch the show because I like Diane and Eli and the investigator whose name I can't remember right now (hey, I'm old).
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren star as Alfred and Alma Hitchcock during the filming of the movie, \\"Psycho.\\"  We see the battle they had bringing the shocking story to the screen and we see the important role Alma played as Alfred's creative partner, writer, and editor.<br /><br />On the good side, it is a nice recreation of 1960.  On the bad side, there's everything else:  Hopkins' makeup was so distracting and so confining that he was severely limited in showing emotion;  he looked like a mannequin.  Even his usually expressive eyes were squeezed and lifeless under the makeup as was the man's sly, dry sense of humor.  Neither Alfred nor Alma were particularly likable and I found their story dull.  The \\"Psycho\\" cast don't get a chance to shine; they're just paraded in and out with little to say or do and they didn't look like their famous counterparts.<br /><br />Given the talented stars, I expected a really entertaining, eye-opening movie and I was surprised at how much I disliked the film.  It was boring.
1416936386|5.0|Great seller.  I don't know how the book is because my daughter has not read it yet.  She is finishing the Matched series, which she says is great.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book was a quick read, certainly had me reflecting on my own spending and saving habits.  Every young professional 20 and 30 something should read this book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The movie had a better pace. Katniss was more likeable in the movie. It was still a very fast read and I enjoyed it.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|My husband and I have enjoyed this, it has a great combination of politics, court room drama, and family life. They do a great job at high lighting the complexities of relationships and friendships, there rarely is an easy, black and white answer.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I though season two drug a bit but three picked up the pace. I've two minor problems. First...and if this was done in previous seasons I never noticed.... but this season there were several points where they would play a song on the soundtrack over shots of each character \\"thinking\\" and not doing much to add to the story. \\"Lost\\" did this a lot and I always thought it was padding...or an effort to sell the music. Some people may enjoy it but it would take me out of the show. The other is the use of the CGI for some of the gore. It is better than most but still a distraction. Other than that....great acting, direction and the storylines are very good. Looking forward to more.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I really like this cover. The kindle fits snug in it. A bit stiff, but wil loosen up with use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 5 YR old loves this game its very easy to use and she has a lot of fun!  over all a very good app
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is really fun it is free and it is worth your time you can eat angler fish.sharks people and much much more
B00APUQRPC|5.0|this is why we want to go to the movies.Not like some of the junk they put out today.This will be a movie you like.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Before dressing the kids in the morning, I check  the weather channel app!<br />As there are allergy suffers in our house the &#34;in season&#34; part is valuable. When you press the&#34;in season&#34; button you will see what the pollen irritants are in your area. It rates them as high/moderate/mild. It also shows a current pollen map of the United States.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This is not up to Denzel best,There were to many bad actors in this  movie with him. I was glad i didn't pay full movie prices
B008HK3XU4|5.0|My 9 daughter has had this case for about 5 months now. It still is like brand new. The sleep/awake mode works every time. There are no marks on it. The color is an exact match of the amazon photo. And the elastic band is still attached! If it can stand up to her opening and closing it a hundred times a day and carrying it around with her every where she goes...I'd say it was a great buy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game I just think it is annoying I can't update it because I can't find the stupid little update button because it is like 45,000,0000,000 pages away
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|This game is about being a shark and seeing how many swimmers you can chew on.<br />Its about getting the water bloody.<br />After you bitten off a few legs its boring.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The first episode ending was totally unexpected. Great writing keeps your interest past the first shocker.<br />I recommend this series.
B0062NAVXA|3.0|Good movie. Great service getting it here. Keep up the good work on products and service to the patron. Thanks
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Love it too death awesome show smart witty and comedic so good and funny . Just bought for my collection at home. Long live the doctor.
B005LAII8K|3.0|A very different movie, but kept me interested and entertained. I recommend watching it without distraction as you really need to follow it closely to get the story.
B002722R64|4.0|are you a James Bond Movie lover ? if so you will like this one too. lots of action as expected for a bond movie. loved it....
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|I buy these for my son's collection of movies as they come out so he can enjoy them in the comfort of his home.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Great movie from the start.. Heart warming, sweet, good life lessons, teaches you how awesome dogs really are. I highly recommend!
B000OPOAJS|3.0|Not quite the movie I thought it might be with Robert DeNiro in it but it was okay. The service in getting it here was great.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|By far one of the best books I've read in a while!  Pi is one of my favorite characters I've ever read about.
B005LAIISA|5.0|It was a great movie as all of these are. For both adult and children. Service was great to get it here too.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Please get rid of The Gov character and for God sakes get them out of that stupid prison !  The Gov character is predictable and brings the acting and plot development way down......the show has become ordinary.......and missable.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Great movie. Denzel at his normal greatness. The service was great. Got it on time and without a lot of hassle.
B00821OX98|2.0|Could barely make it through the episode.  Who funds these shows ?  Nothing new in the premise of the show.......bad aliens come to earth, are hostile, start to colonize earth........the indigenous population scurries for survival.  Stop me if you've heard this before.
B002ZG980U|3.0|Not a big Leonardo fan but this has given me hope that he can act out the parts he will take in the future.
B00846REIS|3.0|If you have read 50 Shades of Gray you know that the bar has been set for erotic novels that come after it. That being said this book is pretty much the same storyline of 50 Shades but with some light changes. I have had this book for a while and have yet to finish it, its lacking some steaminess in the sex and the rest of the story is blah. Its an overall entertaining read, I still like 50 Shades better.
B001HN6922|5.0|How can anyone not like a Cars movie is beyond me. They are funny and good comedy for all to watch.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The characters were simply not that likeable. Some adult interactions with children were questionable at best - the language used and the tone of the interactions were shocking to me. There were some redeeming scenes but I would never watch it again and I love Paul Rudd.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Great movie. A big reminder of what the old shows used to be like. Keep them coming in the future.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|love the story and actors!!!! I bought it  for my aunt and she loves it. it was worth buying just to put a smile on her face!!!
B002N5N5M0|3.0|I buy these for my son as he is not able to watch them when the regular series is on.
0743270754|5.0|Read this before you see the Oscar winning movie (which only covers a small fraction of this well written book)
1439102732|3.0|Good book but was not quite what I expected from the author. I will keep trying her books as I know she is wonderful
B00AVL23YE|5.0|Good product.  The only distraction is that the help is online and there are no logs to help you find out why an account will not connect.
B003L77GRO|3.0|I buy these for my son as he is not able to get them when the series in on regular tv
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I was sucked in right away. I'm sad it's over. The details are so engaging, songs, places, everything 1986.  Beautiful love story.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is a great series. Enjoy it with my husband and my son. So family time is around the tube when this is on.
B00785P2QC|5.0|There's game is made by a great creator and can be viewed from many different ways it deserves a title such as  Great game,great graphics,great quality
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What can you say about Son's except they are great to watch and is a man's soap that a woman can enjoy.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I like it very much.it help me out alot.luv that it can fix or upgrade my photos.I like cookin around with it
B0034DGPEU|1.0|The plot is contrived, and the protagonist is mostly motivated by emotion, not intellect; she seems often just hoplessly stupid.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|1stars boring and sucked hate dont get it terrible 2bad it comes with the electronic<br />Do not get boring one star
6305069611|5.0|This is a sad movie. A man from a different world lands here to earth to find water for his family far away. Yet he finds himself stuck in the society of booze, sex, and wealth.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love relaxing to this after a hard day at work!!!! How life has changed, but the clothes and setting are fantastic.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Love this movie, very different. A great cult classic. A man takes a different approach to finding meaning to his life.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This focuses on a relatively short period of his presidency, and is still so dense with detail that my friends who are not as familiar with Lincoln's life had problems taking in all the details in a single viewing.  I have read many Lincoln biographies, including the book which was the basis for this script, and loved the movie. My friends enjoyed it, but several went back for a second viewing.
B008RTE08E|5.0|Anybody who loves The Beatles should have watched this already. The movie is very &#34;wow.&#34; All of which the ideas came from them.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is an AMAZING album.  This is when the whole band was at their peak.  They let Mike Portnoy move the band into heavier territories and, boy, does it suit them well.  It's so heavy, even the normal slow song has a heavy chorus and one of the most incredible musical passages ever starting at about the 5 minute mark.  This album is also extremely technical (a la Dream Theater of course), but except for a brief part of &#34;In the Name of God&#34; never feels stale or wankery like.  This is an album that I will always keep going back to.  If you like technicality, weren't that much into the slow side of Dream Theater, and wanted them to move in a heavier direction do yourself a favor and don't even hesitate to pick this up.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I just wonder if they say it has no limits. Why do they limit it on most stuff. Type in something, but it isn't unlimited.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The concept is ridiculous.  It shouldn't be that fun... building car/machines to take a pig a few feet to the finish line?  Snore... So why the hell can't I stop playing!!!!  Something about the challenge of making the most efficient car is puling me in. Or maybe its the visual of a piggie crashing into things when I build a crazy contraption that brings me back.  OR maybe these pigs just have the power of hypnosis over me. They are bad piggies after all ;)
0783226063|5.0|I had this one in VHS, bought when it first came out long before widescreen or much digital technology. As I recall it cost a fortune to make and lost money at the box office but it remains a Frank Herbert science fiction classic.
B005974CDU|4.0|Complex riffs, odd time signatures, and musical masturbation galore.  That's Dream Theater's forte and it's not missing from this album.  The thing that is missing is the legendary drummer Mike Portnoy.  The new drummer, Mike Mangini, makes his debut on the album, but you won't feel that anything's much different (although some commenters have noted a more generic feel uninspired drumming than normal) because Mangini came on after the songs and drumming were already written.  Although some have noted the similarity of this album to Images and Words in terms of song structures, the songs sound nothing alike so it shouldn't feel too copy-cat like.  Only downsides to album are the slow songs (I've never been into that side of Dream Theater) and the &#34;it's so technical, it might be getting old&#34; feeling you get if you've listened to the other Dream Theater albums.  Overall, still good though.  Check out &#34;Lost Not Forgotten,&#34; beautiful piano intro and, in my opinion, standout of the album.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone  who believes in the reality of love. It also takes a serious look at mental illness.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|absolutely love this app! so easy and fast to use. You can find everything you could want at great prices.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It works just like I want it to.  The numbers on the screen are huge.  It adds and subtracts with ease.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We think this is a great series right up their with Downton Abbey. Characters are realistic and mutiple  story threads engaaging.
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever watched.  I only watched about 20-30 minutes and quit watching.  It should be rated RRR and not for teens to see much less adults.  It was horrible and as far as I could see, no plot whatsoever.  It was money wasted.  I wish I could order another movie in its place.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I just wanted to get back to the characters each day. There was both humor and human sadness.
B007P7UF06|5.0|This is such a wonderful musical. The music is great. The lesson taught on how infidelity can destroy not just 3 lives, but so many more, is perfect. Finally, hope is found again in the end through a small boy.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is a story that is very family friendly. The two eggs are great. Any child to adult will enjoy this dvd
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The movie musical was quite good. Of course if you ever have the chance to see it on stage, go. I am a purist so some of the singers did not meet my expectations, but overall I loved the movie enough to buy it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This DVD is a piece of Art. Show how a person can hold on to hope and get through any problems
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The jet packs are awesome.  Plays well without glitches.  For my son, age 7, it's very entertaining.  He loves the super shoes.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you love Moody Blue you love this singer. There is not one song on this CD that I did not like each song is prefect.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The shop has a very unique concept.  We really like it a lot.  It has some drama, some humor.... a little Western flavor and Sci-Fi.  Yeah.... you don't get that everywhere!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This DVD is what completes the whole LotR . If you wish to be transport to a world of Magic this is worth watching.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Cute and amusing high school comedy with a slightly more R-Rated approach to the subject matter.  The lead actress is cute and believable, but my favorite has got to be the guidance counselor you feel so sorry for.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Watched it three times already... this movie was done very well and I really enjoyed it. The extra tracks that explains how the movies was filmed was extremely interesting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy.  I have read it twice and am ready to read it the third time.  I also saw the movie when it came out.  Of course the movie did not do the book justice, but it was good anyway.  Somehow, one is able to get lost in the fantasy world of the book and still experience the emotions.  Written for teens probably, but I'm a retired lady who enjoys staying young in spirit.
B000FA675C|5.0|I far prefer the book over the movie. The book leaves more to the imagination. Way to go Dan Brown! AGAIN, EXCELLENT BOOK!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a decent book. Worth reading, but not one I would consider a must read by any means but if it interests you then you should read it.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Awesome action packed movie with romance and friendship.  It shows how you develop a lasting friendship in the military and how a major event can change you.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I've probably seen without exaggeration one of the best movies I've seen.  I've watched it probably 10 times and pick up something new every time.  It isn't a movie that I'd want my 9 year old to watch due to the language, but for a 14 or 15 year old, it's nothing they haven't heard already.  It is R so parents take the appropriate precautions.  I highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The upper class in this series are unbelievable in their behavior and opinions, but it is lots of fun to watch and see how they live and conduct themselves.
B00846REIS|5.0|Best book I've read in a very long time!  I would definitely recommend it!  It kept me completely entranced the entire time I was reading it! Can't wait for the third book!
B00340ESIS|5.0|When I read a book devoted to the craft of writing, I'm not looking for fluff and filler. I couldn't care less about the author's philosophical stance, political leanings, or traumatic history. I'm looking for concise, substantive, utilitarian, reliable information on writing a book that will sell.<br /><br />Save The Cat delivers on all these points, and is hilarious to boot.<br /><br />If you buy only one book on the craft of writing this year, make sure it is Save The Cat. You'll be glad you did.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Really enjoyed the three books.  Great characters and story lines.  My favourite story line in this book was the helicopter incident.
0679642609|5.0|Read the 1964 version five years ago.  It was good but put me to sleep at times. This version is more energetic.  I can teach it to my two year olds over time.  The excellent introduction itself is worth the price.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Loved all three of these books.  Great characters and story lines.  This book in the series has some major character developments.
B001CFLHJA|5.0|Nemesis - just listen to that track if you're checking out the album. Mike Moreno just kills it - so does Aaron and the whole band - but it's Moreno's lines that blow up the track for me. Love this record.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Great characters and story lines.  Well written and a very enjoyable read.  Loved the pub/night club scene, and the morning after, helped to setup the characters.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|Really didn't like it,  It was written by a woman who was writing letters to her ex husband.  Would not recommend it
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I did not start watching this series when it came out.  A relative gave me her DVD's of season one and two this winter.  I fell in love with it almost immediately.  I ordered season three and  received it just as I was finishing season two so did not have to go into withdrawals right away.  Now that I am caught up, I can hardly stand the wait for season four to begin :-(<br />I love these DVD sets, and I am now considering purchasing season one and two.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This app is awesome!  I can fool around on the piano when I'm on vacation or something.  Fun! I love all the different  settings it has.
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|The movie was okay.  It arrived in  a decent amount of time but was shipped in a broken case (tab inside broke), so the movie bounced around during shipment and was scratched.  It did not play well and I was not happy about it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful insight into a time in of change in English history. Wonderful dynamics between aristocracy and servants with plenty of plot twists. Watch season one first if you can so you'll appreciate the dynamics & story line.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|I would recommend this movie.  It arrived in good shape without issue. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
B000FA675C|5.0|I've read the book once before, and I've seen the movie twice. It was just as exciting the second time around, and with the Kindle Edition, I can safely highlight, and jump right to all the facts placed in here so I can share it with others :) Plus I was able to read it at home, and on the go, whether with my computer or with my husband's phone.<br /><br />The book itself is amazingly written. It's descriptive without bore, and gives you a history lesson without droning, and makes it interesting since it all goes along the with story. There always another plot twist, right up to the end, and you never know what to expect. Plus, as a reader, you can ponder with Robert as to what the clues mean :)
0684830515|3.0|I would recommend this book.  It arrived in good shape without issue. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Having been a high school student preparing for graduation during the time of this crisis, I remembered very little. This film was very historically correct and very real! It lead us through the most intense, indiviual moments of those lives 'caught in the balance' of such a troubled time. An excellent film. Ben Affleck was amazing and very believable in this role.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I would recommend this movie.  It arrived in good shape without issue. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|We loved this film. We were amazied at the realistic tone. It was as if we were in 1865 Washington, DC, following President Lincoln thorugh his last few months in office and in life. Daniel Day Lewis was a remarkable Lincoln and Sally Field was superb as Mary Todd Lincoln. A very enjoyable film.
B005VPRETE|5.0|The product arrived in good shape.  It was immediately put to use and we are still using it.  Like it!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Another amazing film to be added to the amazing 50 year legacy of 007. This film took us on a more intimate journey with Bond, returning to his childhood home and revealing the true relationship between Bond and M. The ending brought about an unexpected gasp! This film brought Bond full circle and back to his 'roots'. It seemed to end where Roger Moore's bond left off, promising the next 007 feature to be reminicent of the older films in the franchise.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Sort of reminds me of a John Grisham. It's a very legal sort of book. But it was interesting and kept me wondering throughout.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very engaging book.  Even though it is a novel, I think it gives a view into the  foster care system.  Loved the characters and enjoyed the book very much.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I enjoy this because it's not easy...some levels are hard and make you think. It's fun. Graphics are great...never had any problems.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Keeps your brain working hard. Love playing puzzle solving games. Game has several options on how hard you want it to be.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book! It made me laugh and cry. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author and I have loved every book of his I've read!!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|The story was great, the animation was indeed up to Dream Works standards.  I did purchase this in 3D and was glad I did.  It has the effects that good 3D should have.  You are not dizzy, but feel like your there, you get enough of the beauty, and out into the room effects, to make the 3D lover in me happy. The lighting was exceptional. True artistry!<br /><br />Very good story, I enjoyed the story and my husband enjoyed it also.  Children of all ages will like the story.  The Easter Bunny is a hoot, especially when he is turned into a cute little bunny.  You need to watch it, I won't give it away.  You have the good verses evil, but done with allot of entertainment.  I also loved \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\", which was also a Dream Works production.
1423140605|4.0|Bought this series for our grandson and he enjoyed them completely, devouring them in days!<br />He, is 9yrs old and now wants to go to Greece and view ruins.This has sparked a new interest in mythology of many other cultures as well.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|My Grandson wanted the DVD, so I updated my movie to the 3D version.  I was able to send him the DVD in the set, and I have my blue ray and my 3D.  I found it as previously viewed, but the set was flawless!!  I watched the 3D version, pretty good for an older movie that was not originally made for 3D.  The bird flies out into the room once, but the picture is beautiful and worth the purchase. I'm glad I was able to get my Grandson his DVD and get the 3D I wanted in the classic tale.  Well worth the money.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Beach buggy blitz is a fun game for the price. FREE..... I would say beach buggy blitz is a game for all ages...
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I purchased this movie because I wanted to see it in 3D.  I was not disappointed.  The movie had such beautiful effects and you felt like you were in the audience watching it live.  The colors were great and the general beauty of the production was great.  I loved the Arial and water displays.  The story was cute, but this is a production of beautiful grandeur.  I am so happy to have this movie in my 3D collection.  Again, I think the 3D was spectacular and almost as good as watching it live. It's a dance in the air and water.  Loved it!! I did get this previously viewed, but could not see any damage or even sign of use with the 3 Disc set.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great story with outstanding acting. At some point you can actually believe that Daniel Day-Lewis is Lincoln. Very good movie.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Repetitive style got to be annoying. Interesting when first described, but seemed like he ran out of words. Might have been better if shorter.
B0085OELXK|4.0|Fabulous photography, especially of Italy.  Excellent acting, particularly Matt Damon.  This is an intense movie--I watched it in segments, almost like a TV series.  Makes me want to read the book, but then I wouldn't have those beautiful scenes
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Can't believe I missed this in the theaters when it first came out... but THRILLED I could rent through amazon.com.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A great book to transport you to a place where our world is being fought for against demons by half angels. A book worth reading.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this mini series! I watched the first season back to back episodes and jumped right into season 2 and was not dissapointed. The characters become even more complex and interesting which makes the season just as addictive as the 1st! I am not letting myself rush through the 3rd season so I can not have as long a wait until the 4th comes out :)
0762445262|5.0|It might be tiny, but it's just bright enough in a dark room to be a perfect &#34;night light&#34; and not keep you awake!<br /><br />Makes a great stocking-stuffer for the Bat-Fan in your family...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|this book is hard to get in the stores because of it's popularity.  thank you amazon and thank you for the quick delivery.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|this is real music, Paul Anka outstanding voice and music, the music and arrangements are outstandingly lush. This is a great cd and comeback to adult contemporary music. outstanding duets and vocals, wow.<br /><br />More of PAUL ANKA please, more new music, you are a legend and by no means less than Mr. T. Bennett, for the record companies :for God's sakecan you make his older 70's - 80's albums available on remastered cd? The painter, Music man, This is love etc..1989 - Paul Anka - Somebody Loves You. I've been a great fan, for years, should deserve airplay,and more promotion especially downunder in Australia
B003O86FMW|3.0|this book is hard to get in the stores because of it's popularity.  thank you amazon and thank you for the quick delivery.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|How can you go wrong with Lego?  My grandson was happy with this choice and continues to revamp his design.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Based on a true story of a truly humble human.  His expressed who he really is and was. I loved it and told everyone about it.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Takes you right back to high school.  If you liked high school or not you will like this show.  Real, funny, and leaves you cheering for the underdog.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I was so touched and learned something I never knew about a paraplegic.  He could feel.  He couldn't move a muscle, but he could feel and wanted to feel - just once.  And Helen Hunt is a great actress.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|This was a joy to read. A real page turner. Olson has the knack for making history come alive. Her writing reminds me of Barbara Tuchman's or Doris Kearns Goodwin's. I will recommend this book to all my friends and will read it again.<br /><br />DC Rooney<br />Fair Oaks, CA
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great action, plot, special effects, acting. Enjoyable. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a great movie experience.
B0031RS44S|5.0|Excelle page turner. You don't sleep until the last page ...<br />Once more: Lee Child is the best story writer!
B0001IN07Q|5.0|The DVD/CD were both great. They were presents for my wife. I would rate both of these an 8 on a 10 scale.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I became a fan watching him on American Idol, and his CD proves what a great singer and musician he is.  I can't wait for his next CD.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I wish my iPad had an app like this one. this was the only app on my kindle that I did like using.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|I work on a ship and often we have the availabilty of free wifi in ports. The only problem was connecting to it from my cabin, with an internal network card. Now i have miles of reach, amazing. That from behind glass that's been treated to reflect heat / light.<br /><br />It's really an excellent antenna with high range. And it's worth the money.<br /><br />The internetsharing / virtual wifi, is bogus though, i've done everything to make it work and it just won't. Very frustrating but i've learnt to accept it now.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like this app very much. I enjoy the variety of noises than can be overlapped. Soothing rain and campfire are my favorites to fall asleep to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy playing the game.  It's fast and keeps my attention.  The game is played by different age groups and is fun.
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|While I very much enjoyed another of Milan's books, this one I simply couldn't finish. The prose, situations, and heroines did not convince me to continue reading.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|As an educator, I found this book to be quite thought provoking. The idea that we should be training people soft skills such as collaboration and leadership in addition to creativity and entrepreneurship makes sense to me.  It is something I hope all schools will strive to do in order to create a bright future for our students.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|It's so gut wrenching to think that this happens everyday, all over the world....it crosses all lines of race, status, religion.....children are abused and neglected, and we can never get a handle on it until every person THAT DOESN'T find it acceptable does SOMETHING to stop it!!!
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my children.  So now that my children have kids of their own I gave each one a book.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Game downloads fine but force closes right away when I try to select a character. Does it every time I open the game.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|My dad is soooo hard to shop for. He always says he never wants anything, but my sister, mom and I know how much he loves these movies and so my sister got him the first 2 and mom and I got him the rest. He was really excited when he saw them. Ha so he did want somethings :-)
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|to watch on a cold day. I can watch again and again. Makes you appreciate being home. I wish the ending was better.

0307943194|5.0|Item was a gift and my daugher sure enjoyed it.  We buy the audio books and she usually dontes them to the goodwill, after she looks at them. Great seller, who ships promptly and item as described.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|wow, great movie, great acting and a definite recommendation. it showed the true Lincoln and his wife. I never knew<br />he had had threats against his life. it was a great movie
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Classy look perfect for travel. Makes my Kindle experience more enjoyable. The stand feature makes it beyond awesome. You should get one.
B008602KQI|4.0|had potential for being great but stopped short by not having enough engagement by the star. however, I would watch it again and recommend it to other. I just wished they had the female lead doing more.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It you want to stare at hot chicks and make stupid jokes while in bed then pick this app up.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|it was great from start to finish. it was about a family, about two sisters, about two loves, about life. the mother and the father roles were also were done. I bought it.
B0096BIENY|3.0|never heard of them just bought it as a gift for a friend and they loved it. If you like them then go for it.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|having some of the original characters in it made it more believable. the guy who plays a young Billbo Baggins<br />did a great job. I will be purchasing this movie and recommend it highly
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Biggest waste of money ever. The controls dont work. the graphics are okay it is hard to walk. I couldn't really do anything. Awful GTA rip off.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was so disappointed. I love keira knightley, but the movie was slow and confusing. did not buy it and would not recommend it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really great game! Great game. It was well worth the money. Cant wait for number 2! It will be great.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have worn out my first CD, this is the second one. I watch it everyday while at work this time of year, lots of hand work on costumes. Time just flys by with Elizabeth and Darcy.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I'v been waiting for this game to come to my zeki. I used to have to play this game on my friend's ipod, but now I can play it on my zeki!!!  I have beat the main game, it so fun/hard. I hope you have as much fun with this game as I did!! Have fun.
1449410243|2.0|I thought this book would really be funny, most books about cats usually are.  It was really dumb.  Hoping the library will take it.
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|Has some big holes in it, never explained why the switch sequence worked brought Daniel back from the dead 3x but not the old guy???  Best part was Chris Judge playing the Jack
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was amazing I hate  Beautiful Creatures the movie it terrifyingly horrible nothing like the book that changers everything! But this book was amazing some moments I was very shocked what the characters do! Hopefully then movie will be just as good #fingers #crossed
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther returns John Corey (and Nelson DeMille) to primo status of page-turner excitement in reading.  What an interesting take on the Middle East.  Underneath the wise-cracking narrator is much insightful observations about our present day involvement.  The character of Brenner was a nice addition and allowed DeMille to give John Corey a bit of a rest in what might have been too much flippancy for one character.  Loved this book!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Very interesting show, though only somewhat historical (not that I'm an expert). Though Day-Lewis's portrayal gave an interesting character, it didn't quite ring true for me. Worth watching once.
B0085W09ME|3.0|Need to use it more, next year will see it get a work out the way things are shaping up.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This one moves just as quickly as the first two. I had to take it slowly or I would have stayed up all night trying to finish it. It's wonderful that it wasn't predictable. Definitely got a few surprises.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome and i love it because it doesnt have any glitches and it is really cool yeah!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a novel for book lovers, for fantasy lovers and those who like to dream. Robin Sloan takes you on a fun trip combining today's technology with 500 year-old mysteries. It's a fun read!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Ilove the complex plot- many characters with competing interests.  Hope they keep up the slippery slope themes of what is morally/ethically/ humanly appropriate and what is legally so.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|got a new kindle fire after 1st one would no longer charge... this was necessary to get my &#34;stuff&#34; to my new kindle ...worked great...thanks Kindle Support
030758836X|2.0|Part I: Well-written, flows interestingly, seems original despite *obviously* having been inspired by the Scott and Laci Peterson story.<br /><br />Part II: Preposterous and unacceptable.<br /><br />The events described, and explanation for them, are the rough literary equivalent of walking down the street until being tripped by Brad Pitt, only to stumble face-first into Jennifer Aniston such that my mouth lands directly on hers, but then later finding she picked my pocket... because you see, she has lost all her money.<br /><br />Simply defies reality both as I have known it and as it is described in the book in Part I.<br /><br />Part III: Supreme BS on a level of BS that, quite stunningly, makes Part II seem *plausible.*<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book to anyone except the foolish, the gullible, or possibly those who will find the prose in the first third charming; it is, ironically for reasons the book's readers will know, the book's strength.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is now my favorite show. I love it on my Kindle Fire without commercials. NO COMMERCIALS ARE GREAT. ONE MORE WORD
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I got this for the obvious reason...to calculate.  I love the fact that I can use it with my stylus &amp; it's great to grab for anything you need!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|the kids enjoy playing it in the car  they try to see who can get the farthest.  I like that is has some control options
B0095P29EG|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie, where the special effects did not dominate the more human parts of the movie.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Love, love, love, Supernatural.  Every story line is always great!  Jared and Jensen are the best actors ever!  I have every complete season.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is a well made movie with excellent acting and a reasonable screenplay but pales in comparison with the book on many levels.  Kind of left me cold at the end.  Could really have used something like the circle in the book ending.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Acting was great.....story captivating....The movie had me completly engrossed. So worth the two hours of my life. I teared up a little at the ending but it was with a smile on my face.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well worth watching how things we try to do to keep our people safe in other countries do work. Ben Affleck was brilliant
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have watched this from the begining but missed several shows. Now with netflix I can catch and watch all the shows.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Typical John Corey. Always enjoyable. I look forward to another Corey narrative. I would assume more from from Chet Morgan
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|i chose this rating because the 3d effects are very blurry .. it actually made our eyes go cross at times. i don't know if it is because this was made for imax viewing or what , but it did not work well on passive 3d. however , the blu ray 2d version was great.if you are buying the 3d version then i would say pass on it . in most cases you could actually see the images were to far apart to get the 3d effect..my copy will simply not be used again..
B009B50QOU|4.0|A necessary addition to anyone who is a Green Day fan. My only complaint is that on a few of their songs, they cuss for no other reason than to cuss.  Doesn't really add anything to the song
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.  Liam's best performance.  Ben kingsly also gives a very moving performance as well.
B0012GMV58|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite Santana albums because it is both spiritual and jazzy. Although I like the CD, I'm  giving it 4 stars because of the bonus track, Mantra. In my case, it is anything but hypnotic and conducive to meditation. I absolutely cannot listen to it because it is highly irritating and agitating to me.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Evil dead 2013 isn't only good it could arguably stack up against the original. With a much larger budget then 1981 this amazingly bloody movie delivers many thrills and scares. Whether your a fan of the 1981 classic or a new commer to the franchise any horror fan will enjoy th is movie.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Somehow I never get bored with this classic. I got it on vinyl back in the '70s. Now I'm enjoying it more than ever on CD.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|Very artsy format - the movie begins and progresses somewhat like a theatrical production with a touch of ballet.  Then it transforms into a movie format again.  Different and in my opinion, very interesting.  Of course the movie is about Anna and her confliction between the committment she made to her marriage (including a son) and her desire to love a man that doesn't ignore her like her husband.  Once she has love, she doubts if that was what she wanted and seems ambivalent.  I tought it was a great story about a woman of means in 1870 Russia, who was conflicted and yet loved by two men.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Interesting how mrs Robinsons therapy,although radical , helped an insecure abused and angry child, through puberty to become a successful ,compassionate businessman .<br />I have to read the last book to find out whether Ana's style of therapy can make him husband and father material.<br />Of course the bedroom scenes are extremely enlightening , to think I was always rather partial to vanilla.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Very suspensefull!  I had mixed feelings about renting this movie but my husband picked it and once I got started watching, couldn't even put it on pause to get popcorn.  Great plot!
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Angels Flight was another terrific read in the Harry Bosch series. They never end like I think they might. Check it out!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Just loved the whole book, can't wait to read the next one.<br />So young and love wins in the end
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This was a wonderful show. Can't miss with Cirque De Soleil!  Nice story!  Great acts!  Waiting for more on DVD.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|It was a decent remake of a classic. It had a good cast with very good diversity. A good way to spend a couple hours.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Like most real life coin pusher machines it's a pretty simple concept.  However if you think about the coin placement for a second you can actually influence their movement.  The physics model in this game is pretty realistic as well.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is very fun and a bit addictive.  It is easy enough to figure out and seems to run very well on my Kindle Fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome app.on survival<br /> mode the monsters are awesome.<br />I have some awesome buildings. I have a hotel a house<br /><br />From Rudy Langdon
B00AEFYVUQ|4.0|Product arrived on time and in condition as advertised.<br />The movie is one of Allen's good ones, highlighting his classic Neurotic personality persona with conflicts and exaggerated situations to get his thoughts across. As usual, the supporting cast does an excellent job, helping to put across the story very well.
B00C32R64G|5.0|A long time favorite of mine.  Volbeat keeps you guessing.  Love the variety of song styles and never disappointed.  This album is another great one in a lineup of many that say Rock n Roll is alive and well.  Highly recommended.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this cd.  Identifed with many of his song.  Never purchased his music before, but I certainly will in the future.<br /><br />betty
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use .important  to have.Best thing its free!More people should access it.Hope this helps others.thanks for the excelllent product.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|all his books are great some start a little slow but in up great...Haven't read any I didn't like...would recommend all...:)
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I am not ashamed to say anything from the BBC is at the less worth trying and watching if for no other reason to learn to speak &#34;English&#34; and to see when one speaks the words then uses them to the max.<br />This is truly example of the spoke word at it's best. The story is what is what it is no matter what work you choice it all has a level of use and be used to get where you what in live. I have read in the past some reefer's to the wife in the game which is being played and yes it is true and places her in a wonderful postion to see what we as women do with out power over our husband's male co-workers etc. the mirror of life is a wonderful thing to watch and I see at least 40years of my own act and words be said - after each espoisde I ask would I kill or have someone kill to get the prize of power.<br />Must watch for 14up's - great for group talks.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Engaging, sharply witty and hard to put down. I can't wait for a sequel. This author has created a story of murder, mayhem and malfeasance along the order of Sherlock Holms, Poirot and Mr. Bean. Well done!
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|A must CD to have. I am so glad I purchased this CD and added to my collection. The price was excellent too.
1593157134|5.0|This was one of my better buys. I really like the information I'm getting that is changing the way I live. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to get their life in order.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I only just started playing, but so far, I really like it. It has the feel of a real console game with a sort of temple run in a go cart kind of thing. And it's free, so that's nice.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine and I'm so happy I read it. Life is crazy at times and at the end of the day we all want to be loved right? It's our silver lining as referred to by Pat Peoples. Read this book. You will enjoy it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I had the first Lep's World on my phone, and loved it. I got a kindle fire recently, so I got the second game. It's a much larger game, and the fun game I wanted, but at times, the directional controls won't respond and the most irritating problem is that when the checkpoint is on or near a ledge, it restarts you in mid air next to the ledge and you have to pray that you can double jump fast enough to get you to land. These two problems combined are extremely frustrating. I love this game! Please fix it!! Will gladly give it give stars when these issues are resolved, but for now it gets a three.
6305428387|3.0|I purchased the DVD new. I anticipated that it would have good visual quality, however I was disappointed. Better LUCK next time.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|It's just like expected to be. After we opened the package, my son went to kids around the neighbourhood to show of.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Not even close to quality of Spider on my desktop. Hard to select & move cards on screen. Options minimal.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Season 1 was great! I just  started  season 2 now.<br />I love that there are no commercials and you can watch it<br />all together!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The plot is realy good I'm only half way though  the 3rd season. I have to make myself stop .
B000IOERBG|4.0|This is an excellent book.  I discovered it after seeing the BBC TV movie.  The characters are so detailed while remaining interesting.  The plot is not current but makes a great modern history.  The Stalin story was excellent. The ending was not as great as the rest of the book, but good.<br />Enjoy.
B008L0WJQY|2.0|I bought this thinking it would be great on my tablet or kindle.  NOT!  The interface sucks, I expected it to open to the current day when I launch it.  I would have been better just buying the regular calendar and scanning the pictures in; at least then I could put it into a picture browser and flip through them.  Total sucks, don't waste your time buying any of the electronic versions of these calendars.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I only had the screen lock up 1 time otherwise game was great!  Graphics were very good and problem solving was fun!<br />Great game!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This and more reviews at [...]<br /><br />It's no wonder this book was optioned for a movie.  I initially saw an interview with Matthew Quick on a local news broadcast and thought \\"Wow, that guy is really poetic about his book and life in general.\\"  When they started talking about how his book was made into a movie, I needed to read this book a.s.a.p!  I hate it when movies subliminally influence me on books I haven't read yet.<br /><br />Pat Peoples is presented as a man off his rocker due to the split from his wife.  He can't remember why they had split, but he knows that if he just tries harder to become a better person, his wife will accept him back and their marriage will live on.  However, it's not just Pat who needs therapy for emotional distress.  Every character around Pat is in denial regarding their own personal situations. It's the fancy footwork that Pat does around their issues, to press on to his own goal, that is inspirational to the reader.<br /><br />Pat explains to his unconventional therapist how life is like a movie, directed by God, and he is but an actor in the movie.<br /><br />\\"Well, you have adventures. All start out with troubles, but then you admit your problems and become a better person by working really hard, which is what fertilizes the happy ending and allows it to bloom-- just like the end of all the Rocky films, Rudy, The Karate Kid, the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies, and The Goonies, which are my favorite films, even though I have sworn off movies until Nikki returns, because now my own life is the movie I will watch, and well, it's always on.<br />Quick, Matthew (2010-04-21).

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Once you get going, game is really great.  I really started to enjoy it after I figured out how to jump and get the parasailer.
B006MOW98E|2.0|This and more reviews available at [...]<br /><br />Rating: Chaser; I appreciated the story line.  It kept me reading.  It took me a couple days to finish because I kept putting it down/falling asleep.<br /><br />Great concept... good stories.  Two wonderful and one great author tackle young love over the time span of Holiday break (really Christmas Eve to Day after Christmas).  Although these stories were very well targeted to the younger crowd (13-18 y/o), I found them \\"cute\\".  You know I love John Green, so that's why I bought the book.  I enjoyed the first story but I sped through it to get to the John Green contirbution.  Of course he blew me away with his portrayal of a teen `racing' his way to love.  The opportunity for `love' not obvious to his main character, but he incorporates all his characters into the finale.  Marueen Johnson  and Lauren Myracle also desomonstrate a young woman's need to find `the one' in the sea of fish.  I read this just after Christmas and I am sure the spirit of the holidays would have moved me more if I read it prior.  They are easy and fast to read, but I kept putting it down.  Johnson & Myracle's \\"I am a doomed teen, destined to roam the planet, single, for the rest of my life\\" drama was a little too much for me.  Green's introspective take on how to approach love via friendship was very real.  Something I can relate to.<br /><br />Johnson adds a lot of starting block humor that kept me interested. Jubilee sees the ubsurdity with her parents obsession, but can't see the forest for the trees when it comes to her own relationship.  When her train breaks down near a Waffle House in Gracetown and she trusts a handsome stranger to take her home to get out of the storm, Julie is forced to reevaluate her her current and toxic relationship.  Stuart, her opinionated looking-glass, wants to make sure that what happened to him, doesn't happen to her.<br /><br />Green's characters are the best of friends, as they've always been, but one friend is ready for more.  Not until a race to the cheeleader-packed Waffle House, sidetrakced with `life or death' obstacles, does the revelation that `more' could be targeted at the male-lead, Tobin.  \\"The Duke\\" or Angie is just a friend, but his vision of her is quickly adjusting.<br /><br />Myracle character, Addie, has found love with a wonderful shy guy but she wants the `Hollywood' happy ending, sequel, prequel, etc..

B004XUMMFE|5.0|The show was fun, exciting, real, and full of amazing storyline.  My only regret is that there is no more story being produced.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I had alot of fun playiny it but it is kind of hard at the beginning of the game.:( i guess thats how they make there money tho.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|There is so much from this move that I love. Palmer Joss had some great lines, asking Ellie to prove her love for her father. Great writing, great effects, well done for the time.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better! Season 3 was great, always keeps my full attention and keep me on the edge of my seat! i am excited to have just started season 4. Five Fringe stars all the way!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|My young son downloaded this today, with my permission, and within minutes had run up a 2.99 bill! I realised straight away as he told me he had gotten some 'free' coins and when I checked had been charged £2.99 for 300 coins. He does understand not to buy things in apps and we have talked about it, however, the way they set it out made it look free and he did not realise. Ok, maybe I was a little naive but I think when a game is free it should be just that. I'd rather pay a couple of pounds for an app and have no more to pay than download these so-called 'free' ones.  App deleted. Complaint logged with amazon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game cause I can play against my friend in Facebook and in person I wonder what next on the world tour STOP
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love that I only have to touch the card once in order to move it and just keep hitting until it's exactly where you want it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This it the best game ever. I have no complains about the game. Mystery manor is the best game out there.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|Without a doubt hands down this is one of the best SciFi television shows.  If you enjoy SciFi you will enjoy this series.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Better than the movie in every way possible. Book 2 was my favorite of the three for reasons you would have to read for yourself but don't pass these books up. And when I read them again (for I know I will) I just might read them in the shade of the hanging tree...
0374275637|5.0|Daniel Kahneman is a renowned psychologist, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics. His work (and that of his late partner, Amos Tversky), and that of a network of colleagues in a similar path, has had an effect on how we see human decision-making. In the social sciences and economics, rationality is a key assumption about human thinking. Kahneman and Tversky and others have put that assumption in the cross hairs of their research. Indeed, some of my own research in political thinking by American citizens is based on this body of work.<br /><br />In this work, Kahneman begins by noting two systems of thinking. System 1 is automatic, quick, and intuitive. It is decision making by shortcuts. Normally, it works fairly well, but it can also lead to bad decisions. When the stakes are low, even the downside isn't too bad. For major decisions? Well, that can be problematic. The operations of System 2 are (Page 21) \\"often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.\\" This is the realm of reason and conscious thinking. System 1 tends to be nonconscious.<br /><br />Part I considers more deeply the operation of Systems 1 and 2. We learn, for example, that System 2 can be lazy and let System 1 \\"do its thing\\" without conscious control over those processes.<br /><br />Part II addresses biases in decision making. This includes the operation of decision making shortcuts, or \\"heuristics.\\" These are tools that assist decision making and make it quick and easy--and sometimes very wrong. For instance, the law of small numbers. Many people are very confident that judgments that they make based upon a few examples are apt to be correct--even though there is scant statistical indication of this. We do not easily think in terms of probability and statistics. Or availability. We often make decisions based on what pops into our short term memory first, that which is most \\"available\\" for retrieval. Or regression to the mean. If someone scores extremely high on the GREs, it is common that the next test would result in lower scores. Why? Many times, very high scores are the result of good luck. Reality will return in such cases, as the next score is likely to revert to a more normal result.<br /><br />Part III? A series of chapters on overconfidence. It is disconcerting to realize that a lot of our decisions are based on shortcuts that can sometimes go way wrong. Worse, there is plenty of research that shows that once people make decisions, they become overconfident in how good those decisions are. Part IV examines choices. One of the more powerful aspects of Kahneman's and Tversky's work is \\"prospect theory.\\" Once more, we see skewed decision making at work--far from the realm of rational cost benefit calculators. One key finding here: People tend to be risk averse when they are in positive ground; people are risk takers in negative situations. Example: If you are getting an A in a course and anticipate that that will be your final grade, you are unlikely to cheat. Why? You have a lot to lose and little to gain. On the other hand, if you're facing a D or F, you are, according to many studies, more apt to cheat. The relevance? Some urge being touch on cheaters as a way of deterring academic dishonesty. But someone who is in bad shape to begin with is less likely to be deterred in  such a circumstance.<br /><br />The last part is a reflection on the meaning of all that went before. Also helpful is that some of the major pieces of research are attached as appendices. These may be slow going for some people, but if the reader can wade through them, they get a good sense of how this book came to its conclusions.<br /><br />A very fine book, well written, that makes important research accessible to a larger audience.he GREs, it is common that the next test would result in lower scores.

B005K17RU0|4.0|The app works as it should and I have no complaints. It tells me the weather....what else can I say?
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Some parts were hilarious! Other parts I skipped over if I thought it was a bit much. Easy fast read that was quite entertaining.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This app is awesome and it's free. I get a lot of laughs out of this app and my family does too.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Kenny Loggins is back...and not.  He so gives himself to this ensemble piece that he never dominates and is never absent.  The harmonies are pitch perfect.  The singers generously swap out the lead vocals, even in the same song.  Background musicians are first rate under the direction of veteran record producer, Peter Asher.  The songs tell of lives lived, suffered, enjoyed and integrated. The sound?  Sometimes a little like the old Poco, as others have noted.  Some songs are vintage Kenny Loggins sound.  A song like &#34;A Thousand Wild Horses&#34; is in a class by itself.  But everywhere the voices are rising, falling and weaving together.  Buy this cd!  Play it several times.  You'll find humming the tunes and savoring the lyrics.  I only hope these three will tour near me and put out more music.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|Was very disappointed withthis movie and Russel Crow was so fat and gave such a bad job of acting that I was embarrassed for him!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is a much watch. One of my top 5 favorite movies from 2012. Affleck was able to make a dramatic/non action movie into a thriller. Great work
B009AMANH4|4.0|Wonderfully portrayed story of the difficultly in Lincoln years In office and the problems that plagued our country. A true history of breath taking moments showing the hardships Lincoln had to contend with in order for this country to be united.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I know this movie got great reviews but I personally didn't like it.  If you want to watch a depressing movie about mental illness, then great.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Beautifully filmed story of two creatures alone trying to survive the elements and each other. One a young boy and the other a big strong tiger caught together on a boat Lost on the ocean. It's like riding a roller coaster of emotions and you are totally connected to the action!
B004SEUJK0|5.0|The writers, producers, cinematographer, director, casting director, dialog coach, lighting tech, grips, even the Best Boy - and of course, the actors: an absolutely superb lot; world-beaters! And Miss Zellweger's English: no BBC-trained posh could have topped her!
B0090SVDO0|5.0|Wonderful music by the Doors!  Would recommend to everyone who enjoys Jim Morrison and who remembers the the drug era in hip America.
B00BVYJG18|5.0|Album is raw and heavy with pounding riffs and great vocals with Jesse back at the helm.<br /><br />If you like older KSE, then what are you waiting for.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Did not enjoy the singing and found it distracting and interfered with the whole story. The actors are very accomplished in their fields but this story should not have been presented in this way. Needed more non singing parts combined with the singing.<br />L
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm so glad that I can catch up on missed episodes so easily. I buy just the episodes I need and watch them through the xbox on the big screen! Love it!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|While I know that change is a huge part of the Doctor Who experience, I still miss David Tennant. I especially enjoyed this season because of Catherine Tate as his companion. The banter and sarcasm between these two makes for some really fun episodes and glimpses into the doctor's character we didn't get with the love sick companions of the first three seasons. I highly recommend this season and think the finale is one of the best episodes ever!
B001U887M4|5.0|I don't wear shoes in the house and when I started having problems with my feet the Dr, said to get some crocs to wear.  It has done the trick. Sometimes I put my orthotics insoles in them and I hate to take them off.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so cool and fun for all of the world to see what happens if you want to see what happens if you want to be able to see what happens if you have any idea
1554072840|3.0|I felt the book was a bit long winded for a child potty training age. I tried reading it to her while she sat but my potty trainer is at the point where she wants to flip the pages of a book herself so it isn't used much, but the movie was great. She adores the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. It reminds me so much of Temple Run. I love that it has  almost non-stop action. Even off you do die there is ALWAYS a surprise  waiting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surf is a great game. It is a very simimlar game to temple run.  But it's a harder game because it has three lanes.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I couldn't wait to find out what was happening next.  This was my first Kindle book and l now really love my Kindle.  Anyone who enjoys a thriller/mystery will like this book.  Thank you David Baldacci!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book for kids and adults. Go and be kinder than necessary it is a wonder what may come from kindness.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As with the LOR trilogy, Jackson has given us a great epic. Just to watch, the movie is spectacular. The story is as engaging as any ever written. I would recommend this to all that like fantasy film, and even to those who wouldn't normally watch them. Great movie!
0199267170|4.0|I bought this book for my sister-in-law for Christmas.  The book seems to be well written with much scholarship by the author(s) - a new view of Shakespeare's writing.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Watched this with a younger friend who liked it more than I did. Maybe I just kept comparing it to &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34;......now THAT was a memorable movie.
1603427244|5.0|I had no idea that there are so many different ways to cast on and bind off, and that both can make a big difference to the finished piece. This is a beautiful, clearly written and photographed book that made everything absolutely clear to me. I consider myself an \\"average\\" knitter, but think this book could be useful to even a fairly new knitter because it is so clear. Why not learn all these cool options from the start of your knitting career? Great little book!
B00947N6D8|5.0|We loved this movie!  Great for the whole family!  I have a 9 year old and two 6 year olds and they have watched it over and over again!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My fianc&eacute; and I love this show. I wish it was available on Netflix but it's not. Worth every penny on Amazon though.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun little app and a great time waster. the graphics are good and game play is very smooth. finger tapping fun
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|..Great price for the cable and even got the wall plug with it(free)... But down side is it won't charge while I use it at all.. even tried with my old wall plug.still won't charge... guess you get what you pay for..next time I'll get the real one...Good for now I guess
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is an absolute page turner. I Couldn't put it down. The way this boy is telling his story is amazing
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is the 2nd Vidio I rented that had sub titles for the hearing impaired . I have perfect hearing and would  prefer  not to have  sub titles. Thank you, Sandra Irving
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!  At first I thought it would get boring after a little while.  Now I'm hooked.  Makes me have to think and plan.  I think anyone would enjoy passing time playing this.
B009Z5975A|5.0|Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun kids classic movies watched ever
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This case protects my Kindle whether in my backpack or purse!  Its sturdy enough for my work and readings done on it. I highly recommend this case for your Kindle - black is always in style and I am sure you can add your own flair to it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love mlp so wene i saw thise app i literary alomst flipped out. And best of all it's FREE.The only problem was all the advertisement. But i give it a A++ 100 20 STARS HOPE U LIKE IT IF U BUY IT ;)
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book gave me a lot to think about! I've always called myself a feminist. But the stuff she is talking about (the stuff you tell yourself, the assumptions you make, etc) are things I hadn't paid enough attention to. I'm not on a corporate track (I run my own small biz), but it's still all completely relevant. Definitely worth reading. Really want men to read too, because they are very involved (& it is in NO way an attack on men).
B005K17RU0|5.0|If you are having trouble termanating this app download task killer for free and you can delete all running apps.It takes up a lot of space, but it also deletes some of your running apps that are taking up space when your not using the application.And as far a this weather app, it works great.To the people who gave it one star, it must be something wrong with your kindle because it works great.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|In Season 5 Don is married to his young secretary, his ex-wife Betty has gotten rather rotund and may have cancer.  Joan's husband re-ups and returns to Nam.  Harry and Don go backstage at a Stones concert to try and get them to do a jingle. The agency gets a Black and a Jew and this is only the first two episodes.  *take a breath*<br /><br />Season 5 is the best yet.  Kick off your high heels or wing tips, make yourself a cocktail, slip into something more comfortable and enjoy.
B000J103PC|4.0|I'm watched this movie many times & am never disappointed.  My daughter & I quote lines from the movie in certain situations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is suprr fun and very entertaining i can be on it for hours. I can always have fun on here.
0141805625|1.0|I thought that I was ordering the unabridged CD's for the novel Matilda by Roald Dahl, and I waited FOREVER for it to arrive.  When it FINALLY came, I immediately noticed that the running time was approx. 1 and 1/4 hours on 1 puny CD - what a RIP.  I was sooooo disappointed.  I called my local library and they had the unabridged CD's.  They were available for pick up the next day.  The dramatized version that I received is soooo pitiful.  DON'T waste your money or your time.  We use Amazon constantly, and this is our very first disappointment.  In the future we will avoid The Book Depository like the plague.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie was so stunning in it's color and special effects. It has a message for the entire family. Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a good app for all you horse lover's out there almost any horse is avalible on this game I recommend it
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I think it helps to have lived in the 60's and love Alfred Hitchcock's films to fully enjoy this movie. Now I want to watch \\"Psycho\\" again! The actor that plays Anthony Perkins (James D'Arcy) is a dead ringer and should of been given more screen time. Actually the filming of \\"Psycho\\" should of been given more screen time. Highly recommended.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|another winner, always fast paced.  more storylines with each character taking center stage. this series just never gets old or boring.  love it!
B000FA675C|4.0|I am not the best reviewer in the world but I liked this book.  So many books get to be ho-hum about half-way through and I could care less if I finish.  This one has action and intrique and keeps you guessing.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|After season three, all fans of Downton will be happy to know a fourth season is in the offing. It cannot fail to please after hitting a home run three consecutive times. Season three does not disappoint, and leaves us wanting more and more after the final episode. Too bad we here in the US have to wait longer than the British fans to find out where things go from here.<br /><br />This is the best series that's been on TV in many years. Classy, opulent, true to life at the time, and loaded with good acting and interesting characters. When a series draws one in and you begin to think you're part of the show, you know it has to be good.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|True story that includes snapshots of the life of a surfer in the west coast. California coast is depicted in detail and Gerard Butler once again proves he can play any type of role.
0563486430|5.0|The book came in great condition and I read it straight through.  I loved the story and after having read it only about 3 weeks ago I am ready to read it again.  I love David and Billie in this book.  I can see their characters in my mind as I read the story and I really enjoyed it.  Too bad it couldn't have been longer!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book and the whole series. I love the characters. I fell in love with peeta when I first read the book. The movies can't be perfect but I still adore the movie and the movies to come.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am a 66 year old white male who doesn't care much for royalty stuff.  I would have been on the ship in Boston Harbor dumping tea into the water but I am totally obsessed with Downton Abbey.  Please not Matthew.  I can't believe that I have to wait until next January for my next fix of Downton Abbey.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|We are not &#34;into&#34; motorcycles, but you do not have to be because it is so much more than that. The show gets even better with each new episode.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I  love car racing and Steve McQueen.  This movie gave me my fix for both of them.  I really enjoyed it.
0800141849|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and own it on VHS so, I really needed to own it on DVD! Oldie, but goodie.
B007712XAU|5.0|I enjoy anything that Harlen Coben does and I know this was one of his first books and that he didn't care for it but I did.

B0017SWSCW|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Arcjjer is good reding.  A nice change of mystery writing.  Will read more of his books.
B00A7ZX4RO|5.0|Hands down, Rihanna's best album yet! Feels like you're on a psychedelic journey the whole way through. A Mind-blowing experience! #Obsessed!
B002XTBEDI|4.0|I've watched &#34;Return to Cranford&#34; twice and enjoyed it very much, but not as much as the first. Most of the original characters are here and so the acting is sublime and the story engaging. There are, however, a few loose ends and moments that feel contrived. The streets are so clean that the town looks like a set designed by Disney, but the costumes are perfect and the love story is charming. The conflict between Harry and Septemus doesn't feel finished, and the death of Harry - No! He's Alive! - is unworthy of the series. Still, on the whole, worth seeing.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well I am a huge Clare Danes fan anyway, but this first episode was captivating in it's pace, suspense, and intrigue.  I am really hooked and looking forward to the long ride.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Entertaining story lines and well-developed character personalities. This series is a natural spin-off from Stargate SG-1 and highly complementary to its predecessor.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|There are many troubled people in the world that have areas of responsibility and power that abuse not only their position, but also the very people that they are supposed to cherish.  This is a moving story of one persons life trial and the way in which GOD gave her a new opportunity at a life of LOVE and security.
B005ER6STG|1.0|Original version could possibly rate 5 stars, this one only 1.<br />Only a minute or two has been deleted, but those horrific flashes of deleted film were needed to make the intensity and power of this film palpable.<br />Among the scenes, two were imperative to the plot in establishing the unspeakable heinousness of the deranged director and in showing what the outcome was in establishing the beginning of Milos' downfall and break from rational, sane behavior.<br />Other scenes cut may not have detracted from the film's plot, but they did dilute from the \\"gore factor\\" quite a bit.<br /><br />The result is that the film's power has been lost and it's imagery rendered impotent in establishing the reaction for which it was intended.<br />A huge, huge disappointment.<br />Best to pay the extra 10 dollars to get the \\"Director's Uncut\\" version if you want this film to have a permanent space in your DVD/Blue Ray collection.<br />Half way through it I was so keenly aware of the cut scenes that it ruined the entire viewing experience for me.<br /><br />It made me furious that my money was wasted on this pale rendition of an otherwise unforgettable film.<br /><br />\\"A Serbian Film\\" is a classic movie of infamous renown that deservedly has it's place in the annals of cinematic history. The film not only aspires to question moral and ethical choices on a personal level, but strives also to serve as an allegory to the plight of the Serbian people and their perceived mistreatment in regard to their history and the government rule that made such a history possible.<br /><br />To watch it figuratively neutered and castrated was a disgrace to the viewer's<br />intelligence, the plight of the Serbian people and an insult to the cinematic vision of the film's director.<br />The producers may have felt that the film served as an allegory of it's government \\"raping\\" it's own people, but sadly in this version the film itself I feel was also violated and \\"raped\\" for greed and profit by it's censorship as well.<br />It may be an exaggeration, but would the film \\"Psycho\\" be nearly as effective as a \\"shocker\\" without it's infamous \\"shower scene\\"? Try to imagine \\"Psycho\\" without it.<br /><br />To pay 10 dollars more for the 2 minutes or so that were cut is ridiculous but necessary if one wants the intended powerful impact for which this notorious film has deservedly become infamous.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|I own the physical copy, and the book itself is fantastic. David Foster Wallace's genius really has room to shine in its daunting 1079 pages. However, the esoteric references and Wallacisms that lend so much to the book will inevitably leave the average reader thoroughly and understandably confused at times. To combat this, fans of the book have compiled a list of spoiler-free page by page annotations located on the David Foster Wallace wiki: [...]    However, when I picked up the Kindle version for reading on the go (the 1000+ page behemoth not lending itself well to transportation), I was frustrated to learn that despite Amazon's claims that the eBook \\"Contains Real Page Numbers,\\" they are nowhere to be found. After contacting Amazon support, they confirmed that Kindle version has no real page numbers and gave me a refund, but the claim on the store page hasn't been removed.    Why are real page numbers so important for a digital book? Aside from the satisfaction of knowing you've conquered 850 of 1079 pages a mere % complete indicator cannot convey, the previously mentioned annotations which grant so much additional understanding to even the most literate reader are almost more trouble than they're worth without knowing what page you're actually on. Compounded with the difficulty of navigating through previous chapters to decrypt the convoluted plotlines or refer to the endnotes, reading the ebook really does become a chore.    Don't cheat yourself out of fully experiencing this amazing journey. Avoid the ebook and buy a physical copy.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book was uplifting.I would reccomend this book to all my family and friends.It is powerful and makes you realize your own power.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Great books all around. I read a lot of YA even as an adult and she just keeps making great books. I already had this in hardcover, but wanted for my kindle.
B003LPR4ZK|5.0|A long and heartfelt correspondence develops shortly after WWII between people who've never met, but who become quite close and emotionally attached even so, despite being all very proper and cordial in their correspondence.  The viewer builds anticipation about an eventual meeting and what could transpire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses! So this app is so fun for me! Much easier than caring for a real house and just as much fun!
B004WR125O|3.0|I love this thing! Small, unobtrusive profile, easy to set up (remember wi-fi password is case sensitive) and works like a charm... for a reasonable price. My signal strength is great, and internet radio sounds terrific via wireless.  It's easier to set up if the receiver (NR 616) has HDMI connection to the tv so you can use onscreen display.  Without that, using the receiver's display makes feeding in the password a bit more tedious... that's what I did ... but it worked just fine.  Happy listening!!!  Update:  This has stopped working -- won't receive signal from router.  Nothing has changed or moved, and the router still works fine, but a few months ago we suddenly stopped being able to get internet radio, or connect to our wifi network at all.  Bummed.  It's less than three years old!  I've changed my rating to 3 stars, because -- even though it worked great, it only lasted for about 2 1/2 years.  That's pitiful, in my book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is very good and is changing about every month which makes it new and interesting all the time.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is so fun I love it. so fun. I play it and my mom does to. it is fun!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved this series. Yet again George R.R. Martin kept me flipping pages. Would highly recommended this series to anyone.<br /><br />Can't wait till Winds of Winter!!!
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|So I order this Item for $209 from the company Helix Camera, Wednesday April 10 and was excited.<br />They said it will be arriving between the 17 and the 23 so it was far from now. I got it April 12 and now I am going to test the New Condition Rode VideoMic Pro. I will write a review when I test it sometime this week.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|One of my favorite animated films of all time. Such a beautiful message for young girls growing up in a world where strong and assertive women are held back. Love, love, love this movie.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Learned a lot about the time period and it was a fun story to read. King still has that creepy way about him but it is cool to have a story set against real factual events. Well worth the time!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Saw the first two seasons via Netflix but was so glad to see if offered here when not available on the other. Allowed us to get all 3 seasons in within a few weekends. Now we're caught up and ready to go for season 4.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Where are the instructions on how to use it.  I keep taking pictures of myself or I have to turn the kindle blindly and try to lineup the camera to take a picture.  NOT HAPPY
B002WY65VU|5.0|Love this Zombie movie.  Double Tap is now the phrase in use at our house when we watch any zombie flick.  This, of course is just for fun.  More serious viewers will enjoy The Walking Dead TV show, which we also watch.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|Yes I like Adele, and when you see the film the song has more impact, also the first bond song to win an oscar which by far has been an oversite because there have been a lot of great bond themes...Congrats and a must have for any Bond fan!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Viewers of the new American series with Kevin Spacey really ought to watch the original British series.  It is deliciously wicked, and free of some of the extra plot lines the American series put in to stretch it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|HBO has done it again, great story taking you back in time to a place where Dragons still rule, I was hooked after one episode and I only get HBO for this and True Blood!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Fun, fast story about a young woman who has been pushed to the edge by betrayal who meets a duke while she attempts to hide from an unsuitable suitor (the only guy who is willing to marry her).  The duke has also been pushed away so much in life and yearns for a different way.  Very well written and exciting! The final push to the end was a little slow for me, but as in all good chess games, the strategy is revealed and the winner is definitely the reader.
B007REV4YI|5.0|As a Bond fan I can say this is without a question this is in my top 10 and Craig is second only to Connery...I read a lot of reviews and people get so wrapped up in small details the whole point of going too a movie is to have fun and enjoy the action and this film does just that. A nice restart with Craig at the helm in his third film, and if you own the box set there is a slot in the end for this film.
B000FA675C|5.0|I loved this book as I do all Dan Brown's.  I thank you for giving it free.  It was so kind of you.
1250027624|5.0|This book is a real must for &#34;Downton&#34; fans.  The photos of the actors are excellent, the format is very quality and it's a wonderful complement to the series.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I happened upon this book entirely by chance, and I am so glad I did! So many laugh out loud and \\"you have to see this\\" moments.  A great find!
1250006341|5.0|&#34;Downton Abbey&#34; fans must add this quality book to their libraries.  Great photographs of the stars in their characters, together with much info about the period and its manners and mores.  What a great permanent record of an unforgettable series.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Kindle folks are missing out on the ability to store items and create and mess around with spells and gems.  I keep waiting for an update alert on my kindle ....hope it comes soon.<br /><br />I enjoy the game a lot but really wish kindle fire players had the same updates that they have for android players. We don't have the ability to store items and apparently there is an entire portion of the game devoted to spells.  I keep waiting for an update and hope it comes soon.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I'm afraid to say anything about this documentary, out of fear that I might spoil the ending.  It's a great watch and says a lot about the human spirit.  Not everyone is looking for fame and money.  Some people are purely seeking fulfillment.  This documentary is about the latter, and it will amaze you.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|A lovely story about looking beyond and embracing the possibilities. Life seen through the eyes of a child. Great story
B000O599ZS|5.0|I've watched this movie so many times but I never tire of it. There's a reason that it's one of the movies Steven Spielberg<br />watches before he makes a movie. There's everything you need for a good drama: suspense, conflict and empathy for the characters. It's the best movie John Wayne ever made. Ethan is a complex character with a questionable background. Natalie Wood was never more beautiful (as an Indian maid). It makes you understand the determination and perseverance that settlers had to last in the West of the 1800's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Need more  more.  Updates  if you do awesome  here's a list turn into survival  to creative and  turn easy medium and hard
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the story for the bargain price. Well written, humorous bad suspenseful.<br />Could have happened for real.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just like Misery and The Green Mile I found myself thinking throughout the day about how long it was going to be until I could pick up reading where I left off the night before. It rekindled my love for a good book.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love the how so many characters have good morals and values. It shows the consequences of immoral character. Love it!
B003U53GK8|5.0|The finale was very intriguing. It reminded me of the movie &#34;Inception&#34; a bit. But I'm not going to talk about it. Just watch it!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book was wonderful and different than the movie.  Very glad I read it. Everyone can lose focus in life and sometimes a friend you don't expect can see you through.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. WORLD TOURS and SUPER MYSTERY BOXES are my favorite part. I wonder where I am going next?
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love jetpack joyride it takes skill to go all of the sectors my high score is sector 7 I want to beat the game
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Tegan and Sara cd Heartthrob is for anyone who loves songs with good melodies<br />and meaningful lyrics.There also touches of electronic and new wave.<br /><br />I love their use of keyboards in the songs,very melodic.<br /><br />Standout tracks are : Closer closer ,Goodbye goodbye, I'm not your hero is very upbeat and catchy song.<br />One of my favorites is the beautiful ballad Love they say us.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|\\"And then there were none\\" is a phenomenal mystery story keeping readers on their toes. The mix of suspense and suspicion makes readers want to keep reading. Readers will be surprised about the end of the book, and I certainly was. This is something to read. But, it is supposed to be Indian Island, and the nursery rhyme uses Indians, not soldiers. Still, it is a great read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead Season 3 was awesome!  There were some real twists and turns during this season and I cannot wait for Season 4!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|this book is unlike any other book I've read. It is full of love and compassion like the others but also,hope, but not the kind that you would think the kind that a girl dieing would have for her life. so im asking you to please read this book and all of the others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The little girl absolutely love this. I would recommend this to anyone that loves animals or even just trying go show there kids responsibility with an big animal such as a horse
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great actors, great story, never a dull moment.  I didn't really want to watch it because I thought it would be too political but it was really good, interesting to read about what really happened too, since this movie is sensationalized.  But Ben Affleck admits he took liberties for the sake of a gripping movie...I think he did a great job.  Also interesting to hear how this movie came about--from an article in Wired magazine.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Best I have seen of Ben Affleck in years. The plot was well structured and the selection of cast to the 6 people was amazing. Would recommend it to others.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love that it shows your last action under your current action. It has everything you need for common daily use in a calculator.  Kudos :-)
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Helen Miren stole the show. Anthony Hopkins was good and the supporting cast was well cast. Could have used some editing.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|My teenage daughter got us hooked on this series.  We started at the pilot episode (via steaming) and worked our way through all the season.  When we finished, we started back at the beginning and watching them all again.  She is getting ready to head off to college in the fall and wants to be able to watch these in her dorm room, so we have purchased all seasons on DVD to pack.<br /><br />This is a series that is funny the first time and every bit as funny the second time.  There are some elements/great lines that we didn't fully appreciate until a second viewing and the episodes still feel fresh.<br /><br />I will say to parents considering this series for their kids:  the series is filled with talk about sex and that is the primary motivator for many of the characters.  Not a problem for the older teen, but I wouldn't have felt comfortable with the subject matter when my daughter was a younger teen.  It is pretty constant and very obvious - not much is subtle.  Just be aware and you may want to watch a couple of episodes for yourself before making a decision.
0525478817|3.0|I so, so, SO wanted to love this book.<br /><br />First, I heard about it EVERYwhere.  It had a lot of hype behind it which should have been my first hint that maybe I had higher expectations than I should have.<br /><br />Second, the whole teenager with cancer is a long time love of mine in books since I grew up reading Lurlene McDaniel books.<br /><br />And lastly, the cover of the book is gorgeous.  Not to judge a book by it's cover, but this is a very pretty book sitting on my bookshelf.<br /><br />All that said, I didn't love the book.  I'd say I liked it.  I liked it enough to finish it.  Or maybe I was just curious or hopeful that the story would get better?  Either way, it never really did for me.<br /><br />My biggest issue was that I had the hardest time believing the story line.  The author never made me feel like I really believed what was happening or that these characters existed.  Maybe there was a point to that?  Maybe if I over analyzed the book I could see more to it than that.  But really, when it came down to it, I just didn't buy it.  At all.  And I wanted to.<br /><br />I did like the book.  I did enjoy parts of it.  Which is why I gave it three stars.  I think had the author just toned down the whatever it was that made those characters seem so fake to me, then I would have loved the book.  Unfortunately, there was just something missing for me.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|So...the book is well written and the story holds your attention throughout.  There are some things left hanging or unexplained that really should be better covered, but this does not detract from the general backstory.  I'm not a big fan of the video game, but still enjoyed the book.  I'll go on and read the rest of this series; if it's as good as this first novel, it will be worth the read.
0345529057|5.0|We got these real fast and I just love them. I started reading the first one immediately and am so happy and surprised to find that the movie Game of Thrones is following the books exactly! It makes it even more fun to read the books then watch the show. It puts faces to the names and really brings it all to life.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|i have always dug Andrea Boceli's  voice  however this feels  so  contrived and  force  like its nobody's  business.  him and David Foster trying to make  Boceli  more  appealing  to  who again though? I mean Boceli  crossed over  big like  15 years back.  so why have him teaming up with Jennifer Lopez? I mean it  ain't gonna mean  a  Julio Iglesis and Diana Ross\\" all of me\\" part two almost  twenty years.  the arrangements and the overall gloss of  this  album  just  feels  like a  not needed push into something and it feels  stale and stiff where it shouldn't.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game takes up quite a bit of space but it is totally worth it. AND ITS FREE!!!! I highly recommend this game to EVERYBODY. its just one amazing game. 5 stars all the way!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|love it! i have yet to read a nicholas sparks book that i havent loved but this one is really great!  love the characters and the story!!!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this mic for clarity on the voice part of instructional music videos. For the price, it does a really great job.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I have played both Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts for the DS. Loved them both. I purchased this for my iPhone 3GS but then upgraded to the Note 2.<br /><br />So far it has been immensely fun. The levels are quick and short but entertaining. My one main complaint is that it crashes. Not to the point of me throwing the phone against the wall, but it does crash.<br /><br />To anyone complaining about IAPs for this app, for this app it is not all too bad. You pay less than a dollar for the main game, then less than a dollar for all levels past the first fifty. It's two measly dollars for that.<br /><br />Then it's a dollar each for an avatar pack. For less than a meal at many fast food chains you get the full game. And people with only a dollar can get the base game. Win win.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This show (for those who don't know) is based off of a comic book series. Although the show strays away a bit, it's a great tv show. In my opinion, it's in the top 10 shows on tv. Being so different from the comic, you never know what is going to happen next. If you haven't seen it, I would strongly recommend it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was spot on for the book, and did an amazing job portraying the dystopian universe of the future.  A must watch.
0316286850|3.0|Making faces is a great book choice for new beginners. It has great pictures and easy step by step instructions.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|The story was alright, the special effects were good.  Some of the major scenes were to fast paced for the streaming to keep up eith.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Mahjung is a fun game, entertaining and challenging. A good stress reliever. Keeps the mind alert and helps falling asleep at night.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|This is a good fast paced story.  Not based on a real life incident, although it does incorporate some real life facts.<br />Includes a lot of sexually content and hardcore drug use.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Dark Shadows is a very good movie with some over the top scenes, but still good acting job by some fine actors.  Tim Burton came threw on this movie even though many bad mouth it.  What I enjoyed about the movie was the music by Danny Elfman, the special effects at the end of the movie stunning, plus major props to the make up crew on Johnny Deep's face as a vampire.  I will label this movie as either your going to like, love it, or hate it.  But like many movies if you watch it with an open mind and make up your own mind then you might enjoy it as much as I did.  From the very start I was intrested in the movie, and it never made me lost intrest maybe because I am somewhat I hopeless romantic and if it takes centuries to be with your own true love then so be it.  I was proud of Johnny Deep's character for never giving in to the evil women.  The other actors did a good job with the characters they were acting as and what they had to work with.  I still give it a four star rating never giving into what other people say about particular movies just make up my own mind about movies I think I will like or know I will enjoy. It wasn't a waste of movie or time and great add on to my collection.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|The story was alright.  It didn't seem to be as funny, heart warming, true, of exciting as I thought it would be.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|Uninstalled it after only a couple days.  My phone slowed down, lagged, etc.  Use ABP on my computer but will not on my phone.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|This is a fun fast paced story.  The story is good, the acting is good, and the special effects are good.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Not for the faint of heart, but worth watching. Excellent cast and storyline, can't wait for Season 3 to start.
B005S39YGU|5.0|Great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great we love watching the Big Bang theory.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Do you want to read the Bible more, but don't know where to start? There are several reading plans to get you to spend time in the Word. Some plans are short, some are long. There are topical and devotional ones, there is one to suit your needs and interests, and new ones are added all the time. It is also easy to look up verses and specific passages. You can highlight and make notes . The app can remind you to read and you earn badges by reading. I love this app. It works great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B003VW8GT6|5.0|When I grew up my Dad was a John Wayne Fan, and he would watch them all the time. Now that I'm an adult I find myself looking for those good shows that are entertaining but not all about sex, and blood. This is one of my all time favorites. I wasn't even born when John Wayne or Ricky Nelson were alive. Its still a great movie!!
B007TML4EI|4.0|I got this free one day from Amazon, not sure I would pay a whole lot for it. Fairly challenging to protect your dummy from some of the bombs.
B008XCM18Q|3.0|I have read all of the Bourne series by Robert Ludlum now, just not in order. Much better than the movies , no comparison.
B008KE3960|3.0|I liked it so much that this is one of the few games I actually played enough to win. I never did earn enough points to get the best planes; I'm not sure how to get them unless you play for hours and hours after beating the game. Or paying for them, which isn't worth it.<br /><br />Controls work well.<br />Somewhat of a challenge on some levels<br />Decent mindless entertainment<br />Good for being free, probably wouldn't pay much for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game- I like that the save feature was added- also I like the different locations....love this game, recommend for download
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game i love it so much my sister my brother my dad my mom and i love it very much.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've passed over most of Ken Follett's novels for years - his Century Trilogy (2 of 3 pubbed) is outstanding.  We never got to the 20th century in any of my history classes - the novels shed light on the machinations behind WW1 and WW2.
B00C32R64G|5.0|I've been listening to Volbeat for since their Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood release and have always found them to be infectious, upbeat and energizing, but this album really amps it up.<br />Former Anthrax lead guitarist Rob Caggiano's production influence is definitely felt here and gives this album a harder edge that lends itself perfectly to the Volbeat rock/heavy metal/rockabilly style.  His featured guitar shredding is a very welcome addition also.  Like previous Volbeat releases, this album is infectious and energizing and while still upbeat, I feel it's just slightly darker tone could be a real sweet spot for Volbeat.<br /><br />There isn't a song on this one I don't enjoy, but for me the standouts are:  Dead But Rising, Room 24, The Hangman's Body Count, Doc Holliday and Our Loved Ones.<br /><br />Something really came together on this one and there seems to be a synergy happening quite unlike I've heard in Volbeat in the past.  Although I would have liked a bit more low-end, the production is tight and the songs are cleverly crafted.  If you're a fan of the Volbeat style and energy, you should like this one.<br /><br />This one's Fire in a Bottle in my opinion...so uncork it and prepare for a dark explosion of Volbeat happiness.
B0087EACJK|4.0|I Got it for my grandson, but started playing it myself.  It requires more chess-like strategy than other video games.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|...and better than ever.  Do the math..it's easy...<br /><br />a great Doctor  1<br />  sexy companion  1 = a great veiwing treat
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great science fiction writing with a sense of humor. I love all the actors. Since the series ended, I started watching it again from the beginning. The overall story makes more sense as you watch the pieces falling together. Fun to watch.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|Great all star cast and great location.  Some tension and suspense actually develops as the movie progresses.  SPOILERS: the good guys win.
B00190N4E4|5.0|Great job in all departments and very well captured life of the Mahatma. Sir Ben did a great job and well deserved recognition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Been following them since Season 1.  Once in a while I go back and watch that first espisode.  It was sooo good.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show is seriously funny. I usually don't watch MTV stuff but I loved this. I watched the first and second season in less than a week because it was so good.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Good movie; kept my attention; very good cast with good acting.  Can't say this about many movies I've chosen lately.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I became on hooked  on Fringe about halfway through first season.  The characters are very interesting and the science is plausible yet sometimes outlandish.  The series seems to get better as it progresses.
B003GSLX5Y|4.0|I feel strange giving this classic only four stars, but it's only for the ebook and even then it's only for the formatting.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Naomi Watts at her best, but all of the cast is great.  Exciting through the whole movie. I will watch again.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This was a clunky game with navigation issues. Story starts off as interesting, but any game that requires hints just to do basic things isn't very good. Also, you have to click X twice when zooming an area, it gets annoying. Just badly designed, and acting was not the best.<br /><br />This is not as good as their order game, Epic Adventures: Cursed Onboard. That one was so excellent.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|While I do love the way Anne Hathaway as Fantine sang &#34;I had a dream&#34;, my favorite song is when Hugh hackman as Jean Valjean sang his song crying out in repentance to God and decided to change the direction of his life and basically give it back to God, was my favorite! I wanted to sing and cry out to God right along with him &#34; I repent take me know Lord&#34; I cried all 3 times i saw it in the theater and again once I got my DVD at home! Love it ALL! I also loved the ending when you get to see all those who died singing as though they were cheering on those still alive and fighting/running the race laid before them! All around great musical!
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|Songs that stick in my head, this is his best album since 1991's Rumor and Sigh.  It includes some acoustic songs too and I'm glad because they are great songs.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've used many apps, including the integrated Chrome and IE readers. So many that perform so little.<br />The singular task every other RSS app does is poll a list of feeds you have judicially selected.<br /><br />The reason for reading a feed is to have a succinct overview of the most current information available in a format that presents synopsis of the article for you.

B000FCKC4C|3.0|I found this book interesting, a bit disappointing, refreshing and rewarding.  The author writes a rather complex story, he incorporates commons sense and leads you along with his character, toward the certainty and logic of easily overlooked basics of philosophy.  I was never certain where the author was taking me, his writing style seems deceptively naive and simple. I'm unsure if this due to the fact that the book is translated or if the translation accurately reflects the writer's style.  Overall, I found the Alchemist a satisfying, follow your heart tale.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Better than the Twilight series! A must read for those who love to get lost in another world. This book kept me on the edge of my seat for hours.

B009HOU672|5.0|Max Richter has to an extent taken apart the four Vivaldi concertos and fitted the pieces together in a new way, adding some elements of his own. In a way, it's almost -- a in metaphoric sense -- a cubist re-imagining of the works, and as such it's a delightful way to acquire a new perspective on the original. Richter's deconstruction and reconstruction isn't better than Vivaldi's set of concertos. It isn't some sacrilegious travesty either. It's just different while echoing the Baroque composer's vision. As its own piece of music, or set of pieces, its beautiful. Highly recommended.
014241493X|4.0|I really liked the book, and it's probably one of my favorites, since it's John Green I don't see how it could be bad. Even though the story may drag a little sometimes, its really interesting and when you get towards the ending it becomes more amusing and the end is fascinating.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great graphics, fun story. love all of the monsters and snatchin creatures that roam the grounds. wish you didn't have to keep trying for stuff like runes to enter some rooms every time.
0142410705|4.0|Personally, I really enjoyed the book, it's great just as other John Green books, but out of all of them, I thought this one was the least good. The story is very entertaining but I didn't like the ending very much.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game not only offers ever-lasting good times. It's also very easy to control and is worth all the money you pay for it. I recommend this for any device/handheldsystem and for the computer or xbox. This is the best game on my kindle fire. :) Enjoy!!!!!!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I love this movie for so many reasons. Number one, my heart is in Hawaii, and seeing the islands less glamorized, but how they really are (particularly Oahu), just melted my heart. Secondly, the soundtrack is so awesome! I had to buy the CD, too!<br /><br />The story is very touching, as well. My partner hates this movie because of the betrayal subject matter, but i think it added a level of sadness to the story that was very endearing, and moralizing. This movie changed my mind about George Clooney whom i thought was unconvincing as an actor. Now i really appreciate his skill.
0670026638|5.0|\\"A Tale for the Time Being\\" by Ruth Ozeki is a Zen meditation on failure and success, mortality and immortality, the pull of culture and history, and the strength of moral courage and compassion.  Although its protagonist is a young Japanese-American girl, the story's central questions are deeply metaphysical, asking us the nature of true knowledge and happiness.<br /><br />The story unfolds with a 16-year-old girl texting her 104-year-old great grandmother from a Tokyo fantasy cafe with a risque French maid theme.  The girl's name is Nao Yasutani.  We find out that she is an only child of Japanese parents who lived for a short time in Sunnyvale, California, when her father worked as a software programmer for a video game company.  Not just any software, however: he was hired to concoct programming that would simulate real-life warfare, and to infuse the experience with excitement, fun.  We learn that he was fired years ago, and moved back to Tokyo in disgrace.  His life in ruins, he turns to desultory ways of spending his time: putting around a one-room Tokyo apartment like a loser in his old clothes, making up a fake new job, gambling on horse racing, taking sleeping pills, going on aimless walks in the middle of the night, committing half-hearted attempts at suicide.<br /><br />Nao's story comes to light because of a narrator who shares the author's name of Ruth, living with her husband Oliver (also the name of her real-life counterpart) in Desolation Sound, British Columbia.  Immediately, these names clue us in on the post-modern nature of the story.  The stories are intertwined in a self-referential way, and some literary mischief is afoot.  Ruth is a writer and Oliver an environmental artist.  One year after the 2011 tsunami that caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Ruth finds a plastic envelope along the beach on the Pacific coast.  In it are Nao's diary and a packet of old letters.  Nao's diary is hidden inside the covers of a hacked copy of Proust's A laRecherche du Temps Perdu.  Through Nao's diary, we learn of the fate of her family.  Her story features the 104-year-old great-grandmother, Jiko, who tells a fascinating story of her own.  Jiko slowly reveals her history as a budding feminist in early twentieth century Japan, and the lives of her three children, who all pre-deceased her.  In particular, her painful story reveals a sensitive, scholarly son who was conscripted into the navy during WWII to become a kamikaze pilot.  His story of the hardship and hazing suffered during training, his moral objection to the war and in particular, to his assigned role, and his forbearance of his circumstances by intellect and courage, are heart-breaking.  He writes official and secret letters to his mother, the latter in French, because they would evade censorship, and because he finds solace in the words of French philosophers and writers he has studied in college, including Proust.  Because of her son, Jiko has renounced hatred and vowed to live as a Zen Buddhist nun in a remote temple.  Fluent readers in Japanese, Chinese, and French will have deeper enjoyment of the texts of letters and names.<br /><br />Jiko enters Nao's life when her father realizes she needs help that no one else in the family can give her.  Nao reports the difficulties of being an \\"American\\" Japanese in a Japanese high school, one without connections and status, and therefore the butt of cruel pranks, the victim of bullying.  She describes in painfully plain speech the bullying which follows her from classroom to the internet.  She begins acts of self destruction.  The internet cafe from which she texts is a place where older men with school girl fetishes find young girls, like Nao, for prostitution.<br /><br />The book is beautiful dovetailed between Nao's and Ruth's voices, and the generational connections between Nao's great-grandmother, her great-uncle, her father and Nao herself are intricately presented, like an intense puzzle.  We learn thatJiko's Zen Buddhism contains great power, not from pacifism, but from silent resistance.  Zen engages in active debate with our better natures confronted with the forces of destruction, both natural (ecological disasters, tsunamis) and man-made (aggression leading to bullying, war, rape, murder).  It is a testament to Ozeki's art that the Zen message is subtle yet powerful, and the stories feel authentic.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book comes at the unsatisfying end.  I feel that the book could have resolved without a modernist literary trick involving debatable physics.  The author cites Rivka Galchen, whose work I dislike.  I feel manipulated by an author who wants to put me in graduate school for literary theory.  No, it's not that I find the concepts too difficult--- the deconstructionists have, after all, already done autopsies on stories long ago.  I feel that the meta-story aspect (think Inception or any other story that questions whether the story-in-the-story or the narrator are actually fictitious) detracts rather than adds to the story, and is an unnecessary nuisance.  The last chapter, with the dialogue between Ruth and Oliver, feel inauthentic to me, a mini lecture about reality.  I know it ties into the Zen concept of the \\"time being,\\" but I don't think even Jiko would find it amusing.
B00821OX98|5.0|We started watching this in the second season and really liked it. With Amazon Prime we were able to get the first season and catch up on all the action.
B005LAII80|4.0|On the face of it, this movie doesn't sound like it is going to be up to much.  Minimal plot (two judges, one Dredd the other a rookie have to enter a huge tower block in pursuit of some bad guys, and have to work their way up the mega-block to the head honcho at the top, killing bad guys and trying to survive as they go), lesser known actors, limited budget for sci-fi actioner and a director who although he showed promise in Vantage Point, has spent a lot more time in television than the big screen.<br />And yet!  With all this to overcome, it works.  The milieu and the characters are interesting enough, the action brutal and undiluted enough and crucially the direction tight enough to pull you through and be left suitably entertained.  In stark contrast to Stallone's bloated 1995 version, this movie gets straight to business, and business of the day is an `average day' in the life of Judge Dredd.  Instead of all the backstory and character explanation, screenwriter Alex Garland has Dredd and his psychic rookie bringing their judgement in some innovative ways, hinting rather than ponderously explaining the essence of the character - although you could argue that the biting satire intended with an all powerful judge and executioner is somehow lost in this interpretation.  It's an extremely effective storyline for delivering what the fans want, while allowing a fresh audience in - all in a manageable budget.  Satisfyingly, the punches have not been pulled - no pandering to the censor here a la Taken 2 or Die Hard 5 to ensure a rating allowing the widest audience - the violence is brutal and gore is not short on supply, making this not one for the squeamish.  Although I'm not a huge 3D fan, if you do watch this in 3D the effects are quite satisfying - it benefits from being actually shot in 3D, and not \\"dimensionalised\\" in post production.  Even the music works - neither traditional or melodic, it's a pulsing and throbbing industrial score, which serves the material well.<br />Karl Urban manages to be less the `man with no name' and more `man with no face', channeling Clint Eastwood's minimalism into his demeanor and raspy voice, managing to convince you that there is a man behind the mask without resorting to removing the helmet, and Lena Headey is also a wonderful surprise as the villainess.  In the end though it is the lean script and tight direction that make this worth watching, despite the fact that ultimately it is a lengthy series of people getting killed which doesn't actually amount to much.  It has enough of a character study in it though, that I'd be interested in seeing Urban reprise the role, even if the weak box office appears to make it unlikely.
B0086449YA|5.0|I bought this CD because I am a devoted fan of Mark's music going back to the Dire Strait's beginnings.  If you are new to Mark's solo work or all of Mark's work incl. Dire Straits don't start here.  Better start with Sailing to Philadelphia or any of his Dire Straits material.  This is a collection of outstanding songs that reflects a maturity of musicianship that other classic artists lack.  Mark's playing, harmonies, lyrics (Seattle is just amazing !) just keep on getting better.  OK, this album is VERY laid back but who cares ? I just chill out to this album whenever the mood takes me which is usually every day.  Go for it !  If you like great music, musicianship, lyrics and production to match you won't be disappointed.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|funniest movie ever made love it DANNY MCBRIDE IS THE GREATEST WHO EVER LIVED he needs to make more movies.

0385349947|4.0|This is a must read for women...and men. I'm grateful Sheryl Sandberg had the inner strength, confidence and drive to shine light on this important but silent issue. I'll be reading this again and again. THANK YOU!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A game you can't put down, once you start! I have to say this game really makes you keeping going just to win!
B000HX4ZF6|3.0|i have watched this before and liked it for what it is a movie but when my daughter came home needing to write a paper about this and how it was accurate or inaccurate  and we sat down and watched it together I could see the obvious flaws and as she started to do the research it came to be more obvious how little I actually new about this time period and how the film hardly got anything correct. I gave it 3 stars because if you watch it just like a movie and don't  care if the accuracy is there it is good but looking at the lack of accuracy kind of ruins it for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4--I am sure it will be as good as the other shows! Watching for the new series!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good game but you do have to wait for the energy to replenish each day to continue to play or pay for energy items.  Forces you to pace yourself.  Wish the game gave out more items each time as well.
0811875555|5.0|The book is absolutely amazing. It shows you so much concept art for every charcter and setting, from the begining to the finished movie.  Also every body of text has some thing intriguing to say. I gave it five stars because of that.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice graphics, easy to use and fun.  Only wish there were more free collections. Love the ability to get edge pieces only and the ability to change the number of pieces depending on how much of a challenge you want at that particular time.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie at cinema and cried throughout, delighted to find it on DVD at Amazon.  Watched it tonight and again was reduced to tears!  Fab well made film that shows the devotion of mans best friend based on s real story.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game which is really addictive, but as I've found with similar games the only real way to progress is to spend money, and I've also found the constant requests to like and post pictures on Facebook annoying too.
0141031484|4.0|An excellent book that explains clearly how probability and statistics affects everyone, or rather how not understanding randomness causes most people to over or under-estimate the likelihood of events.<br /><br />In particular he demonstrates how irrational human beings are when it comes to understanding:<br />- black swan (rare) events and planning for them,<br />- that events with (seemingly) positive correlations do not necessarily mean that one causes the other, and,<br />- that randomness and uncertainty (i.e. luck) have a greater influence on the outcomes of human activities than most people, even those who think they act rationally, care to believe.<br /><br />While written fairly clearly, I will admit that I had to read some sections more than once before I understood exactly what the author was saying, even though I have, or thought I had, a better than average understanding of probability and statistics.<br /><br />Now at least I have a good understanding of why I act irrationally even when I know the true probability of success in some activities, such as when buying lottery tickets.
B007ZUTNF6|5.0|A must read. It's a great precurser to undersatnding frequency and our reality. I recommend this book before the reader goes into later publications on frequency.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I &#34;TVo'd&#34; all of season 3 until I could watch season 2, which I have. I watched 4 episodes (1 disk) of season 2 at one sitting! Then the 2nd disk the next day and the last disk the 3rd day.  I have 3 more episodes of season 3 to watch and I'm hoping there will be a season 4! I love the way the story doesn't drag on with minor details but moves along fast enough to keep your attention without missing anything. Wonderful!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved this movie, the special effect are great and this copy was even better with the 3D, the quality was great! So cool and i saved $10 compared to Sam's Club.
B0095P29EG|5.0|This is a fun movie. It has a good storyline, but if you are looking for great depth this isn't it.  Truly, it's just good entertainment.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I really enjoy this game!  The only thing I don't like about it, is that you have to buy more levels.  They should be free.

B005HED11Y|5.0|Obviously, the effects are cheesy but if you can't get yourself to look past that and love this series for what it is then watch Baywatch or something.

B007PVHANM|5.0|Since I was a 7 years old living in Jamaica, I have listened to BMW.  I have watched many other stories of his life history, but none captured the essence of how his life impacted particularly those around him.  I always wondered why the Wailers departed; how Rita felt about his numerous \\"baby-mothers\\" and from all the reggae artist in Jamaica, why was he so much more popular.  Now I know<br /><br />Music tracks through the feature spanned his first to last recordings.  It is 3 hours long and it felt like 30-minutes.  Whether you have seen several other biographies or none, this is must-see TV for casual and hard core fans of Marley
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It's a nice app, but there's not a ton to do with it, which is fine because you're just listening to music. One handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app. All in all, nothing bad to say.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is the best example of giving the audience the feeling that they are living the life of the character. In this case you are looking through the eyes of Nash, a bright and smart individual who posses huge potential but has one flaw schizophrenea
B005LAIII0|1.0|Long and boring.  Beautiful filming! But the movie is one of the worst I have seen.  Rented from redbox, so only spent $1.79, and that was too much.

B000FA675C|4.0|Dan Brown is a hell of an author, blending facts and fiction with an imagination that is way over the top, yet within the realm of &#34;believable&#34;.

0345803485|2.0|I must admit this is the first book I've read since college and I found it difficult to read it all the way through. The characters Anastasia and Christian are just too unbelievable that they were totally unrelatable. I could not believe that any woman would be so naive and desparate to give herself to a man completely, even a virgin, the more I read the angrier I got until I was at my limit. I don't know what happens at the end of this book and honestly I don't care to know, it was just irritating and redundant. Constant lip biting, hair smelling, chin grabbing, inner goddess, gray eyes gazing, blah blah PLEASE !!!! Plus, the page upon page of \\"oh my\\", \\"oh crap\\", \\"s***\\", and big words I had to stop to look up in the dictionary to know what they meant. This book is Fifty Shades of Frustraion and Nonsense.....

B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I watched the first two episodes with the only expectation that the Brits are raving about it.  I didn't know what the plot line was going to be like because I steered clear of the spoilers on BBC Ones' facebook page.  After seeing \\"Episode 1\\" and \\"Instinct,\\" I am hooked.<br /><br />BBC has been creating such great original shows recently.  So original that American shows are creating copy cats.  [[ASIN:B004QOB8SO Sherlock: Season Two]] meets CBS's Elementary [[ASIN:B009IJJ8UM Pilot [HD]]].  BBC's [[ASIN:B003IMERF6 Being Human: Season 1]] meets Sci-fi channel's[[ASIN:B005GP7EEE Being Human: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]].  BBC has fresher shows out like Copper and Ripper.  And I have a feeling that these shows might be copied too.<br /><br />That quote - \\"What would your clone be?\\" Was on one of Orphan Black's facebook status.  It's a great quote and should be used as their advertisement ads.<br />I don't know how Tatiana Maslany can pull off portraying so many characters.  One minute she's a \\"dragon tattoo\\" \\"punk rock whore\\"  to being a cop, soccor mom and rich German gal.<br /><br />A little warning here, there is nudity, bad language, and violence.  It even gives a warning before the show starts.  That said,  I love this show.  It's my new favorite.<br /><br />*** Spoiler to Episode 1****<br />There is nudity and a sex scene.  That may or may not have been warrented to show the beginning action.  However, Sarah is pretending to be this man's live-in-girlfriend.  And in that case, ignoring sex would have caused suspicion.<br />*******End Spoiler******<br /><br />I can't wait for the next shows.  I want more.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey engages you in the characters.  It is like watching Upstairs Downstairs.  Both have their problems and issues.  Neither is immune from life's trials.  I love the clothes, the house and seeing how a class of people lived in a time gone by.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I have been eagerly waiting new material from Bowie. Since his heart attack, one didnt know if he would record a full album again. Lucky for everyone, he was spending his time writing fantastic songs.<br /><br />The album seems to reflect on his life, and his past recordings. The drum track for 'Five Years' off the Ziggy Stardust album appears in a fade out, and there are noticeable nods to earlier songs and albums, but in a way where its more of Bowie acknowledging the past while definitely moving forward.<br /><br />If you are a Bowie fan, this album was worth the long, long wait. If you never really listened to Bowies work before, give it a play and see why he has endured for so many years and remains relevant. Maybe you might not like some of the songs, but you will see that he is indeed an original and a new Bowie album can bring you into a new world.<br /><br />Here is an album by a true master of his craft. Lets hope he can do a tour.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|A really incredible tale for both children and adults.  I enjoyed every second of it thoroughly. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story.

B001S49AQW|5.0|I was first introduced to Georgette Heyer when I was a teenager. I still retread them to this day! Friday's Child is one of my favorite books!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Must admit full season is not over but when I missed one week I immediately went to Amazon to see the show.<br /><br />Just hoping the characters don't become so large in number that it becomes confusing to the viewer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft or survival craft that's what I thought when I had a choice between these two apps I have heard a lot about mine craft so I got minecraft just waiting for new updates

B008OOYALE|5.0|Love the game but updates need to come out faster other than that it is great it was 99 cents .
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I like to read stories of good ole American history.  This was intended to be just based on facts  but it reads so true from what I know.  What a good book to read and a lot of places were to good to put down because I really wanted to see where this was going.  I loved the characters and would like to read a follow-up story of what went on with the children after they were grown.  A story I will always think of again and again. Ya' need to read about this \\"Kitchen House\\".<br />..
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|has a few glitches but overall great,the higher levels get a little slow,have to wAITE 24 HRS TO DO MOST THINGS
0525952926|1.0|I have read all of Mr. Follett's books, and enjoyed them all thoroughly.  I cannot believe that he is charging $20 for a kindle book.  I will not purchase this book as a matter of principle until the kindle version is made available at a reasonable price.  Seriously  - ridiculous.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great series! I was hooked from  the first paragraph  of the first book. I recommend this series to anyone who likes to read!
B000FA675C|5.0|Amazing plot twists, fascinating symbols, truly Byzantine story line.  All in all, a great read by an author at his peak.  Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this whole series! So good!! This is the first book I read on my Kindle! It was super cool. Always kept my place and synced between my devices. Super cool!!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book is definitely worth reading. Too learn what this individual had to go through day to day is heartbreaking
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Amazingly well acted, lovely songs.  The singing voices are relatively thin, not operatic, but fit well with the themes and characters.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great DVD.  Love it!  It is a true musical.  Do not expect talking.  Now I can watch it anywhere I go.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I just got this game on my kindle fire hd a couple of minutes ago. I really am enjoying this game. It is super fun for all ages and the car is very easily controlled. Great game!!!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This movie was a family WINNER!!! Everyone LOVED it! I even had college kids at work, borrow it and LOVED watching it! ***** FIVE stars
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I really didn't watch this series when it was on TV. I am now watching it in order and i love it. To bad there are only 4 seasons.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished the Hunger Games series!!! It was an amazing book series. I recommend it to everybody! If your looking for a book filled with excitment, mystery, and love, this is the right book for you.
B009IUH1N2|2.0|I've been playing these mobile games for awhile and the free ones are almost always bad news. Some of them can be clever like Prize Claw where you can play it for a bit and it has to recharge and constantly comes up with incentives to feel like you can progress through it despite not paying for certain things. Or Major Mayhem where it rewards players who play well with lots of ways to get incentive items that you would have to buy with in game money.<br />This game didn't have that option. Didn't have the decency to spare my rewinds in the tutorial. Ya know. The part of the game where I don't understand the mechanics yet?<br /><br />It basically punishes you for not being really good or not being able to do a whole level in one shot which is fine. I'd rather spend a couple dollars and enjoy The rayman jumping game instead. Its far more nicer looking.
B000FA675C|5.0|This story was absolutely awesome. From the first sentence to the last - a story that makes you wonder. Dan Brown is one of my favorite authors, an idol. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|As a dog lover I am always looking for a good book about dogs. After reading A Dogs Purpose and the sequel A Dogs Journey I didn't think I would find anything that was going to be as entertaining as these were. This book was my first download for my Kindle Paperwhite. I am so glad I decided to read this one. This author made Enzo come alive!! I laughed out loud and also cried. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants a funny but lessons learned from a dogs point of view.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first but now you can't make me give it up.  Each show represents a new avenue of adventure and shock.  Thank you writers and actor performances.  I've started Season Two, thank you Amazon Prime.  It is really a pleasure to be a member with Prime and Amazon.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I recommend this app because it is a soothing sound machine, an alarm clock, and it includes multiple wounds in the app itself to fall asleep to.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  A tearjerker too.  Anyone who loves stories about Ireland, about sadness and joy and redemption, will love this book.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Like all the previous Fagan solo work, this album is definitely a must have.  Although still in keeping with the Dan sound he is most famous for, this is another great work by 1/2 of the Dan superduo.
B007ME5BUG|3.0|Has some good insights into war not previously discussed in other books. However, somewhat superficial and mostly rehashes previous history.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Being a Dan fan, I always enjoy listening to their music.  I was blown away by &#34;The Nightfly&#34; when Fagan went out on his own, and now look for all his solo work to add to my collection.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|You download all your favorite videos,I paid two dollars for this app.I love this app! I recommend this app to everyone!
1451695195|5.0|Excellent narrative of a true experience. A must read for anyone who doubts spiritual life. You won't doubt it again.
B005D63ICI|5.0|I just started watching Dexter for the first time in Season 7 and decided I just had to start from the beginning so I bought Seasons 1 through 5 and have loved every single episode. This is one of the best series I have ever seen!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am really surprised they have kept it going for 8 seasons but I still watch and enjoy. Over the years I have watched X Files, Fringe, Grimm, Vampire Diaries, True Blood and others in this catagory. If those type of shows are your thing then this show will be too.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This series is so great that I have purchased all 7 Seasons for my video library and intend to rewatch them with my daughter when she comes to visit me!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The second season was more amazing than the first season! Captivating show! I have been telling everyone to watch the entire series!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I never play this.  I am sure it is great though.  Who has time for games. / / / /
B0012GVKVY|4.0|Quality is good and good movie, there is not much else to say about this bluray, thought there is not much extra to watch...
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I had this previously on cassette tape and loved it.  It's one those few compilations that is good from start to finish.  I was also surprised with a couple bonuses at the end, one a nice French song. - Brad
0142421715|5.0|My daughter read it and loaned it to her friends and they all loved it.  I still need to read it, but I friend of mine did and she loved it.  It's a fast read, great for tween or teen readers.  My daughter says it was a real &#34;page-turner&#34;, she couldn't put it down.
B003U4UNPK|4.0|I had a lot of trouble downloading episodes 17 and beyond. Went to season 4 & 5 then went back to season 3 to try again. It worked and it exp and backward in timelained the next seasons. I like the series but have trouble w/ the going forward
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I always enjoy watching stargate, we need more sci-fi like this. It's been quite some time since the series ended but the show doesn't feel stale or old. I highly recommend the entire series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Stealing from the book, but so appropriate. Amy is the best villain I have come across in a very long time. Gillian has written the best book I have read in a very long time. I couldn't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome thanks for letting this be free I love this game I just love it so much thanks!!!!!!!
B003XTUZIM|5.0|Islands is flawed, but still an essential recording owing to its colorful and searching spirit, its truly innovative passages and memorable, wistful and plaintive emotional finale.  The playing and singing are great, the production is natural and powerful. The music is something you haven't heard before - especially if you were already a Crimson fan. Islands mostly abandons the explosive frenetics and showy virtuosity of the first three records in search of subtler emotional payoffs.<br /><br />Crimson does stubbornly insist on playing the weird shtick at all times, but despite their pretensions, true to their pretentious selves they find honest, buried repositories of feeling that are not usually reached by conventional rock music.  Lester Bangs wrote in his Rolling Stone review of Islands that he thought the mythically overwrought words were pretentious, but also states, not once, but two times, \\"the music is good.\\"<br /><br />If a listener is patient - you can't enjoy King Crimson if you don't ante up your \\"mind-space\\" - when the music ends, you may find strong  and complex emotions pulled out of you.<br /><br />This record is frequently acoustic, but the music is not what one would normally associate with \\"acoustic\\" music.  Islands begins perversely with a squeaky, unaccompanied bowed acoustic bass solo, then enter clusters of hand bells and African shakers more befitting a Pharoah Sanders' album.  As Formentera Lady progresses, vocalist Boz sings softly in his English accent of sun baked Moorish walls on a Mediteranean island.  It's a dreamlike excursion with a bizarrely minimal, relaxing, rhythmic vamp.  There's goofiness in Robert Fripp's oddball, almost moronic acoustic guitar riffing and Paulina Lucas' meandering, mildly insane soprano vocal.<br /><br />Formentera Lady segues into the rollicking guitar/sax instrumental,  Sailor's Tale, featuring Fripp's hot metallic sustained guitar tone and delightful alto sax squalls from the swinging and fluid Mel Collins.  Then, over a hushed, creeping-in-the-dark groove, Fripp enters dramatically with a kranging guitar chord that sounds like a stretched-out electric banjo.  Innovative sounds here.<br /><br />The Letter, with its too-melodramatic verses, fortunately cuts to a pensive brushed-snare, free-tempo section with aspiring sax and clean, ringing guitar - a challenging musical conversation that rises, free falls and lands gracefully. The extremely melodramatic vocal is a nervy and passionate enough tightrope walk to barely avoid plummeting into plain cheesiness.  As imperfect a track as it is, the riskiness and passion earns it its place on the record.<br /><br />Ladies of the Road is a sleazy, slow-burning \\"rock\\" song about groupies with great sounding Beatle-ish vocal harmonies, bawdy strip-lounge tenor sax, and a funny, psychedelic, tortured guitar-gasm of a solo.<br /><br />Prelude: Song of the Gulls is an authentic, waltz-time chamber piece with oboe lead, violins and no rock band.  It's slightly banal, and mildly pretentious too, but played well with a charming, slightly raw touch by uncredited studio players. It does successfully evoke the rugged cliffs and sea gulls along the English Channel and works well as an intro to the album's emotional centerpiece, Islands, the final track.<br /><br />The dusk-like closing is haunted with wistfulness and resignation, like the retrospect emotions at the end of one's life (similar to Jobim's Waters of March). But the music is pleasingly unhurried, simple and understated with distant, quietly slogging drums. A churning, medieval pump organ, Keith Tippett's slightly-out-of-kilter and slightly-out-of-tune piano and Marc Charig's speech-like cornet bleats seem warmly earthen, and human... all wood, reeds and crudely forged brass and timeworn piano strings.  It's a beautiful and moving finale.<br /><br />Islands is an extraordinary, odd, humanly flawed record that doesn't seem to be quite all there.  Not completely satisfying, but compelling, innovative, beautiful and original nonetheless.  I think it's a flawed classic.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a wonderful book!  I have read it several times and will probably read it again.  If you love mystery books, you will certainly enjoy this book!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this is an easy and fun game to play when your traveling around and it does not require an internet connection to be able to play
B0042WXW2A|5.0|This was a perfect product that was exactly what I ordered.  Love it, listen to it often, super happy!!  Thank you!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|The notebook app is good.  I like that I can have several notebooks<br />Although when typing the spell checker changes it to something else and I have to go back to correct it.  Adventurally I get it to keep the spelling I wanted.  Also, the typing is slow. I type but the letters don't appear. There is a delay and some of the letters don't come up.  So the app's spell checker changes it to what it thinks it should be.  I can't figure out how to turn off spell checker.<br />Otherwise it is a good app.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I was home without the kids or husband, so I randomly picked something I knew they wouldn't be interested in, thinking it would be a one-time watch. Fast forward a week later, my husband and I have watched all the shows and are looking forward to season three starting up soon.<br /><br />It's a show about teenagers and the torture that some people seem to find during high school. Lots of angst, love stories, problems with parents, and funny moments. It's definitely a show that I didn't expect to like, but instead I loved it! (For the record, I am 35 years old with three children.)
B0067R0APK|2.0|I would love to rate the app higher, but the radar does not display. It's a beautiful app,  just not fully functional.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not a big reader, but I'm roughly the same age as the author and have the same interests. If you are into video games and other geek culture & know a lot about the 80s, this book is a great read. The pace of the book was good for a modern audience, and I didn't find myself complaining about any bad sections. I hope they actually make this into a movie.
B00838HRP2|1.0|This DVD only works in Europe, not in the USA.<br />My Grandson was very disappointed. I will never do<br />business with this company again.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I really like having all the full features available to me without having to use my laptop. I love the full features now at my fingertips.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|So this movie is one for the glorious movies we have watched but I told them we would if the read all the books and they did so I did. Wild movie I can see why many think is good
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had a hard time putting it down! I look forward to reading the next book in this series.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Excellent movie about the dangers and trials of the WWII submariners from the other sides perspective, well worth the viewing don't miss it!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I am watching it all over again because I think it's well wort my time. It's like reading a great<br />Book or a novel. And also, because I believe that we always see things with a different eye when we see it a second time. I'm sure I missed a lot of great information and great acting the first time I watched it :)
1419553429|4.0|this in a very good product also a nice starting point with tips and info about the gmat test that you want to take.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Ann Hathaway stole the show even though only in the movie a short time. She deserved the Oscar! Excellent acting.
B00915G6YE|5.0|This was a definite improvement over season 5 and season 6. Don't give up on the show yet! Okay, I just thought of this and Showtime should totally do this... When the Box Set comes out after Season 8 ends... They have to have the Box Set be a wooden box like Dexter's blood slides. How awesome would that be! It would open up the same way and everything! They could split all eight seasons into their own sleeves(so like 16-24 or so discs) and have them be like his blood slides. SHOWTIME PEOPLE PLEASE DO THIS.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I was a JC fan before Star Wars came out, so I've been pining for this movie for quite some time...and the wait was it worth it! Andrew Stanton did a great job of translating the book to the screen and wound up creating an epic I can only describe as the Magnificent Seven meets Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is that the action should have raced after the Warhoon attack, but I'm confident the sequels (Gods of Mars & Warlord of Mars) will capture ERB's break neck speed. If only Disney had focused on the historical significance of the movie in their marketing, we wouldn't have to wait so long again!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a sensitive and moving piece about a subject that most of us have never even thought about. the  actors portrayed their roles with compassion and dignity.
B008Y7DWC4|2.0|This was soo bad i didn't even watch the entire movie, i turned it off after about 30 mins. i would not recommend  ... reviewed by Ben
B003YBUSMW|5.0|I'm 58 years old and love to play the racing games with my grandkids,,,, with the wheel I can finally keep up instead of using the thumb stick on the controlers.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! Seeing all the inspirations of others, getting great recipes - wonderful.  I love being able to create my own boards with the pins I find interesting to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game for kids of all ages and sizes it is also a very easy game to play.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Could not put these books down, read all three in less than 2 weeks! A  fantastic read, did not want it to end.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Great watch great looks , personally like metal staps but this watch was great and great look so got a president stile ss strapp and lovo it even more !!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I debated between the H4n and the Tascam line of products, and I eventually went with the H4n.  I do not own a Tascam, so I can not explain the differences between the two, but I will explain my experiences so far.  The case that comes with the Zoom is nice and sturdy.  It only fits the sound recorder, and so I went to a local Walmart and picked up a camera bag so I could place the H4n and the accessories that go with it.  The sound itself is very clear, sometimes so clear that I have to perform multiple takes just to get a more subtle sound.  The interface is fairly straightforward, and a novice like myself who is new to sound design and recording did not have a difficult time figuring out how to navigate the menus.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone who is looking for a quality sound recording device on a budget, or who is new to the field, to try out the H4n.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Pros: Crisp, clear sound.<br />Easy to use Interface.<br />Battery life is decent.<br />2 XLR ports in bottom for additional tracks.<br /><br />Cons: Windscreen is bad for outdoors.  I would recommend a Dead Kitten or Mic-Muff.<br />Accessories are loose and require an additional purchase to carry everything together.<br />Some additional accessories are available for purchase I feel would be better suited included in the package (the remote control for one)
B006Y9BULE|5.0|Great product supper recomend this .<br />Works great bery funtionally and great looks definetly worth the money will get another one for sure.
B000006045|5.0|Bass oriented spatial tones and rhythms,<br /><br />an insanely talented woman vocalist and very good composition.<br /><br />Mellow and fantastic journey grounded by the main male vocalists skillful drone.<br /><br />Praise Jehovah and give thanks for His only Begotten Son Jesus Christ who's name literally means Jehovah is salvation, also meditate on what the Bible says about Jesus - \\"For [the death] that he died, he died with reference to sin once for all time\\".

B007K3JCAE|5.0|Great movie for a great price and it arrived quickly. Very satisfied customer, looking forward to ordering more movies soon.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|With a historic background of a painful truth about the injustice and the pain inflicted on so many by so called righteous institutions, this particular story is filled with emotion, despair and redemption.  It made me laugh and cry.  I loved the candid expressions of wisdom translated in vivid irish dialogue.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Works great and saved a couple of bucks. Whatelse could a happy customer ask for? I would definitely buy another one.
B000002KOQ|5.0|This is iconic early Joni Mitchell -- her third album, from 1970 -- and it's well worth having, but I must enter one reservation: the singing could be better.  Actually, the singing is fine in some really memorable songs (\\"Morning Morgantown,\\" \\"Conversation,\\" \\"Ladies of the Canyon,\\" \\"Big Yellow Taxi,\\" and \\"The Circle Game\\"), but in other places Mitchell deploys the top of her voice with some volume, and the effect isn't pretty, for it then acquires an edge and a wobble.  A couple of years later, in her \\"Court and Spark\\" album, she seems to be much more aware of what her voice can and can't do well, and the singing is consistently better throughout.  On the other hand, to my ears at least, the songwriting is stronger on the earlier album -- not that it's weak on \\"Court and Spark': both albums are very good.  The truth is that nobody writes stuff quite like Joni Mitchell's.  She has an eye for situations and a verbal dexterity that renders them without cliche -- and a musical gift to give each a distinctive musical shape, all the while creating an impression of spontaneity that is in part the upside of her vocal limitations.  One of the reasons we like her is that she kind of sounds like ordinary folks sound when they try to sing.  Or so we think as we're listening.  Doing it is another matter! \\"Conversation\\" is almost heartbreakingly good.  \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\" is magical, and \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" -- the one with \\"They paved Paradise . . .\\" -- is terrific fun.  If you haven't got this, get it.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|This is a great movie for a great price and it came faster than expected. All around happy with my purchase
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I resisted watching, because I knew that it was going to be only one season.  Lots of friends suggested it. Now, as your new friend, I'm doing the same.  Check it out!
B00821OX98|5.0|At first I thought it was....just ok but then it grew on me and now I'm a fan. I would recommend it to anyone who loves good TV.
B009XTF8KQ|2.0|A real \\"by-numbers\\" job, this: derivative and honestly not in the least scary.<br /><br />A good cast wasted on dull material that you've seen many times before.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I've played this on an iPad so am familiar with it and the developer. My only complaint is that the game is going too fast, or maybe I'm too obsessed playing it. Hope you will give the game a try. It is fun.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I'm a long time, avid reader of SciFi/Fantasy and was so upset with the blatant disregard Rice has shown for the profession in an attempt to make a quick buck, that I felt obligated to write a review so others are not conned out of their money/time.  For those in a rush or with a Tweet attention span, I'll sum up here:  When I go to Chinatown, I expect everything to be name brand knockoffs, I expect DVDs to be cellphone recordings from the theater; however, when I go to Macy's or in this case Amazon, I expect the real deal quality product.  For the rest, I'll lay out some facts.<br /><br />As far as the literary deficiencies, one-dimensional characters, repetitive word/phrase use, character name mixups, etc, the other negative reviews do a good job of capturing them well so I won't belabor that.  I'll instead point out the marketing ploy.  Rice is a new author who has written this and two other series in the past couple of years.  Just as this series was likened to successful, quality authors like Tolkien and Martin, the other series are likened to the Twilight Saga and Hunger Games which are currently popular.  Wow, pretty coincidental right?  The titles are amazingly similar too, just interchange some words from \\"A Feast For Crows\\" and \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" to get \\"A Feast of Dragons.\\"<br /><br />These other series are just as literarily flawed and follow the same ploy by producing a novella followed by double spaced, Courier New 12 font, short stories being passed off as \\"books.\\"  The subsequent books get progressively shorter, are very disjointed, but are released monthly for the reader's convenience.  The second and third were so incomplete that they were bundled into what normally constitutes a novel, but at a higher cost of $8.99 than individually totaling $8.97.<br /><br />So, now for the real apples to wax oranges...Below are two excerpts:  one about a legendary sword of MacGil kings and the other a somewhat insignificant sword given to a Brother of the Night's Watch.<br /><br />\\"...He was sure he would be The One. But he was wrong. As were all the other MacGil kings before him. And his failure had tainted his kingship ever since. As he stared at it now, he examined its long blade, made of a mysterious metal no one had ever deciphered. The sword's origin was even more obscure, rumored to have risen from the earth in the midst of a quake. Examining it, he once again felt the sting of failure. He might be a good king; but he was not The One. His people knew it. His enemies new it. He might be a good king, but no matter what he did, he would never be The One.\\"<br /><br />\\"...Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes. The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf's head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black as yet unstained by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a 'bastard sword.' Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again. 'This is Valyrian steel, my lord,' he said wonderingly. His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.\\"<br /><br />So there you have it: Rice = comic book without pictures, Martin = 3D HD movie.<br /><br />To those who keep saying it's Young Adult, please don't insult our youth. Don't drink the Brawndo!
B00821OX98|5.0|Plenty of action and suspense. The CG for the aliens is done really well. The characters work really well together and the acting is pretty good.

B000FA675C|5.0|I enjoyed the various plots throughout this book. It was exciting to read and I will enjoy re-reading it even though I know what happens. I think Mr. Brown has a great imagination.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome!!!!!!The graphics are great and it works great on my kindle! I play all the time and it works great its a bit confusing on how t train but once you get th hang of it its awesome!!!!!!!
1878424319|5.0|As you can see from my rating that I loved the book. I feel that Don Ruiz put every day life in a different perspective. If you choose to take a different look at the world, the people in it, and how you feel about yourself. Your life could become more peaceful and much more.<br />These four agreements that you make with yourself are not easy but worth while, you keep at it and you can feel the difference. Being impeccable with your word is a very useful agreement it makes you more aware of what you say and even what you think in most cases. There are three more agreements that I find useful in my every day life.
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|plain '''simply very very  boring fell asleep trying to watch 3 times<br /> boring fell asleep trying to watch 3 times
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book definitely has a great plot and it keeps you guessing. However, I found myself in Awe at the end of the book. The thought process to come up with such a crazy plot is a bit frightening. Both of the main characters are justifiably insane.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Over-all it is my evermost dependable protection for my iphone 4s, i tried different case protector but i always end up to go back with this case..recommended to all!

B00BHMETKC|5.0|well done movie. john goodman is great as usual. the story is captivating and action packed.i would highly recommend it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My 9 year old has played this so many times I think she could play it in her sleep :-) The puzzle makes you go back and forth on the boards to win and you take clues and tools from one to solve the others.... there are clues to help you if you get stuck which she did use some but she was half way through the game when she discovered the clues... and they don't spell out how to win so she still had some thinking to do... for that reason I gave it 5 stars... thinking is good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is epic it's really fun for kids if you like temple run you will definitely love this game
B00992CF6W|4.0|and now they play on my kindle too.... wait what was I thinking!! LOL but really it lets my kids all play together and work together to mine for things to build up their worlds... my kids are 4,9,9,11& 11<br />It works with kindle and ipad/ ipod users so they can all play no matter which device they are using! Until they start arguing... at least I get my kindle back every now and then :-)

B007BVMVDU|5.0|I am a huge fan of the books, and wondered how well the television show would implement the books.  I found this series to be<br />very well done, and the characters even look somewhat like I had imagined they would look like - good casting!  I thoroughly enjoyed watching them, and whether or not you read the books or not, these shows are certainly worth a watch!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really relates to real life a lot. Like you have to train a horse for compition. like you would in real life. I want to say more but it wont let me
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great alternative to the other &#34;numerical&#34; logic puzzles like sudoku and ken ken.  It's a little hard to play the larger puzzles on my 7 inch tablet, but worth the hassle.
B00992CF6W|4.0|well i love making all of the worlds and stuff but i made this awsome world and it deleted  all the stuff i made on it and i did not press delete. fun but you may lose all your creations.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|An in depth study of some of the characters we have come to know. Love the books. Love the series.
B000FA675C|5.0|Facts packed with thrills. Keeps you engaged throughout. It sure is much more ahead of its predecessor Angels and Demons.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love the books.Love the series.Purchased DVDs of seasons One and Two.  Enjoyed watching the series, but the books are always better.
B005DJREJS|3.0|This role would be tough for any actress because a large part of her job is acting out her thoughts which are being narrated for the viewers sake. The first season was sort of charming because she reacted to her thoughts with a humorous sort of dead pan/slow realization.  In Season 2 however, she's a bit too obvious and campy.  But I'll stick with it because I love the youthful &#34;bant&#34;.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Sort of a sequel to &#34;A Feast of Crows&#34; Further study of characters we have met. Hope I don't have to wait too long for book 6.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 16 as it is a little complex. I love period pieces and this is true to form. The actors are fantastic and the story is great. I had to see it 3 times. Stevan
B00C7LB20C|2.0|The story is scrapped up from every action film made in the last 10 years.  Aaron Echardt puts in his usual solid performance but he can't overcome the lame script.  The woman who plays his daughter is given some of the worst lines and direction ever ... talk about 'on the nose'!  Her character is so whiney and bitter there is little to like.  Pretty much sums up the movie.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|What can I say, he's a charming and wonderful actor. This is a great story line. Pattison portrays a poor man trying to fit into high society. A little beyond his reach. At his age he's got a great career ahead of him.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Lots of prompts and options, easy to get going and gives user feedback<br />if they make a mistake, lots of fun!
B005KLAAFO|1.0|The title says it all. I stuck this disk into my windows 7 professional computer and none of my audio programs would play it or even see it. Window just doen't recognize this disk.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a great game. So addictive. It goes so fast  and I like that. if you don't want to get bored. Just try this one.
B000002N1E|5.0|I bought this album for one song...The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.....Prince at his best.<br />I highly recommend this for anyone who loves Prince.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|A compelling read if you don't over analyse. The writing style is easy and you'll want to read the next chapter to find out what happens..... Good holiday book!
1843119560|2.0|Absence of comprehensive reference to international rules other than perhaps ICC. Limited utility if one is to find other rules such as Citeac, HKIAC which are popular also.  There is limited international element therefore.
B00AG4BZFE|5.0|Bernie Wrightson is more than an illustrator, his artwork could tell stories even without any words.  This book has great examples from a great period and the stories are woth the read.  The kindle edition on my iPad gave a new spin on work I remember reading for the first time in the back issues of Creepy that I compiled by digging through every comic shop I could find back in the early 90's...  This one's worth every cent!
1936594234|5.0|Couple this book with The Science of Getting Rich and YOU WILL GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT...best book.  Changed my life.  I talk to my subconscious every night before bed and it delivers without fail.  I carry this book with me everywhere and reference it consistently in my books Just Ask the Universe and The Universe-ity. It weren't for Joseph Murphy, I would never have been an author. Absolutely amazing!  Get it!  Read it! Do exactly what it says!  If it changed my life - if will undoubtedly change yours...
B007XNAPNY|5.0|The band was totally refreshed after working with producer Mark Ronson on their &#34;All You Need is Now&#34; album (one of their best in ages) and they hit the road to celebrate.  You can tell the band was in high spirits supporting the new material which sounds just as good played side by side with all of the old hits you know and love. Great set list, sound quality, and picture quality. If there is one Duran Duran concert to own, it's this one. Superb.
0345803485|1.0|I have this thing...if I start a series, no matter how bad it is, I have to finish it.<br />Sometimes it is a pleasant surprise (as it was in Twilight - terrible, somehow even worse, decent, interesting &lt;--in order of the books).<br />50 Shades is such incredible drek, I simply cannot bring myself to give one rat's patootie about what happens in the next two books.<br />I mean, who wrote this?  A 12 year old?<br />And what's even more appalling is how many people are simply IN LOVE with this book.<br />Just wow.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|With the official retirement of a-ha, it was unclear if retirement would include suspending solo work too.  Thankfully not, as this is Morten's finest solo work to date. Picking up where the final a-ha album left off, this is a gorgeously produced set of songs with Morten's voice in fine form. The songs are all of the quality to make it as an a-ha single. One song was written by The Pet Shop Boys for Morten, and also appears on the PSB album Elysium. If you're an a-ha fan, don't miss this album. Worth every penny.
B000RLFBP6|5.0|When this movie was first released I thought that given the title it was going to be a bad movie. This was so wrong. This is a great movie for the time that it was made. The special effects are a bit weak at times, but the story is great. The robot is great. The acting is OK but the action keeps it moving and fun.
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|This band is painfully under appreciated in the United States, yet total rock star legends everywhere else in the world - and rightfully so. After a hiatus caused by Marie's bout with brain cancer, she was persuaded to try to sing again and the resulting album, Charm School, spurred the band's longest and most successful world tour to date. While on the road, the band penned new songs and released them as an album while still on the road. They did this same formula while touring in the 90's when they released &#34;Tourism&#34; (also a great buy).<br /><br />These tracks are fresh, spontaneous, and musically diverse. They have the energy of a touring band rather than the sometimes stifling studio atmosphere.  It is a band at the height of their creativity and popularity, and all the fun they're having shows on every track. Longtime Roxette fans won't be disappointed. This is the bands strongest output in years. Pure power pop sunshine.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play, once you pick it up to have a \\"quick game\\" that's it you can't stop playing! You don't need any brains or skill to play it so the whole family can join in. Also has a function allowing multi-play. Great game thank you
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Seriously... this woman has talent. Her voice is a powerhouse, her attitude refreshing, her persona unique. Every song is a rock solid anthem and serves to remind you just how many great songs she's released in her relatively short run. Greatest Hits... So Far! indeed. I'm sure pink has much more in store for us in the future. Definitely worth the Deluxe upgrade as the disc of videos is fun to watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the game is nice but it could have different games to it. I ride horses and horses dont jump like that
B0067LXQAW|3.0|Having been a huge fan of the Cranberries back in the day, I was really looking forward to their comeback. One more chance to hear the band perform.  Sadly, though this album is a far cry from bad, it simply did not reignite my love affair with the band. Sadly, it's not the melodies that are lacking here - they are truly amongst the finest the band has done in ages. It's what has always been a bit of a weak spot - it's the lyrics. Oh Dolores, why of why don't you try harder with your lyrics? It's like they were written by a fourth grader. Here's an example...<br /><br />But it's raining in my heart - Every time we are apart<br />And the sun won't shine today - So I have to walk away<br />If I could fly -You know that I'd try<br /><br />Seriously?! This type of grade-school rhyming scheme dominates this record and keeps me from further listening.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like finding matching items, but it did not have enough levels I think.  Then I had to buy the next level and I am not to sure about it yet.
B006CS7UXO|5.0|Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe are rather prolific songwriters. With each album they release there are usually as many or more songs released as bonus tracks to singles as there are on the album itself.  Many of these tracks are arguably better than the ones that made the album, but for one reason or another, did not. This is the second double disc non-lp track compilation from PSB, and it shouldn't be overlooked. Full of innovative tracks, many of these could have been hits on their own. Definitely not just a collection of throw-aways. Highly recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game I can play it forever.  I love the match 3 games and it has a lot of levels.
075669812X|5.0|This was a gift for my 9 yr. old son who collects Lego Ninjago and watches the cartoon show faithfully.  He loves this book.  Even though he knew the background on every character, he still learned things about them he didn't know.  And the fact it came with a toy was a big plus.  This really keeps him entertained and reading which is another plus.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is good.  I like finding matching items.  This one keeps you occupied. I would like to find more free ones like this.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is another game that you think &#34;one more round&#34;, &#34;one more round&#34; and before you know it an hour has passed.  This is fun and challenging.  What I like is you never get tired of it because just because you've played it once, or 50 times, each time is different.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found this book very compelling.  As a parent, it hit a few nerves.  How well do we know our child?  Are we right to look deeper or are we being disloyal?  This book stayed with me for quite awhile after I finished it.  It's a good read, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it made me think.  I recommend it!
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I thought this looked like fun but it's hard to get it doing anything.  I have a 9 yr old who wanted the game and even he said it's not anything he wants to mess with.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was great, I wanted to see it when it came out in the theater but never made it so when I saw it available on Amazon Videos, I grabbed it, it was great...
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game looks like harmless fun, and it is, but it's easy to spend an hour and not realize it.  I will plan to play a short game and then I do great and move on to the next level, and the next, and before long you look at the clock and are shocked.  But all in all, I really like this game.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|What more can you say about Clint Eastwood, he makes kick ass movies, even if he's not at his prime, he still kicks butt...
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I have a lot of mahjong games and this one isn't my favorite one.  I don't hate it, it's just different from the others.  I do play it when I want something different.  You have to keep rotating the pieces to find a match.  Its a challenge.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Was quiet surprised after watching this movie, it was pretty good, thought it wasn't going to be as entertaining as it was but was pleasantly surprised when it was finshed..
B00271HTLI|5.0|This movie is so well done. It's the best movie ever. I can watch it every day of my life.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|It seemed to have an interesting theme, so I decided to give it a view.<br />It had a few interesting characters, especially Max's teacher, but ths story moved very slowly.<br />Max suffers with terrible headaches, and I think the director spent way too much time on this malady, scene after scene after scene.<br />The sounds effects were particularly bothersome....an incessantly ringing phone lead me to stop the movie and<br />look for something better.<br />I wish I had a better review, as the description of the movie really did capture my interest.
B009KEN87O|5.0|just finished it in normal mode today.  space invaders, Galaga,breakout,Ferris,and asteroids are all parts of this game.  best game I have played in a long time.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Yet again it's another amazing book series!! I can't wait to read the rest of the Beautiful book series. Truly amazing!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I mean who ever created this game I love it. I know Imangi Studios created it they did a very good job on this game I appreciate how much youbdid.
B000FA675C|5.0|It was an interesting read. Keep you on the edge of your seat . Didn't want to put it down..
0062238868|5.0|This book tells story of a great American warrior from his point of view. I am thankful for his patriotism and service. I am deeply saddened we have recently lost this legend. I know he is in heaven, and I pray his family continues their strength. Great inspiring book for all of our military heroes.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I used this in a PC that was built for my son, he has now the best PC in the house, it is fast and reliable.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|great book was free I recently downloaded and loved it great great great cant express this enough thanks again. :)
1400069807|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  It will open your eyes to what you are putting in your mouth.  No more oreos for me!!
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|Last DVD unfortunate a bad one... last disc not good... Got through it but a friend could not finish the season.
B0028YPDVW|5.0|Excellently done work and very accurate.  I have two foxes by the same makers and they are also excellently done (see my review on them).<br />I will be ordering more wolves, since my friend likes the product and they make good surprise gifts for her.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really wanted to see this movie as soon as it came to theaters, It was a fantastic movie. Loved it!
B00899F0G8|5.0|It's an awesome show. You get hooked. I didn't think I would like it but my sister made me watch it and now I can't miss an episode. I like that it's a mystery type show.
B008F9T76Q|4.0|If you like young adult science fiction, you will enjoy these books.  I had a lot of funny reading them.  The third book isn't as interesting, however.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|The way its written is fun and makes it an easy read, but there are similar books with much usefull info.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so great for Bible studies and daily reading. I love listening while driving or working out! my 7 year old even lives to listen!
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoyed watching the first two seasons of the show, some points get boring but that is somewhat expected. Overall the show is good, watched it as a part of my prime benefits.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|It may be a great program  , It doesn't Work with a Lexmark printer 3000, wifi.<br />I couldn't find the printer in their list , so it couldn't be set up .. disappointed<br />I wish they had a larger list of printers available....
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great series. I actually saw the movie first and then went back to watch the series. The movie is one of my all time favorites and the series turned out to be just as good.
0307744434|5.0|My favorite genre is Victorian literature, and I find that I get bored easily with modern love stories. But, like the Victorians, I still want to read a well-crafted and compelling story. I saw this book at Target and dismissed it as the usual trite stuff, but my sister chose it for her book club. I read it in one day. It's romance and mystery and simply a fun read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A very funny and touching movie that appeals to EVERYONE. My daughter does a spot on imitation of the guy who runs the  carnival game where the girls are trying to win a U-NEE-CORN!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I love this series.  Each episode is better than the last.  I can't wait until lunch so I can see the next episode.  Great acting.
0061743526|5.0|It has been many years since I read this book, but was thrilled when my book club chose &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;.  Its message is timeless and all should read it.
B008476HBM|5.0|Ms. Austen has a great way to develop characters. They are funny and clever. I really enjoyed the story she was able to create.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I, really like this game! It runs just as well as if it were on a computer. I would definitely recommend it.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine Dragons shows why they are an up and coming band in this amazing Album.  It is rare that I find an album where I enjoy every song without having to skip any song, but this is one of them!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|At first I played this game on my laptop but on the kindle it way better than the computer version!!! THANK YOU NINJAKIWI!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Chose this b/c a friend really liked it. It is a sexy, addictive book with characters i began to relate to and feel as if I was getting to know them.
1935597760|5.0|This book was page Turner for me.  It made laugh, cry and cheer the characters on.  There were sad moments that tore at my heart but hope followed with Alice and Mick.  I fell in love with Jamie and Lydia and their strength and perseverance. I would love to follow the next leg of their life.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie kept my interest for over two hours and I look forward to the next film in the series.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|still the funniest scripted show anywhere. great ensemble just keeps getting better, topical and familar in storylines.<br />even when a bit over the top I am still laughing.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Exciting and engrossing.  When you think you know who the good guys are, you find out that you may be wrong.  It keeps you guessing.  Excellent acting.
B004LX0D36|4.0|When Austen was required reading in high school I found her a bit long-winded and , I thought, out of touch with my generation. Now , after reading this novel, I think she's still a bit long-winded but I've come to see that she has something to share with all generations.
B009G57OTU|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely amazing and the casting is exceptional. I really enjoy all if Paul Thomas Anderson's movies!  If you love off-beat movies you'll like this one as well as PTA's other movies.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Chronicles one of the key moments in our nation's history. Fine acting performances abound. There were a few moments where I had trouble following along with the plot but the end of the film resounds with poignancy.
B005HSL626|1.0|someone at work recommended this game, it is inane.  I found it unchallenging and will be deleting very very soon.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Whether you like this movie depends entirely on the type of humor you enjoy. Going into this movie, I knew that Seth MacFarlane had a heavy hand in the development of this movie and provided the voice for one of the movie's main protagonists, the teddy bear come to life Ted.<br /><br />I for one, like a good dose of schoolyard style humor so I frequently found myself guffawing at the potty humor on display. However, if your idea of a good time is something at a bit higher grade level, you may want to steer elsewhere.<br /><br />All talk of the movie's relative maturity level, I thought Mark Wahlberg did a good job as the movie's likeable schlub. He showed some nice range in this one, playing a role much different from the action hero he often portrays on screen. Mila Kunis was spot on in her role as the almost too perfect girlfriend (I mean, how could he actually not realize what a catch he had).<br /><br />One casual observation -- I'd love to live in the world John inhabits. Every young lady around him was an absolute knock-out. From his girlfriend to his co-workers and her co-workers -- an absolute parade of supermodels. I'm kinda curious if the ladies would have thought the same of the male ensemble in the film.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has a nice variety of sounds, it's nice that you can mix them together to find what works for you. I work 3rd shift, this really does help when trying to sleep alone in a darkened room.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie had potential. So much potential. Rich heritage, a visionary director and an ensemble cast brimming with talented actors. But somewhere along the line, the high-minded ideas in the script never meshed together and this movie just ends up feeling like a giant plate of spaghetti with some kind of indecipherable and not so tasty sauce.<br /><br />Overall, there's a few tense moments and the first hour or so of the movie is enjoyable as the plot thickens and you're wondering how everything is going to play out. The problem is, once it actually plays out, a feeling of 'what the heck just happened' is all that you're really left with. More than one person told me about the feeling of confusion they had leaving the theater after seeing this film.<br /><br />It should be noted that if you're a fan of breathtaking cinematography, you'll want to give this film an extra star (or two). There are some magnificent shots and sets throughout the film and although they didn't have all that much to work with at certain points, the acting is generally very good.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Good movie with a great soundtrack.  The only problem is that I-tunes splits up the tracts by artist when you copy it to your computer.
B008602KQI|4.0|The fact of how we sacrifice the young men and women in life for our \\"freedom\\" but not really total freedom from government control is certainly a parallel to how it is today.  Also, how we as humans would be under such circumstances would take a life for your own survival and be subjected to the politics as well.  The film was entertaining and made think how you would be under such circumstances --- would you sacrifice your values for the sake of survival.  I would recommend this for young adults and older audiences.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|very well written and amazing accurately believeable actors and actresses.i cannot wait to own all the seasons I havnt even finished one and now they got season three...wowza im behind
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I saw an old show on TV and thought I think I remember what was happening but with Amazon Prime I get to go back and watch all of them. I am so hooked I am 2/3's throught the 3rd season now. Love it. Love having Amazon Prime can't imagine TV without it
B001QXCYZY|5.0|Bought this for my now sixteen year old. He loves it. It's very compatible with computers and laptops I would Oder agsin
B000NY12LO|5.0|timnely and interesting subject matter.  gripping details, well formed characters.  so very relevant to our times.  Can't put this book down.  have never read this author despite her popularity.  now I get it.  excellent writer.  I will check out more of her books after this one.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great story loved having all three seasons at once'  I'll view it over and over again.  It's a great story.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good, free time waster.  it is pretty realistic and set up so that there is more to it than just pushing coins around.  love that it's free unless you choose to buy something.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun almost like temple run but. I love this game and I don't ever get bored of it
B004W1GCQO|4.0|The season begins with an introduction of all the new characters, with lots of foreshadowing about WWII and interesting relationship dynamics. All in all, we really enjoyed it.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Allow me to step onto my soapbox while you gather round!<br />I have a theory: the person in charge of editing scenes and taking crap out that does not contribute to the story must have been on a payment plan that worked on a pay-per-minute arrangement; the longer the film, the more he made.<br />The basis of my theory, is that you have a 169 (!) minute movie that could have easily been 69 minutes. Don't believe me? Try this: fall asleep at any random moment and notice that you will not have missed anything remotely relevant and that you will pick up the thread exactly where you left off. Or watch it and notice how the first scene is 30 FREAKING minutes of elves arriving at his house and eating his food.<br />That is all.
0739375970|5.0|This is a great book....  If you started watching the HBO series, you really need to read the books... they are great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Like watching a train wreck. You can't tear your eyes away. Gripping and well written. I highly recommend this book.
0449011909|5.0|If you want to read a great story - this is it.  I started w/ the HBO series and have been loving the books ever since...
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG!!<br />At first I was not sure what to think about Fifty Shades!<br />After the first book, I could not put it down and when I did could not wait to<br />get back to reading. Everyone should read the Fifty Shades Trilogy!!<br />Chris

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This is a review on the product itself. Not the movie!<br /><br />I am deeply disappointed in Disney's latest \\"experiment\\" with combo packs. 3D combo packs is a premium we 3D collectors have all come to love and expect. If I have the option, I always buy the 3D combo pack. Even though I'm sure its original intention was to bring on 3D adopters, I thought Disney decided to make it a constant so that consumers could enjoy each of their movies in 3D and 2D for a premium price. I loved Disney for that, as I love them for so many other things. It's a brilliant business model that gives the consumer more options, one that has been replicated by all other studios.<br /><br />How can Disney expect every family to just own a 3DTV in every room of their house? The only 3DTV this household has is in my bedroom, because I'm really the only one who cares for 3D. My father is blind in one eye so he wouldn't be able to share the experience in the living room, and my mom and brothers don't have a huge desire for 3D. Even if we were to inconveniently bring my 3DTV into the living room and watch the 3D movie in 2D using the 3DTV's options we'd only be receiving video information from one \\"eye\\" of the 3D version. A few scenes were intentionally made different between both versions (such as the river fairy scene) to utilize the 3D effects or tame it for the 2D, so you wouldn't be seeing the 2D version as originally intended on the 3D discs.<br /><br />Maybe I wouldn't feel so strongly if the 3D only version wasn't priced as high as the 2D combo pack, but it is, which is one of the reasons why I give this product one star. The movie on the other hand deserves 5 stars. Here's hoping that others will voice their complaints and Disney will fix this before the Blu-ray is released.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is great.  i use in on my pc, and on my samsung 5 android and my arnova 10 android.  they all link together and are great.
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|What can I say...I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Trekker, and Voyager probably my all-time favorite of the Start Trek franchises. Wish the cast had been included in a later movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really gave me something to think about. I felt that I was a character in it and now, I am infinite.

0064409422|5.0|\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" has been seen as the best novel in the Narnia saga by many readers. It was the first novel in the series that was published in 1950, and became one of the most beloved books ever for children. The 2005 film adaptation was a hit. After \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", the second installment gives readers more conflict, adventure, action, and excitement. We also get four new heroes in this tale, and they are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.<br /><br />It all starts when during a war, these four siblings are being sent from their home in London to stay with a professor inside a large mansion. Peter is  the leader of the group, Susan is the peaceful one, Edmund is a bit of a hard head, and Lucy is the most curious and innocent. Feeling bored since they first came, the children decide to explore the professor's home. Lucy finds a room with a large wardrobe and decides to open it. But after going in the wardrobe, she finds herself in a world with trees, snow, and a lamppost. Suddenly, a fawn named Mr. Tumnus greets Lucy and tells her that she's in Narnia, a land of fantasy that's now a frozen wasteland. After returning to her world, Lucy feels like she's been gone for hours, then learns she's been gone for a minute.<br /><br />Edmund's the next one of the group to discover the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek, and find's it more of a shock. Then out of nowhere, a sleigh appear and in it rides Jadis, Queen of Narnia, who is now called the White Witch because of her icy white image. After swaying Peter with a hot drink, Turkish delight, and her charm, the Witch convinces him to bring his siblings into Narnia to see what they already know. Reluctantly, the four all come together through the wardrobe and after that, they find out that Mr. Tumnus was kidnapped by the witch. Soon the children's journey will become a battle to save Narnia that's full of adventure, drama, and hope.<br /><br />I can really understand why many see this volume as the best of the series. We get more storyline details, more characters, and a lot more action and thrills than \\"TMN\\". The way that the story starts off quickly is actually a good thing. The Pevensie children are truly very wonderful heroes, and each of them have their own personality. All readers will have a true blast of happiness while reading \\"TLTWATW\\", leaving them to explore all of the other volumes. The Pevensies do appear in the rest of the series, but \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is the true core of their adventures in Narnia that every reader will love.<br /><br />Final Verdict: The second novel of Narnia gives us a bigger meal of story and fantasy, and a new group of heroes that's truly a treat for everyone.he best of the series.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I thought the cinematography was amazing, the story intriguing, and the main character extremely likeable. Knowing the ending won't prevent me from watching this one again.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|A great app! Better than any alarm clock that you can buy in any store. I only use my  regular clock to tell time without having to touch my phone.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|it looks so cool,only problem is the price. can you lower it down or put it on free app of day because I am not allowed to buy this: 
B003THJA1G|5.0|I have been hooked on this series since it started. I love the chemistry between Nathan and Stana, and nothing showcased it more than the beginning of Castle and Beckett's story.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|A fresh take on my fav ole sounds. I love the Delta Blues, if you do to, you'll love this cd.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Great book, fast and easy read.<br /><br />I have seen the movie, and it is very close to the book.  Looking forward to part 2'
B007ZJDGXC|5.0|Very suspenseful, makes you think how true could these situations be today, Ryan Reynolds does a great job, Denzel is great as usual.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I like, I'm making custom maps, hg maps, and other stuff like that, Also How did you get webs on there lol?
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I love both of these authors.  This book gives the flavor of both authors throughout the book.  I never had the feeling that this was a Pratchett chapter and tnis was a Gaiman chapter. The additional 'behind the scenes' material was very interesting and added to the book.  Great read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I couldn't get bejewled on my kindle but when diamond dash came out I was so happy it is easier
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very fun app wish you could get coins faster. great if you like horses.<br />i love this app. dont like that it cost money to get gems quickly.
B00005JLEX|5.0|once again my son had to have this collection he wants the rest of the seasons to im not a big fan
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book will keep you glued to it from beginning to end. Sad though because of what happened to Chris Kyle. This book will make you proud as an American!!! It reinforced my admiration for these men who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms that we sometimes take for granted. Freedom is not free and this book will give you an insight to the price that is paid.
B00C32REYI|5.0|I've been a fan of English artist James Blake for sometime now, from his early dubstep EP's through this current release and feel he is evolving at a breathtaking pace.  I was originally a bit flumoxed by the vocals on his 2011 debut, but soon won over.  OVERGROWN is beleive his best release to date.  His mixture of spare but deeply detailed tracks, combined with passionate vocals and strong lyrics make for compelling listening.  James Blake has arrived and is creating music that will be echoed for years to come.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|read all his books in this series, and was pissed when it was over, i wish the series never ended. i was hooked. the depth of the world and story he creates is very compelling and i want more of these kinds of books
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Do not start to read this book after 8 pm. It will be a long night, but one well spent!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi makes for an enjoyable quick read when you need some time to relax and engage in a fantasy.  It surprises you along the way, and comes together in a robust delivery that respects the reader.  Vivid imagery, moderately philosophical discourse on religion, and experience of the character's conscious make you love humanity just a bit more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the fact that the horses in this game are so realistic and that the competitions get harder as you go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great story.  I did not want to read it until others told me it was worth reading.  I did not like the idea of children killing each other.  I could not put the book down.  I cannot wait to read the others.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|A great game, lots of fun breeding dragons and trying to work out how to get what you want. Wonderful colourful graphics.
B008Y79HE6|5.0|the movie in itself is an entertaining and i already seen it on dvd...i wanted to have it on my kindle but when i hit watch now it played only a minute of the movie...it would not let me view the movie as a whole...i tried 5 or 6 times to play and watch the movie but to no avail...let me just say the movie in itself is a good one to see...but puting  or watching on my kindle was to say the least difficult...there is a problem with that...and it is not my kindle because i have downloaded and just seen many movie from amazon prime....b<br />BUT IF YOU LIKE TO SEE THE MOVIE GODZILLA...RENT  IT ON DVD.. OR LBUY THE DVD...I DID...
B008X9Z37A|5.0|With this great product, I can hand my Kindle Fire HD more  easily and I don't have to be afraid that it would break.
B008XO7X4G|5.0|i downloaded this movie FREAKS---WAS PRESENTLY SURPRISE...i did enjoy watching the movie...amazing how these people did manage to live a life in the carnival sideshow...they were real people in this movie...even though it was a movie..you can imagine how these people lived and survive despite the ridicule and crule treatment of them...but the movie in itself was okay and entertaining...
B008M87GJK|5.0|With this, you get the news from a completely different perspective.  There is all types of news.  It is also complete.
0783225482|5.0|Very enjoyable movie. I have seen it more than once and will continue to watch it often. Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, and Bruce Willis interaction with each other couldn't be better.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Not only does it tell me about the current, local weather, but it also has more features and long term forecast.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|His movie is one of my favorites.  Ben Affleck was terrific and I can see why it was an Academy Award winner.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling is one of my favorite authors.  I read all the Harry Potter books, and saw all the movies.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|You know 82 tracks really cant tell the whole story about Stephen Stills , but after being a Stills fan for 25 years ( saw Suite Judy Blue Eyes woodstock version for the first time when I was in my 20's and was sold )this is COOL !<br /><br /> The \\"Treasure\\" in the different key , \\"Leeshore\\" makes Dave Lindleys guitar average \\"Church \\" is way better than the original and the compliation has all the Stills standards \\"Southern Cross\\" , \\"Love the one you're with\\" \\"For what its worth \\" \\"Change partners \\" but what really stands out is the range of music Stills covers , everywhere !<br /><br /> His guitar playing (not to mention bass, drums, keys , synth etc) both acoustic (the box set crossroads is a prime example)and electric (where do I start ? \\"Turn your back on love \\"?) shows why he is always rated in Rolling Stone top guitarist lists ( what is he , no.43 but I reckon no. 2 or 3 on acoustic)<br /><br /> Sure it features everyone from Eric Clapton . Ringo Starr , Herbie Hancock , Neil Young and the obvious Jimi Hendrix \\"take\\" , (and its OK but I really would have liked to be in those studios, share houses and parties where they all jamed )<br /><br />I could wax on and on about how good this is , but honestly for $40 and 82 songs that are ALL good , some you want to cover, some great , and a few that may just change your life<br /><br />Cheers Stephen
B0049J3QF4|5.0|watched this for family movie night, and I enjoyed it as much as the kids.  great quality and sound.  they haven't made a movie for kids like this in a long time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|For some reason I can't stop playing this game  love it. It's very addicting  know more writing time to be back to the game
B001EBROWQ|5.0|Finest flick I have seen about the life of Jesus.I highly reccommend it for any and all, inspirational and well done..
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is my favorite author. I always am waiting for another Scarpetta book to come out. I go to the library and Im on a lsit of 300 people. Love this series so much, been reading them for 17 years. Keep them coming.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|The storyline was a little slow to being with.<br />Took me a while to get into the stroy - but when I did - possibly 1.3 way into the book -I really enjoyed the content.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This is a good little variation of the classic bubble shooter. I have not had any of the issues that others are experiencing. The reason I only gave it three stars is that you must have an Internet connection to play, I prefer games that I can play offline.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had to order this replacement part because of a new puppy with a taste for my Kindle cord.  In fact, I've had to order like four of them.  It came quickly (thank goodness!!) and there were no problems with the product itself.  I am happy to have my kindle back in working order!
B00499NHLC|5.0|stunning performance. faithful to the original book in a sense, not just another modern day crime drama. can't wait for the 3rd season.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very cool lil game seems real easy at first then it steps up to match ur skill and the cartoony animation is neat. like the strategy part and your helpers make it all come together well
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good and wide variety of characters, good story with historic background, and good actors.  I especially like Maggie Smith.  Excellent!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Having a nun for a sister, I can relate wholly to this story.  I appreciate her even more for all the sacrifices that were endured in her 50+ years in the convent!  This story was captivating and inspirational all rolled up into one.  A must to have and enjoy some long dark evening.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What else is there to say? In the same vein as Upstairs, Downstairs in the 70s, Downton Abbey is a period drama that leaves us on the edges of our seats, begging for more. Well done, indeed!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|Couldn't ask for a better collection!  Worth every penny spent!  I Love all my classic actors and actresses in this and proving that once again- those were the good 'ole days!
B00BVVA138|5.0|Worth the long wait of a new album. They are melting faces with this one. I would definetly refer to buy the album.
B000065V42|5.0|Loved all special effects and the cute story that was portrayed!  Another great from the Disney studios!  Kept my laughter and attention the whole time!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this games is the funniest in the world and I even have the first hungry shark. and it was awesome to me and it was crazy. and here's my phone number 206-849- get a new game.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I listen to music, as I take my daily walk.  I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable.  The Amazon MP3 app is amazing.  It's always there!  I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before.  The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick.  I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me.  I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers.
B0000A118M|5.0|In art we seem always to seek out the unquantifiable, that which goes beyond expectation and thrills us beyond words. \\"A Love Supreme,\\" recorded by Coltrane and his band in a single day (12/9/64) and released in February '65, meets that description. This isn't just 'one of the great jazz albums,' a descriptor quite pedestrian and overused. No, this is an album which set the spark for a brand of free-form and improvisation--hinted at by his live Village Vanguard recordings a couple years earlier--which would spread throughout jazz itself (witness the Miles Davis albums of the late 60's to the mid 70's), into comedy (e.g., the landmark conversational and semi-improvisational style of Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl and others), and film (think of \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"Medium Cool\\" and Antonioni), and into the broad musical genre of fusion that flourished in the late 60's and early 70's, before reaching an apex (jazz-wise with Miles' live performances in Osaka and rock-wise with any number of lugubrious prog bands), then straining into caricature. That's a wealth of influence, but this one album achieved that and more.<br /><br />Listening to great jazz is one thing (and a significant thing). Listening to an iconic recording that so fundamentally changed all of Western art is quite something else. That, ultimately, is a good way to describe \\"A Love Supreme.\\" It is quite something else.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I had more ease using this app than with my regular site on my Dell lap top. I was truly surprised at the speed and comprehensive<br /><br />detailing available to me with this Android. thanks!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy game to follow and continue playing for hours.  If you like this game is woo org the 99 cents.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I think you should get all of gameloft's games. I have got most of them and all I've got has been so fun. Gameloft has great creative games. If you get this game and love it like I did please write a review; they deserve good reviews.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This one is the best in my opinion even though I had to watch it a couple of times to completely understand the different time zones featured in the movie. Brolin's character stole the movie from Will Smith with his stone face and nicknames for Smith.  I could laugh just looking at him. The Griffin character added mystery and intrigue to the film.  I missed Frank the pug and Jake Jeebs from this release.  All in all worth watching.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I install. it and found my printer and whhoola now I am no longer tied to my pc thank you
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|It was a long silly movie.  I can not understand how this movie could ever get 5 stars or any awards.  It is absolutely a waste of money and time.  The story
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy playing this but it is hard to get lots of money to buy characters and get the things from the box to earn the characters. It is a really good game and I would recommend it to people of all ages.
B000KI6286|2.0|There were quite a few buffering moments.  I know it was not my internet because I had not had a problem with Netflix on the same day.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Everyone knows this is a great game and it runs well in the Kindle Fire. We all love playing it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to Downton Abbey. Great writing, suspense, excitement, love, historical, it has it all. It is the best series on television.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Absolutely great movie making. I saw it in 3-D in the movie theater, I wish I had a 3-D TV.
0812550706|5.0|Plain and simple this is an amazing book. This is the first OSC book I've read and I truly can't say enough good things about it. From the first chapter to the last it was almost impossible to put down. The last few chapters alone make this book a masterpiece, but the first 3/4 isn't just gravy, it ties in intricately to the conclusion. I couldn't give this anything less than 5 stars.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|At first I wasn't sure but then I got sucked in. It has a great story line and its believable. It's very entertaining.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Bought this for my 3 month old baby boy. He has to have some type of background noise or music to fall asleep to and he loves this mobile. I had a wined up mobile previously but it was too loud and would startle him or keep him awake. This one, however, has volume settings that are perfect for night time. He loves to watch the animals spin around and tries to reach for them. He is now 8 months old and still has to have it on every night before he falls asleep. Perfect product for my baby boy.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I think it's funny that Sanberg is getting some push back on this book...claiming she's blaming the victim, so to speak. I didn't get that impression at all. There are some hard, solid truths in this book about how women conduct themselves and subliminally hold themselves  back from progress in the working world.  Maybe the truth hurts but it needs to be said. Highly recommended.
B00846REIS|5.0|I finished this book shortly after I read, because it was  that AMAZING! Everything I had in Fifty Shades of Grey but BETTER. Thank you Sylvia an  I can't wait to start the new one!!!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I found this recommendation from John Green, and I must say, I absolutely loved it. You wouldn't ever think that a pairing like this would work, but Rowell made it shine.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I love the books and was a big fan of the original movies. I had set my expectations pretty low for the Hobbit. Sadly I didn't set my expectations low enough and was still disappointed. This is supposed to be the story of a home loving Hobbit who goes on an adventure with some bumbling Dwarfs. This was Bilbo's story and he come how got lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />Things I hate about this movie:<br /><br />The Rabbit sled<br />The Albino Orc and all related subplots (35% or more of the movie.)<br />The butchering of the scene with the trolls.<br />The inept adaptation of the Goblin sequence.<br />The fact that they didn't sing 15 birds in 5 fir trees and replaced it with a stupid fight sequence.<br /><br />The fact that they could have done the book in one very good movie if Peter Jackson wasn't out to make Tolkien into his cash cow.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A definite favorite .  This solitary game is smooth and easy on the eyes.  I play it often.  I recommend it to all solitary lovers.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I, Swordstar of ThunderClan, am a big, BIG fan of Star Trek! My favorite series is TNG, and the books are awesome too! Go Captain Picard!<br /><br />--Swordstar
B0030N3O8Y|4.0|I enjoyed Season 8, but would have preferred it tied up loose ends during the previous seasons.  Would have preferred to see Jack Bauer have some resolution in his personal life.
B00271DNP4|5.0|Oh my gosh I just love Harry Potter and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a little bit of violence and adventure. I would also recommend the Harry Potter book series. If I were you I would also watch the whole series of the movies. They get a little bit darker and scarier as they go on though. Hope you found this helpful!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I don't like the new changes to the format. Not as User friendly. Radar is hard to find. You have to scroll around to find info now when it use to be all on the same screen.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|A fun game for all ages. I like it and so does my 3 year old gr.granddaughter. Give it a try.
1452101248|5.0|One of the best and interesting cookbooks I ever had. I love Ottolenghis creativity in so simple recepies.<br />Must have.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|In \\"Secret of the Wings\\" Tinker Bell (Mae Whitman) crosses the bridge to the Winter Woods, where she meets her \\"sister,\\" a winter fairy named Periwinkle (Lucy Hale). But it is against the rules for fairies to cross the border, and Tinker Bell learns the reason when her act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences.<br /><br />Disney's fourth Tinker Bell movie \\"Secret of the Wings\\" is a great family picture that benefits from superb voice performances and colorful animation. The story is simple and engaging, but not too simple so that adult audiences too can enjoy it. It is also good to see Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) again.<br /><br />Part of the franchise's charm is the vivid and lively descriptions of life in Pixie Hollow, which is fun to see, and this time again you will not be disappointed. The film's amusing hospital and library sequences are something you should not miss.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the film could have spent more time on supporting fairies. Also, \\"Tinker Bell\\" is no longer in the title. Why is it?
B00947N6UG|5.0|My family has really enjoyed watching this movie.  We watch it repeatedly with friends.<br />It's not often that we find a family friendly movie these days.  Thank you for this one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have recommended this book to friends,  relatives and others.  I love it my mom and sisters love it,  my aunt and uncle love it.  I cried at many times during the book!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Great movie for the Monster High fan.  We love it and watch it several times.<br />Another good family friendly movie...  uh if monsters are ok with you!  lol
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|&#34;Exquisite!&#34; Isn't that what Thom said? The ending made me shed a tear; not just sadness that it is over, but elation that it ended well. Yes, Exquisite.
0547258305|4.0|I loved this series...Great story line. Keeps you interested the whole way threw. Very creative.  If you liked Hunger Games, you will love these books also.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|2nd book in crossfire series and its even better than the first,i cant put down these books,fantastic writing just fantastic
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Everybody should read this book! What a great eye &  soul opener! It will definitely be read again immediately. Wow!
B00866H7SS|5.0|i just love this book,far better than fifty shades,eva and gideon r they perfect couple, i love everything about this book,all of the characters are believable and u fall in love with eva and gideon so quickly u never want their story to end,fantastic writing
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not fond of this game version.  Maybe it is just me fighting with my Kindle. Hate the pauses and the small keyboard.
034580404X|5.0|Really fast shipping and packaged good really like the books.... Will order more books....yay:)))) Really like everything bout all these book I recommend ppl 2 read....
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|This follow up to 'Knocked Up' was hysterical at times, but lacked the non stop hilarity of the original.  Maybe Seth Rogan could have filled the gaps.  It also had some more serious moments that felt uncomfortable in this type of comedy.  Overall I would recommend and would have given it 3.5 stars if that was an option.
B008469DGY|5.0|Love the variety of courses and quickshot feature. Also the ball control is a vigorous in mid air<br /><br />U r
0823095223|5.0|I had this book on my \\"Wish List\\", hesitating because these guys are so obviously WAY AHEAD of me and I will never, ever catch up. I just started polymer a year ago and found myself gravitating towards sculpture, which I've never done before, and moving pretty fast on acquiring skills. But there is so much to learn...just like anything else. So the book kept drawing me in until I bought it. And I was so glad I finally gave in. First of all, the book's quality is top notch. The photos are large so detail can be studied at leisure. The color quality is great. The techniques are completely comprehensive...down to earth, easy to understand with loads of photos on procedure. Second, the writing style is great. You are put at ease from the first. The tone is laid back and full of wry humor (just my kind) but it is obvious these guys are SERIOUS artists, aside from their credentials, and that they totally enjoy their work and admire it and each others as well. Third, I appreciate the fact that they let you know the kind of mistakes they themselves have made. They certainly do not put themselves on a pedestal and, in poking fun at themselves, make the student feel at ease about making his/her own. The sense of comradery is totally evident. And, as a woman, I appreciate that a woman is included in the group and given extreme honor as to her position in the field. Fourth, there are chapters on doing business as an artist and even photographing your own work. I bought several books on desk top photography, etc. and they are all good. But this one was sweet and simple and pulled it all together for me. Fifth, even though each of these artists works a different medium and I only am doing polymer right now, I garnered invaluable information just by skimming thru the first time I opened it. Last, this book has become my main textbook for sculpture so far. The more I look and read the more I find. I seriously recommend it for anyone that aspires to be a master at this craft. You will enjoy it tremendously.ll enjoy it tremendously.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|&#34;Firefly&#34; was a true wagon train to the stars, part gun-slinger western part sci fi romp... Joss Wheadon at his conceptual and writing best! An exciting, smart, funny, serious-issue-confronting masterpiece. Each and every cast member fit their roles like a glove and seamlessly worked together as an ensemble--from day one. Even the music was a perfect fit. My ONLY complaint about &#34;Firefly&#34; is that it was allowed to end with only a brief goodbye in the form of &#34;Serenity&#34; (the big damn movie). Buy both and savor them slowly... if you can. Once you are hooked you'll also want to get the &#34;Done the Impossible&#34; dvd/download a tribute from and to the fans. Unlike other franchises (I won't name names but you know who you are) Firefly has never fogotten its fans and its products are reasonably priced and of high quality. So help support that stalwart business model, buy the downloads, shirts, decals, keychains, dvds and blue rays, 'cause trust me you'll want to experience &#34;Firefly&#34; again and again and again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Living in a high altitude environment presents a particular challenge to weather prediction. This service keeps me up to date with the rapid changes and national weather as well.  Good product.
B009NX2XA0|5.0|Living in Tucson, AZ, I have had the pleasure of visiting Old Tucson Studios where this movie was made.  I have seen about where every set was (prior to the destructive fire that destroyed most of the lot), and I have walked the same streets that John Wayne, James Caan, and Robert Mitchum walked making this movie.  The action is great; dialogue was what is was for a western, but overall, I can watch this movie over and over again.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|as my fav. musical of all time i thought this was a very good movie. it's a shame they had to use the monotone flat russle crowe. hathaway overacts the roll but does a good job. and jackman really does a fantastic job. if you like musicals this is worth a watch anydaym
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I think this is the best easiest to use headset I have ever purchased.  Where it brings the value is with the additional case for protection and charging.  The only disappointing part is their software only runs on windows.  For Parallels users, the software reads the headset but implies it is connected to a hub and therefore wont update.
B003SI5NX0|4.0|older but pretty good animated movie. akin to all dogs go to heaven but with billy joel involved. not bad
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The Derrick Storm novels are great.  Great entertainment, once I started reading couldn't put it down.  Along with the TV series this is wonderful.
B00821OX98|4.0|The characters were developed real well, and I've grown attached to them. The only thing lacking were large action and set pieces appropriate to the setting of the series. From what little ive seen of the second seasonx they've upped the ante :-D
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well done. Loved the characters and how they interact. Seem so normal for the times. Even though I was saddened by the turn of events, I realize that some things are the way they are and were even moreso at that time in history.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|So much fun to listen to the music over and over again.  This particular anniversary concert is so special because of the reprise of all who played John Valjean from different countries!  So special!
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I was happy with the way the events in history were told and how the good men showed their patriotic beliefs. I was however not pleased with the darkness of the entire movie.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|Blake Shelton is playful and serious in this new collection of his songs!  He makes me smile.  He is real and relatable!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I'm not sure who to root for....there seems to be some good om the villians and some bad in the 'heros' I really want to see one of the villians (anti-heros ) get what he has coming to him
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson  came to my attention when he was chosen by Harriet, the widow of Robert Jordan to complete the Wheel of Time series.  I found his writing excellent and I don't know what he wrote vs what Jordan wrote.  I moved on the the Mistborn series and found that excellent as well.  This book keeps up the tradition.  It has a different set of magic rules from either of the other two.  It is the first book of a new series and book 2 is due in oh, a year or so.<br /><br />That his &#34;The Emperor's Soul&#34; has been nominated for a Hugo doesn't surprise.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|I bought this because I thought I lost my SD card adapter.  When I go this one I tried it and it did not work.  I thought it had something to do with the files so I dismissed it.  I found my old one and tried it, it worked fine with the same SD card.  I noticed that I had to force the card into the one I bought here so I looked at it compared to the Apple one, they are very different.  Do not buy this piece of crap it is a knockoff.
