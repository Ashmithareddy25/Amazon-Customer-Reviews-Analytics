B0053TWVDC|5.0|This is a good thriller to add to your collection. The little preacher, Isaac really freaks me out and it'll make you never to have the desire to see Gatlin, Nebraska. The performance of a very young Linda Hamilton is awesome.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and didn't find it slow at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't love the ending. The plot throws some twists which really kept me hooked, I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend it!
B002HFWBUI|5.0|Mickey Rourke is raunchy with class in his seduction of the meek Kim Basinger, who is very vulnerable and beautiful. This was written and produced by Adrian Lyne who previously produced Flashdance, which was a great movie as well, but this one involves a darker theme. It was hilarious when Kim was fed jalapeno while blindfolded.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Fun game. Would play more often if you did not have to wait so long to get coins when not playing.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Loved this book. I've been working in IT for over 15 years, and this book describes all the pain and anguish of doing it wrong, and teaches you how to do it right. It lost a star due to some misspellings, wrong words, and a duplicated full paragraph. Otherwise, your favorite geek will love this book . . . Buy it for him/her!
B004NELBPC|1.0|This app used to be awesome. Updated versions present the news based on popularity rather than chronology. What is the sense in that? It gets worse with every update and that is really too bad.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I have always been intimidated to try to calibrate my monitor.  The Xrite CMUNDIS ColorMunki product was very easy to use.  After loading the software and a reboot, it took less than 10 minutes to complete the calibration.  Not cheap but it is easy and it works!

1568363931|5.0|I love this book. While I may not like all the food ingredients, it has given me enough tips and meals to take my lunches to work. I especially enjoy the cream cheese ham rolls, and so do my coworkers! :) It's a great read, lots of recipes and they are easy to follow and easier to make!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using Evernote for about a year and I absolutely love it. It is on my phone, all computers, and my tablet. Anytime I need to refer to any project work it is readily available, as well as being able to make new notes that will almost instantly sync to all devices. Evernote is very user friendly and easy to learn. I have organized all my work and social life on Evernote. Evernote is great now, so I look forward to each new upgrade. THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is an excellent post-apocalyptic tale. I'm glad I was able to read all of the parts at once, waiting for more would have been excruciating. I found part three to be my least favorite and the first and last books were the best. Wool is definitely a page-turner with lots of suspense, mystery and intrigue. I would definitely recommend!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I dont subscribe to Showtime. So I was able to watch first 6 episodes on a special offer.Think Ill complete on Amazon.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I didn't give it five stars because I think it could have gotten more into depth, but I'm guessing they knew it would be a hit and are saving more for the sequel(s). The acting wasn't the best, but this isn't an &#34;Oscar&#34; movie, so I will let it slide.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book!!!! I couldn't stop reading once I started. I can't wait to start the next book! Hope it's just as good!

B004222UC8|4.0|this is a really good album , if you liked the ronnie james dio era of sabbath,you will like this i give the original eternal idol album a 4 and one quarter rating, a bit polished but not bad and i also like the 2 bonus tracks,black moon which was a single from the headless cross album, and some kind of woman . i rate the 2nd disc, the e.i. ray gillen session a 5 this is the main reason i bought this album,i am a big badlands fan the band that ray, jake e. lee and of course eric singer featured on these recordings. rays vocals had a little more range than tony martins but both good vocalists. this is probably my favorite tony martin era album ,with headless cross 2nd and rounding out third the cross purposes album third, tyr i thought sucked..

B000XUBFE2|4.0|I saw the colours. I fell in love with the people and I mourn their deaths. I began the book with dislike and completed it with deep attachment.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A great app that really helps you to manage your battery life. With reminders and predictions on battery life depending on what you are doing it works great with the kindle. Definitely worth giving it a go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting!! Def 2 thumbs up!! Must get this game you will love it so fun to play
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A very descriptive book that takes you more than just on Harolds physical journey.  You will also travel the emotional journey of Harold and other characters in the book.  They are all believable characters that you can associate with.  I would describe it as a really 'human' story.
B009EDZINI|5.0|I love all the men movies  they give you the excitement of being a mutant but with a great reason for wanting to b good
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Over twenty years of waiting for the next bit of this story to be told. Sanderson did an excellent job of picking up where Jordan left off. He gave us a seamless ending to our protracted trillogy. Even through two authors, this is by far my favorite of all the stories I've read.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|this was a fantastic read that i thuroughly enjoyed. previously my favorite novel was the inheritance cycle but this has far surpassed it in my oppinion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this to play on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's the game I play most now, and has been for the last two weeks.<br /><br />In case you don't know the game: you have a third person view of a character running away from monsters down a temple path. You swipe left / right to turn, up to jump over, and down to slide under. You run over coins and collect them, and can trade them in for enhanced abilities and different characters. Every now and then power-ups show up that you can jump through and claim.<br /><br />My favorite power-up is the coin magnet, which makes coins jump to you even when you don't run directly over them. The speed-up is also nice. The shield hasn't been useful as it doesn't keep me from falling or dieing when I miss<br /><br />Games usually last 30 seconds to 5 minutes, so it's a great time-killer. The rendering is nice, and both the rendering and gameplay is better than [[ASIN:B0086700CM Temple Run]]. The touch controls work perfectly on my Fire HD 8.9.<br /><br />Great game!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It's a fast read.  How could any one read through this and not feel for Pat.  Too much reference to football for me but regardless of that very enjoyable.
0316212377|5.0|Like children growing up, People and intelligent machines evolve their way through millennia towards Sublimation, transference of their minds and bodies to a higher order universe. Some, like the citizens of the Culture, remain in our universe despite being sufficiently advanced to Sublime. Others, like the Gzilt, tumble headlong towards this next evolution. The Gzilt are only a few days away from Subliming, but a disturbing disclosure from the Zidhren - one of the Gzilt's mentor cultures - threatens their future. In the end it's down to a four-armed musician with just the right chance acquaintance and the curiosity and interference of the Culture to preserve the Gzilt's chosen future.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this is the tenth Culture novel: it still feels fresh to me. Banks' writing is beautiful, witty and engaging, pulling the willing reader into the Culture universe and keeping them there. This book has everything I love about the Culture: well-meaning Culture interference, the god-like Culture ships, and reflection upon myriad aspects of life. What does it mean to grow up? How do you make the decision to Sublime to a world which you've heard is wonderful, but which you have nothing but words to prove it? When have you lived too long, and what does it require mentally?<br /><br />I found the characters endearing, and the story engaging and interesting. Even to the end I had ways I hoped it would work out, but it could have gone either way. There is the standard share of villains and heroes, each with their own motives and justifications and darkness.<br /><br />This is a good Culture book. Though not quite reaching the pinnacle I felt with [[ASIN:0316005401 The Player of Games (Culture)]], this is easily in the top three of the series, and the top ten books I've read in the last ten years.<br /><br />If you're a sci-fi fan and haven't experienced the Culture, I strongly recommend reading this book, and then perhaps Player of Games, and some of the others. Although the universe is self-consistent, each book stands alone, and they can be read in any order.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. Banks! 5 stars, as usual where your writing is concerned :)Although the universe is self-consistent, each book stands alone, and they can be read in any order.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. Banks! 5 stars, as usual where your writing is concerned :)
B0047S1KMS|5.0|Odds are you hadn't heard of this clever horror gem. DEAD SET is a British television mini-series that documents an instance of zombie apocalypse. Running at approximately 141 minutes and broken up into five episodes, DEAD SET first aired on the E4 network from October 27 to 31, 2008. And it is riveting stuff. It is harrowing and darkly comic and, most importantly, doesn't condescend to its viewers. It merges zombies with reality television. It's another kick-in-the-arse commentary on conformity within our society and our fixation on pretend televised sensationalism. It's a wicked satire, brought about by exec. producer/writer Charlie Brooker's scathing wit.<br /><br />I'd never seen the Big Brother show. And, frankly, I despise those who fawn over them trumped-up celebrities. It's disturbing to me that in the UK, where it originated, Big Brother is even more popular. (I guess having a damn cool accent doesn't necessarily equate to sophistication.) DEAD SET tracks the cast and crew of the obnoxious Big Brother reality show, and for those who are in the dark as I am, its premise goes like this: Contestants selected for their inability to get along with each other are plonked in a confined space and each week are voted off the show by the viewers. As DEAD SET opens, the contestants and the production crew are so wrapped up with the shooting of the latest episode that news of a cataclysmic national emergency pass them by.<br /><br />I saw this mini-series with a cousin who is a reality show fiend (and, yes, I despise him for it). But he filled me in with some background material. Such as that the in-film presenter, Davina McCall, is the real-life UK Big Brother presenter. And that the UK version of the Big Brother house is a fortified compound on the Elstree studios lot. Wire fences lace the compound's perimeter. It is regularly patrolled by security to keep the public out. Apparently, the set designers of DEAD SET have reproduced the Big Brother house to an almost exact likeness. Meaning that those familiar with the show and the house's layout will get that extra thrill. But for the purposes of serving the zombie narrative, the compound and those barricaded within amp up the genre's often used siege element.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is uniformly solid, even the actors relegated to the stereotype roles (the hot bimbo, the creepy guy, the hunk, the street-savvy homie...). But the two standouts are Andy Nyman as the absolutely hateful producer \\"Patrick\\" (he gets the best dialogue) and Jaime Winstone as \\"Kelly,\\" the harassed production runner/gofer and eventual plucky heroine. Kelly provides the narrative thread. She's our point-of-view character. I appreciate that Kelly does the sensible thing even in the midst of blind panic. She retrieves her weapon (How many times have we seen someone absent-mindedly discard their weapon?). Before exiting a room, she peeks under the door to determine safe passage. It's gratifying to see someone who isn't prone to typical horror movie stupidity. I do question that Kelly and several others, in such short time, become such deadeye shooters.<br /><br />There's satisfaction for the gorehounds. DEAD SET may be a television mini-series but it doesn't stinge on gore and blood and brutal kills. It's got more-than-decent production values. And, yes, for viewers of gentler persuasion, there is profanity. Because \\"Yikes!\\" is not an appropriate expletive when you're being targeted by the undead. However, taking a panic dump in a bin IS very much appropriate.<br /><br />All five episodes are on one All-Region disc. Bonus stuff is as follows:<br /><br />From Episode One:<br />- \\"Davina McKill\\" - An interview with reality game show presenter Davina McCall while she has her zombie make-up put on, followed by a behind-the-scenes look at one of her zombie scenes (00:06:51 minutes)<br />- \\"SFX: You've Got to Get Them in the Head\\" - the f/x crew looks at the fire extinguisher as a zombie killing device (00:02:45)<br />- 2 Deleted/Extended Scenes<br /><br />From Episode Two:<br />- \\"Interview with director Yann Demange\\" (00:04:21)<br />- \\"On Set with DEAD SET - interviews with the cast (00:06:13)<br /><br />From Episode Three:<br />- \\"Interview with exec. producer/writer Charlie Brooker\\" and if you can't guess whom Patrick the Producer is based on after this interview, well... (00:06:02)<br />- \\"SFX: Head Shots\\" - With stunt performer John street who plays a zombie whose head is shot up by a copper (00:02:09)<br /><br />From Episode Four:<br />- \\"House of the Dead\\" - Charlie Brooker gives an acerbic tour of the faux Big Brother set (00:05:06)<br />- \\"SFX: Davina\\" - Davina McCall's zombification (00:00:58 seconds)<br />- One Deleted/Extended Scene<br /><br />From Episode Five:<br />- \\"I Am Patrick, Hear Me Roar\\" - Interview with actor Andy Nyman (00:03:52)<br />- \\"Army of the Dead\\" - For the climactic zombie mob scenes, zombie extras recruited thru the Internet work thru the early morning hours (00:03:35)<br />- \\"SFX: Patrick G!ves Head\\" - Patrick gets what's coming to him (00:04:11)<br />- 2 Deleted/Extended Scenes (including how Pippa bites it))<br />- 2 Deleted/Extended Scenes<br /><br />From Episode Two:<br />- \\"Interview with director Yann Demange\\" (00:04:21)<br />- \\"On Set with DEAD SET - interviews with the cast (00:06:13)<br /><br />From Episode Three:<br />- \\"Interview with exec. producer/writer Charlie Brooker\\" and if you can't guess whom Patrick the Producer is based on after this interview, well...

B00AB7HESI|4.0|Tells you the problem and just type the things to fix it and they appear. There's alot you can type in and interact with. Type arcade machine and it appears and you can play the mini game. Good for the puzzles and just for a sandbox experience. I think it should be five stars for younger people
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I have a number of Depeche Mode cds; ultra, music for the masses, sotu, pta, , etc. This one is soo different from the rest!! I cannot pick a favorite song. They have really outdone themselves. I ordered this from Amazon themselves and it was here to me the next day after it launched!! Soo happy about that!! So many stores where I live Do not carry Depeche Mode products!!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I enjoy it you definitely would have to have a twitter account but when I first got a twitter I was like wow so confusing but after a while I figured it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is such a good game. Pretty common too. It is about some birds who got their eggs stolen by pigs so now they're out to get them. All of them. You shoot a certain number of angry birds from a slingshot and try to get all the pigs with the limited fowls. It is set up into levels where you try to destroy all the pigs. Angry Birds doesn't have TOO much of a storyline other then revenge against pigs. Kind of an arcade style. It can be challenging sometimes. But is always fun. I could play this for a while without getting bored. Bottom line, this is a fun game and is good for all ages. I would recommend this anytime. This gets a 5 out of 5 on the Guru scale.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I honestly wasn't expecting anything when I saw this and while I liked the director's previous works, this seemed an unlikely pairing as any. But somehow, it worked. Tony Starks played Sherlock Homes well (yes, I know it's Robert Downey Jr.) and even the combat took on an analytical twist that was pretty interesting.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|Top Gun is just a great action movie. I actually own two versions of this movie and if you're looking for something to watch that will take your mind off of the days troubles, this movie is it.
B004LWZW42|4.0|This was an interesting origin story. Although I enjoyed it a whole lot and thought the acting was superb, I felt the ending was too pat. Lots of great homages likes cameos from Wolverine and an older Mystique and a fun movie overall.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|I thought this was an extremely strong effort, highlighted by strong vocals, harmonies and some great hooks.  Why the record company decided not to put any weight behing this is beyond me.  I'd say that 5 or 6 of the songs are outstanding, the balance, at worst, listenable.  In my opinion, despite the absence of a killer single, their most complete effort ever.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Many games don't work so well on a touch screen. This one does. I find it very easy to grab the card I want from the middle of the stack of cards.  I've been a spider addict for some time, and I'm glad  to have it on my kindle.

B0063IH60K|3.0|Graphics could use some upgrading, but then again, it is on my phone. Decent to pass the time when waiting for a plane or meeting.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Hallstrom has crafted a profoundly sad film, which is focused on the relationship which developed between a man and his purebred dog (Akita). All literary license (time, locale, among some points) and pathetic fallacy aside, as well as some rather inane, irritating actions on the part of some of the human characters, this film beautifully and greatly underscores the special bond of love and devotion which uniquely exist between dog and human. The film will certainly tear at the heartstrings of most dog lovers everywhere if not anger and frustrate them and perhaps turn them off to the film itself.  It is, within the genre, a most powerful and rather provocative movie.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|The app it self works pretty well but some suspisous permissions and then they make you buy things ( like fonts) that should definetly be included for free
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is fun and intertaining I can't put it down. The storms are hard but they give you coins. you will spine hours on it and not know it. They give you thaings to do and that is what will help you move on..
0345803485|5.0|I normally not a big reader, if I want a story I'll see the film but once I started looking at this I could not put it down. I don't want to spoil it so won't go into detail but will say that yes this book has some real hot sex scenes in it. However, I have seen much worse before in other books and being that the novels I have read are few in numbers I would believe it's real common. What makes everyone so upset in my opinion is the fact that the writer is a women and not a man and we all know how women are suppose to hate sex. If this same book was written by say a John Doe the reviews would be very different. I finished this book in a day, I loved it that much and ordered books 2 & 3 here on Amazon and can't wait to devour them like so many other women already have. We don't all hate sex, we just hate it when it's always about the guy and not the girl.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Good read, exciting to think about!  History brought alive!  Will probably buy the rest of the series and follow the author!
B00008GKEG|5.0|My husband and children are HUGE Beatles fans. Several years ago my husband recieved the Beatles Antology on tape (remember those?). He loved them but unfortunately, the technology went by the way side and the tape player broke. So the anthology sat on the shelf, desolate and unused. Then I foundthis for a great price on Amazon and purchased it for this as a Christmas present. There was great happiness and joy as he opened the present. He has spen many hours enjoying this set/. Of course, he downloaded them to his music library and his iphone so he has his favories with him all of the time. This
B00006RU5B|3.0|This album sounds exactly like what it is, a combination between Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine as produced by Rick Rubin.  It lacks the driving hip hop funk of RAtM, but doesn't have the building sonorous melodies of Soundgarden.  The band would go on to develop their own sound later, but in this album the elements seem stuck in their own style.  It doesn't really work.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis did the best portrail of President Lincoln I've ever seen. Sally Fields and Tommy Lee Jones both did a fantastic  job in the movie. I'll be watching it again.
B00004Y6NK|2.0|If Patrick Bateman had a favorite Eric Clapton album this would be the one.  Filled with 80's synthesizers and horn blasts and produced by Phil Collins this was certainly in the spirit of the age; but it was an age that didn't suit Clapton at all.  It's hard to hear this album without wanting to look at the TV guide to see if this week's episode of Miami Vice is a new one or a rerun.
B005DJRD80|1.0|5 minutes of this was all I could endure. It's now 4 generations since the sixties and with every decade social mores go further backward. Every teenager feels like an alien, god knows I did. Fine. Now I'm an old guy thinking back on when I was our heroine's age in the late sixties... and I every day, I feel like MORE of an alien. In the first episode when our heroin gets wham bammed and thank you ma'amd she just TAKES IT? Like she could not just have followed him out, picked up the mic and said \\"thanks for the quicky, aholee, sorry u cdnt keep it up, maybe next time...\\" ach... whatever, contrived, trite piece of mierda like a thousand others... sooo depressing.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Took a bit to get into this but now I'm in, great human story rather than just sci- fi action/adventure and I'm on to the next in the series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome and I like to play because my friends are playing this game and also because I can very up to thousands and thousands of coins and keys to get a life
B009WHCXQ6|5.0|I love the way they did the movie the only thing I realy didn't like was N.Cage trying to speak like batman in the tv show.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Kindle Fire HD needs the one game that is impossible to hate from DS, no matter how many times you played it. 5 stars for this game. It has only failed once and I can't stop playing it.
B008MX7Z32|4.0|I was looking into a few options in getting a reading light for my study.<br />I was looking for something 1) mobile and 2) bright.<br /><br />This is great, and the swiveling option gives different angle options that you can work with.<br />A feature that I love is the different light settings which lets you toggle between how<br />strong you want the light to be.<br /><br />The reason that held me back from giving a 5 star is because you cannot<br />rotate the head of the light, which would have made it more versatile and useful.<br /><br />Otherwise, great product and very satisfied as a student.

B000NTPDSW|1.0|The &#34;restoration&#34; of these three movies is terrible.  The exterior scenes are washed out and the sound is of lower quality than the original DVDs.  The original DVDs had Dolby sound whereas the &#34;restoration&#34; just has standard sound.  Buy the original DVDs and not the &#34;restoration&#34;!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|the game wasn't too difficult where u had to select the hint button multiple times. its a great game if u have any spare time. some objects are a little more complicated to find than others, but overall I really enjoyed it!
B006ATJXQW|1.0|when i got this book i was really excited it is an awesome book but i can't find the AR level. very good and amazing book besides the AR level on it
1449410243|1.0|The poster of How to Tell if your cat is plotting to kill you is funny; however, that is a VERY small part of the book, and the rest is not very funny at all, in fact, it is rather gross.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Everyone interested in organized crime should read this book.  Goes into more detail than the movie. Highly recommend to anyone.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read the review of this book and wanted to get it for my 9 year old granddaughter, but I was concerned that it would be difficult for her as her sister is a child with special needs.  Not long after, my granddaughter told me she had read it and loved it!  Then her mom told me she thought it was wonderful!  Then a friend told me it was a &#34;must read&#34;.  This is a very well-written book by someone who has an intimate knowledge of disabilities.<br /><br />All children,and their parents, should read this special book....kindness should never be overlooked as it so often is, especially in the &#34;growing up&#34; years when hurts can damage a child forever.  This book tells the story so beautifully, I don't believe anyone could finish it without a new awareness of what a person who is &#34;different&#34; must deal with every single day, and the courage they must have.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|We are just catching up on the Walking Dead.  The second season was a great transition from the zombie infested world to the more human side of the struggle, but still with plenty of zombies.
1476715904|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. This book reminded me of the days when I used to supervise a program for high school students to write Slam poetry. But we did not call it Slam poetry but Spoken Word Poetry. This was an incredible read, and it reminded me how beautiful poetry is and how it can be used as an outlet to express emotion. &#60;3

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I've always enjoyed stories of heroism and bravery, especially about American GIs during WWII.  This story, however this story is different in that it includes the bravery and honor of a German pilot fighting for his country yet showing mercy to an American B-17 crew.  It is well written and I enjoyed hearing how both of the pilots were able to meet in their later years.  The story about their meeting was very touching.  Glad I could get this book on Kindle.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I was looking for a knife for use as a tool and I found it in this BK2. I think you could safely call this knife indestructible. Sharp point, good edge, hefty weight. Makes for a great mini hachet or pry bar or anything else you could think of.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not bad but had a hard time getting to the bonus levels.<br />Other than that it was pretty good.  Game does not change when you play it multiple time.

1402720602|4.0|I was looking for a book to actually teach me how to build a guitar.  If that is what you are looking for this is not it.  It is however a great book.  It gives some history on he origins of the guitar.  Something I knew nothing about but always wanted to learn a little.  It does give some insight on building such as different bracing techniques and the various styles of classical guitars.  Not a bad read for a luthier or hobbyist that just wants to learn a little bit more about the instrument.  If you are wanting to learn to build a guitar I have been told by numerous people that a book called Guitarmaking.  I have a copy on the way.
0143122843|5.0|I think I'm becoming a major Philip Kerr fan. This eighth novel in the historical series featuring the very world-weary Bernie Gunther, private eye and anti-Nazi extraordinaire, is perhaps the best of the bunch. Bernie's been drafted back into the cops, working as a detective in Berlin in late 1941. He's been to the \\"east\\" as an SS officer (after Heydrich drafted him, leaving him no other options) and he's glad he's back in Berlin, but he's grumbling about the conduct of homicide investigations, the way things are done and so forth. When Heydrich interrupts the latest case to insist that Bernie come south to Prague, where he's essentially the colonial governor of what's now the Czech Republic, Bernie follows orders and goes, bringing his girlfriend along. Heydrich announces he needs Bernie to act as a bodyguard, and figure out who's trying to kill him...and soon after, one of Heydrich's aides is murdered, and Bernie must solve that, too.<br /><br />The book whirls along at an impressive pace, and works pretty well. I have one weird quibble with the way it's written: I don't see the need for a chapter of 130+ pages in length, when some others are 2-3 pages long. Chapters are supposed to break the book up into manageable parts, so that you have a place to stop; at 130+ pages, no one's going to read that in one setting (or not many people, anyway). Aside from that, it's a very interesting book, well-done and amusing. It also brings Reinhardt Heydrich to everyone's attention again. For those who aren't familiar with him, he was the guy Hitler supposedly wanted to succeed him, a truly devoted Nazi who enthusiastically fought as a Nazi reservist in the Luftwaffe even though he didn't have to. His plane actually got shot down in Russia. On the negative side, it was Heydrich who chaired the conference at Wannsee where the Nazis decided what to do with the \\"Jewish problem\\" as they termed it, the conferees of course deciding to go with death camps, as opposed to trying to send them somewhere remote like Madagascar. Heydrich was a truly evil character, but a true believer and a brilliant administrator and leader. He also had a J. Edgar-like intelligence apparatus that gathered intelligence on other Nazis, through wiretaps, phone taps, and intercepted mail, and so he was much more powerful than he would at first appear. Given what an evil snake he was, he deserves to be forgotten, but prudence dictates otherwise...
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|A fun hidden object game with puzzles that don't frustrate. A good game to play, put away and play again.
B00AJLHULW|2.0|Let's be clear: I love Robben Ford's guitar playing. He's part of my Mt Rushmore of Jazz/Rock guitarists; LC, Scofield, and Mike Stern being the others. But I absolutely hate hearing RF sing, its just not a good thing. He is nowhere near the level of noted singer/guitarists such as B.B. King, SRV, George Benson, Bonnie Raitt, and Prince. This record suffers because of his insistence on stepping up to the mic. Next time RF, hire a lead singer. Its nothing to be ashamed of. If it works for Carlos Santana and Eddie Van Halen, then it'll work for you.

1419705849|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and really looking forward to seeing the film of the same name. There are plenty of plot segments that could have been taken down in favor of story that would add to character progress. The Halloween segment where trick or treating with Greg and Rowley leads to a confrontation with bullies is one humongous bit of blatant padding for time and had no real relevance to the overall narrative of the film beyond the obviously goofy surprise ending that really didn't do much to make the characters interesting aside from redeeming a character.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season yet. Must see if you're a walking dead fan. Can't wait for the fourth season to come out.
B00AIA89HS|4.0|This album is great. It is a good album for the fans and for anyone who just strted listening to Hatebreed its albums like this that are keeping the metal community alive!

It is easy to use, has good graphics and provides the most information of any weather app I've seen.  I use it everyday!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The game is fun and kept me entertained, but there aren't enough levels. They need to add more over time. I have 3 stars on all levels and nothing left to do.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Enjoyable but not worthy of academy award greatness; It's in great company as far as this years films go, but it's not number 1.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow, so much fun, easily a five star game. Play everyday and its still fun. Recommended highly. Easy to lose hours a day playing, especially like visiting other games. GET IT!!!!!
B000002LMK|4.0|One of Neil & Crazy Horse's most overlooked albums.  Grunge precursor and distortion a' la carte.  F*!#In' Up finishes with over 1 minute of excruciatingly zeroed-in feedback, and the rest clock in at slightly under.  One of those albums that you pass by until you listen to in the context of some external event, and then it just locks in.  This album is not for the casual listener, but for the NY&CH aficionado.  You want easy listening, go buy Barry Manilow, and my condolences to your widow when your brain atrophies.
0316228532|3.0|JK Rowling is a fantastic children's author but not much of one for adults.  The characters are simplistic and there's none of the depth or inner life or descriptiveness that readers expect from adult fiction.  Even the vocabulary used by Rowling is simple, much like the Potter books.  Though the themes are adult - drug use, small-town politics, class, race/ethnicity, aging - the book is simple storytelling, surface skimming.  It was an enjoyable tale but nothing more.
0525478817|3.0|I am a thirty-something woman who enjoys the occasional young adult novel!  I found this book well-written and gripping, but I was a little taken back by the push of a worldview that says that only idiots believe in God.  I felt like John Green pushed his point throughout the book that if you are intelligent, you can't possibly believe in God.  That pretty much ruined what was an excellent book otherwise.  I do consider myself well-read, intelligent, thoughtful, and a believer in God.  I think it's pretentious to depict people who believe in God as idiots who need to be soothed by platitudes, as John Green does in this book.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|The only problem with this game, other than the size of the download, is that it is addictive. I'm hooked.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I think the Amazon review system is fantastic.  It has helped me purchase and avoid purchasing numerious items.<br /><br />However on something like the Harry Potter collection...lets be honest.  Either you like these films or you don't.  Nothing I can say will be any more info than what you already know.<br /><br />Personally I enjoyed being able to watch the entire series as the characters grew from kids to adults, rather than watching a string of different actors portray the different ages.  I guess that is one thing unique to this collection...continuity beyond compare.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Did not see the ending coming. I thought it was a predictable book...then boom I was fooled...and the cliff was no longer there.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I love the Hawaii background of the movie, George Clooney and the plot. Amazing plot. Very refreshing. Might be a  little slow for the people who love excitement. I love it very much.
B00992CF6W|2.0|on the app store this game is a cheaper price. Its priced at $3.99 I think that's fair for MINECRAFT SINCE ITS AWESOME but these price is ridiculous. Plz lower the price because I love this game..... pretty please?
B0011NVCSO|1.0|This is a great album, but the vinyl pressing is awful.  Surface noise (crackles and pops) throughout all the songs.  Its so bad at times that the vocals and instruments distort.  Very Disappointing.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Whether or not you believe that this particular manifestation of the account of Bin Laden's death, OR that this mission was even carried out at all (tip of the hat to you ole conspiracy theorists out there), this is still a pretty good book, just as Zero Dark Thirty was a good film (though not directly related). Interesting read if you like military literature.
B004WR125O|1.0|Worked flawlessly until all of a sudden after 2 1/2 months it just quit.  80% refund plus shipping and handling... $16 back.  Think I will just run to Radio Shack and see what they have.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was an excellent read. Collins is a wonderful writer. Once I picked up the book it was difficult to put it down. I would recommend to book to both younger and older adults! It may even be a good read for English teachers when addressing famine in the world and social gradient.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't  stop reading. Such a difficult subject yet handled with great care. Very insightful. Up to the last page I couldn't put it down. Jodi is truly blessed with the art of telling a story that makes you think....
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|This movie was superb!  Although the scares are sporadic, the story was intriguing and suspenseful.  I was never bored.  After watching horror movies for 40 years, I don't care for slasher films.  I prefer intelligent, suspenseful horror with good acting and a great ending.  This movie fits the bill.  I recommend it for those who prefer stylish horror.  Best of all, there are no vomiting scenes.  I hate that!
1417747811|5.0|You hear about certain things in life that everybody says you should do. See Machu Picchu. Go skydiving. Eat one of those poisonous blowfish. Watch The Wire. To your bucket list should be added Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />Now I say this as an American, an American who hasn't known one iota of the hardship the Joad family Steinbeck outlines in this book. And from what you gather throughout this text, the Joad's were just one of the many unfortunates caught up in the turbulent changes wrought by the Depression and industrial agriculture. Their journey is that of a nation in turmoil, reverberating clear into today.<br /><br />But this book is so quintessentially of America you can't separate the two, and all the better if you are reading this book with some intimate knowledge of the US. Even if you don't know America, this is a great exposure to the dramatic juxtaposition between rich and poor that has defined us all the way up until today. Chapter 5, where Steinbeck outlines the role of banks in the plight of the Okies, could easily have been written about 2009-era America and its ravaging by Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs - some 80 years later.<br /><br />The scene painted by the characters in this book evokes rich imagery, from the listless Al, to the frightened Rose of Sharron, the transcendental preacher Jim Casy and the practical, short-tempered Tom. Each builds the story through redneck moments of hardship, triumph, defeat, generosity, blind hatred and almost every emotion you could dream up. I wont get into the individual scenes but they had a particular pull for me, after having seen the destruction of the rust belt in upstate new york with my own two eyes.<br /><br />But what gives this book its five star ranking has to do with some deeper, ethereal quality. The amazing works of literature make their point with subtlety; Steinbeck crawls up your back the way one of those cheap undershirt tags rubs against your skin. It's this incessant, methodical march he presents that surrounds the issues of that day so clearly - and with such conviction - you must pay it proper attention. This book will leave you thinking for days, pick it up.ical march he presents that surrounds the issues of that day so clearly - and with such conviction - you must pay it proper attention. This book will leave you thinking for days, pick it up.

B006CHML4I|5.0|it looks nice and cheap.In the night,the hands are very clear,and the light lasts for almost the whole night.I love it.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I love this film, and the cast is outstanding -- Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton.  Need I say more?  Maggie is vintage Maggie, playing a racist old woman who is forced to travel to India for a hip replacement.  Judi plays a vulnerable and sheltered woman whose husband has died after losing much of their life savings.  It was refreshing to see Judi play such a vulnerable character.  My last on-screen memory of her was Pride and Prejudice, in which she played Lady Catherine, a very cold character.  Penelope's character and her husband have also lost much of their life savings, after he gave it to their daughter to help her start a business.  As usual, Penelope does her best acting through facial expressions.  There are four other characters as well, but those three give the most commanding performances.  The film satisfied (and encouraged, strangely) my wanderlust, because it involves a group of British retirees who travel to India.  Also, it is bi-cultural in that one of the storylines concerns the young proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and his relationship with a woman whom his mother deems unsuitable.  The film provides a good dose of Indian culture.  I gave it four stars instead of five because the dialogue needs some work.  That wasn't as obvious during the first viewing as it was during subsequent viewings.
B0057VDGNK|3.0|The soundtrack is very depressing but good and its definitely perfect for the movie.  It has a 80s feel to it.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I've been a fan for 50 years. This little chip is wonderful. The music seems new and I appreciate songs that I would normally skip.I own the remastered stereo and mono cds but this thing opens up a new listening experience. Yes it's too expensive and yes I've spent too much money on every Beatles \\"new\\" issue but this is it. Skip a meal everyday and save the money to get this. I feel like George Martin and Geoff Emerick listening to the flac version with headphones. Step on the gas and wipe that tear away and get this.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, watch it. Just go buy it. Its worth it. And being able to get it on bluray for ten dollars is amazing. Not only is this the most hardcore actionpacked kung fu gunfight machete swingin movie I've ever seen, but its got a legitimately interesting and suspensful plot that keeps it from being just gratuitous violence. But dont worry, theres plenty of violence. I reccomend this to anyone who likes kung fu or action movies.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I loved the characters in this novel. It didn't take me where I expected it to go. While a murder mystery, it's also a story of family love. Will definitely be looking for more by this author.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|the first book was absolutely wonderful and I was done with it within a week (that's fast for me since I don't like reading too much) and then it slowed down. so you will go back and forth between being on your toes to mellow. overall I loved the series and would recommend it to children in 8th grade or higher
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I am waiting for the newest book out. Seems like I have now read all available. Hurry up.<br /> I love the TV series. You picked a perfect set of actors to portray the characters. Have already pre-purchased the first year series. Thank you so much.<br />  Ernie Carani
0307352153|5.0|Quiet is well written and well researched and offers a wealth of information about the differences between introverts and extroverts. Extroverts prefer action to contemplation, risk taking to certainty, and they are comfortable with conflict. They also make fast decisions, multitask, think out loud, and are talkative and interesting.<br /><br />Introverts, in contrast like being alone, enjoy being cooperative, work slowly and deliberately, have great power of concentration, think before they speak, express themselves better in writing than in speaking, dislike conflict. They are apt to be sensitive and serious.<br /><br />Cain makes a clear case for the fact that extroverts are highly valued in our culture and introverts are ignored or even looked down on. She explains in detail the valuable contributions introverts make to our culture and our world. They are the thinkers, creative and visionary. This is an excellent, valuable book.<br /><br />I was surprised Cain did not cite The Introvert Advantage: How to Thrive in an Extrovert World. Though quite different from each other, both are excellent books on a much neglected subject. The Introvert Advantage offers more practical help for navigating life in an extroverted world. For a full picture, read both books.
B00BGDF1FO|1.0|I know not everything stays the same, but what this acoustic abomination has to do with the Metal Gear universe is beyond me. I was more than willing to give the game and it's soundtrack the benefit of the doubt, bought it, played it, hated it and it's music as well. This soundtrack might be something for teenagers or people on Crystal Meth, but there just is no real quality to it. So it fits the game perfectly, which is another sad fact...<br />I can only hope that no more of these missteps will be added to Metal Gear's otherwise flawless musical track record. And for the future I hope Kojima develops proper Metal Gears in house without outsourcing it to guys like Platinum, maybe these games will then get a soundtrack worth listening to with proper STYLE, HEART and SOUL like all the Metal Gears before them!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Interesting X-Files-like program. Characterizations are interesting. Storyline moves along well. First two thirds of Season 1 did not push the main story line that well. Last third of the season took off.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This was a very fast read, I really wanted to know what happened. Quick paced and interesting, but I still felt like it was lacking something. I just never felt like the characters were all that believable maybe. It felt like a poor man's Gone Girl.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|Bought for my wife for her book club.  She says it was OK but not great, like most modern novels.
B00026WU7I|4.0|great music from one of the oldies but goodies. Bob Dylan is a one of a kind artist. The new artists on the scene don't even come close to the musicians of yesteryear.

A must see for anyone... a stupendously amazing cast will have you fall in love with this movie!

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|O.k. I am a huge fan of the comics. I never got into the safe, coffee table marvel comic story lines and always felt Dredd to have more of an edge with its drug addicts, terrorists, mutants and serial killers that filled the story lines of the best British comic that ever graced the magazine shelf at the store. For years i looked forward to the movie...then Stallone did one that was NOT anything to do with the comic OR character.......and that was that!...until now!<br /><br />The Good-<br />Its shot in a dirty, grimy way (as Mega City One should be) some people are complaining about this but i understand this was done to make the 'Slow Mo' scenes much more clear and sharp which moves me onto my next point. The Slow Mo scenes were absolutely beautiful, they were shot in extreme slow motion with a track that sounded like Loscil's 'Argonaut'. The effect was a tiny glimpse into the mind of a poor drug taker seeing a snatched moment of perfection in an otherwise ugly world...i remember the scene with Ma Ma in the bath and the droplets of water looked like a a shower of diamonds floating in the air. Cinematically combining these moments with the grey, grim futuristic settings with only flashes of sickly and nuclear yellows to draw the eye i was impressed.<br /><br />Its Good Vs Evil in a strictly darwinian sense. The justice is doled out in a totally impartial way...many people have said this is pure fascism but these people obviously do not know the story behind the judges...retirement for them is called 'the long walk' and means leaving Mega City One to wander the cursed earth and try to bring justice to the mutant wastelands. The Judges are selfless upholders of the law who reap no reward other than seeing a perp get what they deserve.<br /><br />Dredd the man was a job well done by Mr Urban, admittedly its not the hardest role to act but it requires a little subtlety in his growls that Dredd fans like myself saw and appreciated. Anderson was as fragile and uncertain as any rookie would be on the job (i loved her mental battles with the gang member 'Kay') MaMa was probably the most evil (and skanky) looking female criminal i have seen on the screen in a long time! i really felt for the tech guy who was terrified of her!<br /><br />Yes there was no glorious end-of-level shoot-out with the boss...MaMa was just another perp to Dredd and he summed up the understatement when the Chief Judge asked him at the end what happened here (After the night long battle in the block with dozens of enemies dead) and he simply replied '...Drug bust'<br /><br />The Bad-<br />These are just little gripes of my own as a huge fan...I would have loved to have seen more of Mega City One and its huge range of interesting sub-cultures. The city looked a little sparse and it should have been a little more like bladerunner complete with hover pods flying about. It did not feel as futuristic as the comic.<br /><br />The marketing and the 'Crappy Stallone Dredd Drag Factor'...basically killed this film at the box office as everyone thought \\"oh they have re-made that crappy movie?\\" and thus it did not make it its targets for a sequel deal however....Its wonderful to see this has become an instant cult classic and the Blu Ray & DVD sales and fan interest will probably put the baddest Lawman in the planet up where he belongs on the big screen with a multi-movie franchise!<br /><br />Summary-<br />Loved it!I cannot wait for the sequel!!!...then i can start getting excited for Dredd 3!!!!as any rookie would be on the job (i loved her mental battles with the gang member 'Kay') MaMa was probably the most evil (and skanky) looking female criminal i have seen on the screen in a long time! i really felt for the tech guy who was terrified of her!<br /><br />Yes there was no glorious end-of-level shoot-out with the boss...MaMa was just another perp to Dredd and he summed up the understatement when the Chief Judge asked him at the end what happened here (After the night long battle in the block with dozens of enemies dead) and he simply replied '...Drug bust'<br /><br />The Bad-<br />These are just little gripes of my own as a huge fan...I would have loved to have seen more of Mega City One and its huge range of interesting sub-cultures.

B000092T6M|5.0|Amazing movie once you get past Kevin Costner's accent! Apparently I am not the only one who felt this way I read many of the reviews for this one and the accent issue seems to be a general consensus... Apart from that everything else is perfect the Sheriff of Nottingham is played by the sexy and irresistible Alan Rickman so that sold me on the idea of buying it right there... A must see... Absolutely!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Its not the best super hero movie I seen,but it wasn't to bad.It starts out telling how space and every thing else was made,and then the guardens appeared.Who then set up in A planet called oah,and how they created the green corp.It als tells by just chance how A test pilot from earth got selected,and thats when the real story begins.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I liked it. A different book than the previous ones I have read.  Good mystery. Nice resolution.  On to the next one!
1558908846|1.0|The Good-<br />N/A<br /><br />The Bad-<br />For years i read the awesome comics that were dark, gritty and full of drugs, serial killers, mutants and such...a hellish world being governed by the baddest lawman on the planet Judge Dredd! well i remember being young and SO excited for this film but after i watched it i was utterly crushed! The apple falls so far from the tree on this one as a fan. Yes sme people argue its mindless fun etc etc...but for me he was my comic book hero. Not some safe, coffee table marvel comic book hero with super powers...just a real man, a Judge who selflessly dispensed lw to the mean streets of Mega City One.<br /><br />I will not go into acting, lighting, plot, dialogue (I am sure it was never aiming to win oscars anyway) but for the true representation of Dredd watch the Karl Urban 2012 Movie...now He IS the Law!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I cared about the characters and would recommend this book to a friend. Thank you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Abyss is a great hidden object adventure game. The graphics are top-notch, the story line is interesting and the gameplay is smooth. The puzzles and HO scenes are a bit on the easy side (even in expert mode) but I did have to think quite hard few times. I didn't have to skip any puzzles, but I enjoy the challenges. :-)
B001S86J0I|5.0|The movie is absolutely amazing... What more can I say they have an amazing cast... Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Tim Allen, the list goes on and on! There are so many great actors and actresses in this movie and it is absolutely hilarious!!! Plus the special features on this deluxe edition are super great too... Sigourney Weaver rapping seriously!!!

B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is too slow, not as fast paced as I like and had issues and it crashed all the time - nobody ever helped. Prefer Pumpkin Bingo for its addictive, fast paced bingo - will be sticking to that as they have GOOD customer service!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I love the author's writing style. Good quick read. Gets you thinking. Definitely makes me open my eyes to my world and life.
B00124BNF4|3.0|I never loved Talking Heads but they had some songs that were key to college in the 80s.  I couldn't pass it up for 3 bucks.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I did really enjoy this book, however I  wish the editor gave it more than a \\"once over\\". There were just too many mistakes, words being left out, etc...it really takes you away from the story instantly and then you have to try to delve back into it, but the moment is lost. I know it shouldn't be a big deal but when I'm reading a book I like to be completely taken to another world, not stopping because of errors every other chapter (literally). And I'm not putting down the author because I really did enjoy the story and characters, especially Travis. I just hope she really puts her editor to work next time.
B000FA675C|3.0|Usually I love Dan Brown, but for some reason I lost interest midway though the book. As if once I knew that big secret I didn't care as to how the rest of the book panned out.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|This is without any doubt such a typical release that every horror movie collector NEEDS to have, just wonder how long they still will be around, certainly now with the new release of the Evil dead remake! Get them as you long you have the option! A MUST FOR EVERY COLLECTOR!
0938045768|5.0|This was an extremely informative book.<br />A great tool to help students at any level. It taught me how to gently build myself up; to get slowly stronger and stronger every day through steady progressions for all the key body parts.  My core, back, arms, and legs have never felt so energized.  Mega Kudos to the author!  Weak little old ladies like me will want to start at the lowest stages displayed.  BUT FYI for you tough guys--the progressions lead all the way up to HANDSTAND push-ups and ONE ARM pull-ups.<br />It literally offers not just a beginning but a well-considered GOAL for everyone at any level of fitness!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Be prepared to ask yourself, &quot;have I really been playing for three hours?&quot;  It really is that addictive, especially when you can't get past level in this Bejeweled-like game.  As you repeat levels, you learn how to beat that level.<br /><br />I'd make it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  The half star depreciation is because the game is only loosely based on the movie.  A closer association with the movie is an intriguing idea.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This was such a good movie for all ages.  It has such a terrific message.  It is nice to watch a movie that does not shy away from a Christian component, yet is not an in-your-face bible-beating movie.
075669812X|5.0|Christmas present for our little 6 yr old Ninjago fan..this immediately became our night time read before he goes to bed.
B009VB97EY|5.0|What can I say, this movie is all about the eye candy. Hot guys getting nearly naked. This is no Oscar contender but very entertaining none the less..
B000LPS47U|5.0|As a collector this releas of AB is a must to have, was so lucky to get the final last release that was sold here by amazon. pity they didn't ship it straight to Europe, some they do some they don't, but i have a few very nice friends over in the States who were glad to help me out, so with a little American detour this finally winded up in Belgium!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Eight years ago Justin Timberlake released his second studio album [[ASIN:B000H305U0 FutureSex / LoveSounds]],an album very much defined by uptempo funk and EDM musical ideas and hybrids. The grooves were emphasized over the vocals a lot of the times, and it was quite a creative departure from his debut. In the time since that release Justin Timberlake has taken time to star in feature films and,for awhile seemed to be joining the ranks of Elvis Presley and Whitney Houston who traded in their musical banner for shots at the silver screen. But not only did his theatrical roles turn out to be a big success, but they seemed to have inspired him creatively as well. Most popularly inclined music artists today have gone backwards to a degree to emphasizing single songs again. Mainly,as with the 45 RPM record half a century ago, that format is more in tune with the age of internet based formats such as YouTube and MP3's. Not only is Timberlake a fan of dressing and grooming himself in a sharp,elegant manner but his time in film probably exposed him more to the medium's dynamic way of presenting its vision. So since Timberlake bought \\"sexy\\" back last time out,he is now bringing the musical quality of the album format back in a similar fashion.<br /><br />  The album opens with the upbeat melody and stop and start groove of \\"Pusher Love Girl\\",with Timberlake's sensuously subtle vocal approaching wrapping around the hiccuping rhythms as he compares a strong relationship to an addiction. Hearing it here I've warmed up heavily to \\"Suit & Tie\\",a percussively  rhythmic funk piece where Jay Z's rap is perfectly in tune with the musical setting and never intrudes on Timberlake's melodic vocal harmonies. \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" blends a slower 2-step dance groove with a trance music-type harmonic atmosphere,complete with East Indian singing and flutes. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" is one of my favorite songs here. It begins with a lightly pulsing,spare electro funk and builds in it's last three minutes into a afrolatin dance/funk/percussive jam. The enormous rhythmic dynamics of \\"Tunnel Vision\\" and the slower \\"Spaceship Coupe\\" but more of the emphasis on Timberlake's songwriting and vocals again-as he vocally harmonizes with himself Marvin Gaye side to express both the romantic and carnal side of his personality in these songs. \\"That Girl\\" is a sweetly melodic neo soul type number-led by a fantastic jazzy guitar riff that again places the focus on his singing and melodicism. \\"Let The Groove In\\" is just amazing-a hyper kinetic funk era style jam that is heavy on a genuine African percussion/tribal dance rhythm.<br /><br />  \\"Mirrors\\" is a very potent mixture of modern soul and progressive pop/rock that grows stronger in tone as the song progresses-especially in terms of its melodic development. The final song \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\"-with it's spare trance/electronica sound and backwards loops takes the overall approach of this entire album to its most basic level. And what is the overall approach of this album exactly? In a modern production concept from Justin and Timbaland,who produced the previous album, Justin Timberlake has managed to bring out a re-visitation of the cinematic psychedelic soul/funk/pop-rock sound that permeated music by Isaac Hayes and much of the Norman Whitfield era Temptations. The songs here are generally seven + minutes and therefore have enough space to develop instrumentally and vocally. But as opposed to relying on a backup vocalists and enormous orchestral instrumental passages with no vocals, Timberlake's own talents in singing/songwriting are integrally linked to the conceptually dynamic instrumental approach this album takes. And the mixture of tradition string and horn arrangements with modern day EDM/hip-hop electronics give this album the possibility of being the commercial fruition of how music in the last three or four years has began to grow out of the unsettling complacency its been in since the turn of the millennium. Considering this albums already strong commercial success, if an approach to music like this catches on in the coming years, the funk/soul album innovations of the century might reach their commercial golden age.m.

B002RKSZS0|4.0|Lots of young humor and delight from Ms Austen 's tale of a young curious everyday girl- light hearted and cute
B00122FYMO|5.0|Aah, the Glory Days of the early 80s.  Madonna's self-titled album captures that era as well as any other music.  Some very good songs from this album are not on her compilation albums.
B008602KQI|3.0|Many reviewers speak of this movie in terms of something futuristic when in fact, an oppressive government has existed in the past and most likely will again.  What do you think happened during the Gladiator times, slavery, the Holocaust, the Serbian War, Belfast, etc., etc. The movie was controversial in that the lives of defenseless small children were taken.  I will never find that entertaining any more than trying to create a love story based on pedophilia, such as the movie Lolita.  Boundaries Hollywood.  I gave it 3 stars because all of the actors delivered.
B00571F26Y|4.0|It is amazing how simple and straight forward this book is, while it is also highly informative. I would recommend it, and have, to anyone that has the intention of loosing weight and feeling better. I am 100% certain that this book will teach you something, even if you are a professional, about health and the effects of wheat in your diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It's been wonderful reading London once again.<br />He is such a thorough writer .<br />Animals and wilderness are vivid reminders of past wonders of this planet.
B00B19GKI0|2.0|I though this movie was gonna be amazing judging by all the reviews. This movie actually looked like it was filmed<br />in the early 80's. Very little to no action with a lame story. Great concept to a movie just bad execution.
B00BIK3FAI|4.0|Just delightful, great detail, beautiful art and well thought out. My only problem with this little gem is that it is too short.
B005636EA6|5.0|What a great clubbing party album!  The lyrics are clean.  It's all about poppin' bottles and livin' the high life.  Great dance music.  My favorite song is actually &#34;Best Night&#34;.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|I know this film is very cheesy, but it does keeps you entertain from beginning to end. Also, it is one of the landmark pictures of 1970's Cinema. For that along, the film deserves some sort of respect.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|This film got off to a good start, but became too predictable. Also, while I can understand sound effects in the capsule or within the suits, several effects were of outside noise..THERE IS NO NOISE IN SPACE.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It's everything you want from MIB -- Will Smith, Tommy Lee, and really bizarre aliens.  Lotsa slime.  Lotsa bravado.<br /><br />Watch and thou shalt not be disappointed.  Unless you didn't like earlier MIB's.
B00969GFFU|2.0|I just finished 562 pages of agonizing reading - I guess I only finished the book, because I paid good money for it.  I was hoping that if I stuck with it, it might eventually have something to say worth hearing.  It did not.<br /><br />I didn't like any of the characters - hard to keep reading when you don't care about the characters.  The reading was slow going, it was not an easy or quick read.  I often thought I must be crazy to keep reading!<br /><br />If you want a good read with great characters and wonderful prose, read Ivan Doig's, &#34;Dancing at the Rascals Fair&#34;.
0793518326|1.0|I repesct this publication and those who were involved in writing as I do know The Beatles did alot of tricky writing. &#34;All My Loving&#34; for example so wrong in so many ways. So far I've got a set list of 20 songs my band does, and at least 5 of those are very incorrect. I found the tabs online to learn correctly. It's a real hit and miss.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|If you have liked Kelly's CDs in the past then you will like this one.  I would recommend to anyone who likes Kelly's music.  Can't wait for her next CD!
B004LKVHSY|5.0|Some times the book in which the film is based turns out to be better than the picture, but other times (like this one) the book and the film can't even be compare. The book is very painful, but this movie is a hearth break. One of the finest films not only of the 90's independent spirit but in all of film history. I've seen the movie in television when I was a boy, also in DVD and even in Blu ray, and I can tell you that either way you watch this movie it will affect you. This is a picture that should be in every film lover collection.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This is very similar to the regular fruit ninja game so if you like that you will like this.  You only notice the Puss in Boots at the beginning menu.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|I am a near-original Rails developer, and a guy who loves the attitude and approach that Fried and DHH (Hanson) promote in their books.  But this one takes their ideal past a limit of utility.<br /><br />Here's an analogy: go to any Rails API page and check out the code.  It's brilliant.  It's awesome.  It's terse and simple.  It's elegant.  But because of all of these things, the top-level APIs of Rails all call second-level APIs, which are also abstract, wonderful, cool, terse and simple.  And that's great -- this is &#34;how to write beautiful software&#34; in its essence.  But if you're actually trying to figure out how a given method works, you have to drill down into the methods called by the top-level.<br /><br />And this is the weakness of Rework.  It is short and sweet -- an easy read and direct to the meat, no doubt.  But, in the same way that you need to believe the top-level Rails methods work, you are asked to believe that the top-level methods described in this book work, too.  My experience says that both Rails methods, and those proposed in Rework both work ... but while you can test the former, there's a great leap of faith required to accept the latter.<br /><br />Frankly, I think the book is thin -- not just the absence of fluff, but the absence of demonstrable, clear evidence that their approach towards business is applicable to yours.  In the end, the ideas are all sound, in my experience, but they devolve to just assertions of truth, rather than demonstrations thereof.  I think I want more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very beautifully designed and smooth motion throughout gameplay experience. a sweet realistic take on every kids dream of owning a horse. high quality graphics i give this game a five out of five well done!
098478280X|5.0|Very organized<br />a lot of information<br />useful for the interview<br />a lot practice questions<br />have solutions<br /><br />only if could have some solutions in c++/c

B0021L8V0W|1.0|I love Angelina Jolie (From Tomb Rider to Hackers to Girl, Interrupted) but I couldn't found a soft spot in my heart for this movie. * spoiler alert * Also, through out the entire film Angelina gets slap a lot, and whenever i watch a film when a woman gets slap it really makes me uncomfortable.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Love my glee!  This season is just like the rest so if you're a glee fan you'll like it.  Hard to get used to a bunch of new people.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a magnificent production. The cinematography is pure art and can compete with the great paintings of the past: I think I have never seen the like of it. Some deviations are made from the book, all seemingly in order to obtain those stunning images - Darcy's proposal for instance is made under a solemn, late 18th century garden \\"temple\\"; in the pouring rain, rather than prosaically in the small cottage guest room she occupies at Lady de Bourgh's; the denouement is even more torn out of any convention, but it yields the strongly symbolic mage of two lovers in grassland embracing amidst haze and dew against the rising morning sun: I buy it.<br />I cannot vouch for the story's consistency because I know both the book and the superb 1995 BBC series too well to be able to imagine learning the story by way of this motion picture. Other than that, the acting is superb; Keira Knightly (with a name like that, when is she going to do Emma???) magnificently portrays both the serious and frivolous sides of an intelligent and wise 22 year old; Matthew Macfadyen had to grow on me (and who in the world can top Colin Firth's plunge in the pond of his castle?) but convinces; Donald Sutherland, though in my view a miscast, is his superb self; and Judy Dench places a most formidable and implacable Lady Catherine. Everyone else is thoroughly enjoyable.<br />The music is well done, fortunately with period players (the English Concert): what a chance, nowadays, for a film director to depict musicians the way they played in the time of the story! This period playing is combined with 21st century music depicting the characters' emotions, and all is amalgamated into a good whole. The costumes are very well done too, maybe a bit too upscale (difference is made though between the rich and the less so), but they blend better into the stunningly gorgeous pictures than (perhaps) simpler, more realistic clothing would.<br />One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.<br />I wonder if Keira's blowing out a candle somewhere in the middle of the movie is a small wink at Jennifer Ehle in the BBC production, who does the same, in pretty much the same way.
B009IUH1N2|2.0|Not the best I've seen having to do with ninjas. Maybe it could be turned into a temple run knock off.

B000002H4C|4.0|Bought this for my husband and he seems to like it.  I can't really comment on the music that much.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|A very well made picture that still look and feels as intense as it did back in 99. One of the finest Blu ray experiences out there, from the audio to the video. This movie (specially on Blu ray) is a must OWN for any real film collector.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Decent movie and makes you think about this time in history but I found it to be very slow.  I took a nap in the middle and I don't think I missed much.
1423140605|4.0|All three of my daughters have read and enjoyed this, along with the rest of the series. They really enjoy the characters, telling me about their favorites.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Great detail.  This book provides some haunting images of what life could be like in North Korea.  At the same time, it weaves in tales of near tragi-comedy in the US and Japan, showing both what the then regime of DPRK thought of the US and how it approaches its nearby neighbors.  It shows a nation that has left both time and humanity behind,  the costs to its residents far too high to bear.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John scazi is a great writer and the book Fuzzy Nations is one of my all time favorites. Quick and easy read
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady GaGa is so talented.  Would recommend this CD to anyone that has like any of her songs.  This is the kind of CD you can listen to over and over again!

0385738781|4.0|I enjoyed this series of books, leading up to this.  Boy oh boy was this a different turn from the previous two books of this 3-part series.  However, I think it was time that the trilogy ended with this, and I'm kind of glad it did.  Would i recommend this series to my friends, you bet your butt I would.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a Very addictive game with achievable missions. It has some Very cool characters to unlock. A must have.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Like the others, this is a book about revolution. Unlike the others it is about the revolution of one woman's soul. Just when you think k things are going to turn for the good, something unexpected happens. It's a great story.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I am generally good at games like \\"Collapse\\" and Match 3 genre. I started to play and after a short period of time, I was advised that I was \\"out of lives,\\" BUT for a certain amount of money, I could BUY more lives starting at $1.99 for 10 lives upward to $99.00. So far every time that I play, at the end of EACH round they take a life. When I lose my lives (around 5) a clock counts down several minutes until I get another life which will be taken away as I complete the one minute or so pre timed round. I am not about to sit for several minutes and watch a count down clock and wait to get one more life. I have received respectively scores just to still lose a life. I OWN several games including Collapse and I can play level after level and not lose a life. The real idea behind \\"Diamond Dash\\" is that most people like me do not want to wait to continue the game so they want you to give them money to continue to play and an awful lot of people will do just that. Try an experiment and write down every time you PAY and how much playtime get for the money. I think that you will be amazed. I know I was. I have also found that these monetary rip offs occur more times than not with games that constantly tie themselves in with Facebook. Parents should monitor how much money their kids are spending.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE....This game is not at all technologically advanced and completely not worth paying any amount of money for!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Great CD.  I love Lady GaGa and her music.  Great up tempo CD that can get you going.  Would recommend if you like her last CDs.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|I admit it I love the movies and getting all of them on Blu-Ray for 89 bucks is great, of course it's not jam packed with extras and whatnot for the die hard Twihards but it's not that big of a deal (unless that's more your deal). They've got a few extras on there but nothing crazy.
1904550665|5.0|This is a great book for my 3 year old. She sings with all the 3 books we have so far. She knows the songs from story hour at the library where they have the same books in maxi format. This is awesome and provides quality time for your child. The illustrations are beautiful. Would definetely recommend this for all children from 2 years up.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books are one of the best books I've read. Can't wait for the movies. It's hard for me to find a book I can read and not git board ,but these three books are books I can read again and again
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! It is not Mario,  but is easy to start and then more challenging, giving you time to learn the controls and the lay of the game itself. Thank You!
B007THA4FI|5.0|It's hard to believe the same author who brought us Harry Potter with all the magic of his world could also write a book so depressing and dismal.  Rowling drew me in based on her past reputation; she kept me reading based on her brilliant writing ability. I can't remember reading a book this well written in recent years. Her characters started off bad and got worse.  Her plot could only lead in one direction - there was NOT going to be a happy ending.  Yet I couldn't put the book down.  I can only hope that the characters represented the worst possible in people, and that in real life, people have some redeeming qualities.  I'm not sorry I read the book, but it was challenging to become part of the dysfunctional and dark world Rowling created.  Be prepared to be stirred up emotionally.
B00192IV0O|4.0|This is a good CD by the Black Eyed Peas.  It is kinda techno sounding so if you like that you will like it.  Techno is kinda a turn off for me which I am not a big fan of this CD because of that.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|“Fifty Shades of Grey”… where do I begin?  Being a reader I found that the book provided a good fluid read.  Unfortunately, all the hype surrounding the book is hog-wash.  I think what kept me reading was the anticipation of the BDSM acts.  The BDSM scenes that never occurred!  The basis of this story is about a young virgin being turned out by a wealth, handsome, and extremely experienced man.  I mean what else would be expected from such a situation?  The erotic scenes were over as soon as they started.  I felt like I was cheated by all the hype.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I downloaded this game randomly and I must admit that it is one of my favorite apps!  If I could just eat the guy parasailing it would be great! !
B007STXHTM|5.0|Does the job very well, good manufacturing and properly packed.<br /><br />I used it several times. No way to get a good movie underwater without it with a Hero 2<br /><br />I do recommend it

B004KSQN7C|3.0|This CD is okay.  After really listening to Britney you start to realize that the poor girl really can't sing.  Amazing she has made it as far as she has.  It has good beats so it probably wouldn't be bad as a workout CD.

B002UHSDUK|5.0|Why are 20 more words required? I've got 15 more reviews to do and i just want to be nice and submit these for you guys but i don't want to spend this much time on this. Really!! Why can't i just write Good, Bad or Ugly?

B008JEJOCY|5.0|These Crocs fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I have two permanent screws in my left foot and if I wear traditional sandals or flip flops for a long period of time my left foot begins to throb with pain, so I decided to give crocs a try. My Crocs offer the same free airy feeling for my feet that I love as traditional sandals do, except I can wear these crocs all day long and the screws in my foot do not give me any pain, my feet feel like I am walking in gel all day they are wonderful. Also the quality is great they stand up to all kinds of walking conditions and they are easy to clean, this will surely not be the last pair I buy!

0307454894|5.0|We all pretty much keep a few secrets from our loved ones. Some of them probably could be over small things, and others could be life-changing. In Bernhard Schlink's novel, it follows a teen boy and his secret romance with an older women, which alters in his university years when he sees her on trial for something she did that's inhuman involving the Holocaust.<br /><br />It all starts in Blumenstrasse and we focus on a fifteen-year-old boy named Michael Berg who is diagnosed with hepatitis. Every day is a challenge for him, and he believes that there might be no hope for him. One day in October while walking home from school, Michael ends up vomiting and suddenly, a woman comes to his aid and conforms him that changes his life forever. He decides to thank the woman with a bunch of flowers in her third-floor apartment. Michael learns her name is Hanna Schmitz, and quickly he falls in love with her. He spends many of his days at her place bathing with her, reading to her, and fighting over petty things but always making up. However, one day when visiting Hanna, Michael finds out she's gone like thin air and leaving him with a heavy heart.<br /><br />In part two, we see Michael now as a young law student with a bright life after trying to forget the woman he so dearly loved. His class is studying on the Nazi trials and that the best way to learn it is to see it up close. Up at Bergstrasse, a trial is in motion and Michael is shocked to find out who it is: Hanna Schmitz. Every day at the trial, Michael can stop but observing every moment of Hanna defending herself when she has been accused of joining the SS in Auschwitz during the Holocaust. After that, Michael's image of Hanna starts to affect him as the years go by and makes an unexpected decision.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" truly is a novel that has its share of shocking and sorrowful moments that makes it have an emotional vibe. I read the novel back in my sophomore year in high school, and reading it again, it felt like it was more memorable. The story starts off a bit as romantic and at times erotic, then in the second part, it takes a more dramatic turn that made me continue to read more. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is definitely the heart of this novel, as well as its emotional and heart-aching atmosphere.<br /><br />Some readers will probably find the novel too dark or racy since it involves the Holocaust. But others should give the novel a chance, and will find it as a sad heartbreaking tale between two lovers. For me, I found the relationship to be truly unimaginable and full of emotion that i found it very much one memorable novel.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Schlink's tale of two lovers packs an emotional punch that's truly and unimaginably powerful.ike it was more memorable.

0736092269|4.0|Very detailed, well labelled book.<br />I initially bought the women's one thinking it would be fine but only realised once I got it home that it was missing half the body!<br />Thankfully this one includes your arms and chest.<br />I bought it more for the anatomy side of things as I'm interested in studying phyio/sports phisiology, and live how it highlights the major and minor muscles engaged in each exercise.<br />Also includes more on common injuries etc not included in the female one.<br />And still includes female anatomy pics so go figure

B00C5ZORES|5.0|Not even two months ago, Fall Out Boy was still split up - at least to everyone's knowledge - and the band's future was uncertain. And now, we have their fifth album ready to download. As a massive fan of the band, it feels almost surreal. It begs another question as well: how good can an album that was recorded suddenly and in absolute secrecy be? As it turns out, very good. Fall Out Boy, unhindered by expectations from fans, made an album that's quite different from all of their pre-hiatus material, yet still feels true to themselves. This is not a sell-out album, as some might have you believe. Some detailed song-by-song observations are below, though for those of you who just want the quick run-down, here are some concise thoughts:<br />* Fall Out Boy is NOT a pop-punk band anymore. Sorry to anyone who had an investment in that side of the band. I would say that they most resemble pop-rock now. I'd say this new stylistic shift has allowed them to create arguably their best album yet... however, some may be inclined to disagree. Please know going in, however, that this is NOT a pop-punk album and does not attempt to be.<br />* This album is supremely catchy. Almost any song on here could probably go on the radio and have some degree of success. In that sense, this album's reminiscent of fun.'s latest record, \\"Some Nights.\\" Again, this is not a bad thing-- it's just different.<br />* Patrick sounds better than ever before. If you thought he was good on \\"Folie\\" or \\"Soul Punk\\" (his solo record), you'll be even more blown away by his progression here.<br />* From a parent's standpoint, this album is both a bit edgier and a bit cleaner that Fall Out Boy's pre-hiatus material. It's edgier in that there are more profanities. \\"Where Did the Party Go\\" and \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" both feature the f-word, and one swear shows up on \\"Young Volcanoes\\" as well. In addition, Courtney Love and Big Sean deliver heavily-profanity-laden guest spots on \\"Rat A Tat\\" and \\"The Mighty Fall,\\"two otherwise clean songs. However, this album is also a bit more clean than Fall Out Boy's latest, in that it feature far less sensuality than usual - the band seems to have matured, focusing on other topics besides just romancing girls (although there's still a decent amount of that). This section may not relate to most people, but parents wondering whether or not the album is safe to play in front of the kids may need to assess their ability to handle harsh language.<br />* Yes, it's different, but it's not as if Fall Out Boy suddenly sold out. This album is a natural progression of the direction they'd already started in \\"Infinity on High\\" and developed on \\"Folie a Deux.\\" If you like \\"Folie,\\" you'll probably like this album. If you hated \\"Folie,\\" well, this album's probably going to be even worse. I think \\"Folie\\" may be their best album, so I was inclined to like this release.<br />* Buy this album. It's fantastic, and there's not a single bad song on the album. It's different, but give it a few listens and you'll get used to it and like it.<br /><br />SONG-BY-SONG:<br />THE PHOENIX - Kicks off with a bang. Massive, epic, and dramatic, it's everything that their first track back as a band should be. Patrick gives a standout vocal performance. I'm not a huge fan on the overly synth-y chorus, which seems just a smidge TOO dancey, but the rest of the song is hard to find any fault with. 4.5/5.<br />MY SONGS KNOW WHAT YOU DID IN THE DARK (LIGHT EM UP) - The only incredibly long song title on this album, sadly (another thing that Fall Out Boy's changed). But man, what a song it is. The synth loop at the beginning might scare you into thinking this'll be overly poppy, but it's probably one of the darkest, rockiest songs on the record. Patrick's \\"I'm on fire\\" is wonderfully unexpected and feels like a classic rock anthem. 4.5/5.<br />ALONE TOGETHER - What would happen if Fall Out Boy covered Maroon 5? This is probably pretty close to the answer to that question. I'd call this one of the poppiest songs on the record, and for some of you, that'll be an instant turn-off. It's catchy as all get-out, and I'll be incredibly surprised if it's not a radio single at some point (after \\"My Songs\\" and \\"Young Volcanoes\\"). It really grows on you with repeated listens. I like it now. 4/5.<br />WHERE DID THE PARTY GO? - I'd say this is arguably the worst song on the album, and it's not even BAD. It's just... not at the level of the rest of the songs. A little catchy, but nothing too memorable, and it feels overly synthy. The needless profanity on the second verse kind of subtracted from it for me, too, though that's a personal thing. 3/5.<br />JUST ONE YESTERDAY - Patrick feels practically blues-y from the opening lines, and the songwriting is vintage Fall Out Boy - a little nonsensical, but super-clever and witty at the same time. This song feels like it could have been ripped from \\"Folie a Deux.\\" Only suffers due to being a bit unmemorable in the context of the album. 4/5.<br />THE MIGHTY FALL - I'm not a fan of Big Sean. He didn't add anything to the song except the need for a radio edit. That being said - this song is fantastic despite him. The chorus is massive and will get stuck in your head all day, and Patrick's as commanding as ever in the vocals. It's very reminiscent of \\"My Songs,\\" so your thoughts on that song will probably apply here. 4.5/5.<br />MISS MISSING YOU - This one's a grower. I didn't care much for it, or even remember it, upon my first listen. But this song has a way of getting into your head the more you listen to the album. \\"Baby, you were my picket fence\\" is going to kill in a concert setting. It's designed for that sort of arena-style sing-along, and really embodies the new sound that Fall Out Boy is embracing on this record. 4/5.<br />DEATH VALLEY - Another very-\\"Folie\\"-ish song. Fans of the band's older work will probably find the most to like on this song. I've heard someone compare the song to Queen, which doesn't ring entirely true to me, although I can see where they're coming from. It's a pretty great song, although it kind of suffers from blending in among the other, catchier songs. 4/5.<br />YOUNG VOLCANOES - Boldly going where Fall Out Boy has never gone before, and on a mission towards complete and total radio domination. Seriously, it's just a matter of WHEN this song utterly takes over radio for months. The song is pure pop and catchy, and fans will be totally caught off-guard by the song. Give it a try, and you might just be won over by it. 4.5/5.<br />RAT A TAT - I don't know what the heck Courtney Love is doing here. The song would have been much stronger without her, as was the case with Big Sean. That being said, this song is probably the closest Fall Out Boy gets to returning to their bratty, pop-punk roots. The music is really fun and danceable, but without the synth issues that \\"The Phoenix\\" had. The gang vocals take some getting used to, but it gets better with repeat listens. 4.5/5.<br />SAVE ROCK AND ROLL - An absolute beast of a finale. Fall Out Boy's best finale yet, and probably the spiritual successor to \\"What a Catch, Donnie\\", but better. I'd be surprised if anyone hated this song, even old fans who miss pop-punk Fall Out Boy. The emotion and energy on this song is transcendent. It's an anthem, in the truest sense of the word, and one that won't leave your head for days. Elton John becomes the first guest singer who actually really adds to the song, as he and Patrick's vocals complement each other nicely. I can't lavish enough superlatives on this song. 5/5.<br /><br />So that's \\"Save Rock & Roll\\". People are going to make fun of the title and say that they're not rock anymore, but that's not even remotely true. Fall Out Boy has always been poppy, to some degree. That's implied by the \\"pop\\" in \\"pop-punk.\\" \\"Sugar, We're Going Down\\" and \\"Dance, Dance\\" were both poppy singles, albeit in different ways than this album. This album stakes out new territory, but doesn't sell out in the process. The songs are great and not just easy, churned-out radio hits. You owe it to the band to at least give this album a listen, and to make up your mind for yourself, beyond the hype. You might just like it. I know I did.
0307341577|2.0|I bought this book after reading Flynn's Gone Girl, which I absolutely loved, even the ending which some reviewers didn't like so much.  But Dark Places put a bad taste in my mouth.  I didn't even want to finish it, and finally put it down for a few days to decide whether or not to even keep going.  Wanting to find out how it all ends, I pushed through to the end, and it did have an ok ending, but it was just too dark and grotesque for my liking.  I agree with all the negative comments on this book that other reviewers are saying, unlikable characters and all that.  Usually I lend my books out to friends, but this one I just donated to the library (they have a long enough waiting list for the book).  I couldn't recommend this one to anyone!
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Bought this CD because I really liked one of the songs.  Good CD to listen to when traveling out and about in the car.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|I'm not really sure why people didn't like this album. I listened to it today and thought it was an awesome mix of every facet of what a truly great jazz/blues album should be. It's not Robben Ford's most ripping album guitar wise but shows the evolution of a truly great old school band leader. It's music for the soul in every way.<br /><br />I liken it to the old days when you could sit in a smoky jazz bar and listen to some cool jazz while sipping on a bourbon on the rocks while smoking a good cigar. I would LOVE to hear him play this record live with a great big band. Cigar and bourbon not withstanding.<br /><br />If you appreciate good, laid back jazz/blues from a true artist, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was a dictionary. What else do you say about a dictionary. It has a lot of words. Yay I guess
B004LWZW4W|4.0|Good movie, enough  said.  Why I bought it, is not for discussion.  These reviews should be any number do words.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I could have saved my time and read another good book instead of wasting my presious reading time with a juvenile story.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Took a couple of times listening to to really really like it.  Whole CD is about sex so may not be good for a younger audience.  I LOVE it and plan to buy every CD Bruno releases.

B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|\\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves.\\"<br /><br />This book left me speechless. I still cannot decide whether I loved this book or just liked it.<br /><br />Like all the other tragic love stories I knew someone was going to die in this book but still it caught me off guard when it happened. It happened all too quickly for me (I was expecting it to be slow with lots of tears).<br /><br />I found the characters to be fun while reading even though most of them are suffering from cancer. They accepted what they have, they accepted that one day they were all going to die.<br /><br />There are many quotes that I love from this book, especially this: \\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\\"<br /><br />This book left me thinking and thinking. I couldn't come to a conclusion of whether I loved this book or liked it (somtimes I even feel like I completely disliked this book)! And I don't think I will ever land up on one particular conclusion any time soon.<br /><br />If you love tragic love stories then, this is a book that you must read.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have watched this movie probably 7 or 8 times, and still enjoy every scene.  Now that I have the 3d version, it is just as good , maybe better.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|It really is a novel full of suspense.  I felt as if I could have been in the story.  The ending is a susprise but I was satisfied.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Really works! I don't often bother to do reviews, but I am so pleased with this DVD I wanted to share my experience and encourage anyone who might be on the fence about it that this is an effective workout. I never watched Biggest Loser but was familiar with Jillian Michaels, and bought this figuring she would help whip me into shape. And wow, I am not disappointed. This is a challenging - yet fun and upbeat - workout, with 3 levels. Each workout is about a half hour long (she calls them 20 minute workouts, but there is a warmup and a cool down for each - WHICH I TOTALLY COUNT, thank you very much (!) and make the total time closer to 30 minutes). I am currently on week 3, continuing to rotate all 3 levels (mostly switching back and forth between 2 and 3 at this point) and like them all. Each version has parts that seem relatively easy/do-able, and each has at least one part that seems darn near impossible... at least until after a few more days of trying. The thing that has impressed me the most is the SPEED at which I am seeing improvement. There were exercises (\\"circuits\\") which I could barely do the first time or in the first week... and on day 21 I can tell you, I can do them ALL - even the advanced versions following Natalie. I can really see and feel a difference in my weight, my fitness, and especially my abs. If you buy this DVD, do it every day, and really stick with it (\\"Don't give up!\\" and \\"Don't phone this in!\\" as Jillian says just at the right times), you WILL see results.
B007XF0X16|4.0|Good movie, enough  said.  Why I bought it, is not for discussion.  These reviews should be any number do words.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really liked Sharp Objects, but I was spoiled by her later 2 books.  I recommend this to you, it is worth your time.
0375842209|4.0|I ended up enjoying it in the end.  About 80 pages in I felt like giving up, but after page 100, I was drawn in more every chapter (by page 400 I couldn't put it down).  It is ironic though how in the amazon blurb it is called a \\"small story\\" being that it is a 550 page hardback.  I would have thought that there didn't have to be as much background stories as the author gave each character, but as it is a story set in the of the rough time period of World War II it softened the intensity.  The book, also, is told from the perspective of Death; which sounds horrifying at first, but really gives the story an edge that is intriguing and unique.  In the end I gave this book 4/5 stars.
0393061310|1.0|Over the past few years, I have read books that I consider superfluous.  I will critique them.<br />Ideology Trumps Fact<br /> I am a great admirer of Jared Diamond.  He obviously has such wondrous elitist status, as how could I not?  He is a scientist in physiology but nevertheless this book under review is what I would call comparative archaeo-anthropology.<br /> The premise:  It had been noticed that while human beings are supposed to be 98% the same biologically (as claimed by science, nor do I doubt it), the conditions of various nations and peoples are vastly unlike.  Some have been very successful, the Europeans and Eastern Asians, others have not, mainly in Africa but also in Australia and in other areas thought to be remote; these have been calamitous failures.  Or, to put it in specific terms:  Nigeria, because of its geographical size, its large population and its natural resources, should be a successful country and part of the G-20 nations and make a G-21.  But it is not.  The last I heard about Nigeria was that parts of its former capital and the commercial and cultural hub, Lagos, were returning to jungle.  The same could be said for South Africa.  A reason for this state of the planet wanted to be found by certain elements of American society for ideological concerns.  They wanted to find a cause other than \\"intelligence,\\" attributed to Europeans and certain East Asians, for the rise of nations and peoples.<br /> Therefore, Diamond wrote his book.  First of all, while Diamond is a scientist in his field, this book is a popularization of subjects that are not his field --- and even though an erudite popularization is one in error.  The book fails to prove what Diamond set out to do.  He admits it.  Further, almost every assertion about peoples and the planet could be challenged by an expert in the field involved.<br /> The belated societies, further, have something that Eurasians did not have when they started: They have the example of the successfulcountries themselves, in their history, political struggles, technology, medical and even weapon advances and even literature.  These the dominant peoples would give them, and have - and either country to country or by individuals.  Nor has this worked, except potentially in a small way in some countries.<br /> Diamond does not prove his thesis, and the book is not partially a failure; it is totally a failure.  It is stuffed with \\"ifs\\" about the development of the planet and its peoples as far back as the Pleistocene. Nevertheless, the author has gotten kudos throughout the academic and publishing fields for his attempt to prove that something other than intelligence is involved in the rise of peoples and nations.  I did not want a \\"good try.\\"  I wanted a book that established other reasons for the welfare of nations than intelligence, and the book was presented that way.  The subtitle says \\"The Fates of Human Societies,\\" which is an absolute statement, as if it were an established fact, or a serious hypothesis under peer review.  Rather, the book is near totally conditional and contingent; or, to speak plainly, false.<br /> Further, the book quickly got boring to me, as I perceived that it was neither science nor fiction --- but a vast collection of facts in specious organization.  (Perhaps it might fall into the genre of \\"creative nonfiction\\" that means, rather, \\"arrant nonsense.\\")<br /> I do not know what the reasons are for the perceived and persistent differences between peoples.  Some such biogeographical considerations as Diamond posits may have meaning as part of an answer, if one is ever established.  But Jared Diamond has not presented the solution.  He posits a vast array of interesting facts and developments but we are still as ignorant of the reasons for the developments of human societies as we were before his book.  The supposition that geography and climate affect human societies is not new.<br /> But then, in another millennium, the world might change in a way that will allow the gifts of the belated peoples to thrive and dominate.  (We should remember that Europeans, about CE 1000, did not appear to be on their way to dominate the planet, if we can forget Byzantium --- that we have.)<br /> Nor do I disbelieve that New Guineans may be, on average, more intelligent in their milieu than Westerners/Americans are in theirs.  (This is especially true with American politicians who must be the dumbest creatures on the planet, whatever sub-species they are.)<br /> Nor, if they do not want to construct a modern, industrial, technological, profit-driven, exploitive society in their own lands, that could be a fact in their favor.<br /><br /> Therefore, since there was no answer to the question of the peoples of the planet in their various degrees of --- Success?  Dominance?  Effectiveness in the world? --- the book is superfluous and a waste of my time to read and thus irritates me.  The author and publishers might be accused of falseness in advertising.  The project of the book might even be termed propaganda.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I think this book would be better suited to a teen audience. The writing was casual with several points of foreign languages where the author mostly makes it clear what was said. I found the vocabulary to be high school level. Also, as is true with many fantasy stories, there wasn't a satisfying conclusion that draws you into the next book as a desire to hear more stories about the characters or the world, instead it was slightly anti-climatic and left the reader dangling at the end. As if the only way to get the audience to want to read more is to hear how the story ends.

1476734941|5.0|I bought this book after I heard about it on tv. As a fitness instructor I watch lots of people trying to loose weight the usual way - restricting calories & burning more calories - without success. I am one of those people who is skinny on the outside, but I have some fat around the middle that just doesn't go away no matter how much I exercise. I find his research fascinating, although so far much of it is anecdotal. His approach reminds me of interval training (interval eating), which has proven to have great health benefits to all age groups and fitness levels. I am following the diet (5/2) because cancer runs high in my family, not really to loose weight. I find it really easy to do - and I'm eating more fruits and veggies on my fasting days (which I've been trying to do for ages, but it just wasn't happening before). I have noticed that my pants fit better (after about 4 weeks), and it gets easier to do the diet as you get into a routine. I found that starting the fast after an early dinner (say 5pm), then a low-carb breakfast, then just nuts/fruits/veg in the afternoon and you're done (ready for your full dinner at 6pm) - makes it much more doable than going more than 24 hours (ie dinner - breakfast 36 hours later). There's lots more research being done on this diet currently, so I expect to be hearing more about the results in the news soon.
B000006IVI|4.0|The Sci Fiy movie that showed us the alien experiments of Area 51 and the attempted take over of our planet is now here for you in a classic Retro format the Laserdisc.  With extended play hosting 55 min of video per side this Laserdisc will keep you entertained and on edge.  However this version does not include some deleted scenes that were brought back in the DVD release.  This does not make the movie any less exciting as it is being shown in original Theater presentation.  But if you see it on DVD with the few additional scenes and re watch the Laserdisc you will notice the gaps.  Overall it is a great movie on a great medium.  Keep the digital vinyl spinning.

1400069289|5.0|This is an engaging book that will bring about a great deal of thought, discussion, and self-examination.  Duhigg discusses not only personal habits but organizational and societal habits as well.  The book was well researched and Duhigg uses vivid examples that really bring the book to life and make for an exciting read.<br /><br />Some of the negative reviews mentioned that only the first couple chapters focused on science and the rest was just filler.  It's true that only the first section discusses the neuroscience and studies in regards to habits and this is a fairly high level overview that the average reader should be able to comprehend.  The remaining chapters included speculation on how this science has been applied or could be applied.  Due to Duhigg's background, this is more or less what I expected so the fact that the book didn't focus completely on scientific theory didn't reduce my enjoyment.  If you're looking for an in depth scientific study that covers the low level details of how the brain functions this is not the book that you're looking for.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't get enough of Downton Abbey.  This set is a great buy and I have already loaned it to some friends who were most pleased with it, but like me regretted several of the plot lines from season three.  However, we shall see what happens as season four comes on the scene.  Surely DA can continue to engage us all!
B009AMANH4|5.0|I hear many say it's boring and they want to sleep through it, but my brother and I, who are mildly interested in history, love it to pieces. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing as Lincoln.

B005LAIHZY|1.0|This was disappointing. It might be the dumbest story I've seen in a long time. Nothing heroic, nothing inspiring, nothing adventurous, & outside of the first 5-10 minutes... nothing entertaining. Also not sure what the title \\"BRAVE\\" had to do with anything with the story line or main character. The lead character didn't do anything \\"BRAVE\\" once the story started. As for the settings & locations (in which an animated feature could transport you anywhere your imagination takes you)... yet the entire movie actually took place in about 2 locations; the modest castle & a small section of the forest. Once again there was no imagination.<br /><br />Even the supporting characters were lacking. The witch (who was pivotal to the story twist) was dumb, one dimensional, the character was not fleshed out, had no originality & outside of 5 minutes the witch had no further involvement in the entire movie. The main villain of the whole story line had very little background ... we didn't know anything about \\"him\\" even during the conclusion. The whole plot revolved around turning the mother into a Bear?? The only thing more absurd, was how \\"the Bear\\" interacted with the daughter. It was clumsy, and a head shaker. The moment that happened & I realized that dynamic is what the whole plot revolved around... they lost me. The first 5-10 minutes of BRAVE (when the main character was a child) were promising, after that, there was no point to making this movie... even less of a point to watch it. The best way to describe BRAVE, is that the entire movie merely scratched the surface of what they could have done. In a word... disappointing.

B003TTKB5I|5.0|Season 1 is the first glimpse of the unique characters that populate Seattle Grace Hospital. The staff's personal stories are a continous revelation. With the patients' stories woven into the tapestry, we watched one episode after another like a book we couldn't put down.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is the one game on my kindle that I have not gotten bored of. It is always being updated and would say it is one of the best games you can get. Worth way more than three bucks.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have had this knife for about 6 months now. I take it hiking and camping. I havent even noticed the weight. I have used it for food prep and batoning wood. It came out of the box ready to go, razor sharp. It is my &#34;survival knife&#34; I am confident it can handle any situation you would need a knife for, from making feather sticks to batoning.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Been wanting to read this forever. Glad I did! There are some lose ends I wish had been more tightly crafted. I need to go back and revisit the secret Dorian shares with Alan Campbell that give s him power over Alan. Wilde has an odd way of shifting narrators and point of view. It was almost as if he wrote as he went and never went back to edit.  Overall, I enjoy classics and this one was worth the read even it wasn't five stars.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book. It's a fresh take on young love! Read it - you won't be disappointed! Can't wait to start the sequel!!!
B001EU79F4|5.0|Bought this to replace the vinyl I,ve had since college. Been a big fan for a long time, he captures a world of blues in his songs
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my father. I have not received a report whether he loved or hated it, so I guess it was okay.
B004MYFUC8|3.0|Put off reading this book for 80 years. Shouldn't have. Loved every character. What a delightful book.  Genius author.<br />Never boring.

1400069807|3.0|Although much has been written lately about the so-called obesity epidemic and the hazards of processed foods, I hadn't read a lot on those topics. But I recently finished Brian Wansink's \\"Mindless Eating\\" and found it fascinating. \\"Salt, Sugar, Fat,\\" a hot new book, seemed like a good way to continue the exploration.<br /><br />Well, no.<br /><br />Moss has certainly done his research, and he clearly tries to be measured in his approach, both good points. However, this book seriously needs cutting and better editing all around. For example, do we need to have the sales tactic known as \\"up and down the street\\" explained more than once? And how often do we have to be warned about the dangers of too much X?<br /><br />Grammatical errors and word misuse abound--the negative connotation of \\"cabal,\\" for instance, must have flown over too fast.  But my absolute favorite is this howler from the chapter on salt: \\"Doctors groups held press conferences to sound the alarm that many patients didn't even know they had high blood pressure until they developed more evident complications, such as congenital heart failure.\\"<br /><br />All in all, readers in search of more and better information will come away from this book with their hunger unsatisfied.
1454901276|5.0|Equally as good as the other  2 set in the Hebrides<br />(don't need any more words to describe how good these novels are.)
B00122TDAS|5.0|Another great album before they went Pop. Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford amazing writers/musicians not afraid to break new (back then) ground. Good music for old hippies.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I have seen this movie before, but could not remember it well. I loved the interesting plot, but the however the movie contains a good bit of filthy language. I cannot understand why film makers think filthy language makes a movie more interesting, I think it takes away from it. And you have to get past the first half of the movie with the character of the children being extremely disrespectful. You almost wish you could discipline them yourself.  The movie is set in Hawaii, and contains a lot of traditional Hawaiian music.  It may be considered a chick flick, I'm not sure, since men vary in their interest. However, it is not an action pack movie, which is why I like it, and may be why men may not like it as much.<br />The DVD arrived much faster than I thought it would. With in a few days.  I was very satisfied with the delivery.
0061714372|5.0|Is one of the best biography's I've ever read, is so precise and really entertaining, you feel like you are having a coffee with mustaine while he is telling you all of the different things he had to go through during his live. i recommend this book to everyone who wants to know how's the life or a rock star but a human being too.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is an awesome product! I initially purchased the Anker SlimTalk 3600 mAh first for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, but it did not have enough charging capacity to charge my phone 1 time fully. While my phone has a 3100 mAh battery, you have to keep in mind that 30% of the power is used to power the charger and the remaining 70% of power is used to charge your phone. Therefore, after acquiring the Anker Astro2 Duo which had almost triple the capacity of my phone battery, I am able to charge my phone 2-3 times fully from 0-15% phone discharge before the charger needs to be charged again. I informed Anker customer service that they may want to disclose how much power is used to power the charger vs. how much power is used to charge your mobile phone so the accurate product with the appropriate capacity may be purchased the first time. Overall,  I am satisfied with this product,  and I am completely satisfied with Anker customer service. Thank you.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|How many ways can I say I love this app. It has transformed my organizational skills. It is simple to use yet amazingly useful. I love that I have full control of content. I enter my own choice of names for folders. I can set reminders and add notes. It is great to be able to check off completed items and restore them later to use again. It took several apps to do all I can do with this one, so I've been able to delete other apps. And to top it all off, sharing across devices is the frosting on the cake. Worth more than 5 stars!!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Great Movie. Enjoyed it A lot. I would recommend this to ANYONE. I adored the Movie with Russel Crowe and others. this one was nice too!
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|A very funny happy album. I enjoy most of the songs. It's definitely a summer album, i mean, you feel in summer everytime youhear it because you can easily imagine yourself outside in the patio drinking something nice under a tree while enjoying this music and having fun with friends.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great Hinton game. I wish credits were easier to earn. But as far as bingo goes the mobile version is my favorite!
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|If you haven't seen it yet, watch it. You need it. It's a cultural requirement, I'm serious.<br /><br />- Killer Fight Scenes. Check.<br />- Spectacular cinematography. Check.<br />- Badass moment after badass moment. Check.<br />- Cheesily delivered macho lines. Check.<br /><br />It's a badass movie, don't let three stars fool you, most films aren't deserving of four or five stars these days.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am a fan of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books so I was wary of the movie. This was true to the book, though it did add some activities by Gandalf that were not spelled out in the book. I do not feel the additions did any harm, and in some ways, it helped. Well worth the money. Thanks Peter and team. Job well done.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|My son is an avid fan of Minecraft so I was thrilled to find a name brand (Lego) product for his birthday.  Opening the box, the almost 500 pieces initially looked impressive, but that soon changed as it was assembled.  The characters are miniaturized and it seems the majority of the pieces are the smallest Lego makes.  Once assembled, it's so small it looks almost pathetic.  Unfortunately the packaging was damaged in the excitement, so I'm not even going to try to return it.  If it was sold at half the price, it might be an okay value.  But at this price, it's a complete rip-off.  Don't waste your money.
B00BI6SVCE|4.0|as someone who was not a fan of Kiss Each Other Clean, I was a little weary about the new album from Sam Beam...<br />my fears have been subsided, this is his best record since Endless Numbered Days for sure.<br />definitely going to end up in my top 10 for the year..<br />good show sir!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Cinematography is spot on. Acting is superb in my opinion. Has one of the best movie scores by Oscar-winning Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, and contrary to popular opinion prior to release, a movie about Facebook turned out one of the most memorable films I've seen in a long, long, long dang time. Watch it. Own it. Worth it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book reached out and touched my heart. It challenged me and inspired me. Definitely a book to pass on!
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I enjoyed the book and how it was broken down, very easy for beginners to digest the information presented and a good refresher for anyone that's experienced to use. I've been lifting weights since I was in high school, I don't consider myself a beginner, but I'm not an expert (definitely not a bodybuilder). I was a college athlete, I understand lifting, nutrition, etc.<br /><br />Very easy to read and follow the program and plans laid out in the book. It brings me back to the what worked best for me, heavy weight, low reps, and bodypart specific training. I've never incorporated HIIT into my workouts so I'm sure that will help. I would definitely recommend this book anyone looking to get in shape, stay in shape or get over the plateau they've hit.<br /><br />Only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that I just started the program last week so I haven't seen major gains yet. Once I see those gains I'll come back and update my review.
B002BE7JEI|5.0|This is one of the best Stephen King film adaptions ever! Right up there with Carrie, The Green Mile, Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption! Kathy Bates gives an unforgettable performance in her portrayal of Annie Wilkes. She walks a very, very fine line here- giving just the right amount of humor to her character but not enough to make her performance over-the-top. Kathy Bates is one of the finest actresses we have today and she's not given enough credit for her varied work. James Caan is terrific as the bed-ridden author that Annie saves from a car crash and takes care of in her isolated home. Little does Caan's character know that Annie was stalking him and that she is his 'number one fan' and will do anything to keep him under her power. Director Rob Reiner keeps his actors in hand and lets them play around with their roles but doesn't let them go too far. This movie is, as they say, a 'keepah'!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Like the app.  Gives nice graphic of battery life.  Includes detailed battery information such as volts and temperature which I will use to try and optimize my battery life.
0156034026|4.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid tells the story of a Pakistani citizen named Changez, his move from an undergraduate degree at Princeton to an NYC-based valuation firm called Underwood Samson & Company, and his relationship with the WASP-ish Erica, pre- and post-9/11.  Changez narrates the entire novel--at times in first person, but often in second person as well, as Hamid frames the story as a conversation between Changez (now returned to Pakistan) and an un-named American man in the Old Anarkali Bazaar in Lahore.  Changez invites the American man to try a cup of tea, which turns into a full meal and then dessert.  What begins as a seemingly harmless conversation slowly darkens as the novel progresses.<br /><br /> Just as Changez's politeness masks something perhaps more sinister, the novel's apparent stream-lined simplicity masks its depth and richness.  The novel resounds with the theme of isolation v.s. openness and appearances v.s. reality.  Obsessed with her memories of Chris, a childhood friend-turned-lover who has passed away, Erica retreats further and further into herself, preferring to live in her own fantasies rather than in the real world.  Her inward movement mirrors America's growing mistrust of \\"foreigners\\" and increasing isolationism post-9/11.  Changez, on the other hand, moves from an isolated focus on solely \\"getting the job done\\" and appraising companies to realizing that the reports he and his company makes affect the companies' employees--real people trying to make a living.  He begins as well to view himself as a perpetual outsider, and to connect these companies to larger flows of capital--capital that is disproportionately held by people of Erica's complexion rather than his own.<br /><br /> Another theme in the novel, connected to that of isolation and openness, is that of control.  Hamid's novel is very much a novel of \\"talking back\\" (à la Edward Said)--of insisting that one's voice be heard in a world that so frequently ignores or talks over it.  The only voice we truly hear in The Reluctant Fundamentalist is Changez's.  Changez holds his two layers of audience (the unnamed American and the reader holding the book) essentially captive.  While he includes dialogue between himself and other characters, one is always aware that this dialogue is filtered through Changez's limited first-person report of the conversation.  As such, Hamid also conflates the reader with the uncomfortable American, who, twitchy and suspicious, views everyone around him as a potential threat.<br /><br /> Interestingly, however, the novel does not entirely reassure us that the figures of whom the American is suspicious aren't, in fact, a threat to him.  The novel ends ambiguously.  Because we only receive the information Changez gives us, we will never know what actually happens on the dark road in front of the American's hotel.  In other words, the novel itself is dangerously uni-vocal, warning us through its very structure against only listening to one side of any story.<br /><br />  Hamid's novel thus utilizes a technique--oral storytelling--often explored in post-colonial novels, and with, I think, the intent of \\"talking back\\" against the dominant, hegemonic voices, and it explores post-colonial themes of fractured identity, diaspora, and flows of global capital.  But it does this so subtly, one might barely register the way it very faintly echoes sprawling epics like Patrick Chamoiseau's Texaco or Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children.  Hamid's novel is like its narrator--intelligent, well-mannered, deeper than it may appear, focused, controlled, and sinister.  While giving a 3D portrayal of a (mostly) sympathetic man and telling what appears at first to be primarily a love story, it also raises questions that it doesn't fully answer--not just about the text itself, but also about how to live ethically, fully, and also safely as an American, as a Pakistani, and as a global citizen post-9/11.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good movie. Can't wait for the next one to come out. They did a good job following the book when making the film.
B0053TWV46|4.0|This dvd is a must for any King fan. Screenplay by George Romero based on stories by Stephen King. It's a 'B movie', for sure, but it's a nice little horror film done by two of the greatest folks in the genre!

B001Q5395Q|3.0|So the acting is bad, the movie is low quality...but it's highly addictive.  I've seen this movie over 30 times.  There's just something amazing about killer pop-corn, killer puppets, kill wall-shadows, etc.  It's a must see for any sci-fi fan.  Very creative.

B007VYDFMS|5.0|If you were to give this anything less then 5 stars then you truly do not Know Robert Nesta Marley this man is well I cant give him proper credit by saying awesome or he really is awesome he is King and that should be enough.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading Wool Omnibus, I can say with certainty that Hugh Howey has a fan for life with me. Although this story is not horror, I was taken to a place that was terrifying for me.<br /><br />Everything about this story pulled me in. Reading this series has been an experience and I have recommended it to all of my friends. I want everyone to be as blown away as I was.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Can't wait the book 3.<br /><br />It is intriguing how subtle the writer is aproiching the relations, love, trust. And actions and consequences of ones doing.<br /><br />You won't be sorry to read this book.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Love the story really touched home for me and I will try and spread the word to as many people as possible.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn makes motherly love and sisterhood terrifying. I won't stop thinking about this one for a very long time, I suspect. Regardless, looking forward to Dark Places.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Excellent movie with a renamed cast, good music and entertaining story. My wife likes it a lot, and is a good weekend movie.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Not just another book about the horrors of Nazi crimes in Europe. It is a story you invest yoruself in.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Whether you watch this thinking it's tied to the Alien series doesn't matter, it' a horrible movie with horrible characters making horrible decisions. Watching the way these characters responded to situations made me want to pull my hair out.  I'm having hear palpitations, I must stop writing this review.  Thanks for nothing, Ridley.
030758836X|5.0|I hate when people simply continue to state everyone else's review so I will not give a plot summary. This book left me shaking my head wondering what would happen next. Each time I thought I so proudly had it figured out the plot would do a 180 degree turn and suck me right back in. I will say the story is as powerful and twisting as the Mississippi river. I was a little dumbstruck at the way it ended but it stayed true to form. It was one of those books that had me staying up until 1:00 a.m. to finish reading it. I couldn't stop.....I just had to know. I think it is a must read thriller not to be dismissed by bad reviews.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I used this in Jamaica and cant say enough good things about it.  From reviewing the video, you'd think I had the Discovery Channel following us in the water.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Horse lover, war history enthusiast, anyone!! You get caught up in the story, fearing and cheering. I read the book before seeing the movie. I always love the book more!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have loved this game for years, great for those bored times. You can change the tile set to something other than the traditional tiles.
1423113454|4.0|I loved Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series and so wasn't sure whether The Red Pyramid, the first book of a planned series, would own up to my expectations. All in all, it's pretty much exactly like Percy, except with Egyptian, not Greek, gods and that the point of view alternates between a brother and a sister.<br /><br />When you read this, be prepared to laugh. The same humor that fills the Percy Jackson books can be found here. Carter and Sadie fight like any other brother and sister, and the arguements they have are among the best scenes of the book. The battle of Leroy and the chicken-man, however, is another story.<br /><br />I love this book, and though it's supposed to be written for kids 12 & under, I think older people will enjoy it too, because I sure did. It's cute, funny, and action-packed, with monster fight scenes and suspense lurking around every corner.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Since the magnector is sold without the wall adapter plug, I used the one that came with my nexus 10. I noticed after a few hours of charging, the adapter piece gets fairly hot.  It's never like this when I used the micro usb to charge.  I guess the reason it charges faster is because it's pulling in a lot of juice.  Just be cautious.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great way to learn about how to watch and care for a horse. I love this app so much I had to keep it. This app is great!
B009K677CE|5.0|It is rare when Claudia Brucken puts out a new album! The Lost Are Found....is her latest! What a great album it is. If you are familiar with her work you already know that whatever she puts to music turns to gold. If you don't know her....in the 80's she was in a band called propaganda. That's how I discovered her......loved her work since! The songs on this album are covers....everything from Bowie, Jeff Lynne to Pet Shop Boys.....but she makes these songs magical with her distinctive style. One of my favorites is One Summer Dream......it is perfect! As I stated in the title of this review...you will be hooked!
0316223239|5.0|I've been hearing many good things about this novel and wanted to check it out for myself. Though it's heart-wrenching and horrible, I was addicted to this book, and couldn't put it down. It was easy to picture the characters and Room, and everything was described beautifully. I love how it was told from five-year old Jack's perspective. The contrast of Jack's innocence and the situation they were stuck in was  thought provoking. What if you didn't know anything about the world for the first five years of your life? Everything would be completely foreign to you.<br /><br />Ma was a very strong leading character, raising Jack and fighting for their freedom. She isn't infallible, which I liked. She gets frustrated with Jack just like all parents get with their children sometimes. It's obvious they love each other, and their bond is seem throughout the book.<br /><br />I breezed through this. Sometimes it was hard to tell what Jack was talking about, describing things the way a child would, but it didn't break up the book the way I thought it would-it fit in perfectly. I give it 5/5 stars. This is definitely a novel that will stick with me for a while.
0451196716|5.0|I know Stephen King wrote under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman but this book is worthy of being read no matter who wrote it.  After starting this book, I realized that I had read it nearly 30 years ago; but it was worth re-reading.

B00011ZBXO|4.0|I have to say I loved this movie, but it definitely an off beat movie. If you're easily offended, this movie is not for you. Seth Green is absolutely fantastic!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Smart, sexy, and suave. The backstory as well as the weekly dramas are smart, compelling and each week begs one to come back for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|In the game you own and take care of your own horse . Then you train it and go to competition and earn money that you can buy clothes and horse feed with . Finally you get to know your horse and train it.
B009R659L8|3.0|This is definitely not her best work.  Rambling, disjointed, too many characters that added nothing to the plot.  One the aspects that I have always enjoyed about her books is that they keep you guessing.<br />No real surprises or suspense - I figured out who was behind everything very early on. Quite disappointing end to waiting for this book.  I hope this doesn't mean that Mary Higgins Clark has lost her edge.
B00006D295|5.0|This movie is a cult classic. I love this movie in all of it's crazy/weird/awkward/beautiful/brilliant glory! If you haven't seen this, it is a must! Even if just for the sheer fact of saying you've actually seen it.
B00138H68M|3.0|This is a good recording for what it is.  I guess that I expected to like it more, given all the accolades heaped upon it at the time of its release.  It is just not something that I would listen to on a regular basis.  That said, if you are a Strokes fan, this is the only recording of theirs that you really need.

B000E0W24S|5.0|It is mind-boggling to me that there is anyone out there who could consider this MANDATORY set of Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies, performed so magnificently by the great Yevgeny Mravinsky and \\"his orchestra\\" the Leningrad Philharmonic, as anything less than SPECTACULAR, THRILLING, DEEPLY MOVING, and DEFINITIVE.  This is one of the greatest recorded legacies in all of classical music, and essential listening.  Anyone who loves Tchaikovsky and does not hear these performances is cheating themselves out of one of the greatest musical experience imaginable.  My classical CD collection numbers well over 1,500 CDs, and I would EASILY put this set among the 10 greatest recordings I own.<br /><br />Even if you know these symphonies and have other performances that you are quite satisfied with, you simply must hear these, because I do believe these are the final word on the subject.  Mravinsky's interpretations of these works go right to the very core of these symphonies, with thrilling, over-the-top performances that make the jaw drop while being deeply moving at the same time.  The first time I heard the performances of these symphonies, I experienced both shock and euphoria, and felt like I was truly hearing this music for real for the first time.<br /><br />So what's so special?  There are a lot of appropriate adjectives here, but one in particular nails it for me:  these are *dangerous* performances.  Mravinsky pushes the music and the orchestra to the absolute limit in every way, and by all rights, both the music and the playing should fall apart, but they don't.  Instead, what emerges is so revelatory, so shocking in its beauty, intensity, passion, and even wildness.  There is a *truth* to these performances that makes you feel like this is exactly what Tchaikovsky intended to say, and wanted us to hear, that makes it difficult to imagine there is any other valid approach.<br /><br />Mravinsky's performances here of the 4th and 5th are revelatory and spectacular.  Yet best of all to my ears (if that's even imaginable) is the recording of the 6th.  Mravinsky's performance of the 6th is not simply as good as the others, but even more so, it sets off shockwaves.  There is such an intensity to this 6th that it's impossible for me to listen to it and not be moved to tears, every single time.  The pain is real and visceral, as are all the other emotions that Tchaikovsky conveys, including joy, sorrow, momentary triumph, and ultimate tragedy.<br /><br />Some criticize the playing of the Leningrad Philharmonic as rough and disorderly.  Maybe that's true at the margins, but to criticize these performances for such nit-picking reasons not only overlooks so much playing which is spectacular, but it is reductionist in a way that misses the forest through the trees.  And in the end, do the details really matter a whole lot when there is such music-making going on?  The music is so alive, the performances so involved, and everyone is playing as if their lives depend on it.  This is nothing less than great music-making in the finest sense, and when real music-making shows up, the details just don't matter.<br /><br />Some call these performances \\"histrionic.\\"  That's an arrogant, reductionist comment that indicates a lack of appreciation for what Mravinsky and the Leningraders actually achieve here, and I feel sorry for anyone that would have such a response.<br /><br />No one will mistake the sound for being 2013 state of the art, but you know, it's pretty wonderful sound overall, with richness, beautiful resonance, and an overall sound profile that perfectly fits the performances and actually adds to them, and in no way detracts from them.<br /><br />While any of the details can be criticized, the whole of these performances is so successful and so exceeds the sum of the parts that the \\"parts\\" not being perfect in whatever way simply doesn't matter.  These performances are the achievement of a lifetime, and even if Mravinsky never did anything else worthwhile (and that's far from the case), these performances truly achieve greatness.<br /><br />Quite simply, this is one of the greatest achievements in the entire history of recorded music.nything else worthwhile (and that's far from the case), these performances truly achieve greatness.<br /><br />Quite simply, this is one of the greatest achievements in the entire history of recorded music.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to read and use. It was easy to download. I absolutely love the large display.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I think of this as the perfect companion to the 1968 Beggar's Banquet...not in musical uniformity but in compositional and musical quality: take off the title tune (a throwaway lyrically and otherwise) and Country Honk (a \\"novelty\\" song on a Stones album?) - and you've got a perennial. Both are album filler or as we used to say, B-side material. Along for the ride.<br /><br />A Reviewer here wrote that Abbey Road was better. AR had Something and Come Together, at best, and BB has something called Gimmie Shelter and I don't have to mention the other gems. (like Keith's surprisingly powerful rock n country ballad, You Got The silver, Live With me, their best 4/4 since Stupid Girl; and Monkey man...one of their more *perfect* recordings).<br /><br />No essay..no recording dates. Maybe it's better that way.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|After reading the White Queen, the Red Queen and the one about the white queen's mother, it was fascinating to read the historical perspective of Anne Neville's side of the story...how she saw the events common to the books completely different, with different ambitions and fears. Cannot wait for the last one, the White Princess about the White Queen's daughter Elizabeth! Give me a Phillipa Gregory historical novel on a weekend and don't expect much out of me for a few days....I'll be on the couch, immersed in the story!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is the story of a man who was born and raised in a North Korean concentration camp, who escaped and made it to freedom.  His descriptions of his nightmarish childhood are almost too cruel to read, much less to live through.  If Americans want a better understanding of the Kim regime in North Korea this book is a good starting point.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|... this is closer to Stump's \\"Soul Punk\\" than to the hard rock / punk pop that we've enjoyed from previous albums \\"Cork Tree\\", \\"Infinity\\" and even \\"Folie\\".  And this pains me because I love this band, and I really do like \\"Soul Punk\\" ... it's just a matter of expectations.  I expected / hoped Fall Out Boy would bring the rock, as the title of this album suggests -- or rather, demands.  But after the first two songs, it takes a decidedly turn away from rock.  At some point, I wondered if Fall Out Boy is really just two guys, per the cover ... Pro Tools replacing the job of Trohman and Hurley.<br /><br />I didn't like \\"Folie\\" at first either and it grew on me.  Here's hoping this one will do the same over time.

B0000C7PSW|3.0|We heard &#34;Beautiful Child&#34; play at the tail end of some movie we were watching and both agreed we liked the sound, so we purchased this CD.<br /><br />Beautiful Child is a good song, but there aren't really any other memorable songs.  The lyrics are not very creative.  I'm not sure if he write his own stuff or not.  I can listen to it, but it's not one of my top 100 albums I've purchased.
030758836X|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this book, as it was definitely a page turner, and I wanted to find out how it ended, but loathed every character in the book.  They were all miserable people with whom I would never want to spend time.  I don't actually know why I cared about the end, as I really wanted all of them to just go away.  In short, I have no idea what all the fuss is about. While the writing was good, the characters could use some work.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|A great story that shows the dark side of a political system that for a moment in time was willing to abandoned justice for the sake of preserving civil obedience.

0140557741|5.0|I was at a regional conference for work and this book was shown to hundreds of adult professionals as a means to give us perspective.  This is a must-have.  My only complaint is that I left the book in my car.  It was about 80 degrees outside and my car was probably a little hotter.  The pages stuck together...
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a classic!  Perfect rendition of the original and very easy to play on touchscreen.  The accuracy is forgiving for bigger finger folks like me, which I appreciate!  Definitely fun to kill time with!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|So much to learn from this, and reflect on. It changed my perspective and helped me realize the important things. The things he did seemed so brutal, but also the reasoning he gives makes you realize how overly justified they are. I hope I can meet his family one day and just tell them how much he means to me now. Just incredible.
1594203334|4.0|As a first time parent, I enjoyed this book. I learned A LOT. I've highlighted areas that I want to revisit and commit to memory. I plan on using quite a few principles outlined in this book.<br /><br />I do wish that the book addressed potty training as well as how the French deal w/ sibling rivalry/jealousy when a new baby comes into the mix.<br /><br />Overall, GREAT read!
B000002UJQ|5.0|First off, let me say I've never been much of a music guy.  I've always listened to talk radio and admittedly have some lame albums in my collection.  I've tried to expand my musical horizons lately and remembered several people claiming this to be the best CD they've owned.  I would definitely put it in my top 5 all-time.<br /><br />I was surprised at how throughly great this album was.  I've listened to it many times since purchasing and haven't tired of it yet.  Subterranean Homesick Alien is my favorite new track and is very enchanting.  I never realized Radiohead was so spiritual until I looked up the lyrics on some of their songs.  I will be looking for them in concert.  Really love their message.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I love this game but they need to update it I really want a update so that I can get new blades and back grounds so PLZ
B0000AUHPB|3.0|This is a pretty good movie, made great by some awesome stunt-driving and by the fact that Michael Caine is in it. As far as picture/sound quality and special features, well, it's an old DVD: it lacks.
B007V65R54|5.0|Very well described. Shipped in a timely manner. I will definitely buy products from this seller again in the future.
0425252868|4.0|This is a very readable account following the lives of an American B-17 pilot and a German fighter pilot who were first brought into contact in the flak-filled skies of a cold December day during WWII.  The detailed perspective from the German pilot's position was especially interesting.  The weakness of the writing was the author's unnecessary use of obscenities from time to time, but that weakness seems to be shared by most present day authors, who, by and large, seem to lack the intellectual ability to write without staining their work with splashes from the cesspool of vulgarities. Once I completed the book, blacking out the occasional profanities, I was able to pass it along for friends and family to read.  It's a good story.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Its cool, end of story. Very exciting when Thalia comes! And where's Percy Jackson!?!?Beware Midas and Medea! It's like awesome! XD defiantly something Aphrodite would say!
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|It is absolutely worth the extra money just to have all of these fantastic Blu ray box sets. The features are incredible and the content is, obviously, superb. These are some of my favorite Blu-rays I have.

B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Can't wait for the last couple of episodes. Hopefully they will have season 2 because this is one of the most exciting series since 24.
B005FISBTO|4.0|This is definitely one of the best seasons of Dexter, however the DVD seasons that Showtime puts out are a joke. They have little to no special features, apart from random episodes of their other TV shows. Does ANYONE watch those? Still, a must-have for Dexter fans.
B001JV5BIA|3.0|One of the 1st horror movies of this type. No monsters, aliens, supernatural going on here, just sensless killing by a small band of 'hoodlums'. This movie used to be featured with Texas Chainsaw Massacre at the drive-in. Realistic killing is the horror part of this movie. Random rape and murder starring some really 2 bit actors as the 'hoodlums'. They really epitomize the term 'loser'. The two girls do a good job of acting especially the 1st victim who has the most chilling part of the movie. It's the part that I thought about the most after I viewed it. The rest of the cast is CHEEZ at best with some real happy go lucky music serving as the soundtrack. It's one of those movies that are so repulsive that you just have to see it. Wes Cravens 1st work. I never considered him a horror movie genius as he's looked upon these days but you have to start somewhere.
1451638450|5.0|But it isn't a love match; Ivan actually is coming to the rescue of a beautiful woman in dire need.  What follows is one of the most clever bunch of story lines the author as ever written.  Lots of story lines radiate out of Ivan's generous rescue of the maiden in distress and these stories weave through one another and kick off complications usual to a story about \\"that idiot Ivan\\".<br /><br />Full of fully nuanced characters with visits into the story from other favorite characters from the Vorkosigan novels.  Really recommend this read if you enjoy the Miles Universe and it will give you more than one ironic smile with its prose.
034580404X|5.0|These are great books. I couldn't put them down!!!! I have shared them with all my friends. We are all Christian Grey fans
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is EXACTLY like Mario bros. everything is the same but in leprechaun version!!! it has everything!! :) i SO recommend this game!! totally worth it!!!
078322947X|5.0|Awesome movie. Awesome Soundtrack. One of those movies that flew under the radar. I love those kind. You can tell that the director of the movie also did the French Connection and The Exorcist. Not a lot of dialogue once they set out but the mood is very tense. Highly recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun game, seems to function ok.  A good way to pass the time especially if on a plane or waiting in line.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very fun game to play on my kindle fire. I recommend it for kids, I like that it lets you practice and compete.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This is a great book for anyone, but especially those who eat lots of processed foods.  The book has convinced me (an admitted bread addict) to try a wheat free diet to see if some of my autoimmune issues improve.  As other reviewers mentioned, parts of it are pretty dry and scientific, but I think that background information is important.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I like this game. You can be a shark and you can eat people. I have much enjoyment playing this game... Try it out &amp; you might just like it....  :-P
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very good game it is very easy to use if you have trouble on these sort of games<br />.. it also gives you a step by step if you need it.
0525953728|2.0|Sorry, everyone, I just don't think this was a great book about the bin Laden raid. It's an ok book about what it's like to be a SEAL (I assume, actually, that it is, as I'm not a SEAL but it lines up with a lot of what I've heard from my brother and cousin, who are in special operations) but the truth is that there's just not a lot to write about.<br /><br />If you've seen Zero Dark Thirty you had a better view of the bin Laden story. I think that the book is pretty clear that the military raid was the culmination of 10+ years of intelligence work and that is pretty evident in the way most of the book is about things other than the bin Laden operation.<br /><br />It's certainly a good read and if you read it in conjunction with Zero Dark Thirty you probably get as good a view of the hunt and kill as you're ever going to get.
0470424656|5.0|This book is the standard title for everyone dealing with valuation. The only thing which is missing is a more detailed explanation of valuing private firms.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|It arrived earlier than expected and I had no problems with the discs.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this film since I had never seen it when it was on HBO.  The best Iraq war film I've seen yet and does a great job telling a story of what it must have been like on the front lines.<br /><br />The dialog was entertaining and sometimes funny, the characters were realistic, the scenes made it look like we were embedded with them, and there was enough action to keep me interested.  This is one that shouldn't be missed.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|Watching this on a 60&#34; Sharp LED TV the picture is better than I thought it would be.  I can see the individual strands of Annie's fuzzy hair!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|not a bad game..does not require rapt attention if put on adventure mode. I like to have something to play while watching tv

B00BWJARHO|5.0|This was an excellent movie and though not totally true to the book it was much more so than the Lord of the Rings movies (which sucked). I will watch the next installment. The music, especially the Misty Mountain Chant by the dwarves is awesome.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Being a long time Burroughs fan since reading and rereading his books since 6th grade and on, I anxiously waited for this version of John Carter of Mars. Not disappointed at all. The screen play, cinematography & acting were all tip top.<br />Surely looking forward to the sequel!
B0073COMUW|4.0|WOW! That's a good word to describe the color for daylight white, and that's exactly what you get, the daylight. It was if someone cut a hole into our ceiling as soon as my husband put these two bulbs into our kitchen ceiling fan. While I really could use more light than this, it is by far so much better than the lights of old for many reasons: 1) These don't produce heat. 2) Natural looking light. 3) And I have yet to test these out for 30 days and see our electric bill, but from what I've read, they use 85% less electricity to run. 4) Last forever, again, another claim I'll have to wait to prove and I hope I'll be waiting for a very long time! According to what I read, up to 15 years! Raise your hand if you've noticed that those who have fought to keep the old bulbs alive have seen their lifespan last for a quarter of what it used to be. Yeah, me too. And since I'm not fond of curly fry bulbs full of mercury that encourage early blindness they give off such a little amount of light, I vote for this far more expensive but so far, better deal of a bulb. That's why I have given it 4 stars and not 5. I have yet to find out how long it will last and what my electric bill will look like. I can always come back and edit my review. For now, I'm happy and am looking to see if there are 3-way bulbs like this too.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|It is as perfect as you can get. Would love to buy more items as you get them in. Will be a customer as long as you keep up the good work!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A good, compelling read.  I couldn't put the book down and couldn't wait to see the movie.  The movie was disappointing to me as the characters were changed so much.  I recommend this book to anyone I know.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple math calculations done with this easy to use app. I would recommend this for<br /> any student or business person.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Pretty fun game. Played Gamelofts Oregon Trail game and Kingdoms and Lords is way more entertaining with the troop creation and battles.

0385751532|4.0|I would give The Boy in the Striped Pajamas a 4 star rating because Bruno was a very likeable character.  The balance between characters with warm personalities and ones with disagreeable ideas accumulates in a book where you are getting multiple viewpoints as a reader.  The friendship between Shmuel and Bruno represents childhood and their obliviousness.  The bond they make just makes you want to smile and hope for a happy ending for them.  Shmuel and Bruno are exact opposites and only share an address and age, but they prove that people are people amidst World War 2 and Hitler's reign.<br /> There are no weak parts in this novel.  All of the aspects of the book lead to an unexpected but flawless ending.  The length is short, but if it was any longer, it would just be dragged out.  Bruno's naïve qualities makes the readers yearn to help Bruno and Shmuel with all of their difficulties.<br /> This book is perfect for readers interested in the Holocaust and wanting to hear about a child's perspective on the events in history.  This book is so great because it gives you the perspective of a high up soldier's son and of a boy in a concentration camp.  The target audience is teenagers because the reading is quick and not that challenging, but the content and full effect of the emotions is hard to grasp for someone younger than that.  The content makes the book a good read for an adult to.  In all, if you are looking for an enjoyable read that will leave you wanting more, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is for you.
059306612X|5.0|With so much media fostering ignorance and superstition in an already gullible world, it´s good to read something enlightening and well writen. The world needs more scientist like Richard Dawkins.

B000005KQT|5.0|i love this cd i looked at it for a long time and listened to the samples but never bought and now i am sorry i waited so long .there is not a bad song on the whole album i think i am going to wear it out i listen to it so much,if you like the blues give it a try you won't be sorry.
B00CDCE9L4|3.0|This is a great show. I enjoy the convenience in just coming home and pulling up the newest one on amazon when I get out of work (second shift). Lately it seems the shows have been going up later and later, and now we have the newest one that finally shows up and is unavailable? I mean I seriously enjoy the convenience of amazon on my ps3 but these kind of issues are starting to drive people away.. Oh we'll I guess, at least it's on the playstation network store.
B00973902K|4.0|This song is genuinely addicting.<br />It's really not a terrific song but the beat is incredibly catchy and you can't help but smile and laugh when you hear it
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|This was not at all the movie I was expecting when I saw the awesome previews. I went with my 8 year old to see this in the movies because she thought it would be great, but even she was yawning throughout.
1401324649|4.0|I started reading this book without any information or review and was pleased that I did. The idea of a 100 Year old Man as the star would normally turn me off but the author's style is such that I found the Old hero plausible. I wondered all the way through how will the author keep this unbelievable plot moving but he did. I kept on reading and reading and this is a tribute to the author's style. I particularly loved and enjoyed the humorous style and found myself spontaneously laughing many times through the book.<br />I recommend the One Hundred Year Old Man as thoroughly enjoyable reading and, depending on your sense of humor, very funny. Laugh a while-read it. Good therapy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this book. I hope the next series Susanna writes is as good as the Underlander and Hunger Games series. She has a wonderful talent.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, loved it! Would highly recommend it to anyone. How can you go wrong with Maggie Smith and Judie Dench.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Another one that should be required reading in our schools. I would  highly recommend this to anyone truly interested in actually living versus simply being entertained for the rest of your life.
B007SGM084|5.0|Quite entertaining.  Could not put it down before finishing all three books.<br />Recommend this series to all.<br />I would like to read more from Mrs James.
B000002J1M|3.0|The cd works great, was shipped very fast yada yada, but the cd booklet is a piece of crap. Looks like it got wet then dried and now all pages are stuck and will not come apart unless it rips. This might have been stated in the description but maybe not.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It is good future fiction. It was hard to guess where the plot was going and when something happened it was unexpected. A kinda dark story, the good guys weren't all that much better than the bad guys. I'd recommend it to anybody who likes to read enough to think that good books are just as entertaining as & generally more thought provoking a good movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|---------------------------------------------------<br />Pros: (in order of importance)<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />- Mouse works great.<br />- Mouse wheel is angled a bit, which took a bit of getting used to, but has a satisfyingly soft feel.<br />- Software works good.<br />- Programmed my D3 keys into it w/o issue.<br />- Braided cable is stellar.<br />- Nice feet - makes for ease of gliding mouse around.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Cons:(in order of importance)<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />- You can't turn off all the lights, just the logo light. (lights make me tempted to open it and disconnect)<br />- Rubber thumb area gets gross fast, and I wash my hands all day.  While I like the rubber feel, I wish it was not grooved - just for ease of cleaning.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Summary.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Best mouse for the price. Full Disclosure: I usually only buy Logitech mice. I own about seven or eight LX7 mice(my daily driver) simply because I wanted to make sure I can use it for years to come even after they discontinued it.  I also have an M305, that I use daily. I was using a G400 mouse as my gaming mouse, and this Anker mouse blows it out of the water. Honestly if I could turn off the lights this might become my daily driver, and I dislike cords.  If they made this exact mouse except wireless I would buy it straight away.
B005LAIIA8|2.0|The black and white format I liked,and the story of a little boy that brings his dog back to life was cute.After that it went downhill for me,the 3D was average AT BEST,and after awhile I had trouble staying awake.I purchased it for the 3D and I was disappointed,no pop outs and sometimes you couldn't even tell it was 3D.
0345803485|1.0|terrible writing,sophomoric and predictable I read one chapter and tossed it.i wouldn't inflict it on anyone by giving it to them
0385523912|5.0|Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />This is the first nonfiction book I have read that I was unable to put down.<br /><br />The book weaves together the stories of six individuals with an overview of the culture and history of North Korea. Absolutely fascinating and so well-written.<br /><br />I could not recommend this book any higher.
B00B6ELPIU|2.0|Honestly, who isn't a longtime fan of The Knife? Anyone sitting down with their catalogue can instantly tell what a wonderful and unique sound it represents, despite a few random one-night-stands at the mixing board. This record, while housing a few great singles, veers too far into the experimental for my tastes, and I like experimental! I'm a big fan of long-running, epic, and sometimes subtle tracks (GYBE!, Johann Johannsson, etc). But here, Karin and Olof literally (look it up) went to an empty warehouse, recorded for hours, and mixed their favorite moments down to a 19:00 nothing-fest. I can appreciate minimalist art as much as the next guy (as a fan of the supermatist movement), but I won't be fooled here. 7/13 tracks are close enough to classic Knife, but those extra 6 are filler if I've ever heard it. The &#34;digital booklet&#34; the album comes packaged with also attempts to make a fair point in an original comic, but its execution just made me groan.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|The story sells itself. I have always been a big fan of the books by Tolkien and this director seems to have brought the very spirit of the books right out onto the screen. Especially with the Brown wizard and those huge hares. Must see if into Fantasy.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I found the cable is still to short.  Same length as the cable that came with my Kindle Fire.  Why don't they have longer cords on these products that need to be recharged
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is a great game...but lately it has been automatically exiting out of the game. So far this has only happened in creative mode but it is still very frustrating. over all I would say that this is the best game that I have ever played (although I wish there was like war or something against other players) great game and lots of fun!
B00AFOS6P2|4.0|I'm a big fan of Nick Cave & TBS and their other outfit Grinderman, and was initially put off by this record. Slower albums, like The Boatman's Call and No More Shall We Part have always been favorites of mine, but this never felt in the same vein. The music is sparser than the heavily orchestrated tracks on even the softer records, but the fewer instruments here manage to lend a heavier sound. Lyrically Cave is relaxed, and sometimes a little silly, with seemingly nothing left to prove. That said, what initially I was aggravated by grew on me and I'm liking this record more with each listen.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|Bruce Willis = Action Jackson, this movie being no exception. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fantastic job in this film by selling his character to you like a 30 year veteran car salesman. Bruce Willis gets gritty on a mission to right a wrong. Good show would highly recommend if into sci-fi.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Amateur writing but a well developed plot and theme every person should be encouraged to ponder. Not recommended for children under thirteen.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is so good I can't believe how much I love this book. It like all the Percy jackson but this is my favorite
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This app lets me choose either the full site or a nice lean mobile version for my smaller device. It shows just the timeline without all the side garbage in mobile mode. I wish I could do that on my PC too. It runs good on the Samsung player but it stays on and really eats the battery up. I wish you could set it to only activate when you want.
B004PYDBVM|4.0|Makes you really see the worst of what men are capable of, good and bad. I recommend this book for those who want a peak at the real North Korea
B004GYY714|4.0|I like to listen to NOT but live in a wasteland populated by those who think, so I can't tune in locally. With this application I can get all of the eastern liberal Jewish junk I need (?) to hear.
B001GMH8RO|5.0|This is one of my all time fav....I had watched it once when I was a small kid...and immediately had a crush on Demi Moore.....Patrick Swayze is good too...especially in the scenes where he struggles to come to terms with the fact he is a ghost....his trysts with other ghosts on the train and stations are great....but for my the scene stealer in the movie is Whoopi Goldberg....she is just hilarious whether she is acting like a person who speaks to ghosts or goes to a bank ....the soundtrack...unchained melody is an all time fav....<br /><br />all in all....watch this movie with your wife / gf ....at night....:)
B00280LYIM|5.0|Loved it!!!! I am soooo addicted to these books its crazy. I would recommend this book to young readers and old readers because it is just that darn good.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|An engrossing story. The child knew nothing of the world, just the \\"Room\\". Very disturbing at times but triumphant near the end. I can't imagine the life they led in Room. Brilliantly written of new experiences after they leave Room.<br />I Recommend this book as a quick read and a story that puts things in perspective of how life is for everyone.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|If you don't like flying or drug addiction I recommend not watching. Although it is about a plane crash, the story is really more about functional alcoholics and drug addicts. Can be disturbing at times.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|This is a fantastic movie....I think Ang Lee killed the Hulk...this is how Hulk was supposed to be made...he is big..he is bad...he is angry and it is not without the nice moments.....<br /><br />the special effects are amazing....and the sound effects just awesome even on my basic 3.1 system....look out for the scene in the college campus...fantastic....
B00992CF6W|4.0|well see I never bought the pocket edition but I own the game on my computer. I'm sure this one is great. its my fav game ever. I don't see why you should get the game on the computer then get it in your phone and barley be able to see it. I know people like it to be mobile and stuff but to me its just a pain to figure out the controls. there's no multi player either which sucks. ive played on a freinds before and I didn't like it that much either. overall I would get the computer version instead.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|This movie was horrible. Why the hell did it get such great reviews? This is an insult to Battle Royale. This was nothing more than an MTV teenie bopper love film with a few shards of tame violence thrown in, just like all the Twig Light crap. PG-13 was the first indicator that this was going to be a lame movie. The training session was way too long and dragged out. Jen Lawrence can't act worth a s***. The writing was aweful and the so called special f/x looked to be done by the same group that worked on Twig light. Just a horrendous complilation of over hyped s***. The demon creatures at the end were stolen from the movie, The Gate. They just made them bigger, added more frightening teeth and got them to bark like dogs. The Tracker Jacks scene was also retarded. It was truly remarkable how they all disappeared once Jenny fell from the tree. Then there was the end battle between blonde and blonder...really, Gary Ross thoght that was a sufficient ending to the movie? Well, he was correct. Movie sucked, so why shouldn't the ending? 2 hours and 23 minutes of laughable garbage. Wish I could give it zero stars.    No doubt, that those who enjoyed this movie, enjoyed the Twig Light series as well, and therefore have no idea what good movies are.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Spoiler alert!!!<br /><br />I really enjoy this show but the killing off of one of the central characters to the plot is quite annoying. And if he isn't really dead, then we were misled and I would lose some respect for the show.
B000NTPDSW|2.0|There is some problem with video when I played the first part. There is some grain in many scenes. Not sure if that is intended
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I have got to say that it may be very helpful to people that need help on word's that need help on to find the meaning of that word.<br />I also think that it also might be very helpful to children  might need help on words that they need help on during a sentience that has has a word that they don't haven't have a clue that  they have a butt and bark nesis

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I'm no audiophile, so I wasn't really concerned with perfect quality (within reason). My phone was never able to put out much volume through the audio jack. This gadget ups the volume. Works great in my car and outside with a portable player.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Although I think that this is one of the most interesting series that I have read the time lapse between the books is far too long. In a nutshell I cannot wait for the next release.

B008PWUTJC|5.0|Kindle slips in easily and remains well cushioned and safe even if it falls. The case has a nice sporty look and feel. Looks pretty much like it does on the website. Highly recommend.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Waited a long time to see this movie. Not really impressed. The DVD sound was dreadful more like mono than 5.1 surround. Although I am a fan of Amanda Seyfried and Hugh Jackman as singers and actors, the standout performance is Samantha Barks. For prospective buyers of this DVD do yourself a big favour and purchase the 25th<br />Anniversary blu ray. Far superior. Also give yourself a treat and purchase the 25th Anniversary blu ray of Phantom of the Opera. And as a really special treat. Go see the live performances !!!
B00005JPSM|4.0|Another predictable movie but nice to watch.Aaron Eckhart is a real cutie and there was definite chemistry between them both.

B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is an amazing story. It is something worth reading. I can't wait until I read the next book!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I gave this game a high rating because it's a fun game to play; not too difficult, but still challenging enough to keep your interest. This is a game that can be enjoyed by all age groups. It's a really fun way to pass the time when you're waiting in an office, at the airport, etc.
0123694965|5.0|This was the perfect book to read for a serious introduction into all the tasks that game design requires. An absolutely huge breadth of coverage. The depth of topic was kept relatively shallow, but that's not totally unexpected in this kind of reference. Great starting point for beginning game design enthusiasts.<br /><br />I bought this with the deck of lens reference cards and I can't say I used them much. They sit on the shelf collecting dust while the book makes its rounds through my circle of gamedev friends.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|kept me interested right from the beginning, not for children, quite a bit of violence and nudity, but aside from that the back stories of each character is great

B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is $19.99 and above just for the DVD.  The extra egg toys are cute and an added bonus.  The movie itself is good...special effects are excellent.  The storyline re-affirms the power of faith and believing.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My child loves this movie, especially Justin Bieber's &#34;Santa Claus is coming to town&#34; song at end. Two thumbs up!!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Nice dark-hallway light.<br /><br />This light is very bright and has a perfect sensitivity for when the ambient light dims.  This in turn activates the motion sensing and thus in turn will activate light when needed.  No more fear upon entering a dark indoor area.<br /><br />I placed this one in my hallway and it works great.  I don't have to worry if the ambient light is questionable and if the device will light.  It is very consistent.  So now, when my daughter comes home at night after school or work she does not need to feel around for the light switch on the wall.  She just walks in from the garage door and the motion-detecting sensor kicks the light on and leaves it on long enough for her to find the appropriate light switch in the house, or just enough time to walk on by.<br />It needed 4 x AA batteries out of the box, and I hung it on the wall by my hallway garage from one of its mounting holes on the back. Set it to the \\"auto\\" switch to activate the sensor.  No problem, easy.<br /><br />Once activated, there is a flooding of bright light and not a \\"spot\\" action type light.  So far with this light activating about 15-20 times per night, staying on for 10 seconds per action and our use of over the last two weeks there has not been any noticeable change in the brightness and therefore I have not had to change the batteries.  What a pleasant surprise over my last battery operated night light.<br />This item was generously provided to me for an honest review by the manufacturer and I would honestly recommend it to anyone.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Great movie and to combine all characters working together, like the Avengers, for the common good is spectacular. My child loves it!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I tried to focus on the intent of the movie but I really wish to have that hour and a half out of my life given back to me.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Simply amazing. I couldn't put the book down. I don't know if book 4 can top this but I shall see.
0439023521|1.0|This book was a total letdown and an unfortunate example of how hype can adversely affect independent thought.  There's just no way this book would have made the impact it did otherwise.<br /><br />I had reasonable expectations for The Hunger Games.  I wasn't excited to read it, but I'd heard enough good things that I at least expected to enjoy it.  Boy was I wrong. It was a total waste of time.<br /><br />First, the entire book is written in first person, passive present tense.  Example: \\"I'm sitting on a riverbank, tying my boot.\\"  Are we supposed to be in her head and she's narrating her life to us at that very moment?  It's awkward and limiting, and a big no-no when writing pretty much anything.  It was like reading a really bad screenplay. Collins' prose was also extremely dry.  There was no beautiful description to draw readers into the story like any good book should have.  It fell extraordinarily below the expectations of alternate reality fantasy.  She could have done so much more with the world she created.  In fact, the film went beyond what was in the book.  Example: Despite the Capitol possessing technology like hovercrafts, the Capitol train was a regular train on tracks.  In the film, they stepped it up and turn it into a hover train.  What, Collins couldn't think that up herself?<br /><br />Second, the characters were dull, one-dimensional and unsympathetic.  I didn't care what happened to them.  By the end of the book, I didn't care whether or not Katniss lived or died.  Don't mistake me--I don't believe that a protagonist has to be likable, but she at least needs to be one I can root for.  She was strictly utilitarian; just a plot device as opposed to a real person.  The characters in the film were inherently more sympathetic.  That should never happen. A movie script has an average of 120 pages with a lot of white space.  There's only so much time to work with.  But a novel allows an author considerably more freedom with backstories, description,exposition and character development.  The film should be a shadow of the book, not the other way around.<br /><br />Third, I expected some deeper meaning to the book as was expressed by friends and the author.  It wasn't there.  Either people were doing everything they could to associate the book with issues like war, totalitarianism and global warming (yep, that was a claim made by Collins herself) when it wasn't actually there, or Collins intended for those issues to be there but simply lacked the talent to mete our her desires and hoped to remedy that by claiming such associations during her book tours.  Really--I looked for those metaphors; I'm well-educated in governmental and political issues, but they just simply weren't there.  The only potential metaphor was life under a dictatorship. But any of the subtlety, the prose and exposition reflected few, if any, deeper political meanings.<br /><br />I can only conclude that the reason this book became so popular was because it was crowned the anti-Twilight; a story with a teenage, female protagonist that wasn't a love story.  It must have been quite liberating for the teen girl audience that had become accustomed to the shallow, obsessive love story that is the Twilight series. But just because you find an unbroken dish in a pile of shattered remnants, doesn't mean it belongs anywhere other than a second-hand store.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing this app and so does my great nephew we like all the different games available in this app
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This is a fairly priced, no frills cover for the Kindle Fire. My husband wanted something simple and understated to protect his kindle that he could carry in his briefcase or in his hand without calling attention to it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great app game, great graphics, nice upgrades. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they should have slower levels for beginners. I like to play but it would be nice to go slower until you get the hang of it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is addictive straight from the word go! I found when I said 'this is my last go' I still couldn't stop. In the game it is much easier to collect coins to pay for more great upgrades although to get a new person it goes up to 150000 coins although I can definitely see past that! I am sure you will love it when u play:)
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Ive watched it three times since recieving it. Prequel to Alien. Ridley Scott you did it again GREAT job.<br />Michael Fassbender you are one scary dude.
0812992784|1.0|I read this with great disappointment.  The name dropping, (he's in with the in crowd,) the pettiness of the spats and the banal pride in buying his Thai food from the same place as \\"Birry Joel\\" in the posh Hapmptons is repulsive.  As much as I admire, to a worshipful extent, Rushdie's fiction I detested this book.  The few passages where the horror of the fatwa is beautifully articulated pale in comparison to the trite meanderings of an author attempting to fill some pages.
B008R5OKI8|5.0|Each of the Vivaldi Edition's (the Vivaldi Edition is a project to record all pieces found in the composer's personal archive in Turin) discs of Violin concertos have a theme. The theme of this disc is 'For Pisendel'. Pisendel was one of the great virtuosos of the first half of the 18th century. He studied with Vivaldi in 1716 and perhaps a year or so later. These lessons were informal, as Vivaldi seemed to view the German as a colleague. But Vivaldi did show Pisendel some things on the violin and gave him lessons in composition. Part of their friendship and personal relationship was that Pisendel had many Vivaldi scores dedicated for his use (per Pisendel) or he was allowed to copy works that interested him and bring them back to Germany. This recording has both dedicated works and the ones which were copied by Pisendel.<br /><br />The part of Pisendel on this disc is played by violinist Dmitry Sinkovsky. He has a fresh sound and a strong, even wild virtuosity. In an attempt to live up the the reputation of a famous virtuoso of the past so respected by Vivaldi, Sinkovsky adds small cadenzas of his own to many of the works. The orchestra, Il Pomo D'Oro sounds good here and blends somewhat better than on the L'Imperatore disc, although it could still compete for attention with the soloist more, tonally and stylistically. Over all, it is a great disc bringing together difficult, high-quality works and presenting an excellent Baroque violinist I've not heard before. Works Included are:<br /><br />Concerto in C RV 177. This work dates from after 1730, and is in Vivaldi's strange late style. This shows that Pisendel had an active interest in Vivaldi's music even at this late date, and that somehow they were in contact enough for him to receive scores. This performance is a less polished but fun addition to Carmignola's version, although here the 3rd movement tempo is taken too slowly.<br /><br />Concerto in D RV 212a. Vivaldi composed this work for himself to preform atthe 1712 feast of St. Anthony, and it includes several written cadenzas. Pisendel's interest in the pure virtuosity of the work is understandable, and it is possible that Vivaldi 'updated' the work for him. The 'a' version has a more modern and lyrical sonata-style slow movement, while the old version has a more recitative style slow movement (as does RV 208 from the same period). You could call RV 212 the Vivaldi version (see Adrian Chandler) and 212a the Pisendel version.<br /><br />Concerto in d minor RV 246. Pisendel seems to have shared Vivaldi's dramatic flair on the violin and had a fondness for minor keys.  This work has a dark, rugged feel and uses double stopping freely.<br /><br />Concerto in B flat RV 370. The liner notes state that the dating of this work is problematic, but estimates that it's from the first half of the 1720's. Adrian Chandler (who already recorded this piece) seems to think it dates from around 1716 (or before), when Pisendel was visiting Venice. I'm inclined the go along with this based on several factors. Either way, it is a showy, well written piece with a place to pause for a cadenza.<br /><br />Concerto in d minor RV 242. Even though this work dates from around 1716, it made Vivaldi's cut for Opus 8 (1725). Perhaps he was fond of it, or maybe that inclusion was a nod to Pisendel. The last movement is a study in double stopping, a technique which appealed greatly to Pisendel.<br /><br />Concerto in B flat RV 379. Based on the language, this work, published in Opus 12, is later than most associated with Pisendel. The feel of the work is classically Vivaldian, with aggressively joyful mood and rhythmic vitality. The opening solo starts with a  great hook.<br /><br />Concerto in g minor RV 328. There is a fiery side to the melancholy when Vivaldi writes in g minor. This piece is a perfect example, being dark and depressed, but containing moments of anger. It certainly is something that would appeal to Pisendel, who enjoyed introspection as a refuge from display.

0143038419|5.0|Reading \\"eat, pray, love\\", whilst one of the best sellers and most popular books, happened to stir in me many delights and yearnings. I loved it through and through.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert paints a world of joy, bittersweet sorrow, and entertainment in her self-discovery. I find her writings overwhelmingly beautiful. It is not often that I can identify so much with the personality of an author and the yearnings of her search. I hardly have much in common with her situation: She is divorced, lives in NYC, and travels alone to 3 countries in one year of her life. I love her guts. I love that, as a woman, she can so boldly state that she did not wish to have children and that she was unhappy with a great man in her marriage and her fancy apartment in New York. I absolutely admire that she can claim, without any apology, that she cannot find happiness in her seemingly perfect life - oddly enough- a life which until then was her own picture of idealism.<br /><br />At the age of 34, Elizabeth Gilbert, in all her devotion to pursuit of a dream, decides to give up everything she has built in pursuit of the longing of her heart and a journey of self-discovery. She defies cultural notions that we should be happy if we are married to a good person and that the maternal instinct should kick in right around 30 for a healthy, normal woman. Finally, when her bouts of depression become intolerable, she makes the commitment to that self-discovery and sets off for her one year journey to three countries whose names start with an I - suiting her mission to self-actualization even more perfectly if you care to put significance into small coincidences - Italy, India, and Indonesia.<br /><br />Elizabeth's prose is unique and poetic; I was engrossed in her world. Her passages read like a symphony, music to my ears. At the time, I had constantly dreamt of visiting Italy and for lack of no good reason, it had still not happened. Elizabeth Gilbert gave me Italy better than any guidebook or travel journal. She writes with subtlety about her experiences and is herself surprised by the enormous joy she is reaping from it all - watching Italian boys play football in the streets,  choosing her gelato flavors carefully, thoroughly enjoying every bite of her food, taking Italian lessons, and engrossing in life as it unfolds in the form of daily routine for the average Italian.<br /><br />I admire the most about Elizabeth Gilbert her thirst for adventure; it leaves me green with envy. How she travels to a country so far and away to find a 100-plus year old medicine man she met years ago is an example of Elizabeth's care-free, risk-loving, it-will-all-work-out attitude, that to me contrasts with her constant worrisome traits. Off she goes to Bali, and through a luck-struck bizarre and ingenious way, she most certainly finds her medicine man and spends the last four months of her adventure in beautiful Bali.<br /><br />She is an ordinary novice at travel, without so much as preparing an itinerary or making a plan before getting on the road. She experiences horrible incidents of indigestion from the thought of travel alone and has hardly any tolerance for non-ordinary foods and unfamiliar climates. She is as equally unprepared to travel alone on such a self-discovery mission as a child. Yet she gets through it all by exploiting her one key strength: her ease in making friends with anyone, anyone at all.<br /><br />Our `novice' traveler sets on her journey to the countries of Italy, India and Indonesia, in that order. The order in which she visits her countries carries a significance that she shares like so: Italy is for indulging in life, food, sights, sounds, India is for indulging in health, purity, yoga, meditation, and reflection, and Indonesia is to return to the medicine man she met years earlier, without so much as having a name, address, or a plan to aid her search.  The uncertainty and lack of preparation thrills and worries her at the same time -it tests her tolerance for the unknown, and in a bizarre way, seems to cause her to mature and grow to not worry about small details. What is the worst possible scenario? Well, she may just not find her medicine man. Are we conditioned to worry and plan too much during times when the journey needs to take its own course? There is so much at stake if we do not plan - a waste of time, money, resources, a lost opportunity, a frustrating journey - and while all of that is plausible, the unknown still has a thrill and risk has a taste that fills us with envy and curiosity.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert tells us poignantly about her struggles in the Ashram in India; these were among my most favorite passages of the book. The experience of Ashram by itself would provide difficult enough for anyone taking on a journey of self-discovery, but particularly for her so recently parting with her indolent, carefree days in Italy. The atmosphere and environment of Italy and India and the nature of her journey in each could not be more in contrast. While in the Ashram, she struggles to adjust. Sitting in meditation for hours. Waking up at the wee hours of the morning to sit in this silence for what seems like eternity. Doing yoga for a while before returning to silence and to more meditation. The discipline, the sacrifices of instant pleasures for the sake of a higher pursuit. These make up some of the core messages of \\"Eat Pray Love\\" by the brave and open spirited Elizabeth Gilbert.it tests her tolerance for the unknown, and in a bizarre way, seems to cause her to mature and grow to not worry about small details. What is the worst possible scenario? Well, she may just not find her medicine man. Are we conditioned to worry and plan too much during times when the journey needs to take its own course? There is so much at stake if we do not plan - a waste of time, money, resources, a lost opportunity, a frustrating journey - and while all of that is plausible, the unknown still has a thrill and risk has a taste that fills us with envy and curiosity.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert tells us poignantly about her struggles in the Ashram in India; these were among my most favorite passages of the book. The experience of Ashram by itself would provide difficult enough for anyone taking on a journey of self-discovery, but particularly for her so recently parting with her indolent, carefree days in Italy. The atmosphere and environment of Italy and India and the nature of her journey in each could not be more in contrast. While in the Ashram, she struggles to adjust. Sitting in meditation for hours. Waking up at the wee hours of the morning to sit in this silence for what seems like eternity. Doing yoga for a while before returning to silence and to more meditation. The discipline, the sacrifices of instant pleasures for the sake of a higher pursuit. These make up some of the core messages of \\"Eat Pray Love\\" by the brave and open spirited Elizabeth Gilbert.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|Just watched this film a few minutes ago and are now writing this review while its fresh in the brain. Its never special the second time you watch it so get everything you need to done, meaning get your snacks, use the bathroom, and do not leave the TV for any reason unless your house is burning down, this movie is THAT good. This isnt your typical slasher flick, this is what should be called a horror porn flim as it has lots of sex. Not alot of blood though, you'll be disappointed if your looking for blood, although, its still scary regardless of it, because it has alot of violent rape scenes that will test your willingness to stay to the very end. This is NOT cut, as the name implies it really is uncut because before even ordering it on amazon (and do not do this) I spoiled it for myself by looking up the entire plot on wikipedia only because I wanted to know what was so controversial about it, and just by reading about it, you question whether you should watch it or not. I say give it a go if your very much into horror, and not for someone who enjoys horror here and there. However be prepared to do alot of reading, as the film does have subtitles in english, and certain parts of the film I had to rewind to read it again because the subtitles go pretty fast. Overall, very very good movie .The packaging itself implies that this movie is really something as it is a jewel case glued to a piece of cardboard with fake blood on it and on the DVD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all the books could not put them down. It's a must read I've read it now two times and love it.

1401938906|5.0|E-Squared by Pam Grout proclaims to have \\"nine do-it-yourself energy experiments that prove your thoughts create your reality\\" and she delivers! Her use of imagery in examples was excellent. I have to admit the convenience of the appropriately named, space heater example. She tells of spending a cold night in a strange place, huddled under blankets only to awaken in the morning to find a space heater right next to the bed. All she needed to do was flip the switch... but she didn't know it was there. This was to emphasize her point, that her lack of awareness and consequential lack in that situation is much like those of us who struggle with need and desire, unaware of the energy field surrounding us, ready to respond if we will simply flip the switch.<br /><br />While I didn't need more proof than I already had of the validity of her claim, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised by the extremely easy experiments and the quick responses. My favorite was the first, the \\"Dude Abides Principle\\".  The hypothesis was written to provide evidence of the energy force available to us. The author asks us to simply ask for a blessing with 48 hours as evidence of its reality.<br /><br />The next 48 hours brought several blessings to me, all could have been discarded as coincidences (if you believe in those) but the one that provided a slice of humorous, concrete evidence was the shim.<br /><br />Soon after starting the experiment a thought crossed my mind, \\"I need a shim\\". For those of you who aren't familiar with the term, it's commonly used in carpentry. According to the Free Dictionary, a shim is \\"a thin, often tapered piece of material, such as wood, stone, or metal, used to fill gaps, make something level, or adjust something to fit properly.\\" Since I'm not a carpenter it's not something that I make reference to very often, although I have a few scattered around my house.<br /><br />That afternoon I left to visit a friend in a neighboring city and planned to spend the weekend. She had a few visitors in the next day for a brunch and as we were sitting discussing a myriad of topics, she turned to me and asked, \\"Do you need a shim?\\" At that she opened her hand revealing two teeny plastic shims with a hole in the fat end. They were more of a novelty item since they could be hung on a key chain. I very nearly fell out of my chair. I had not participated in more than the one single thought of needing a shim. I never wrote it on a shopping list nor mentioned it to a living soul. It was a single, isolated thought and the resultant provision was immediate and clear. Needless to say, the shim hangs on my key chain as a constant reminder of the power of a single thought.<br /><br />Pam's book is filled with experiments like this which all produced positive results for me. Her writing was clear and entertaining. She referenced leaders in the field who profess to believe in the power of our thoughts and how they create our reality, all favorites in my book. From The Course in Miracles to Dr. Masaru Emoto's Water Crystals in What the Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole, she brought them all together.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book if you are a believer in the power of our thoughts on the energy field surrounding us as a physical confirmation and reminder. To those who doubt its existence, I beg of you to read this book and perform these experiments as evidence of the unseen.e weekend.

0345803485|5.0|This may not be something that some people can handle reading due to the errotic sexual content, but I found it to be stimulating and sensuous. It is very well written and I would recommend making sure you read all three books in the series, do not just stop after the first one because that would be a disappointment!
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Revealing look at growing up in Japan with virtually no parential guidance.  Explanation of what ended Shirley's long marriage is hard to imagine.  That Shirley was so gulliable!  Ended up liking and respecting Shirley's daughter Sachi very much.
B00BKBCF38|4.0|I had the good fortune of getting an early pressing of Ghost's sophomore release, so I've been digesting this album for the better part of a week now. Good thing, because as with Opus Eponymous, I'm finding that this is more of a grower than a shower. While a couple tracks struck me right out of the gate, the majority took time to make an impact. (And to be honest, I'll need a few more weeks before I have a fully-formed impression of the album as a whole.)<br /><br />In keeping with the medieval theme of Opus, the title track begins in reverb-soaked Latin plainchant. The band enters full force soon thereafter with an infernal fanfare celebrating the anti-Christ child's arrival. The album continues through the first few tracks at the same insistent pace, guitar riffs and snare drum front-and-center with the ubiquitous pipe organ creating an effectively sinister backdrop.<br /><br />Just fifteen minutes deep and \\"Ghuleh\\" takes the album for an unexpected turn. I'm not sure how I feel about the jarring change, not having delved too deeply into the lyrical content, but I can only assume it's meant to follow the path of the story. The tune itself came off as hokey to my ears at first, but I've grown to admire its vulnerability; there's something compelling in Papa's voice, something that quietly breathes life into the story. The driving tempo returns with \\"Zombie Queen,\\" which juxtaposes funereal organ against some unlikely Ventures-esque surf guitar passages.<br /><br />Chanting clerics are back for \\"Year Zero\\" (my personal favorite of the lot) to kick off the album's second half, a tune of nicely layered textures replete with bell-tower chimes and featuring a melodically crafted guitar solo. The best part of all may be the lo-fi fadeout, evoking images straight out of 1922's Nosferatu. From here, Ghost satisfies its more pop-centric listeners with \\"Body and Blood\\" and \\"Idolatrine.\\" These are my least-favorite offerings; your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Infestissumam turns back to the heavier side on \\"Depth of Satan's Eyes\\" and closes well enough with \\"Monstrance Clock,\\" which caps with a satisfying coda built upon layers of guitar, synth and chant.<br /><br />All in all, this release proves to me that Ghost isn't just a flash in the pan. Although I gave it four stars, I can see the rating nudging a bit higher for me in the coming months. Given enough spins, I feel confident most doom rockers will get pulled in just as I did. I look forward to reading others' reviews over the coming weeks.urns back to the heavier side on \\"Depth of Satan's Eyes\\" and closes well enough with \\"Monstrance Clock,\\" which caps with a satisfying coda built upon layers of guitar, synth and chant.<br /><br />All in all, this release proves to me that Ghost isn't just a flash in the pan.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|Henry VIII was such a dramatic character, so they already had a great storyline to work with! Showtime did an amazing job taking it to the next level. Even though I knew the basic story from this era of history, I didn't know many details. This show fascinated me and spurred me to do some reading and research. I was amazed how true they stayed to the main facts of history. There were some embellishments and some straying from the way the people looked in real life (for example, Catherine of Arragon had red hair according to history, but had black hair in The Tudors), but it's to be expected. I couldn't stop watching it. Compelling. Captivating. Amazingly well-made and incredible acting. It gave me a lot of compassion for folks who lived rough lives back then. A must-see!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Couldn't put this book down. Like the other books of the Hunger Games there was just enough romance, just enough tragedy, just enough action, just enough drama. Great book.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|What a movie.  It literally starts like a house on fire............Sonja's to be exact.  Poor Sonja, family killed down to the last brother, raped, and left for dead.  Thank goodness, a blurry white spirit shows up to offer poor Sonja some much-needed advice, spurring her on to VENGEANCE!  Cue Arnold ridding and ridding and ridding.  Naturally, one cannot have this type of film without a temple of some sort, manned (so to speak) by priestesses in lovely white robes.  Avert your eyes as carnage soon ensues thanks to a lack of manners by crazy Queen Gedren of Berkubane (for a brief moment I thought it was Queen Gherkin of Blefuscu but I think I got my wires crossed).  Thank goodness, one of the lovely priestesses escapes and falls into Lord Kalidor's beefy arms; else, there wouldn't be much of a story.  Well, in truth, there really isn't much of a story but they all go along with it anyway, none the wiser.  All this fuss for a downed disco ball a lovely shade of pulsating green.  They all call this thing a talisman.  Silly me, I was under the impression that a talisman was something one wore about their neck.  Try that with this thing and there wouldn't be much of a neck left.  Although I waited for the longest time for someone to try it.  Said bauble ended up in a room filled with candles to help bring about its brilliance and an end of the world.  Yes, this was a doomsday plot.  Sorry to say, it doesn't turn out that way in the end.  Where was I?  Pickle Puss (Brigitte Nielsen) spends the bulk of this movie spurning the advances of Arnold (Lord Kalidor), no small feat!  When she isn't giving a hand to this really snotty little brat in want of a good spanking (Ernie Reyes, Jr.), Sonja fights and fights and fights an odd assortment of men.  Never has so much swordplay been put to film with so few results (although a head does go flying).  Things really pick up once they get past the metallic sea monster and enter Castle Berkubane.  The Queen (Sandahl Bergman) isn't much of a decorator but she does have a snazzy TV and a really big pet spider.  Along the way we also learn the best use of a couple of horses, some rope, and one nasty little boy.<br /><br />I really mean it when I say they don't make them like this anymore (although some wisenheimer has the bright idea to do a Red Sonja remake.  Wasn't one trip down this crazy road bad enough!?).<br /><br />On the plus side, there is a bombastic score by Ennio Morricone.  So it's not a total waste.ch of a decorator but she does have a snazzy TV and a really big pet spider.

B0011UJMK2|3.0|Slow and confusing at first but really liked the middle and finale. Starting Agent 6 next. Hope this one is a bit clearer to understand.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|a little short but okay.  It was entertaining for what it was.  Items were relatively easy to find.  Hints&quot; were not much, but all in all it was good.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I'm pretty disappointed in this app. It stops working all the time and has to close. The chat and messaging frequently freezes up so it's not usable.  The whole application seems half ass. I wish someone would put  some effort into creating apps that work well for tablets and mobile devices other than iPad or iPhone.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was a excellent movie and full of action and suspense. I highly recommend the movie to other action movie fans.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is one of my favorite Bonds. This movie was exciting, sexy, unpredictable and action filled, (just like I like my Bond flicks). It was fun to watch. A great movie to just sit back and get away from it all with. Enjoy!
0439023521|5.0|I have no idea why I waited so long to read this; I think it sat around in my room for almost a year before I actually read it. Now, because I've read this book multiple times, I feel like I should at least tell you about my first impression. The first time I read this, I was pleased with and really liked it, but I felt like it didn't exactly live up to the all of the hype around me. I was just expecting more from it than I felt like I was given. In fact, my original rating was 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />But since reading the rest of the series and reading this again and again, I've chosen to give it 5 stars. My opinion has now changed. I do think it lived up to the hype. But first impressions are everything, so I feel like the information above was important to give all those who read this (plus most of this review was written with my first impression in mind).<br /><br />Now, on to the rest of the review....<br /><br />It took me a while to really get excited about this book. But at the same time, I found it hard to put down because I had to know how Katniss survived The Hunger Games. I was kept guessing about Peeta's true loyalties for a good portion of the book.<br /><br />I must admit though, from almost the very beginning, I wanted Peeta to survive, even with that question of loyalty still in the air. I found him as a instantly lovable character. And, okay, since this is all about first impressions... I thought Gale was pretty wonderful too.<br /><br />From the moment the Hunger Games (the event not the book) began, the plot gripped me like never before because, of course, Katniss is going to survive; she's the main character. But you have to know how. You have to know how things turn out with Peeta. You just have to know how a certain situation resolves itself. And before you know it, once one situation is resolved, you're drawn into another and you have to know how Katniss gets through that one. And thus, this is repeated over and over again, and very effectively.<br /><br />Upon finishing the book, I was completely freaking out. The end blew me away. It was a huge cliff hanger. I mean, it was worse than anything I had read at the time (The Son of Neptune's, The Lost Hero). I could not put the book down as I read the last fifty pages. And I just couldn't read it fast enough.<br /><br />I also found The Hunger Games to be full of characters that you either love or completely dislike. There were few in-betweens.<br /><br />I didn't particularly care for the writing style (it's one I once shied away from), but even I must admit that it was the best one for this type of book. There's nothing wrong with the writing. The Hunger Games is written in first person present, which at the time wasn't something I was accustomed to reading when I passed through it the first time. So, you will probably find in other reviews on books written the same way, I feel differently about it, but that's because it doesn't bother me anymore. Thank you, Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />You can find more of my reviews on my blog, Chasm of Books.<br />[...]as completely freaking out. The end blew me away. It was a huge cliff hanger.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best .Even know I am not that good I still love it.1000000% is how good it is
1423113462|5.0|Tears literally came to my eyes when I finished this book. I just loved it so much I wanted to cry. Riordan dives right into the story. There were a lot of questions of who everyone's parents were so Piper's godly parent surprised me but it I thought it was pretty cool. Jason's turned out to be what I expected but with a spin. And Leo's was pretty predictable but there is something very unique about him....<br /><br />Riordan perfectly meshes Greek and Roman mythology. It's ingenious the way he does it. It's so cool. He uses some of the places he labeled as dangerous in Percy Jackson and the Olympians and twisted them to fit this story line, which was spectacular. And some of the events that took place in the first series make a little more sense once you read The Lost Hero. The characters are wonderful!<br /><br />Throughout the whole book, you're asking questions beyond where's Percy. Riordan gives you just enough answers to appease you but then (a lot of the time) you have more questions you want answered after the new revelations. He perfectly balances the giving and withholding of information.<br /><br />The Heroes of Olympus is definitely, with out a shadow of doubt, going to be better than Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The Lost Hero showed great promise for the sequel, Son of Neptune. The writing is in third person but it has an air of the first person writing you get in the first series. It has three different POVs and each chapter about the targeted character is personalized specifically well. I just love everything about this book.<br /><br />You can find more of my reviews on my blog, Chasm of Books.<br />[...]
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|An amazing book for older kids with a big imagination and love fictional stories. The book was amazing a nd the series is the best I have read so far.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Went and saw it in theaters and I regret it. The Hobbit is a slim book so I was curious how they were going to make it into three movies, well bloated over dramatic fight scenes seem to be the way. Martin Freeman, usually a great actor, seemed stilted an oddly comic. Poor Ian McKellan looked and sounded like he was going to croak by the end of the film, Elijah Wood looked too old (and tall) to be believable in this film. What was even more surprising is how they changed how Bilbao finds the ring. We see it in the Lord of the Rings so you would think they would just recreate that scene...nope.<br />The only saving grace in this movie is Gollum who is even more life like due to advancing technology.<br />Peter Jackson is just out to fleece people for more money.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Way better than the Disney movie of the same name.  Having only seen the movie, I didn't know what to expect but I thoroughly enjoyed the telling of the story and how the relationships developed.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I wish it was easier to get friends..  I hate that ur expected to buy things with money inorder to advance. So i can only play for about 10min at a time.. so I can regain energy.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie recently and enjoyed it but knew their was more depth to the story. I wanted to understand more of the whys  - the details that can't be explained by acting.  The book definitely added more color and I'm glad I bought it.  It was a simple, fast read but I found myself looking forward to getting back to the book. I did buy the next book in the trilogy.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Good graphics, smooth frame rate, good multiplayer.<br />But has a long download time. Easy controls and okay story, Quick time reactions make it that much better. Campaign is good with realistic sounds and gameplay. Definitely a must have.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|This is a definite must for any Barbeau collector. She keeps up her high standards found in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death&quot; (1989).  This film also is designed to add to your John Carpenter collection.<br /><br />Fog night and slow pacing will drive you up the wall. The unseen is just as spooky as the seen. There is gold, revenge, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh. What, want more? What if we throw in John Houseman and Hal Holbrook? Still more? There is a lot more. But don't get greedy. Sit back and enjoy what you can see in The Fog.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000A7Q1UQ Swamp Thing ~ Louis Jourdan]]

She is sent to be a governess to seven unruly children. Little does she know what will become of her visit...<br /><br />This movie is amazing!!! The songs are impossible to forget!
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Volbeat have always been a band trapped in amber, one part old fifties rock and roll, a touch of Nashville and crushing metal.  Even with this diverse mix, something was slightly askew.  For all their power and songwriting skills, they needed a little color to complete the picture, although last year's \\"Beyond Hell\\" was a step in the right direction.  \\"Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies\\" has succeeded in filling the gap.<br />  With the addition of Rob Caggiano, late of Anthrax, Volbeat gained much needed lead guitar work and chordal work to flesh out their ideas.  Caggiano also produced the album, and while it certainly rocks, it is slightly more melodic, at least in places.<br />  However, they are primarily a metal band that plays real rock and roll music, something not easily done or tolerated these days.  With the band comes a guest appearance on \\"Room 24\\" from King Diamond, that cut being thrash heaven, complete with a scorching solo.  \\"Doc Holliday\\" is also a major league head banger, with vocalist Michael Poulsen as powerful and expressive as ever.  His voice is truly the time traveler element in Volbeat - taken back in time Poulsen could easily have been a great early rock and roll pioneer.  Even with metal riffing crashing around you, you can't help but want to cruise in a convertible with the top down and hang out at a drive-in on a hot summer evening with your girl or your buddies.  It will be a fine release for the summer months, and will endure the band to an even larger audience.  Volbeat are getting better, and will be a threat to anybody they share the stage with.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Decent job of portraying the book!  Of course the book is always better and more detailed, but I think the focus of the story was accurately portrayed.
B009LGO88E|5.0|I ordered this after picking up [[ASIN:B009B1D7JK Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate]] and it enhances the controls tenfold. It's also useful for other titles (Kid Icarus to name another). The CPP XL is extremely comfortable for my medium-sized hands, eliminating any cramping from long play sessions. The weight makes the unit feel cheap and light, but you'll notice the fine build quality with the actual buttons and how crisp they feel. It includes 1x AAA battery so you're all set (don't even worry about the instructions if you can't understand Japanese - the illustrations are really clear).<br /><br />My chief complaints with the design would be the inability to remove a cartridge or the stylus with the CPP unit attached. Maybe they couldn't get away with having a cartridge opening available (because of the IR transmitter and the clips that hold the 3DS XL onto the CPP), but incorporating a small hole for the stylus underneath the unit would've been nice. Other than those only two issues, this accessory is a MUST HAVE.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very addictive challenging levels I could not put it down til I completed all 81 levels. The puzzle stamps are a good twist to the match three gsme play.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|really like the oversized elements makes for easy reading and entries; convenient to have on my kindle; and of course, free is great
B000002LJW|2.0|I really don't understand the 4 and 5 star reviews. I almost gave it a 3-star, but ultimately thought that was a bit too generous. For all the chatter about what a great \\"comeback\\" album this is I have to say that I wholeheartedly disagree. In fact, I think Journeyman takes up where the unlistenable August leaves off.<br /><br />The only songs that are listenable IMO are \\"Running On Faith\\", \\"Accuse Me\\", and \\"Old Love\\", which are really some of my all-time Clapton favorites. However, I think he's done far better versions of these songs live than he recorded for this album. His vocals just seem a little lackluster here.<br /><br />As for the other tracks, I don't think the songs or his performances are very good. Plus, they all sort of sound alike with those annoying drum machines and synths. Overall, I'd say this album is another testament to the fact that when Clapton strays too far from the blues, usually things go awry quickly.
B0091REZMW|2.0|So so game. Not willing to buy my items makes the journey too long. I would not buy this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I wasnt sure about this book the first few pages.  However after that I was hooked. I loved all the twists in the story. I didn't know who to root for-Nick or Amy.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Very slick app. Interface is gorgeous and the mix feature is awesome. Definitely the best on Android and on par with Windows Phone offerings.
B009439HEY|3.0|I don't know who Steve got to sing the songs on this album but I was not impressed.  he should have stayed with the other singer from the other album
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Life of Pi was a good book. Greatness in literature causes one to view the world in a different light, however faint. Life of Pi did not cause me to change any view nor did it color my views in the light of discovery. It is good and worth reading, but not great.

The author has penned a masterpiece, and we can live In that mind. And we can come to want to love it and help it smile with life. Imperfectly equipped for a common life, yet divinely equipped to perhaps benefit us all. Ours is to allow, enable, and encourage.<br />I have never found the bluntness of profanity profitable, in fact, it is a present cultural weakness that will hurt current liyerature's classical value forever. It will keep millions of young readers from experiencing the valid power of this story because parents will of necessity not encourage them to read it.<br />Profanity is neither art nor valid expression.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Great movie. A awesome need for a collector. I am very happy with this product and quality of the movie.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|We have all had awkward situations, but this poor girl endures alot.  She's a brave sole and I love to see the way she bounces back from all that embarassment.  At the end of the day, you need not be afraid of who you are, who cares what everybody else thinks!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I like it some what. I was hoping for alittle more action and not so much drama, but still movie to see.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I wished after the third Harry potter movie they would of broken the movie into two parts because of how big the books were. It would of been more accurate and possibly better than they were. First two were almost word for word and three was pretty close but the forth was when it just became a little off since they left out so many scenes. And I don't think they even have extended versions of 3 and up. People are waiting for it but I think they only have it for Harry potter 1 and 2. Getting off topic I enjoyed this movie and it was pretty good. Recommend getting the series.
B00005QAPH|4.0|I have been an admirer of this movie and of Fellini for more than twenty years and yesterday I saw this movie for about the fifth time.<br />I still consider it to be a great movie, especially the dreams and memories are portrayed in an admirable way and the cinematography is indeed great throughout.<br /><br />Guido is in a creative crisis but probably the crisis in his contacts with women is even bigger. He is not mature in his dealings with women.<br />Among others, there is his mistress Clara, there is his wife Luisa, and there is Claudia who is (for him) the Anima and she has `the power or the key' to turn things straight for him.<br /><br />I do have two (minor) points of criticism.<br />(1) Guido happens to be a not really likable character but he also somehow remains distant for the viewer (except in his memories and dreams) and because of this it is quite likely that the viewer does not really care so much for his well-being though his disfunctioning is the main theme of the movie.<br /><br />- Spoiler alert -<br />Near the end Guido has a redemptive insight and all the characters of the movie join together in a festive finale. The energy circulates again. (Truly a great scene!)<br />(2) This liberating insight seemed to come `from nowhere', it was not an effect of (for example) a change in his attitude. For me, this felt rather `unorganic' and `thought out' and arbitrary than organic and natural.<br /><br />Though I still consider this movie a great artistic achievement, the two points mentioned keep me from really being concerned about Guido's proceedings and from being really enthousiastic about the movie as a whole.
B007XF0X16|3.0|It was okay. I enjoyed watching this and I got it on Black Friday for about $5 dollars so its worth it. It's just not as good as the first one.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|My God. What an incredibly well-crafted story. I admit, when I had first opened this book, I was quite unimpressed. I judged it far too quickly. But after stumbling upon another great novel by Jodi, I decided to go back an pore over this book. I sure am glad I did. Some of the characters in this book had me well pissed-off. Melanie, for example. Unable to contain herself, unforgiving, etc. But the rest of the characters truly grabbed a hold of me and did not let go. (Excluding the prosecutor lawyer, of course.) This book was so heartwarming nd heartwrenching at the same time. God, it shows how perfection can be overruled and snapped. I have to admit, I was unwilling to shed tears, but with  torn heart, it wouldn't have mattered anyway. And the ending, I must say, was quite a shock to me. Having read &#34;The Stranger&#34; by Albert Camus previously, I had no idea if the book was in his favor or not. But what  shock indeed. And also of the significance that Chris had in the book...and the sincerity and grief that was displayed captured my heart. One of the best books I have ever come across, deserving of awards and such.<br />I take my hat off to you, Jodi. Thank you for this wonderful novel.<br /><br />Sincerely, Jacob (10th Grade Student).
B009JBZH54|5.0|Of course the third movie would of better if joker was in it but it happens. Katie Holmes doesn't do the second movie and Heath ledger died. It's a shame but both movies could of been better than they were. Don't get me wrong the movie was great but its the little things that could of made it movie of the year. Batman begins I enjoyed Christian bales batman voice better than the second and third one so I don't know why they changed it. Now for the good review. To get all three movies for $30 is a bargain. I loved all the movies besides for the parts I mentioned above. Second movie was my favorite because come on who doesn't like the joker.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is wonderful. It is unlike any other app I have ever played. But my title is  called that for a reason. First of all, there is an update. It was automatically downloaded on my kindle. If it didn't for you, then the button near the description that says 'Open', will now say update. I love this and I could play it all day.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I have seen disneys recent movies and this one is definitely the best one in the recent two years. It was very well made and funny. It tells a tale about a daughter who is a free spirit who's mother always tries and make her more princess and lady like. She stumbles on a witches house and asked to make her mother to change. She was turned into a black bear and now they must find a way to change her back. A definite addition to any Disney collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This  was such a great touching book! I loved it<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone be. Must read
B0044XV3QY|4.0|This product is great. I enjoyed the extra 10 minutes or so of cut scenes that were added to the movie. I don't know why they cutted the first two minutes from the theater version. The extended version explains how he lived in the beginning and I feel that it was important enough to be added to the theater version to begin with. This movie did so well that they are already making avatar 4. Two and three are already made. But to me I am thinking this is the same damn story as Pocahontas and the settlers. It's not original but it sells. Also a fun fact is that mark Warburg turned down the main role for this movie because he was making another movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is addicting and very time consuming and is one of my favorite games i have ever played and I also love to brag about how good I am at the game to my friends.
B004J4WL50|4.0|I was genuinely interested in the Tom's story and this book does a great job of telling it from the inside out.<br /><br />I found it to be an inspiring and well-written narrative of how the company went from idea, to start-up to iconic shoe company.<br /><br />It did not come off as preachy and was very practical in terms of characterizing the type of entrepenurial (sp?) spirit and tenacity necessary to stay motivated, and more importantly, motivate staff.<br /><br />Only thing that left me wanting more was the description of other &#34;One-for-One&#34; success stories -- but hey -- thats what Google is for.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game. Very easy to play and plays like I learned on my old pc.<br />I recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed it previously.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love the way he takes you into worlds we are not familiar with. I still like his earlier works better, right at the beginning, Time to Kill etc.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun.  There are games for any and all. No matter how much time you have to &quot;tap away&quot; you can find something to play.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|As you've probably read, they took a complete new direction. Sometimes you can hear a part of a song that reminds you of some of their past stuff, but they've definitely strayed from their Deathcore/Metalcore roots but in a good way. Very solid album, \\"Can You Feel My Heart, Empire, Sleepwalking, Shadow Moses, Crooked Young\\" are the standouts to me right now. I would highly recommend this album to fans of BMTH, or even people new to the band. Seems like a easy album to transition into BMTH.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|i love dogs so you can imagine how i was watching this movie...so sad, but if its a real story we as humans should learn about this wonderful hachi!
0307591549|5.0|Don't know what this book is about because I did not buy it for me but for my cousin.  She was asked to buy the books for work and she works in an advertising company.  I guess it is good.
B003SI605K|5.0|I recommend this movie to be watched by mothers and daughters, girl friends and even couples. Won't give away the story but I will say that this is a must see. The movie is from a woman's perspective. The acting is great and the story is too. The characters although played mainly by Asian actors, have no ethnicity. You will find yourself relating to at least one if not a combination of the characters. It is not a man-bashing movie by any means. It is more about the human heart, relationships and knowing yourself. By the end of the movie you will find yourself examining where you are and where you want to be. Oh, and don't forget your box of tissues. You will find yourself laughing and crying all at once. Please watch it with no interruptions.

B0028NSE3M|5.0|Not everything he has done has aged as well as this and it is true that he repeated the formula to lesser (though still great) results on Isaac Hayes Movement, To Be Continued, and Black Moses.  But the 20 minute By The Time I Get To Phoenix is the answer to the question you never knew how to ask.  Try to ignore the post Soul artist image he cultivated and if you've stuck around for the whole slow-burn rap, by the time he actually starts singing, you'll be ready to follow him to the ends of the earth.  Hyperbolic, with a groove I defy you to sit still for, and Phoenix pretty wonderfully illustrate the dynamic he was mining on these records from 69 to 74. He was a master of arranging a slow build of hooks you won't be able to get out of your head for days. The whole thing sounds as fresh as I imagine it must have upon release.  Totally essential for every human being on the planet.<br /><br />Edit:  I'm not a big fan of bonus tracks, as I prefer the sequence of the original release, so if you can find the cheaper earlier issue, the mastering on it is first-rate, imho.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Awesome boxset! Great artwork, great video quality and amazing bonus features! Can't wait for the next Thrones boxset to come out.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I found this book to be a fascinating look at the writing process of one of my favorite authors. His advice was well received and I put it to good use in my own book (which I've just finished writing.) If you have no interest in writing a book or finding out King's thoughts on writing, then buy Carrie or Cujo instead, but if you have a burning desire to know how those books escaped from the authors head and onto the page, then buy this one.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I was scared to download this because of the recent negative  reviews. But I was like hey it's a dollar why not see? Glad I did. Had no issues downloading or installing the app. And gameplay is great. No issues there either. So glad I went for it. I also purchased the extra levels for a dollar more. No issues with that. All in all very satisfied customer.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|So glad that I can use this to delete old downloads or other unwanted files that I wouldn't know how to find otherwise.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|this is some deep stuff, but entertaining enough for kids to keep interest.  this movie is beautiful and quiet.  it sparked some excellent questions from my son.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It seems to do what it's supposed to. I don't really do that much more than check notifications and messages.
B000H5U832|5.0|my son loves this movie, or he did for a month when he watched it everyday.  great stuff for a 3 year old boy.  we bought the next 2 as well.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found the Wool Omnibus Edition (1 - 5) to be a great read, in my favorite genre: surviving in post-apocalyptic/dystopian worlds.  Ok, maybe I'm a little strange, but apparently so are many others.  I desired to continue the story so much that I purchased The Shift Omnibus.  And I assume I will probably buy other Hugh Howey tomes (Dust Omnibus?).  It's a very compelling story, and although some have said there are holes, I believe most are explainable.  For a self-published book without all the spell checkers of a big publishing house, I was surprised that I only found one typo in the whole book.  Best of all, this is not some rehashed story (can anyone say zombies or vampires - which thankfully this is not).  Instead, the storyline is something creative and fresh.  Yes, there are some overly detailed descriptions of seemingly inane points, but there are few and seem appropriate for and do not take away from the story at all.<br /><br />I have very little time to read fiction, so I'm careful in choosing my next story to devour on Kindle.  I am happy I chose Wool!
B0009HARUW|3.0|my version's pages are tufted together in pairs, which makes for an awkward feel.  some kids books just repeat the same line over and over while changing a few words each page.  i understand that kids may find comfort in the predicable cadence, but this just gets boring.  oh, my son does like feeling the raised web.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|love the dvd beautiful clear love the movie nice action Halle Berry great actress love some of her movies movie great
B007P06DJK|3.0|the album's great, but it's not worth the extra money to own the documentary.  refrain from  falling prey to acquisition and rent the documentary and stick with your original copy of this classic album.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Willie is always good, this CD is GREAT, but being from TEXAS and growing with Willie I can't help liking his music.<br />All I can say, &#34;Try it you will like it&#34;
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie was full of action. It was very beautiful-the sets and locations were really neat. It has a ton of action, too! :)
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved every minute. I had seen the play the week prior so knew the story line well. I think they did an excellent job with the opening scene.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I must say I really enjoyed this movie. I have made it one of my favorites of all times. Most of the animation movies are really becoming my largest collection now.
B004T32SOK|1.0|I never write amazon reviews, however the experience I had with Box.com, talking with their sales representative, was so bad that I felt the need to warn others.<br /><br />Having just spoken with a sales representative at Box.com, I felt the need to share this information with fellow users. It was, without a doubt the worst customer service experience I have ever had. All I was trying to do was get more information about their business accounts and what kind of services they would provide to business customers. Rather than provide me with information about their product, a sales representative wasted 20 minutes of time asking me questions about my company address, why I wanted to get Box, and going down the list of all types of survey questions, that may have been useful to Box, were absolutely useless to me. And he insisted that he could not provide me with any information about their services without getting all this information from me. Looking to sign up and pay for a dozen or so business account apparently meant nothing to them, and for me, being concerned that this is representation of what their sales people and technical service representatives will be like - I will just go to one of the other dozen competitors that provides exactly the same service. While I only have one sales call to base this off, this was my personal experience with them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|What can a person say about a Amazon product except its great. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out the &#34;How to's&#34; in the use of this app. I rate this G for everyone
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling has talent like no other.  Her music is a combination of her playing the violin with dubstep music.  I love this CD!
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|This is a good app, as well as their other apps, but I was expecting these work outs not requiring equipment. I wished they showed these worksouts using items you could find around the house.You would not take or use this app at a gym. You more then likely would use this at home. But everyone does not have weights at the house.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I found this CD on here when I couldn't find it available at any store.  I received it VERY quick! Outstanding CD at a great price!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Being free, this is a good app. There are no fancy gadgets here and does the job. I wish you had color options, I know there is a pay version, but color is kind of a neccesary option.
0307472590|5.0|producto comprado en sitio fue entregado en condiciones y fechas indicadas, proveedor cumplio cabalmente a compra realizada. totalmente recomendable como vendedor.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I usually hate things that are offensive.  My favorite part is when he slams into the window revealing his...nakedness to that poor old couple.  No one should have to see that!  If you are easily offended, stay far, far away from Sacha Cohen.  However, if you can put that on hold for a few hours, you'll get some hearty laughs out of The Dictator.  It's meant to be ridiculous and on the far end of...everything.  Grab it when you're in the mood ;)
0553296981|5.0|EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO READ THIS AT SOME POINT. This diary is so touching and a very valuable account of one's experiences during WWII. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008RC72G8|3.0|I like Johnny Depp. I thought this movie might be good for a laugh.  It was, as you'd expect, a bit lame.  I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it.....just save it for a night where you're not expecting too much.  It had an interesting ghost story.  It was a little darker than I expected (that helped) but there were parts that were kinda boring.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. I haven't heard something like this in a long time. Completely origional and unique. Best album of 2013, easily.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Pretty basic game, but addicting, and as it goes on, challenging.  A fun game to have on your phone or tablet for when you have down time- but if you are someone who gets wrapped up in games, watch out....this one really will get you (and stress you out trying to keep your plants alive! lol
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This book offers a deep sense to find yourself by not just looking within but to learn to look outside. To learn the language in your heart and to learn the language of your world and only than will you know your true self.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|GREAT book, in my opinion.  It will suck you in and hold your attention...and then set you up for NEEDING to read the next book!
B002ZG983M|5.0|awesome movie! i can't wait for the sequel this summer. movie was as described by seller. great movie i hope the sequel is as violent too
B003O86FMW|5.0|Picks up after the first one, and again, hooks you in.  I think you could read this one by itself, and it still be a good read, but much better if you read it AFTER reading the first book.  It also sets you up for the 3rd book.
B00BR4QNJ0|1.0|It's so weird. I can't controll the game and now the game dosen't let me play at all but comes on. It fools me, I turn it on it shuts off.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|...but it was a good ending to the series, though it was sad to see it end.  This book was intense in a different way than the other 2 were, and had you guessing the whole time.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|It has a great story line and lovely for families or adults that are big kids :). It is also a short movie
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the mystery of this book, not just the &#34;what really happened?&#34; aspect, but also the way it explored the unknowable quality of those we love most.  We may know all along that Andy Barber can't possibly be objective when it comes to his son, but I found myself on his side anyway, right to the bitter end. His honest, complex narration carries the story along in a way that makes you believe in him, even as you're painfully aware that he just might be wrong. The court scenes are intense and never drag or get dull. I couldn't put it down.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Unless you want to give your facebook info or want to pay, its impossible to play this game.  And it's 1.99 for 10 stars...I think thats crazy expensive.  On top of that,I waited for the stars to fill back up, played one round and lost all 5 stars it was showing.  I would of payed a one time price to buy this game, but not what they are asking now.  It's so not worth it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved how Eva and Gideon's relationship is far from perfect. It kept me wanting more and not wanting to put the book down. Can't wait to see what else can happen for these two.
B00511QI4A|5.0|Another great book from Baldacci. Excitemrnt through and through. Very different from the Camel Club books. Cannot wait for his next book.
B008P76UKE|5.0|Listening to The Ring Without Words made me realize that Wagner's Ring was not strictly German. In fact it is mainly based on Norse Legends from Iceland and other Scandinavian countries. The Norsemen sailed their elegant ships all over the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. They raided monasteries in coastal England, where they found lots of gold. They built the city of Dublin. They sailed their ships on the rivers of Russia and played a major role in the development of that great country. The Nor(se)men in France in 1066 under William the Conqueror built castles all over England and Ireland. After 1066 the Normans moved their base of operations into the Mediterranean Sea, conquering Sicily and other islands.<br />Today Swedes play a major role in American cities. My sister married one. If you look at the telephone directory for Rock Island,IL,where I grew up, you will see more names like Swanson, Swenson and Johnson than Jones or Smith.<br />For me, the heart of The Ring is Die Valkure, women warriors like the Amazons of Brazil. I see the women playing in the orchestra, which would have been impossible a century ago. When we get to the end of the Ring, we see the god Wotan, not wise or powerful, but instead making a giant mess of things like the Greek gods did. His daughter Brunnhilde was the model for Athena. The gods were larger, but had all the foibles of us humans.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I watch this movie repeatedly. It has action, comedy, likable characters. Its a spoof about its own show 20 years ago. The aliens thought it was real and so they asked the human actors to try to save the alien world. The actors fumble their way through trying to actually play their roles for real.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Upgrades today are terrible.  The new format doesn't work.. Not good considering  I want to read about the Boston bombing.  DO NOT FIX WHAT WASN'T BROKEN!!!<br /><br />5/14/13 UPDATE. Much better now although at times only the left half of the page shows.... really odd. I hope this will be corrected soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome. You should definitely get it.You care for your horses and enter them in competitions and stuff
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its great for all ages simple enough for young ones, yet challenging enough for older. love this app its so worth it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|this is a brilliant film. ignore the critics and nay sayers, it has everything action, romance. and it's a damn site more entertaining than any of the Star Wars prequels. this film deserves a sequel or two.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Keeps you on your toes. It is great for just killing time and really keep you on your toes! I recommend it.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It covered much but too quickly and ultimately spent too little time on character development.  Also the effects are great but the directing not great.  It is another movie that ends like a tv episode with a slew of unanswered questions...but not to worry, the next installment is due only 18 months later! (!?!?)
0812984412|5.0|Too bad this novel was written after James Michener's death I would have loved to hear what he said about it.  I saw the movie first and then read the novel.  Now I will go back and see the movie when it goes to DVD or online.  I like Michener's tales and this one was in the same vein, but the technology is 50 years later.  It is much in the vein of Michener's THE SOURCE, HAWAII, CARAVANS, THE DRIFTERS.<br /><br />It also would fit well with Frank Yerby's  JUDAS MY BROTHER, TOBIAS AND THE ANGEL, and GOAT SONG.<br /><br />And likewise fit with Samuel Butler's THE WAY OF ALL FLESH.<br /><br />They are all novels that explore religion and beliefs and how those religious beliefs make some lives better and others worse.  All of these books fit the Cloud Atlas trailer comment that it is about the connections of lives through time.<br /><br />After seeing the movie for the second time, I will probably read it again but buy a copy of my own instead of checking it out of the library.<br /><br />I liked it though it was one of the most difficult and interesting novels I have read in some time.  But now that I think of it Butler's was a hard read as well.  Michener's and Yerby's books flow much better, but they all have the same ideas and themes of why we do what we do to ourselves and others.
1423140605|5.0|This is the most beatiful book I have. Great edition, and more important, great book! The best of this new series yet
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this app to help me sleep at night.  It has lots of different background noise to choose from. I gravitate towards the ocean and thus it's what I use to provide some white noise while I fall asleep.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and addicting, very challenging too. :) If you like challenging and fun games....then this game is for you!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Omg, I will say that this, was the best short series I have ever read....I really hope you continue writing more! I started reading this book in the morning, and didn't put it down until I was complete!!!<br /><br />I will say I was hoping that silo 17 would have united with 18, but maybe I am speaking to soon for the next book!!<br /><br />Love your work!!!
B008HJGPVO|2.0|I bought my 1st Kindle Fire & thought I needed all the accessories I saw :( so I bought this & it is ok, but not worth the price. I later bought a set of 4 for less cost than this item & if I lose 1, I have 3 more to use.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. The way the author keeps you guessing is perfect. Didn't want to put the book down.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm not really one for mobile gaming, but after seeing my friends playing it I decided to try it out and have kind of become addicted. Lots of fun and very smooth on my kindle fire for the most part.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|let me start off by saying that I don't hate depche mode and i'm not getting into an argument over whos better the cure or DM, cause to be frank it all comes down to personal preference. Now that I have that out of the way let me go on by saying this album is severely less than average let me just name a few of the prblems I had with this album.<br /><br />1.the flow is choppy<br />2.too synthetic<br />3.lyrics feel like nonsense insane dribble<br />4.out of two discs 5 songs are tolerable<br /><br />These are my top complaints, I don't hate this group but this album at best is 2 star maybe a 2 1/4 star rating. Boys if you want to bring it, you have to go back and get that great flavor that was depeche mode. strangelove,stripped,walking in my shoes just to name a few. I take no glee in saying this, cause it's always tough to see a great band which had a lot of potential (and still do) trip over itself like this.<br /><br />Personally it's not worth the money but, if you have to have it I recommend the mp3 download. ( at least it's cheaper)
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Danny Boyle has made scifi before (Alien3) but this is more cerebral as well as simply more interesting. If I'm honest, it runs the gamut of a thinking man's movie to a thriller. That's a lot of ground to cover. Trust me, if you like scifi, watch this movie!
B009UZBLSG|4.0|Image is great, but on my Nexus 4 it makes a very loose connection, which has prevented it's use a couple of times.
1400049628|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who likes zombie movies that are NOT comedies. Like the &#34;Walking Dead &#34; Series now currently in its third season, this book is also excellent.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not only does my grandson love this game but so do I. I highly recommend this g rated game for any children in the home.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Addictive and fun even though there are occasional glitches. So addictive that I actually buy credits for it. The most fun out of all the other bingo games I play.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This was a must purchase as soon as I left the theatre with my wife. Did this as a pre-order and was pleased when it arrived the day of it's release.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I was very excited for this movie to come out on Blu Ray, as I missed it in theaters. I was not disappointed. It was a visually beautiful film and found myself not getting bored at all throughout the movie. Great movie and very unique story and cinematography.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love this series, so it became a must to purchase as soon as it was released. I only wish the manufacturer would lower their price and keep the digital (cloud) copy in another edition for those that appreciate and want that feature.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I really liked this movie! I bought it for my kids to watch and I ended up enjoying it more. A very classic animated movie, for the whole family. I recommend to anyone!
0446579939|5.0|I read this book right before the movie came out and then went to see the movie.  I loved both.  I'm not usually one for the sappy romance stuff, but I love this story.  One of Nicholas Sparks best!
B001VPJYZK|4.0|I liked Desperate Housewives, I like all the different struggles they all go through. It is very realistic and I loved how some of them can make work and  home life really work even after having babies.
B003M6ENDO|5.0|Plot, story arcs, suspense, thrills and more.<br />It is a whole spy package.<br />I started to watch it recently after being very quickly overwhelmed by the load of .... reality TV.<br />I liked it, I loved it.<br /><br />I do not understand the TV author motives to stop it.<br />Though they need to understand that there is just plain too much of the same right now and I do NOT, and will NOT watch turn it on until something of substance is realeased.<br /><br />After firefly, now 24...<br /><br />In any case thanks to the producers, director and story writter. It is a good story, perhaps even a series of long feature film?<br /><br />Seb
B007ECFD5E|4.0|This was a birthday purchase for my nephew. My brother said he loved it and the assembly instructions were easy to follow.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|black veil brides is my favorite band of all time.I pre - ordered this album and it came in the time it was supposed too.It was the best album yet.
141690977X|5.0|Bought for a couple young girls after reading.<br />Good advice well written.<br />Both have good relationships now, and have said &#34;Thank - You&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great couldn't stop reading it I would tell anyone that this book should be read it was wonderful
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a pretty typical romance story. Connor and Megan spend a night in Las Vegas chatting and drinking, and they end up marrying each other. Connor remembers the night before, but Megan does not. Shockingly, Connor does not want a divorce, and he sets out to convince Megan to stay married to him.<br /><br />Connor is a man who thinks of this relationship in terms of a business partnership. He wants someone he likes well enough who shares his goals and priorities, but he does not believe relationships need love. Megan is a woman who has been burned and believes she does not need a man to make her happy or to provide her with the life she wants.<br /><br />With what type of book this is, I knew I was going to get a happy ending, and I wasn't disappointed. Megan and Connor do have ups and downs throughout their whirwind relationship, and it was fun and interesting to read about them and to watch the relationship develop. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and I would read it again.
B005Z271Y6|1.0|I am sad because I really like Adele, unfortunately there is serious problems for the viewer on this DVD. Picture is good when camera can stay focus long enough, but never stays focus in one picture more then 3 seconds... The problem starts with the director trying way to hard to show anything and everything in Albert Hall but Adele... After 2 songs you already tired trying to fallow these multiple cameras moving from pic. to pic. every 2 to 3 seconds, non stop... and I mean non stop!... She can not even finish her sentence and the camera already moved away. It just makes you upset because kills you concentration and takes the fun away. Obviously this is a work of an amateur. Adele and musicians were all good but the directing killed it. Sorry Adele...
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have been playing this game 4 2 to 3 year's but not on the kindle. I played on the iPod so the kindle app needs to update because it is missing the 4th magic weapon, the cubes other than that I love the game and the tournaments. Git ir dun!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What else can I say, It works perfectly and it is easy to use with large display on my kindle. Highly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|There's a smorgasbord of keyboards for Android out there today. With so many good choices, it's difficult to find a truly unique keyboard to accommodate your Android needs.<br /><br />Well, SwiftKey is deserving of every bit of its praise in the media. Number one keyboard app on Android devices, etc. It's light, fully customizable, and equipped with a vast array of options. The new Flow option is a huge advance for mobile keyboards, and it allows all texters to write as fast as they can swipe.<br /><br />Personalize your keyboard and predictions with SwiftKey's ability to quickly scan emails, texts, and even social media to determine your typing style. Many skins allow for endless personal expression. Even speak your text message with the Voice key, inputting your text or email to a friend that much faster. It amazes me what technology has done for us in recent years.<br /><br />Bottom line: SwiftKey 3 is a must have keyboard for all Droid users and the best $3 you could ever spend on an app. Highly recommended for all users!
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I loved the show and it followed the anime story pretty closely I didn't like that one of the major characters died other then that it was done well put together great the music was awesome and gave me chills when it played I think they should have followed the story a bit closer.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|An essential on the fly camera app to add a little zazz to your photos. Several different capture modes with all the filters you could want. Add some originality to your artistry with Paper Camera, one of my favorite apps for Android! A must buy.
B008EKOO46|2.0|My anticipation of another diamond was high, so was my disappointment.  His description of the organization of the book goes on forever, is unenlightening and remains an intrusive theme throughout the rest of the text- with continual references to topics in other chapters and what has been previously stated.  Also, too much attention is paid to the work of others (much of which is now old hat, especially the non-communicable disease sections) but not enough to his own original experiences and insights- the main thesis of the book is thereby diminished.  The repetitive and dogmatic writing style borders on being insulting to the intelligence of the reader.  But, maybe his intention was to produce a secondary school textbook and I am just missing the boat. I really don't know how anyone could have actually enjoyed reading this book.
B0082Z1CVQ|2.0|It was outstanding I mean what a story man I liked the kind of character Mrs March was and also Amy and Margret<br /><br />And by the way my rating is not 2 stars but 4 stars
B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie based off a comic book is amazing. Besides the amazing art design and being a very well made movie, the story is great. It speaks to the socially inept, teen angsty, nerdy, comic book loving side of us all. This movie pleases many demographics, but is truly targeted to the 20-to-30-something year old geeks who grew up on 8-bit videogames,  comic books, and alternative rock. Also, you don't need to have read the comics to enjoy this movie. I had not read them before I saw this movie and I still thoroughly enjoyed this film. Go see it and be thoroughly entertained, I guarantee it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|seriously -- listening to LIB...N is like hearing these songs for the first time, *way* back in the early 70's. With the orchestration removed, the songs and arrangements stand alone and project much more strongly. Just The Beatles here. Not putting down the Spector version and I know Lennon preferred it, but McCartney was right. LIB...N is a unique take on this great album and worth owning. Just great.
1609611543|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. Look at the junk we are putting in our bodies! It is well written and includes documented research, testimonials, recipes and more. My doctor told me wouldn't accept me as a patient unless I was gluten free. I bought the book, went gluten free and have reduced my weight, blood pressure and glucose.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game works just fine for what it is. I just don't think it's really much fun to play.  But I haven't had any issues with it.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|If you love the desire between those of Divergent, this barely touches Beatrice's love! BRAVO Lauren, bravo. I HOPE OUR WORLD NEVER COMES TO TBIS!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game itself is fun but there are problems when it freezes up and doesn't give you your credit if you had a Bingo and doesn't refund credits used to play. All in all it would be awesome if these little quirks could be fixed.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Amazing, sexy, watched four seasons in 2 weeks! A must watch! Great cast, great plot, great action.  Jax, juice and chuckle are my favs!
0385535147|2.0|After reading most of John Grisham's books this one was far below my expectations.  Every one has a bad day and I think that was his.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game ever  and I like how you change characters and get new boards<br />It Is awesome
B004J4WL50|5.0|This guy, and Google maps, is probably America's best export in advancing civilization. We're all looking for a 'meaning' for what we do nowadays, and it's easy to get lost sometimes. This lil book is like a bible for the newborn entrepreneur of this generation who are savvy, socially responsible, optimistic despite the beaten path in front of us. Sometimes Blake sounds a little too optimistic almost too innocent, some of his success stories just seemed too easy and he seems to have too much luck. But this soon became clear to me that this is all because he has always started with and hold true to a. Genuine purpose in whatever decision he makes. I am very glad I discovered Tom's, discovered Tom's blog, and hence discovered this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is lots of fun would recommend it to everyone. My family loves it a lot. It was very easy to learn and it is challenging and fun at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is a lot better than temple run.l like the characters and upgrates.you have to get this game<br />.
1608871088|5.0|There is no other way to describe this product. It has everything you could have ever wanted to know about the movie and it is wonderful to look through.
B000FC12SM|2.0|It was very hard to follow with the Mars and Venus terms.  I had to replace the Mars and Venus references with men and women just to get through the book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love this game-- fast paced fun.  many options for help keep it interesting.<br />recommend highly for those who like a quick fun game
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|I have been interested in Dr. Bruce Lipton’s books for years, but I truly fell in love with his stuff (for lack of a better expression) when I attended one of his workshops. He is an awesome presenter, best I’ve ever experienced, both in person and as the author of his books. Can’t wait to get my hands on his next book, “The Honeymoon Effect”.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|definitely enjoyable to me but I love gaming all around its kind of interesting to see where technology is taking us
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book has been mass produced and reproduced in tons of countries and languages, and it's so easy to see why. It's a very quick read! I'm a slow reader, and I can finish in a day. Gives tons of perspective on the important things in life, and how easy it can be gone. Suggest to any and everyone!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app is the worst idea to download,  I tried it for myself but its bad. the Icon is a bit different than the facebook original Icon and the &quot;news feed &quot; section wont even load after 2 times of loading and removing the app. I consider not to downloaded if you looking for a facebook app.just simply stays with the normal Icon that sends you to the internet.
B000AY74OG|4.0|This item was received in a timely manner. It is in good condition. It would have benefited from a cleaning of the casing, but other than that, it's fine.
B000V8FKOW|5.0|I ordered this album so that I could practice my rumba dance steps. The songs on this album are upbeat, fun with a little added romance.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really fun read, awesome to experience being burned or drowned in a silo - I felt anxious reading every part and couldn't wait to find out how it would turn out and what would be next.  Excellent.
0525478817|5.0|I do not need to write a review of what countless others have said before me.  It is a wonderful story, both heartbreaking and bittersweet.  It is the first book that I have started reading again as soon as I finished.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was different from what I had expected seeing trailers for the movie coming out soon, but it was not a disappointment.
B00BHMF578|4.0|what is there to say--- it is only a movie, here is my other 10 words ha ha ha ha
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The end holds quite a few surprises that I was not at all expecting. Amazing read, I highly recommend it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I couldn't ask for anything better. Great music anywhere, anytime. Awesome! Who would have thought I could listen to music from any era and from around the world.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very fun game to play if you are into playing games about cubes. It will keep you entertained trying to beat your best time.
B000FBJFSC|1.0|A lot of the same old thing about his father being a drunk and wasting money on booze. I just skipped most of the story. It got too boring after awhile. Reading same old same of. It was a waste of my time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a great read. Though it is a heavy topic, Quick presents it in a really interesting and fun way. Way better than the movie!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I was very bored with this movie, it didn't take long for the bit-c-h-ing and moaning to get repetitive and dull.  I wanted to turn it off but kept hoping it would get better.  But nothing changed, the tone of the movie carried on til the end.  Or at least until the last 10 minutes when I finally couldn't take it anymore.  I expected more from these actors and writers.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was a spin-off from Beavis and Butthead. She was a brainy alter-ego to B&B. She is a cerebral, introverted young adult trying to make sense of a world that doesnt. Her and her free spirit artist friend Jane are each others life-savers. Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />MTV originally produced the series with unlimited access to millions of songs but only for on-air use. They used little snippets of songs throughout the series for mood music. They were unable to release a DvD series because it was prohibitive to acquire licenses to all these little song clips. They finally redid it with different music. I saw the originals on TV and youtube. Frankly I cant tell the difference.
B00005JM20|5.0|Fast and Speedy Delivery!  Would definately use this seller again!  Had trouble finding this movie and wanted to get it for my mom as she Loves Rowan Atkinson!  She was very excited when she received it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is awesome I use it all the time thanx for creating it ill pass it along cant wait to see more
0399157565|5.0|I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell.  I devour each new book she writes.  The only book of hers that I do not own is the children's book.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|In almost every instance where I have read a book and then seen the movie I have ALWAYS found things that I hate in the movie because they omitted something vital or completely changed things around but Jesse Stone movies are the exception. Tom Selleck is stellar and he does a magnificent job of mixing Jesse's venerability and tough and gruff attitude into his amazing performance. This movie is definitely a must see. I would recommend that this particular movie, Night Passage be watched before any of the others within the series because shows how and why Jesse came to Paradise.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Flash Gordon was one of the last times a film this pure, straight forward, guileless, and loopy could be made with a smile on its face instead of a wink at the camera. Its a crazy Saturday morning cartoon of sci-fi pop that has good pacing, silly effects work, and perfectly 'all in' performances. Could've fallen flat on its face, but instead soars like one of the hawk people into its psychedelic backdrop of blissed out heroics. Its a wonderful hodgepodge of colorful villains, amazing lazer battles and outlandish costumes. If you still enjoy fun adventure flicks this is for you. The blu-ray looks good although not a ton of extras and I couldn't be happier.
B00007BHOE|5.0|I love everything about this DVD. It is exactly as I remember when I watched this as a kid, so good job guys :)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the perfect dragon game i could find on the kindle fire. I searched for a game where Dragons. This is a great game for children and family. You'll never get stuck where you have to spend your money to continue. There are no ads that get in your way.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love this game. I love how animated it is and how you can pay with your friends. I also . Like how Scrat runs across the screen!!! Very fun!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Almost concurrent stories of Amy and Nick.<br /><br />The police think that Amy has been murdered and possibly by her husband - but has she or has she YET.<br /><br />A great read, full of unexpected twists and turns.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|This movie is raw, realistic and gritty but I have a hard time watching this film. Overall well done movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I had so much fun reading The Martian.  I'm so surprised it's on Amazon's 99 cent shelf because it's worth so much more.
B000YDE43C|5.0|I love the look and feel of these boots...very well made.<br />They are all leather, including the inside, so they will take a little while to break in.<br />I made the mistake of wearing them out one night, and they rubbed my heels raw.
B00993FEUK|1.0|This movie is too scary for kids. Some mature subject matter and the fright level are more appropriate for a teenage audience, but the delivery is not entertaining enough for anyone over ten.
B0011W48FE|5.0|IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE JUES BELIEVED ABOUT THEIR FAITH AND WERE WELLING TO DIE FOR WHAT THEY BELIVED IN THIS WHAT CHRISTIONS ALSO DID WHEN THEY BELIEVD IN JESUS.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The app MY HORSE is very fun and engaging  for all ages. You cam complete chores, treat your horse, compete, and aquire more tack and rider clothes as you collect  coins and gems. Overall, very fun app.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|A bit disappointing. Good writing no doubt but the story ends quite tragically and abruptly not at all what I expected
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Loved the story and the ending.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because they did not have it on Kindle until 4 months after the hard copy was realeased.
B00BWC1UZE|1.0|Why would I spend twice the amount to buy the Deluxe Edition when there is no way to listen to the 2 Bonus Tracks?  If that's a marketing strategy, it's crazy and makes no sense!!  And why pay almost double for 2 extra songs?  Really disappointing.<br />Carol
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Interesting from a historical perspective; wholesome; heart-warming; funny; sweet. Puts me in a good mood. It's nice to watch something entertaining that affirms healthy, prosocial values and not be assaulted with violence, sex, greed or any of the other 7 deadly sins.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Had to watch season 1 + 2, .Now for the 3rd and can't wait for next year. Acting is great. Am totally addicted.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This s one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. Read the whole thing in one day!!! I WANT MORE,
B0052RCX0G|4.0|Great coffee table book. I would definately suggest only reading two or three items at a time since it is hard to retain all the historical information. All the items follow a similar pattern in how they are described.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|The complete series of the 9th Doctor Who is &#34;Fantastic&#34;!  Once more I fell in love with &#34;The Doctor&#34;!  Christopher Eccleston's series introduced Rose Tyler--and I couldn't have picked a better actor to play the part of Doctor Who.  I own &#34;The David Tennant Years&#34;, and this is a great addition to my Doctor Who video collection.  I'm looking forward to purchasing Matt's portrayal as The Doctor when each season comes out on DVD.  I would recommend this vendor, and plan to purchase more Doctor Who items as they become available.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Package arrived on time from Amazon.<br /><br />Here is my product review by category:<br /><br />Package - Retail packaging in white box which appears clean, premium looking, easy access to product, and labels are easy to read<br /><br />Appearance & Quality - Charger got the aesthetic look of white housing with gray trims and logo.  Clean cut looking that resembles Apple style products.  Charger is well-built that feels sturdy, lightweight but not too light it feels cheap. Housing is painted white with gray plastic trim, and has clear label of \\"Apple\\" for Apple products and \\"Android\\" for Android products so user do not made a mistake and plug in the wrong charging port.  The car plug itself seems to withstand countless pull and plug from the car port and fit just pefect, some cheap car charger I had before will feel flimsy when plug into car port.<br /><br />Charging & Functionality - It works as advertised which output 2.1A from Apple port and 1.5A from Android port.<br />Charging iPad mini and Samsung S3 at the same time works flawless.  I have tried a few electronics just to see how charging holds up, GPS, iPhone, battery charger and etc.  The housing that extrudes out of car port is just the right length so that it is not too short to cause difficulty unplugging it or too long that it will get in the way of other stuff nearby.<br /><br />Conclusion:  There is no rocket science on a car charger but you would be surprise that some car charger brand just can't seem to get their product to work right.  The port label is very useful to direct consumer which charging port to use for specific product.  No complain for its price and quality, they have nailed this one.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I will try to be short.<br /><br />I absolutely love the LoTR trilogy movies. The hardcore fans may claim that it doesn't stay true to the book and many parts are missing, others say that movie was too long and too slowly paced, but for me it was just right.<br />This was not the case with the Hobbit. I understand that Jackson wanted to make more than just the \\"Hobbit\\" book - he wanted a complete background prequel to LoTR including lots of material from Silmarillion. I can appreciate that - the extra info, the necromancer, the elves trying to manipulate things behind dwarfs back etc.<br /><br />However I must stress out that the pace of the movie doesn't quite match. The things scroll along just too fast - the entire part of chasing through goblin caves is like a Roller-coaster ride that went just a bit too fast - in fact so fast that your vision begins to blur. They really should have cut down on the chasing - its makes all the efforts to put serious tone on the darker background story to vanish into thin air and look childish.<br /><br />I would really have appreciated this movie much more if not for the things mentioned.<br />So 4 for the works, but -1 for excessive chasing.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I like the costumes, acting and many of the characters. It is an interesting era and what I look for in selecting entertainment.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is like the best alarm clock ever. I use to use an actual alarm clock and I wouldn't want to get up because it was so quite. You can even turn off you kindle and it will still go off ... recommended hell yes.  : ~)
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|this just kept loading and loading and never worked on my kindle fire.  Might work on another platform.  no good.
076421120X|5.0|The Revealing Jesus worship album wasn't only a straightforward recording of a live worship. I loved that they explained what the songs meant, shared to the listener the significance of the words sung so that we don't just blurt out empty words with melody. Since they shared how the songs affected their worship experience, it lets the listener and the reader get into a deeper level of worship.<br /><br />The devotional brings us closer to Jesus one day at a time. Each daily devotion is kept short but with substance so that we can devote more time to worship and pray.  Both the songs on the album and the devotions in the book are all centered on one thing -- or should I say person -- and that is Jesus. Every Christian wants to be more like Jesus -- and let me clear that, we want to be like Jesus, not be Jesus. But how can we be more like Jesus if we don't spend as much time getting to know Him? This devotional and worship album helps us desire for more of Him!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I WAS HESITANT AT FIRST TO TRY IT BUT I THINK IT IS AN AW SOME BOOK. IT IS . PROBABLY MY MOST FAVORITE BOOK.
B008GAXUGW|5.0|I believe everyone has heard the famous minuet.<br /><br />In listening to the samples at amazon, it was very intriguing and the Baroque period is my favorite.<br /><br />I have listened to most of the collection and have found them wonderful.<br /><br />The data referring to the composer stated that like Joseph Haydn; he was somewhat isolated from his contemporaries and had to be creative and original.<br /><br />How true these words are.<br /><br />The music is a delight and runs the gamut of emotions.<br /><br />If you love the Baroqe, then you will love Boccherini.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This Kindle cover is so helpful with the ability to use it as a table for the tablet.  You don't have to hold the Kindle while reading.  It's great
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Very entertaining.  I heard a lot of people talk about the movie.  The whole concept of moneyball was a big topic of discussion for a while and then seemed to die out.  Interesting to see it in a movie.
1400069742|5.0|We tend to have short memories, or are tasked with learning events second hand...which leads to even shorter memories.  \\"Those Angry Days\\" is a window into a time period where our country was bitterly divided over WWII in Europe prior to December 7th, 1941.  There are a great many parallels to today, but there are also realignments that have taken place over the last 70 years.<br /><br />The similar descriptions of both Lindbergh and FDR are profound in that there are modern day counterparts.  The same risks still exist; do we pour out our lives and treasure to protect those who will need rescuing again and again?  What role does the USA play now that power has shifted internationally?  What rights does our country have to protect herself from those who declare themselves at war with us?<br /><br />It is all the more fascinating if your family has handed down Lindbergh or FDR stories.  Both these men touched many lives and shaped many destinies through their action or inaction.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Mr. Jackson's done it again, only this time there seemed to be more humor in the story.  The acting was superb as well as the costumes and scenery and animation.  Too bad they had to deviate from the book as much as they did, but still an excellent flick.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I liked the app when I first downloaded it.  But the more I used it the less it worked, 9 time out of 10 the only information I got was the clock. I am sorry that I paid for the darn thing.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Humor, romance, trivia, triumph of the underdog -- all common elements that make a baseball movie great. This has the added elements of a touching reconciliation between a father and daughter and a snapshot of the mundane life of a life-long scout. One I can watch at least once a year during January & February while I wait for the next season to begin.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game!! Out of all the g5 games I think this one so far is my favorite. I like how unlike most other games u don't have to wait a day for your energy to reload.
1780387105|5.0|I have been following justinguitar.com's lessons to learn guitar for a few months now.  He has a lot of these songs on his website but it is much easier to follow along with the book.  I would reccomend this book to everyone with any interest in guitar.  It makes learning new songs really fun
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great for BINGO players. Its hooks you into playing the games daily for credits and to win prizes in each country's.
0385344228|5.0|I had purchased 'Defending Jacob' for my Kindle right here on Amazon, thinking I can just take my time and read.  Read while at the doctors, in bed, outside anywhere, anytime, allowing myself to slowly enjoy this book.  WELL FORGET THAT!  Once I started reading I was hooked.<br />I think anyone that reads 'Defending Jacob' will enjoy it.  This was a good-buy-book!
B00447L4KA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter. It is one of her favorite movies and she watches it often.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like survival better but difrent people have difrent taste if u think we<br />Need more updates but don't wory we will catch up to pc so get it now befor it becomes 27$ but were geting multiplyer very soon. And if u think that updates are slow get pocketinv ed pro. Its for minecraft pe.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|The whole time I felt as if I was watching someone else play a video game. The plot is thin and linear, merely a string of fights with different creatures; characters are predictable, bland and non-engaging. I loved the trilogy but this was a disappointment.
B00AUU2KI0|1.0|It's a rewrite of robinson crusoe, poorly done.  The second story told to the investigators is actually the true story.  Pi was so traumatized by watching his mother eaten that he made  up the first story.  Yes, canabalism.
B0035XQW74|5.0|Has quite a lot of gore, and swearing that isn't all that necessary.. But being the kind of movie it is, I guess that is what is expected.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Yes,  it's a variation on temple run, but it's a very good one. Great graphics. Lots of fun. 5 stars!
B009K916ZK|5.0|It works Great for when I need to display my Mac at my school, When You buy a apple remote, it make you look more prepared and professional, when you are giving a keynote!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Sad but so honest....I really liked it. Why do thy make u write sixteen words that's all I had to say.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It had every element of a book I loved: not too sappy, but beautiful and romantic. I can identify so much with the main character. Although it's a little predictable and I don't want to give anything away, I want you to know I cried for like, half an hour, even though that part of the plot was inevitable. Beautiful, beautiful story. I would recommend this book to anyone who's in for a good read. Really. Also, John Green is hilarious.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the worst dmn game in the whole world and it is also kind of fun though so I guess I will say that it is a really fun and cool game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|For people who are addicted to stradegy, prepare to be addicted to Plague Inc.! This game forces you to develop a strategic way of killing people. It's wonderful.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I really like Classy Girls, Big Parade and Ho-Hey (which got a lot of play on the XM Coffee House channel), but the semi-shouting style wears thin after a while.  The Lumineers are obviously good instrumentalists, but the vocals don't need to come off as so slam-bang.  It is not illegal to be a little subtle.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|This was a gift, the item arrived early, well packaged & easy to open! I am very pleased that the gift was so well liked.
B0058YPILY|5.0|We have Bible study Wednesday nights and don't get to see &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; episodes first-run, so these DVDs are helpful. By season seven, the show's starting to run out of steam in our opinion; the episodes have taken on a sameness. They're still enjoyable, but how many times can you see the same thing happen? The Emily Prentiss story line is compelling, and the last episode is masterful. I only wish that the show's creators had decided to wrap things up after season 6; the Prentiss story line could have been introduced early, and the wonderful last episode could still have been done. By contrast, the creators of &#34;Flashpoint&#34; had the good sense to end after five great seasons.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I am a JRR Tolkien fan and really looked forward to the release of this movie ... it didn't disappoint. Looking forward to the next two releases to complete the set.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Read this one!  I read it first when I was 16 years-old and then again 25 years later.  I remember even though it was over 1,000 pages in hardcover, I tore through it in one week during the summer of 1988.  My thoughts when I read it all those years ago were that this was a monumental book that would always be one of my favorites as long as I lived.  Reading it again after 25 years has only reinforced those thoughts.  This is a story of a group of kids who seem to be the only ones who know about and can see an unspeakable evil entity who is killing children in their hometown of Derry Maine.  This entity (who's name is revealed as Pennywise to the kids), terrorizes the community for a number of years until the group of kids seemingly banishes him forever (or so they think).  There's one problem: terrible things start happening again in the town of Derry Maine as these kids have now become adults and have families of their own.  They soon realize that they must regroup, travel back to their old hometown, and fight Pennywise in one last showdown where nothing is certain - especially their own survival.  I absolutely loved this book and to this day it remains in my list of top 5 books of all-time.  I guarantee that if you read it, you will not want to put it down until the end.  Keep a light on though, just a warning!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have a bunch of apps that provide with good sources of news relative to things I like. What Flipboard does that I really don't get elsewhere, is that it pulls from content sources I would never normally explore. I love auto stuff and by adding the auto channel I get info from all over the world including stories from magazines that I don't subscribe to. Unlike a portal like Yahoo, Flipboard provides far more &#34;depth&#34; - the initial cover stories that you would get in a portal, but then the ability to quickly delve much deeper in to a topic.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This movie is a great little romance that I have watched multiple times!  It is a fantastic movie for a stay at home getaway.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This book was very good, easy reading.  A great novel of the lives of people in England during WWII.  It was a big surprise as to what the secret was.  I kept thinking it was something else.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I have it on my nitendo Dsi and I beat all the ten levels so imagine how easy ot is to beat fifty over like two hundred<br />I haven't finished it yet but it is pretty easy<br />but overall it is an amazing game that I love to play when I'm ready for a challenge
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|And, of 'coarse' (heh), after the book a theatric version is critic able. But the actors are good and the plots are the same and it's fun to revisit the story, and not have to find time to read. But it's great, actually, when you have read the books. And I just LOVE Ms. Harris' writing. I got ahold of one and went back for the rest. They HAD to keep to her plot. It wouldn't be the same without it. Truthfully, my only regret is when a FEW things were either left out or altered (only a tiny bit). And my only criticism is the sex parts. But the book was that way (practically) and I am a bit of the old school (though I can see how it relates). I am kind of sad to hear this is going to be her last book in May. I DO hope she will come up with a new heroine. Though she may have hit ALL THE POINTS?!? This show is another that I wouldn't miss.rg
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally awesome! i would buy it because it is SO much fun, i LOVE it. If I were you I would get it ASAP :)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book kept me interested throughout its entirety.  I learned many things<br />Th rough the characters thoughts and wondered what kind of mind the author<br />Must have had in order to write this wonderful story.<br />My name is Terror Rowland.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|MY KIDS AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE, AND IT CAME WITH A BONUS DISC WITH THREE SHORT MOVIES THAT MY KIDS REALLY LIKE TO WATCH.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|The movie is smart and exciting, but it is a little exhausting to watch. There is so much to keep track of, at a certain a point I gave up trying to guess what would happen and just let the move take me. I have gotten annoyed with movies recently always trying to &#34;up the ante&#34;--more guns, more twists, more tiny elements that are supremely important--and while I was intrigued by the idea and respect how well it was produced, I felt it actually would have been more enjoyable and stronger if they eliminated a few elements to allow you to...well, think! a bit more. Possibly would improve on a second or even third watch.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|MY KIDS AND I LIKE THIS MOVIE, WE HAVE WATCHED IT NUMEROUS TIMES.  IT WAS KIND OF EXPENSIVE AND I TRY NOT TO BUY MOVIES BECAUSE AFTER A COUPLE OF TIMES WATCHING IT THEN IT JUST SITS.  I AM HAPPY I HAVE A LITTLE CHILDREN'S COLLECTION TO PUT IT IN.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Fascinating world, believable, interesting characters...just the right amount of foreshadowing so the ah-ha moment is particularly satisfying. You really feel as if you know these characters, as if they could be anyone you met who happened to get involved in something bigger. I would love to read more stories about Shai (or other forger's) adventures. (Though this is a complete story and I have no reason to think such are forthcoming). Also, this is described as a novella, but it is just as long as plenty of older novels--it is only short compared to Sanderson's usual epics.
0785152458|4.0|My husband thought this was Awesome he really enjoyed the story line and it shipped quickly . Hope I can get more books like this for him
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|No doubt Collins can write an incredibly compelling book--but I felt with a dystopian young adult novel, she ought to also make some deeper comments and observations. She kept trying to make the books more dramatic, to raise the stakes, and I felt that by the end, she had just introduced conflict after conflict without really resolving any of them. It even is not entirely clear if people have learned any lessons from the Hunger Games themselves. Collins builds an interesting, if implausible, world, and she manages to draw you in well...but after ward, you feel like you have eaten butter and jam without bread. There's no real substance.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|It has been a long time since a band captured my imagination the way that the early Red Hot Chili Peppers did but this band have it. Unusual musical instruments coupled with amazing musical talent and a great work ethic make them a band worth listening to. They will be big no doubt and I take great pleasure in promoting every success they get because they deserve it
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Just discovered Adele for myself last year and truly amazed at this lady's vocal range!  A must have for lovers of those women that can really belt it out from the heart and soul.
014241543X|4.0|I'm not a big fan of sad stories.  They keep eating at me long after I'm done reading them.  Like I can't let the story go, and I just continue to feel the sadness and pain over and over again.  Because of this, I was quite skeptical of reading If I Stay.  I felt that maybe it wasn't a book for me.  But after I had it recommended to me so many times, and it ended up popping up on my screen on Audible on sale, I figured I would give in to the masses and give it an honest try.<br /><br />If I Stay really made me think throughout.  It's about love and loss, but it's also about difficult choices and real-life issues.  I didn't understand what the story really was until I started listening and realized that it's actually a story of Mia, looking down at her own body in ICU, deciding her own fate.  She's the only living survivor in a family car accident.  She must decide whether she lives or dies.<br /><br />To readers that enjoy a sadder story, you will like this book.  It's heartfelt and sincere.  Sometimes you just need a good cry, right?  I definitely think the audio deserves a chance.  The narrator did a wonderful job expressing the appropriate emotions.  And the cello music that plays here and there definitely added a nice touch.  This was a good read that carried with it a lot of emotion.  It definitely leaves the story open for book two, Where She Went, which I will most definitely be reading asap.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Its a pretty good book, but if you think its gonna be just like the movie. Its not. Its very different but still an awesome read.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I have a Canon HD R400 camera and I am using it to do video reviews on YouTube.  I looked into a lavalier mic to have some better audio with my videos.  I saw a lot of &#34;this is the best&#34; and finally decided on this one as an entry level mic.  For the money, you won't find a better product.  It serves it's purpose, for consumer level video producing.  One review I saw on this said the battery is an uncommon size and theirs was DOA out of the box, but mine works just fine, and I haven't reached the point of replacing the battery.  Overall a great product in my opinion, if your just starting out or on a tight budget, you won't find a better mic.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This is Paramore's fourth album and it is their best yet to date. It is their first album without the Farro brothers and it shows how they have grown into bigger and better musicians. The songs are much different than their first 3 albums and lead singer Hayley Williams has written meaningful lyrics. I have been waiting 2 years for this album and I was not disappointed one bit. If you are a huge Paramore fan, this is for you. Good work Hayley, Taylor, and Jeremy.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The beginning scene could have been left out completely without loosing any of the movies storyline and or audience appeal
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|I'd call it country music with a lot of Pop influence, but I'm no musician. I liked the voices, the harmony, and the lyrics.
0060245867|5.0|I love this story. It's so cute and the illustrations are great. I bought it for my boyfriend's nephew. Such a cute story.
B001974DG0|5.0|Since I am a dog lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great story, great characters, and an easy read. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie has so many great quotable scenes. I am a big fan of Will Ferrell, Steve Carrell, David Koechner, Paul Rudd, and Christina Appelgate so I love this movie. My friends and I quote Anchorman pretty often.
1423140591|5.0|The next in the series crossing between the Greeks and the Romans. Enjoyable as all the others have been. Our first copy was loaned out and never returned.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I didn't want to put this down. I wanted to know what was going to happen next, even though I already knew the story. It was heartbreaking to read how the women and men in the story are treated as pawns by the more cunning and crafty characters. It was as unpredictable a legend story could be.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|The most purposed, resonate, beautiful movie ever made.  Man's perfect cinematic achievement.  I doubt anything put to screen will ever mean more than this film.
B00597A6NU|4.0|The memphis belle was here for a show and tour. Ater touring the plane we came home and rented it. We enjoyed it very much.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent easy read looking forward to the next book which hopefully will be as good as this one was. Awesome story
B004G600A4|5.0|My 4 year old loves this movie. It's just scary enough to keep his attention, but not sooo girly that he doesn't like it. I would highly recommend this movie.
B00A2H9L2E|1.0|because they took the words right out of my mouth (direct copy and paste quote) - \\"Not what I expected. To tell you the tructh I waited so long to write this review that I cannot even remember what this film was about.\\"<br /><br />Yeah. That's how boring it was. Serious snoozeville. Literally. I fell asleep in the middle of watching it. I'd like to add that I loved the first one, but this one was the pits. They shouldn't have even bothered attempting a sequel. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Game with good graphics and intuitive game play. Even if you don't understand how to do something, it breaks it down in the tutorial. I did get annoyed at first because of where my virtual joysticks kept moving but you can fix their position in the options menu.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was amazed reading this book. I felt like I was there with her. My heart was broken. The end of the book was so important/amazing. I am glad I chose to read it and Jaycee is healing.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Got this a a gift for the lady who was just so excited that JT was back. She has this thing playing all the time and really I was surprised when a lot of the songs were good.
B00000250H|3.0|The correct jewel case came - but it had James Taylor's Greatest Hits CD in it - someone with a James Taylor jewel case is listening to Janis Joplin now.<br />Oh well - I like James Taylor too.<br />Accidents happen.
0810993139|5.0|The book is about a kid named Greg who thinks he's going to be famous. When he goes to middle school that might change. He has a friend named Rowly who doesn't fit in with the other middle schoolers. He does a lot of stuff that's fun for a three year old.<br /><br />He has two brothers named Manny and Rodrick. As he struggles in middle school, he also struggles at home. Greg thinks his parents are too over protective, but they just know what's best for him. For example they let him play video games a lot, but they don't buy very violent video games.<br />In middle school Greg has the most struggles. He gets bullied. His teachers think he is going to be a troublemaker because his brother Rodrick was. He gets bullied a lot by a girl named Patty Farrell.<br /><br /> I recommend this book to 9 year olds and older to boys and girls. It's funny, the drawings are great, and I like the dialogue.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is my favorite sudoku app. It has some great features and a very intuitive interface. Might make the game too easy for some with the default options, but everything is customizable.
1419705849|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid, is about Greg liking a girl but she rejects him with another guy. She broke up with him. She goes out with another guy ,but she breaks up with him. goes out with another guy. Greg and him are going after her. Thats why the book is called diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel.<br /><br />By Angel
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|After a period of time ifyou don't buy in they cut you off.  It was fun but i cutthemfrom my kindle.
B00421IR5I|5.0|This is a perfect movie for family not, great for all ages. We laughed all the way through it. It is also a great movie to show a French class, which I did, and they had fun reinforcing their French.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am addicted, but limiting my use.  Don't under stand why you can only friend people you know. Find a real connectionwith people in person.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie is perfectly cast. Each actor does a wonderful job and I like how Miss Potter was a woman ahead of her time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A simple concept, really.  What better narrator then death itself to tell us a story about the Holocaust?  I have honestly never for a moment considered the lives of Germans, especially German children, who also were the victims of the Furher. I will treasure this story for the great lessons it has taught me.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is an excellent DVD and I think it is perfectly cast. One of the best dramas that I have ever seen. All the actors do a great job.
0062014536|2.0|Well...that was a disappointment. Requiem is another unsatisfying conclusion to an otherwise great series. I fell in love with Delirium, and still enjoyed Pandemonium, although not nearly as much. I was hoping that the ending would return me to that initial love stage, but it didn't. Honestly, all three books are extremely different. If it weren't for the fact that they are the same series, I wouldn't know that they are, since they each read totally different.<br /><br />The POV once again has changed. This time it alternates between Lena out in the Wilds and Hana back in Portland. I oddly found Hana's chapters more interesting. I use to think that the cured people would be robotic, but after reading Hana's POV, I see that's not entirely the case. They still have thoughts and feelings, but they seem more...detached, but aware. It's almost like they know something is off, but convince themselves that it's clarity. It's hard to explain, but it's just strange. But, then again, Hana may not be a typical cured.<br /><br />Out in the Wilds, Lena and her companions just keep running into crisis after crisis. There's no shortage of action, something completely missing from the first book, but it gets super repetitive. They reach a new homestead or safe house, regulators show up shooting, people die, then they move on to a new homestead or safe house. Lather, rinse, repeat. All the while Lena is using Julian for comfort while pining after Alex who seems to be bonding with another girl in their group. It was all very blah. Everything I loved about Delirium has just been lost.<br /><br />The ending was probably the worst part of the finale, which makes it worse. I had to read the last few pages twice, because I thought I had missed something. There's war and chaos and death everywhere, and then it just ends. It feels like a cliffhanger with the promise of a fourth book rather than an open ending. Absolutely nothing is resolved. It just ends. Did the Resistance overthrow the DFA? Who's in charge now? Is Lena going to form a relationship with her mom? Does she end up with Julian, Alex, or neither? How are the cureds and uncureds going to live together? What happened to Hana? I have no idea!<br /><br />It makes me so sad when a series starts out strong and leaves me with a feeling of utter excitement only to steadily head down hill and fizzle out. Requiem was almost three stars for me, but then that abrupt ending happened. I don't mind open endings, but this one just feels unfinished.A? Who's in charge now?

B00BP3DPJY|5.0|Lovely album, humble, catchy and strong throughout. I have listened to it about 20 times now and still loving it.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|enjoyable for both kids and adults, can watch over and over again. worth buying and worth the price to get.
B002RI90WM|4.0|I enjoyed it because I liked having the dog, perspective on things. It was sad in parts, but also had some funny episodes
B009A87ZQU|4.0|Not my favorite James Bond and I prefer the original version of this movie.  Bought it for a Casino party were most people are 30-40 years old and thought they would not appreciate Sean Connery the same way the over 50 crowd would.  I was right.  A few of them did not even know Sean Connery ever stared in a James Bond movie.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I got this as a gift for my sister. She reports that the movie is not for everyone. You have to be a real fan of this type genre. She reports that the video quality is very good. She highly recommends it to people who like this kind of entertainment.
B00000J9HE|5.0|These recordings dating from the Sixties have throughout the passing decades defined my  and many other people's impression of Sibelius' greatness. None other than the composer in his own words supported  it, when he wrote to Walter Legge that Karajan was the only conductor who (in his estimation) really understood his music.<br />Speaking for myself, they have worn extremely well. Every time I return to audition one of them, the anticipation of a profound immersion into this spiritual landscape is reinforced. There is nothing spectacular here for its own sake here; each symphony has its own soul and its own colouring; there is no trace of routine, but an absolutely honest and at the same deep immersion into this sound world.<br />These DG recordings, also extremely well recorded for their time, have therefore served me as a reliable yardstick for comparing newer releases. I can only report what my experience has been. While several issues have come close to matching them, none has exceeded them in any of the relevant aspects. This includes Karajan's own set for EMI, which is in many respects a letdown after the high expectations, especially for a superior recording technology. But regrettable, the fussy manicuring impulse got the upper hand on that occasion.<br />Accordingly the DG recording holds fast as the upper benchmark.<br />The outcome is something I could hardly state for many recordings, and it will sound paradoxical. But these DG recording have become part of the furniture in my musical imagination, and I mean this in the positive sense that they reflect my own inner responses to Sibelius pretty much to perfection. I can say this of no other recording of this composer's music.<br />If music listening is a form of induced meditation, capable of opening up vistas of our imaginative world such as no other art can, then it might seem that these recordings have transformed over the decades into something not unlike the pictures I have on my walls. All carefully chosen on the criterion that they will \\"speak\\" to me when I ask for it. I can think of no higher praise than this to bestow on these recordings.<br />But I don't expect that you share my point of view.<br />Nevertheless I am not alone in my opinion. These issues have set standards for other critical minds as well; and to allow yourself to be addressed by them on the same level requires nothing more than to set aside the hankering after novelty and diversion. Lasting values are what the word implies: Values that tend to hang around for a long time. They can go out of fashion for a while, but always return, because they transcend fashions. This happens because if a trend is not match by insight, then it will exhaust itself. But insight is the scarcest commodity of all, and it certainly cannot be acquired simply by wishing it or even by studying for it. Insight rests experience.<br />And so five stars to end, because this site does not allow for rosettes. (Maybe just as well, because then it would be full of rosettes!).
0792839749|5.0|I got this as gift for my sister. She said she is very pleased with the DVD transfer quality. The picture is sharp and the sound very good. She recommends this to people of all ages or who are fans of Dick Van Dyke.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excelente compra, el producto en perfectas condiciones, estuche original y nuevo! rapidez en la entrega! Genial! muy agredecido con ustedes
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I got this as a gift for my sister and she could not be happier. She reports that the DVD transfer is clear and very sharp. She recommends this to any fan of Disney or this type of story line. It is solid entertainment for all ages.
0385349831|4.0|Not Coelho's best work, but enjoyable nonetheless.  He is sltill my favorite author.  He did not seem to write in his normal style, but the essence of his spiritual outlook was still present.
0316044695|5.0|Marcus Luttrell's story moved me.  My dad told me to read it several times and I finally gave in and read one of the greatest stories and books ever.  It is amazing the training and hardship they go through to become SEAL's, and the more incredible thing is that he only tells the tip of the iceberg.  The rest of the book chronicles the intense battle, sacrifice, and Luttrell's fight to survive and get back home.  What he writes and how he tells it draws you in and doesn't let you go, I came out from reading this forever grateful for our soldiers and what they do for us. They are our greatest hero's, I pray for Luttrell, his friends, and everyone who has, does and ever will serve our country in the armed forces, may God grant they all find peace and rest and Heaven, with the greatest of his children, thank you for your service and sacrifice.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This was the first movie that my 15 month old watched and surprisingly, it held his attention pretty well!  Love the characters, love the voices!  The picture quality was awesome, too!  So glad that I bought this!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Able to watch videos much easier than on you tube but not as big a selection as on the actual website.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I really loved this new mix of vampires, werewolfs & steam punk innovation. The chemistry between the lead characters will scorch you. I could not put this book down!
B004529NLG|5.0|great blu-ray combo pack for a great price. great movie that makes you just want to start break dancing while watching it
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Not anything I'd want to watch multiple times, but I'm glad to have seen it once.  Very interesting piece of history.  I had a very hard time, after I'd seen it, keeping the phrase Argo **** yourself out of my vocabulary.  :LOL:
B0017TWUZG|5.0|the product came intact and the movie is just awesome and makes you want to stand up and breakdance with the cast
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This whole album is beautiful. My 12 year old daughter made me listen to one song and I was hooked.
0743270754|5.0|Not literally, of course.  But I was \\"there\\" in the sense of being so totally immersed in the book that I felt like I was sitting at a table with Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Chase, etc., hearing their words and being impressed with the passion behind them.  I felt terribly depressed as the story wound out and I knew the assassination would soon occur.  I wanted to leap into the book and warn the president to avoid the theater that night.  By that point I had come to think of Lincoln more as a beloved friend and mentor than as a historical character.<br /><br />Goodwin takes her readers on a journey to the latter half of the 19th century.  She immerses them in its sights, its smells, it fears and hopes.  I developed a new appreciation for modern medicine, as she described how tenuous life was in Lincoln's time, when disease was rampant and untreatable. I instinctively flinched when I read about the horrors of war, the filthy conditions, the wholesale removal of arms and legs.  I smelled the stale tobacco smoke that drenched the White House curtains, walked through its corridors guided by hissing gas lamps, and felt the heat of sweltering summers unrelieved by air conditioning.<br /><br />\\"Team of Rivals\\" is far more than a history book.  It's a time machine, one that offers its readers an unforgettable journey.  Enjoy the trip.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read half of the book and got tired of all the neverending zombie carnages. If you are a complete geek about zombies or watch or do any of the following...<br />. watch hit tv show the walking dead<br />.play dead island or left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 excessively<br />.prepare for zombie invasions<br />if you do any of those I would strongly recomend it, but if you are the kind of person who likes novels like artemis fowl then I would not recomend that you read this book.<br />But if you are reading this review I caution you that world war z has alot of very strong language and sexuall themes.
B008JFUNPK|5.0|This movie is hilarious. i love the characters and the story was good. you don't see to many caveman movies and i thought that this was a good one. i just love dreamworks animation films. this is the best one since shrek and kung fu panda. the movie is not boring at all. it was well made. great for the whole family. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B003TXSF5C|5.0|This is one book i wish everybody would read especially those who care so much about religion but unfortunately not everyone can understand the scientific layout of it. It has actually given me a lot of answers to some of the pertinent questions about creation as someone who spent almost a quarter century of my life immersed in christian religion but never got answers to anything about life. I recommend it to everyone who wants answers instead of the simplistic assertion we get from religious books.
1613821670|2.0|I wanted to read about the ongoing conflict between master-and-creation, to understand how one could turn against its own creation. Surprisingly, the author doesn't dig into that. Actually, the history slows down, then picks up a little bit, then comes to a halt...<br />Bottom-line: go see the movies.

But then the album goes horribly south.  Sounds like a pop album.  It's almost like Stump took his songs from his solo career and added Fall Out Boys name to it so it could sell.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is the best Director, Producer and Writer on the movie planet. I finally got to see \\"Django Unchained\\" this afternoon...a 2-hour and 46-minute gem that won 2 Academy Awards...probably should have won more. There's a genius about Quentin that only his fans would appreciate...he's the master of revenge...but never hesitates to add touches of humor that temper his anger and frustration. Christoph Waltz won the Academy's \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" for his role in this film. He was not in a supporting role...he should have won for Best Actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was never better as the plantation owner...and Samuel L. Jackson should have also been nominated for an award. But Jamie Foxx is the guy that captures the heart of this audience. I know it's hard to fathom, but this film is a classic love story. What these guys do to save a damsel in distress is phenomenal...and a sincere testimony of true love. I gave it all 10 stars! Keep 'em coming Quentin!

030758836X|5.0|There are some books that hit the book blogging world by storm and it seems that almost everyone has read them.  I'm usually one of the last ones but that doesn't really bother me.  Because I have a tendency to shy away when a book is getting \\"too much\\" buzz.  I'm weird like that.  But I am so glad that I finally read this one because it was OH SO DELICIOUSLY good!<br /><br />This book is about a man (Nick) and his wife (Amy).  But that's all I'm telling you.  Because either a) you've already read this book, b) you've already read enough reviews to know what this book is about (and whether you want to read it or not), or c) your planning on reading it in which case you should go in knowing as little as possible in my opinion.  Or you could be like me and pick this book up solely because the author is Gillian Flynn and you had such a good reading experience with another of her books (for me that was Sharp Objects which I also highly recommend).<br /><br />This book surpassed all of my reading expectations (and I had high ones thanks to Sharp Objects)!  Although I had a hard time at the beginning connecting to the story, before long I was completely and utterly hooked.  I can see why reviewers either love or hate this book.  This is such a dark book at times and it isn't always easy to read.  Ms. Flynn, I bow down to your expertise as a writer that knows how to make the reader squirm.  None of this bothered me in the slightest because I love a good dark read.  The author gives the reader the opportunity to really get to know the main characters in such a way that they almost feel like real people.  Love them or hate them but don't ever accuse Flynn of not fleshing out her characters.  I was so wrapped up in the story that I would think about it when I was doing other simple things like the dishes.  I was completely absorbed by the end...even after finishing the book I thought about it days later.  I could never guess what was going to happen next with this book, and the ending just blew me away because I didn't see it coming.  Tricky, tricky!  Even now just talking about the book makes me want to reread it and experience it from the very beginning.  I will now officially read anything/everything that this author writes which is high enough praise!<br /><br />Do I even need to wrap up my thoughts on this book for all of you???  I enjoyed every moment that I spent in the dark, twisted world that this author created.  I found myself endlessly fascinated with the characters that she created in this book for many different reasons.  And I basically want Flynn to write as many books as humanely possible just so I can enjoy more books like this.  If you want a book where you should always expect the unexpected than I would highly recommend this one!  As for me, I plan on reading Dark Places when I'm ready and in the mood for another dark thriller.  My expectations will be set ridiculously high from this point on.  Enough said :)<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This book will be on my top reads for 2013 this year...I can guarantee it!<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received a copy of this book from NetGalley thanks to the publisher.  It also fits in with my personal goal to read as many Edgar Prize nominees as possible.  I couldn't be more pleased with the results of this personal challenge!he ending just blew me away because I didn't see it coming.  Tricky, tricky!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Most of the book was pretty cliche, boring even. It truly was like a high school girl sat down with her friends and gigglingly wrote this book. Even the sex, which was supposed to be surprising and super hot, wasn't shocking to anyone who watches tv or reads books. I will admit that I was surprised by the end, but I'm guessing that will change since there are two more books.
1401941893|5.0|Although it is geared mainly towards women and young girls, this little EMPOWERING book is gentle on the heart and soul but powerful in its messages, which really can apply to any gender, any generation. Miranda Kerr could easily become the spokesperson for young girls just starting out in life on their own, or still in school deciding their future. I especially ejoyed reading about the way Miranda stood up to the school bully. What a great way to empower TWO people at the same time, even your enemy!<br /><br />The basic premise and theme of this book seems to be: \\"YOU decide your future. Your attitude, your outlook on life - is what will return to you in the form of personal life-experiences.\\" And all through the book, interspersed with anecdotes, is a gentle guidance, through self-revelations, anecdotes (funny, mundane or tragic) and Miranda's own observations (as well as Deepak Chopra and others'), on one page, as well as guiding thoughts by Louise Hay (the savior of my psyche and my healing angel many years ago, through her book \\"You Can Heal Your Life\\") on the facing page.<br /><br />The \\"Getting Personal\\" questions at the end of each chapter are another way of peeling away the layers of self-doubt and adding \\"muscle\\" in the form of self-revelation. There is a good chapter on nutrition, which is another way of empowering yourself-- anorexia doesn't feed the mind or the psyche -- in fact the opposite happens when girls try to starve themselves to look thin.<br /><br />The ONLY thing that I would like to see changed is the use of lower-case \\"i\\" when referring to one's-self, in those affirmations - that is way too humbling. No -- Make it a CAPITAL \\"I\\" because everyone needs to \\"stand tall.\\"<br /><br />PS-- the \\"three sizes too big\\" shoes stuffed with Kleenexes story was hilarious -- it reminded me of a model I used to know who had her own Kleenexes on the runway story (also hilarious). Miranda coped, and so did my model friend. Poise -- and a sense of humor -- are wonderful attributes when you find yourself needing to make the best of an unexpected situation like that.wonderful attributes when you find yourself needing to make the best of an unexpected situation like that.

B005XBKXV2|5.0|The Lion King, one of the most well-known Disney movies of all time and my childhood generation, begins with the birth of Simba. His dad is King Mufasa, who boldly teaches him about the circle of life. Scar, who is Simba's uncle has a plan to take over the throne, because of his jealousy towards his brother Mufasa who is king. So Scar sets up numerous traps to get Mufasa killed and throw Simba off, since he believes that Simba is too young to become King after Mufasa's planned death. Mufasa is killed when Scar slings him to the bottom of a cliff after trying to rescue Simba who was in a stampede. After his death, Scar convinces Simba that it was his fault for his father's death and the best thing to do is to run far away. He tells the jungle that Simba and Mufasa were both killed, and his is next in line for the throne. Later in life once Simba is a grown man, Nala finds him in the jungle and tells him how everyone thinks he is dead, so she convinces him to return and claim throne. Simba returns and battles Scar, who is defeated by Simba and is finally the King of the Jungle. Simba and Nala are in love, and the movie ends with a newborn cub of theirs. I included the teaching of the circle of life, because this was a prime belief in the Indigenous religions. Mufasa teaches Simba that everything one sees exists together in balance, and explains that everyone is connected. Simba believes that the dead are not separated by the living, when Rafiki tells him to look in the clear water at his reflection and Simba sees his father, Rafiki replies that his father is living in him. They also live among all the land and do not take the water and jungle for granted, like the Indigenous people who practically worship the land, rivers, and sky and made hymns out of this. I grew up watching the Lion King, but after watching it looking for religious connections especially relating to Indigenous religions, it's amazing how much is intertwined and symbolized.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Following on the successful 2012 CD release 'Heroes', country music legend singer-songwriter Willie Nelson And Family are back in 2013 with a wonderful and a rather quite diverse CD release titled 'Let's Face The Music And Dance'. Like in the CD 'Heroes' (14 tracks), Willie Nelson combines both covers and his original compositions as in this new CD 'Let's Face The Music And Dance'(14 tracks). He had Lukas and Micah Nelson featured well in 'Heroes' & the overall sound of the album was that of a combination of country & pop. I agree with the record label that the music in this CD 'Let's Face The Music And Dance' is difficult to categorize : it's rather a balanced combination of jazzy, bluesy, popish/rocky, country and latin influenced tracks.<br /><br />Jazzy tracks include the wonderful opening/title track \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" : a smooth jazzy track with a beautiful melody and the unmistaken vocals by the master Willie Nelson & \\"You'll Never Know\\". Bluesy tracks include \\"Is The Better Part Over\\" : a rocky-bluesy track with great horns sound, \\"Walking My Baby Back Home\\", \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" & \\"I Wish I Didn't Love You So\\". Latin guitar/influenced tracks include \\"Vous Et Moi\\", \\"I'll Keep On Loving You\\" & \\"Nuages\\".<br /><br />Stand-out tracks/gems/my favourite tracks inlude the title/opening track \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\", \\"Twilight Time\\" : a mid-tempo laid-back track with incredible melody/piano/vocals and accordion sound & \\"South Of The Border\\" : mid-tempo smooth track, beautiful melody & vocals. I like the accordion sound in this track, the song itself is reminiscent of another of my favourite song \\"Across The Border\\" by Bruce Springsteen from his 1995 album 'The Ghost Of Tom Joad'. Apart from okay track \\"Matcbox\\", the rest of the remaining 10 tracks are very enjoyable tracks.<br /><br />On overall, Willie Nelson, turning 80 years young in April shows no signs of slowing down. He would like us to just 'Let's Face The Music And Dance', not try to box him in some category of music or style. With 60 years in the music industry, with over 200 albums under his belt and 7 Grammy Awards, I think he can afford to do so. A highly recommended CD listening.

B00BKBCF38|3.0|As the title of this review gives away, I felt that the first full length release by this band was an absolute masterpiece. Opus Eponymous came along at a time when most of the music I had been waiting for was letting me down. So many albums that I thought would be monumental were not living up to the expectation, and I really needed to find a winner. Opus was a winner, and I give it a perfect score. There is not a bad song in the bunch on Opus, and I never get tired of any of the songs.  Like another reviewer, I managed to get an advance copy of Infestissumam, and have been listening for a while. First off, I must say that this album is very different than Opus, except for a couple of songs. Both of the early singles for Year Zero, and Secular Haze could have easily been on the first record, but the rest of this album is a departure from that sound. This album has more of a brooding feel. less theatrical, less melodic, and dryer sounding. If the first album was a wild night on the town with a dozen of your friends, this is dinner at home with a couple of close friends. Ghost is great because they are a band that brings a new feel to something you have seen a million times. Kiss, GWAR, Green Jello, etc. etc. have all done the costume gimmick, and managed to put some good music with it, but Ghost is the first one to make the music the real star of the show. If you had only heard the songs, and never seen a picture of the band you would not know that they wear the costumes, and are anonymous musicians.<br /><br />This album does give a very 70's vibe to the listener, but not in an arena rock way. This music reminds me of good rock music that your older brother listened to in the 70's, but nobody knew who they were. The carnival organ sound to me is a nice touch to their sound and adds an evil overtone on otherwise straight forward tunes. As with the first album, you will not find any harsh vocals on this release, but you may find a few whispers here and there.<br /><br />Some people have drawn parallels to Mercyful Fate, Blue Oyster Cult, and Black Sabbath. I don't get either comparison personally. The only similarity I see with Mercyful Fate is that both bands have clean vocals, and to BOC, that they have the 70's vibe that I talked about earlier. I don't think the two bands sound anything alike. That is one of the best things about this band. They don't sound like anyone else currently making music. It's not metal, or pop, or hard rock, or doom, but a combination of all. This is just good song writing, played well, and some of it is pretty memorable. This is not an album that has the \\"guitar solo of the year\\", or \\"wow, listen to that drummer!\\" This album is good songwriting, good musicianship, straightforward rock music with just enough campy-ness to make it fun. They have a satanic message, but it is just all part of the show. This is a band of characters that makes some pretty satisfying tunes. The satanism is just part of the show.<br /><br />A lot of people have been critical of this band, and album for all of the positive reasons I listed above. If you don't like this stuff, you are taking it too seriously. If you criticize the costumes, you're taking it too seriously. If you criticize their playing, you're taking it too seriously. If you criticize the Satanism, you're taking it too seriously. People that are looking for the fastest blast beats, or the most blistering leads, or the most disjointed grindcore, are looking for different music. This is not that kind of band, or experience. This is for having a fun listen every once in a while, and not having to worry about figuring it out. One listen and you will either like it or not. Most people I see that are bashing this are hipsters that are just too cool for Ghost.<br /><br />I do have some criticism about this album that pushes me down to a three star review. First is the sound engineering. I am someone who has a pretty good sound system at home, and a really great onein the car. On a good sound system you can really tell that the mix is too compressed. The drums are too \\"boomy\\" on some tracks, and the guitars get a little lost. For being a larger budget release than Opus Eponymous, it sounds like a rookie was working the sound board on this one. It is not terrible, but it is definitely lacking the production of the first album. Another criticism is the songwriting. On Opus Eponymous the songs flowed into one another, and formed a cohesive collection of tunes. This album seems like it was written in about three sessions that were about a year apart, and I almost think it could have been three separate short releases, instead of one LP. Not as cohesive as the first record. If you are wondering why I reference the first record so much, it is because I would consider it a five star release.<br /><br />Lastly, I got two CD copies of this, one download card, and a copy on vinyl. I have not listened to the download copy, and the CD's have the muddy sound I talked about here. The vinyl is what I was most excited to listen to, and the physical quality of the vinyl is a joke. It is one of the thinnest pieces of vinyl I have ever owned, and out of the sleeve is warped to the point where my turntables cartridge scrapes the record as it spins. I have read other reviews that talk about this too, so it is apparently a common problem. Seriously the quality of the vinyl is one of the worst I have seen. The packaging is good quality, but there is not much to it. No cool booklet, inserts, or any of that. It is simply a record, and a sleeve. That is fine, because it is the music that I want, but I have to say that if you are a vinyl person to stay away from this one. Surprising to say the least. With all of the anticipation over this release, I thought this would have gotten the royal treatment on the vinyl version with heavyweight quality, and extra's that come with a heavyweight price. Simply not the case. Ironically, the sound quality is best on the vinyl, although the physical quality of it is junk.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a Ghost fan you should get this. It is not a terrible release, it just could have been better. Like other reviewers have said, hopefully the third album brings the best of one, and two.

B00B999E12|3.0|The Place Beyond the Pines is a crime drama directed by Derek Cianfrance and starring Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Rose Byrne and Ray Liotta. Set in Schenectady, New York, over a 20-year period, the film is a riveting drama about fathers and sons, and the ramifications that the actions of one generation can have on the next. Gosling stars as motorcycle daredevil Luke Glanton, who turns to a life of crime robbing banks in order to provide for his baby son, Jason, and the mother, Romina (Mendes), who accepts Luke's help only reluctantly. Luke's increasing desperation brings him into contact with Avery Cross (Cooper), a Schenectady cop with a family history of running for political office, who is dealing with a shaky marriage to his wife Jennifer (Byrne) and a young son named AJ, pressure from his own father, and his own discovery of corruption among his colleagues. The film takes some unexpected twists and turns in its second half - which I won't reveal here - suffice to say that Cianfrance's measured direction and languid pacing allows the film to develop into a slow-burning familial drama that is both hypnotic and engrossing, especially as the true depth of the generational secrets are revealed.<br /><br />The music for The Place Beyond the Pines is by composer Mike Patton, who is still best known in the music world as the lead singer of the alternative metal band Faith No More in the 1990s, but whose musical experimentations have taken him to writing, producing and performing as a multi-instrumentalist across numerous genres and with dozens of collaborators. In the film music world, Patton made his debut writing music for the action movie sequel Crank: High Voltage in 2009, and he also wrote the score for the Italian-language drama La Solitudine dei Numeri Primi in 2010. The Place Beyond the Pines is his third feature film, and if the strength of this score is anything to go by, he may well have added another significant string to his already tightly-pulled musical bow.<br /><br />But first, a word of warning to \\"conventional\\" score fans; The Place Beyond the Pines is not a conventional score. Patton's music is a combination of electronic tones, electric and acoustic guitar accents, and a sampled choir - as far as I can tell there are no live orchestral instrumental in play in the score at all. If you dislike any score music that doesn't make use of a traditional orchestral complement, give this one a miss, because it won't appeal to your sensibilities at all. For those whose tastes extend into the more unusual, however, The Place Beyond the Pines is worth exploring, as Patton certainly manages to do some interesting things with such a self-limiting palette.<br /><br />Thematically, there is no real recurring elements which can be pointed to as a \\"main theme\\" or recurring melodic identity; the cue \\"The Snow Angel\\", which features a lonely-sounding piano motif and languid accompanying chords plays just once on the soundtrack, but features prominently in the film's trailer and re-appears several times in the film itself, usually as an accompaniment to a tracking shot following a forlorn bike rider winding his way through a lonely road thickly lines with trees.<br /><br />Instead, Patton is more concerned with textures and moods, creating a sense of loneliness and general despondency through the music which matches the pervading tone of the film; in The Place Beyond the Pines, no-one is ever really happy, and the past weighs down heavily on everyone. Patton's score drifts hypnotically from one set piece to the next, alternating between light and dark, adding layers of gloom to the increasingly desperate central characters.<br /><br />The highlights are certainly the cues where the chorus comes into play - the oppressively pretty opening track \\"Schenectady\\", for example, more than insinuates that something is not right in the city for which the film is named, before moving on through the combination of voices and twinkling guitars of \\"Beyond the Pines\\" and the unusual \\"Coniferae\\", which has a slightly skewed electric guitar riff and other processed effects. The conclusive \\"Handsome Luke\\" is a little more disturbing than most of its predecessors, making use of hard-edged industrial textures, a bigger percussion section, and brutally explosive, almost Goldenthal-esque sound design elements to capture the intensity of the film's finale.<br /><br />Several songs and classical pieces round off Milan's album presentation. The dreamy rendition of Burt Bacharach's \\"Please Stay\\" by Liverpudlian band The Cryin' Shames from 1961 matches to mood of the rest of the score. The new recording of Italian composer Gregorio Allegri's 17th century liturgical chant \\"Miserere Mei\\" by Vladimir Ivanoff and the Osnabrück Youth Choir is haunting and moving, as is the spellbinding performance of Estonian composer Arvo Pärt's minimalist 1977 classical composition \\"Fratres\\", reminding the listener of why it has inspired similar textural experiments by film composers ranging from James Horner to James Newton Howard. There's even an equally mesmerizing cue from Ennio Morricone's 1969 score for the film Cuore di Mamma entitled \\"Ninna Nanna Per Adulteri\\", before the roughneck tones of indie folk rock band Bon Iver bring the album to a close with \\"The Wolves - Act I and II\\".<br /><br />I can't quite explain why I enjoyed the score for The Place Beyond the Pines as much as I did, because it's not really the type of music I usually go for. It might be something to do with the way it gives the film itself an appropriately overwhelming mood of impending tragedy, or Patton's intelligent way of arranging his collages of sounds into fascinating musical effects. Whatever the reason is, I found The Place Beyond the Pines to be an oddly affecting, unusually fascinating score which veers significantly from the mainstream.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|I bought the BK2 with hiking and camping in mind.  If I'm car camping, weight really isn't an issue unless I want to go for a day hike.  Even then, weight isn't my greatest concern but it's still annoying to have your pants pulled down by the knife on your belt.  The BK2 makes for a great camp tool and the removable scales make the knife very versatile but carrying it is a chore in itself.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Price Point ($65-$70   Ontario Rat-5 $75-$80   ESEE-5 $160-$200 w/sheath)<br />- Durability (full tang   tough, easy to sharpen 1095   0.25in thick blade   quality hard plastic sheath)<br />- Modular Design (sheath offers many carry options with [[ASIN:B005KN6DIA Tek Lok]])<br /><br />Cons<br />- Weight (16oz wo/sheath   holy crap ... that's a pound   0.19in thick Rat-5 11.5oz)<br />- Scales (screws loosen during heavy use   keep an allen key handy   grivory not micarta   Rat-5 micarta)<br /><br />The BK2 is obviously a good sturdy knife but I think that the [[ASIN:B000R30XAC Ontario 8627 RAT-5 Knife (Brown)]] would be a better, lighter option. I can't say that I'll purchase it just to find out though.  I want a slightly longer, less broad, full tang blade that I can comfortable carry on my belt, so the search continues ...

0307341550|5.0|This is one of the most unique novels I've read. It's a twisted, unpredictable story in which family bonds intertwine with horror and fear of rejection. It's a fascinating account of how far a child would go to earn a parent's love.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Flynn paints a movie with words.  Her characters are highly unlikeable and downright nasty and mean spirited.  That being said, you find yourself not necessarily liking them, but perhaps understanding them. Libby, the protagonist, is an extremely unlikeable character who I found an odd connection to, as unlikeable as she was I really wanted her to know the real story.  Flynn's writing makes it impossible to put her books down.  This book is brutal in the violence and it's honesty about thoughts of suicide and poverty.  Excellent! Excellent!

B006XF5BTG|4.0|I have lifted weights for almost 6-7 years, trying to lose fat and gain muscle. I've been in a high body fat % all my life. \\"Lean\\" for me is 21-22% body fat. This book not only addresses the training part of everything but also the nutrition part, that's almost as important. I'm not following the nutrition part yet, because I've been on the \\"med/carb Low fat high prot with no good results. Now I'm on high fat, high prot, no carbs.<br /><br />I'm a sports nutrition fan. I've read dozens of books on nutrition and exercise, always beleiving that full body 3x/week was the way to go, but not having even close of the results that you would expect.<br /><br />What I find frustrating is that I've been struggling with body fat for all my life, even as I'm in my ideal \\"weight range\\", I'm always way past my ideal \\"body fat range\\" and all books say that you can \\"easily\\" mantain 10% body fat year round with any of the proposed diets and you can go to maybe 15% when hypertrophing and then start the \\"Muscle definition\\" phase (cutting). I would LOVE to be at.... 18% BODY FAT!.<br /><br />If you weight training and nutrition with solid science based comments, this is the book for you. In it you have even a yearly plan that you can use and tweak to fit your schedule.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 starts just because Michael Matthews answers all your mails and is the most responsive author I've seen. He also doesn't pretend to know the whole truth and can accept other authors/peoples points of view.<br /><br />I started last week and will post an update after I finish the first 8 weeks.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Concise read<br />- Simple routines<br />- Almost every statement backed by science<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I would have loved to have maybe a table or tables detailing the workouts for 3, 4 or 5x/week. Personally I weight train 3x/week, so I had to write Mike to set up the routine.<br />- For pecs, you have a couple of exercises that are a little hard to do for low reps without a spotter (Weighted dips and dumbbell presses) and you really don't have many options to change them<br /><br />Hope you have great results.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is one of those filmmakers who looks for trouble.  His films are always over-the-top in all hot-button aspects: violence, language, race.  DJANGO UNCHAINED is perhaps the accumulation of all of these.  It takes place in the pre-Civil War South, with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) freeing a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx).  Schultz is tracking Brittle Brothers, and only Django knows who they look like.  In return for his cooperation, Schultz offers to free Django's wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of the evil Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone.  Of course, you probably know that.  But this isn't even a film for all Tarantino fans.  It pushes the envelope; two of my friends, huge Tarantino fans, were put off.  Even I walked away from my first viewing unsure of what I felt.  I liked the film, of course--but part of me was disgusted, sick.  And after the second--and third--viewings, the latter two didn't diminish, but I was at least able to make up my mind: I was truly awed by this movie.<br /><br />First off, you have the acting.  Christoph Waltz won his second Best Supporting Actor trophy, and it's easy to see why: he is the shining star in this film.  His Dr. Schultz chews up the scenery much like Hans Landa did in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS--and yet, this isn't merely a retread.  There's a deep-rooted humanity in this character, and Waltz brings that to the surface with perfect subtlety.  In the \\"lead\\" role (the term is debatable for much of the film), Foxx is solid--he's out-shined, but that's hardly any fault of his own.  In a supporting villainous role, DiCaprio is deliciously evil--he clearly relishes the opportunity to let loose, and though his character isn't as fleshed-out as it could've been, this is easily one of the most despicable Tarantino villains to date (according to Tarantino himself, Candie is the only character he's written that actually got to him).  Washington's supporting role is the most thankless here; she doesn't have much to do, but she gives it her all.  As Candie's right-hand man (who also happens to be a slave), Samuel L. Jackson provides another sparkling performance, second only to Waltz: Stephen, the head house slave, is truly despicable, in many ways as bad (if not worse) than Candie.  And that's not even counting the smaller supporting roles that dot the film: Don Johnson (a highlight of the movie), Jonah Hill, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Franco Nero (the original Django), Bruce Dern, Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Tarantino himself (with a god-awful Australian accent), and still others.<br /><br />But as with all Tarantino films, it comes down to more than just acting.  DJANGO UNCHAINED also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and after some thought, it's not hard to see why.  The film is provocative; we have Tarantino's trademark genre mishmash, as well as his whip-cracking dialogue and sense of humor (this film is, despite its horrors, absolutely hilarious at times), but we also have a new edge, an unsettling look into a dark period of American history.  DJANGO pulls no punches; it's gruesomely violent, even for a Tarantino film, and the worst of the violence actually occurs offscreen.  This may not be the definitive dissection of slavery and Southern culture--Tarantino, even at his best, is a pulp filmmaker--but it's nonetheless uncomfortable and thought-provoking.  Some will love it, even as a part of them is disgusted; still others will absolutely despise it.  Either reaction is understandable, and exactly what Tarantino wanted.  But do yourself a favor, and at least give the film a watch.  If it offends you, that's okay--you don't have to watch it a second time.  But maybe, just maybe, while you're being entertained by a fantastic film, you'll also find yourself thinking about history in a new, darker light.the most thankless here; she doesn't have much to do, but she gives it her all.

B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|OMD were among the biggest acts during the 80s, despite never becoming the mega-act they constantly were so very close to becoming. One reason, in my opinion, is that their singles were uneven but more importantly, their albums were without exception not solid enough. This meant that they never created the fan base needed to really hit it big, meaning that songs like Secret and If You Leave never became the smash hits in the UK (If You Leave became a solid hit in the US, but they barely sold any records there).<br /><br />After a hiatus that lasted almost two decades, OMD came back a couple years ago with an album, History of Modern, which is a masterpiece. It is a mixed bag of very catchy songs and slower Kraftwerk like compositions that seems to have resurrected their career in improbable ways, both critically and commercially.<br /><br />They recently followed that album with this new album, English Electric. It has already charted in the UK and on the strength of History of Modern, entered the album charts at number 12, their best album chart showing since 1991!<br /><br />History of Modern (HoM) is among my most favorite albums in recent years. Despite Kraftwerk influences, it has a smooth and lush production. Also, some HoM tunes had a contemporary sound that could have easily been hits, i.e. if OMD were still a force to be reckoned with in the singles charts. English Electric (EE) sounds more retro and while HoM was a mixed bag of Kraftwerk-like songs and hit tunes, EE is very much on whole Kraftwerk influenced. It actually is at points as if those two groups had joined forces in creating this album. It certainly sound like the old OMD, which I think works on this album.<br /><br />There is a loose conceptual theme on the album, regarding the future. The opening track, Please Remain Seated, informs the listener that the future (s)he had anticipated has been cancelled. This is followed with the first single of the album, the 7.33 minute long Metroland (singleis a shortened version of the song). It is a rather brave choice starting the album with such a long song but it works, a very catchy tune (bouncy but yet not fast paced) that holds up well during the long period. There are three electric \\"jams\\" on the album, The Future Will Be Silent, Decimal and Atomic Ranch. These are among the highlights of EE, both using an interplay of repetitive voices and electric music with great results (the Atomic Ranch video is stunning). Dresden is probably the song that comes closest to the catchy tunes on HoM and then there are a few other very good songs.<br /><br />Two songs are so-so; Helen of Troy is a carbon copy of Joan of Arc, simply not as good and Stay with Me wanders somewhat aimlessly. I am not prompted towards the remote, but these songs I can live without. The final song, Final Song, is though a great way to end the album, as The Right Side on HoM.<br /><br />EE is, therefore, a solid follow-up to HoM and surprisingly maybe just as good. It lacks 1-2 additional killer tracks (like HoM part 1 or Sometimes) but EE is slightly more coherent with barely a weak spot on it. EE is (like HoM) a keeper.

B00BAVCD8A|4.0|Chicago pop-punk band Fall Out Boy return triumphantly following a near five year hiatus with 2013's [[ASIN:B00BAVCD8A Save Rock N Roll]], released via Island Records. Tightly composed of 11 consistent and enjoyable tracks, Save Rock and Roll benefits from a brief, thoughtful duration of 42 minutes. Pete, Patrick, Joe, and Andy don't 'reinvent the wheel' nor themselves here, but they easily remind fans why FOB has been sorely missed.  The production is handled by musician/standout producer Butch Walker while all songs are written by the band.<br /><br />\\"The Phoenix\\" can be described as dramatic and dynamic.  Superbly written and performed, the cut energetically and successfully re-introduces Fall Out Boy. Patrick Stump's vocally sounds as appealing as ever, tearing up the catchy chorus (\\"Hey young blood / doesn't it feel / Like our time is running out / I'm gonna change you like a remix / then I'll raise you like a phoenix...\\").  First single \\"My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up)\\" keeps the momentum rolling and also hearkens back to FOB's love of overly long and humorous song titles.  Songwriting is solid throughout the verses, while the chorus keeps things simple highlighting the title catchily (\\"My songs know what you did in the dark / Light `em up / I'm on fire!\\"). \\"Alone Together\\" closes the opening trio well, if less impressively than the two juggernauts that precede it.  A big pop record, the production stands out, even if it is a bit over-produced.<br /><br />\\"Where Did The Party Go\\" finds Patrick Stump showing his assertive side on the verses in particularly.  Always hook-driven, the bridge deserves some lyrical praise (\\"We were the kids who screamed \\"we weren't the same\\"... now we're doomed to organizing walk in closets like tombs / Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema life...\\").  \\"Just One Yesterday\\", featuring Foxes sports a sound driving feel, propelled by Pete Wentz's bass line and Andy Hurley's pummeling drums.  Foxes provides a solid lift to Stump, with both exhibiting excellent vocal chemistry. \\"The Mighty Fall\\", featuring Big Sean is arguably the set's hippest track. Featuring production sensible enough for pop, rock, or hip-hop, \\"The Might Fall\\" benefits from its crossover appeal.

B00BI6SVCE|5.0|I have no idea how anyone could criticize Iron & Wine for moving into new directions in their music.  They have come a long way since Sam Beam started the project, and while I absolutely love their (his) first couple of albums and always will, I must admit that this album has a lot more depth and charm.  To expect a musician to do the same calming acoustic melodies he was doing over ten years ago is insulting when you consider the need of an artist to grow and express himself in the present.<br />This album is a brilliant display of songwriting and arrangement that should put it up there as one of the greatest albums of the year.  Do yourself a favor and give this album a try, though I would insist you forget everything you know about Iron & Wine prior to this release.  It is not the \\"Naked as We Came\\" Iron & Wine that so many of us fell in love with so many years ago, yet it is true to form and a brilliant display of talent and melody that will stick with you for years to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book by far is the best in the series no denying it. It's amazing, epic, and heart pounding leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
0345803507|5.0|Great book , third of the series. Would recommend for any lady of any age. I am 25 and I couldn't put it down. Wanted more. No more books after this one.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|You need to ask yourself the following two questions before you continue to read this review, much less consider listening to Save Rock and Roll:<br /><br />1. Do you like Fall Out Boy?<br />2. If \\"yes\\" to 1, do you particularly love their latter albums Infinity on High and Folie A Deux?<br /><br />If \\"no\\", don't bother with this CD and stay far away.<br /><br />If yes to only question 1, you may be disappointed with this album as it is nowhere near their old style.<br /><br />Now, if you dug on Infinity on High and especially Folie A Deux (like I did), you'll definitely dig this follow-up.<br /><br />The familiar ingredients are there: the kitchen sink production, massive pop choruses, plenty of energy, and a wall of sound production.  As with IOH and FAD there are some left-field guest appearances, this time with the likes of Courtney Love and Elton John.  The songs are all ridiculously catchy and extremely well written.<br /><br />The bummer is that this has two of the absolute worst FOB songs I have ever heard, \\"The Mighty Fall\\" which is what I imagine Limp Bizkit would sound like if they added a heavy pop element to their music, and \\"Rat A Tat\\" which features horrifically bad vocals from Courtney Love and is just a crappy song overall.<br /><br />The rest though is just solid, fun FOB tunes that'll get the adrenaline flowing in no time.

B0096PAA6E|5.0|\\"Entertainment Weekly\\" has stated \\"Every Generation has it's Chosen One and Right Now, this is Clark's time\\". \\"The New York Times\\" has stated, Clark \\"May Be The Next Hendrix\\". \\"The Seattle Weekly\\" has called him, \\"a musical force to be reckoned with\\". Gary Clark Jr. is on the cover of the current issue of \\"Blues Revue\\" magazine(Issue #437), and on that cover \\"Blues Revue\\" states that Clark Jr.is \\"2013's Breakout Star\\". Also, included in this issue is the \\"cover story\\" on Clark Jr., and this new album \\"Blak And Blu\\". It includes an interview directly with Clark Jr. Also, on page 44, it states, \\"Guitarist Gary Clark Jr. is the most exciting thing to happen to the contemporary blues scene since fellow Texas gunslinger Stevie Ray Vaughan first Strolled out on a stage back in the early 1980's. I think Gary Clark Jr. is definitely the \\"hottest\\" new blues-rock guitarist & singer at the current time. Like many other reviewers, I first saw him perform on Eric Clapton's Guitar Festival 2010 DVD, where he performed \\"Bright Lights\\" and it was \\"awesome\\".<br /><br />Gary Clark Jr. was born & raised in Austin, Texas. Austin, Texas is a musicial \\"hot-bed\\". Austin, Texas has produced Blues-Rock greats such as Stevie Ray Vaughan & Jimmy Vaughan(originally from Dallas/moved to Austin), Doyle Bramhall, Doyle Bramhall II, Charlie Sexton, Eric Johnson, & many others. Also, Texas Blues-Rock legends include Albert Collins, Johnny Copeland, Doug Sahm, Johnny Winter, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and many, many others.<br /><br />Gary Clark Jr. who is only 29, is destined to be the next great Blues-Rock artist to come out of Texas, and this album \\"Blak And Blu\\" certainly proves why!!!!<br /><br />All the songs on this album were written by Gary Clark Jr. himself, with the exception of \\"Glitter Ain't Gold/Jumpin' For Nothin'\\" which was written by Clark Jr. and Doyle Bramhall II. Also, Clark does his great \\"take\\" on a comibination of the Jimi Hendrix Classic, \\"Third Stone From the Sun\\", mixed with\\"If you Love Me Like You Say\\",written by Little Johnny Taylor. This mix was recorded first by Texas Blues Great, Albert Collins. Stevie Ray Vaughan also recorded the \\"Hendrix Classic\\", \\"Third Stone From the Sun\\".<br /><br />Overall, this is one phenomenal, \\"landmark\\", awesome \\"debut\\" album, that will go down in history. Just think, Stevie Ray Vaughan released his highly acclaimed debut album \\"Texas Flood\\" 30 years ago, in 1983. Thirty years from now, I bet people will be looking back on this \\"debut\\" album by Clark Jr. as a \\"break-out\\" classic. I highly recommend this great new album by Gary Clark, Jr. Thanks, and I hope this review has been helpful.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I'm not gonna sit here and compare it to such great albums by the band, instead I'd like to mention how much I love every track and its lyrics in this album. I'm a big fan of the band and this album did not disappoint, I listen to it every day and I cannot get tired of it. It is a dark, Mellow album with some lyrics that still have me wondering &#34;what's going on with Dave Gahn?&#34; in songs like Heaven and Angel. I shouldn't mention that I scored some awesome seats for their concert with this Amazon purchace but that made me love it even more haha! Enjoy!
0761129235|5.0|I haven't read a self help book for years. A friend recommneded this and it lived up to it's recommendation. It doesn't lecture. It has a positive attitude throughout the book.  I love examples and this book is full of them. Not boring like so many self help books. It is easy to read. The small steps it recommends make sense and I have put some of them into practice.
B002GIZ8OW|4.0|I have been fortunate to have been involved in numerous martial arts (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Boxing, Wrestling, Krav Maga) and weapons systems (Fire arms, knives, Yawara sticks, Arnis, Bo-Jutsu, Jo-Jitsu, Hanbo-Jutsu, PR-24 Police baton and straight police batons) for more than sixty years of my life.  I personally believe one should ALWAYS be armed with some type of weapon that could  be used for self-defense purposes in an emergency situation.<br /><br /> The short stick, which is called by many names today, (Yawara, Persuader, Tactical pens, Kubaton, etc etc)is one of the most practical and legal tools one can carry in today's society.  Even though key chain holders can also be great self-defense tools, there is a draw-back.  They could be considered a weapon by some law enforcement authorities, which could develop into a legal problem.  For example, when flying or going into a court room, a key chain holder like the Persuader Baton or Kubaton etc, would probably be confiscated by authorities.  However, this Cold Steel Mini-Felt Pen is merely a pen made out of hard plastic and would not be considered a weapon.<br /><br />I have bought, used and carried several of the Cold Steel Felt Pen models over the years.  This one is a little shorter than the full size Cold Steel felt pen, but I found this pen to be easy to carry as well as being an excellent writing tool .  I also test all my weapons and I found this one to be rugged and durable after pounding it full power numerous times on my wooden desk.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are seeking a simple and effective pen you can also use as an emergency self-defense tool you may want to check out this Cold Steel Mini-Pen.  However, I strongly suggest that you receive some practical Yawara Stick training from a competent instructor before carrying any type of short stick weapon.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Co-Author: Use of the Yawara Stick for Law Enforcement 2nd Edition Univ. of Illinois Press)

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I had read some of the reviews here on Amazon and the bad ones troubled me-one author didn't like this movel and didn't like the last one either.  He gave specific reasons, but when he mentioned the prior one I realized he was dead wrong.  Reachwe ahould have words with him.<br /><br />I immediately knew I had to read this one and that the reviewer had not done a good job reading the latest Lee Childs masterpiece.<br /><br />This a very typical Reacher novel - suspenseful, full of tension, 4 dimensional thinking and shooting lots of holes through lots of bad guys. Very enjoyable. A very good read.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize, but just mention this one Reacher quote from the book - &#34;the meaning of life is that it ends&#34;.  Imagine Reacher with a jammed gun and two guys 10 feet away ready to end him.  Is this the end of Reacher?  Read the book to find out.<br /><br />My only issue with this book is that I have fired over 60 rounds from my Glock with a few minutes and hundreds over an entire target session without ever having a jam - Reacher should not have had that gun jam.  That doesn't happen to Glocks.

1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson tells the story of the fight between the isolationists and the interventionists in the months leading up the the entry of the US into WWII.  This detailed history reads like a novel.<br />On the isolationist side, the author has rightly centered her story around Charles Lindbergh.  Lindbergh's character and personality is revealed through his wife Anne'e writings and the diaries of other family members and friends.  He is really a fascinating character.  All of the characteristics that made his so successful in aviation - independence, self assuredness, even arrogance were all of the wrong traits to make him successful in political discourse.  Because of the issues around his sons kidnapping and death and the intense publicity that surrounded him in the US he relocated to Europe in the 1930s and became enamoured with the regimented and controlled life in Nazi Germany.  There were a few other interesting characters on the isolationist side, including some senior US military (George Marshall, Hap Arnold) and young intellectuals like John F. Kennedy, Sarge Shriver, and Brewster King.  While the debate between the two groups started in a high minded way, the isolationist's soon attracted all kinds of crazies (radical Catholics, Communists, racial purists, Jew haters) to their cause and the debate sank to new lows (sound familiar today).<br /><br />The interventionist story is centered around FDR and those advisers (Stimson, Know) who supported the British cause.  FDR is portrayed as uncharacteristically reluctant to voice support for the interventionist cause.  What I found interesting was the role played by individual citizens in promoting the selective service act and the provision of military equipment to Britain.  Additionally the British ambassador to the US, Lord Lothian was a truly heroic character, actually sacrificing his health and life to work promoting the British cause to Americans.<br /><br />I liked this book but not nearly as much as two earlier WWII books the author had - Citizens of London, and A Question of Honor.  I think the subject matter dealt with here was just less exciting that either the war in Britain or the story of the Polish aviators.  Nonetheless this is a significant book telling an important story in a very readable way.ier WWII books the author had - Citizens of London, and A Question of Honor.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|This is one of the more interesting and imaginative films I have seen in my recent tour of more or less current, more or less science fiction, movies. Somewhat to my surprise the television news approach combined with the 'seeing it as it is' element, makes for an exciting reality reported in the impersonal (and, often, necessarily ignorant) mass media manner. The movie-makers and some/many in the audience, may see this as a political parable but I chose to see it as what it purported to be. One does have a choice.<br />The story pertains to a group of aliens who  have come on a spaceship which ran out of fuel. Entered by representatives of a nation (no real names, please, save that the city was called Johannesburg ) over which the spaceship hovered, the aliens were found starving, but harmless. Over a period of twenty years, they were segregated in one big camp in the City, where they multiplied, were fed and housed by charitable organizations, but gradually became an object of fear and disdain because of their impact on the surrounding city. It was decided to ship them to a new camp well outside the city's borders. The story picks up at this point. that is, with the focus on the officially appointed director of the effort being photographed by movie camera's for  publicity, showing the benign nature of the resettlement. I think it best for me not to go beyond this point, because the story sounds more Wes Craven horror, than the pseudo-realistic movie it is.<br />Recommendation: For anyone who does not want foul language to be heard by children,  friends or themselves, steer clear. The f...word is much used. For those who like realistic pseudo-science, this production should be enjoyable. For the general viewer, it is more likely to be entertaining than not; many will find the thread continuing interest breaking.
0425220931|5.0|On the surface,  \\"The Music Lesson\\" appears to be about Victor Wooten's evolution from bass player to musician, but in fact it's a distillation of Wooten's philosophy and understanding of music.  And the lessons he shares with us are valuable and inspiring for any aspiring musician or music-lover.  This book is more parable than memoir, but the truth is that it works in delivering its message across.<br /><br />At twenty five years old, Victor Wooten is a struggling musician in Nashville.  Since the age of two, Victor has been playing the bass guitar, and is accomplished in both the technique and theory of the guitar.  But he can't seem to find his groove, and he struggles to pay.  That's when Michael randomly shows up in his life, and begins to explain the essence of music to Victor.  Instead of breaking music down to its constituent parts -- scale, chords, notes, etc. -- Michael advises Victor to understand music as a world onto itself, and that the playing of the bass guitar is about bringing life into this world -- and so music should emanate from the heart and soul, not from the fingers and guitar.  Specifically, Michael wants Victor to understand ten principles:  notes, articulation, technique, feel, dynamics, rhythm, tone, phrasing, space, and listening.  And once Victor comes to understand these principles he not only becomes a great musician (whereas before he was just a good bass player) but he starts spreading Michael's gospel as well.<br /><br />Victor Wooten speaks music's truth, and the way he spins his tale is delightful.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|I really like the information in this book.  It got me thinking alot about Law of Attraction and such.

B00511ONPG|2.0|I bought this book on my kindle based upon the reviews on this site. You'd think this book was some kind of revelation that would change your social media approach permanently based on the reviews. The Facebook ad section was my favorite part of the book and we're currently utilizing a couple of the formats in a test this month. But, this book is average, nothing special at all in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm now very wary of books like this one that have almost nothing but 5-stars and half of the reviews refer to the author by first name...because they usually know them. I have nothing against the book but I'd caution that this book is NOT a game changer in the social media space. In fact, social media in general is proving to be a lot more hype than a realistic way to drive revenue in a company. We all rushed out to \\"social media\\" because nobody wanted to be left behind in the coming avalanche of revenue generated with this new phenomenon...and frankly, this book is a perfect example of a lot of noise without much substance behind it.<br /><br />An OK book that will likely do very little for your business. And I expect the \\"fans of the author\\" to come running to tell me how wrong I am. But, a book long on marketing hype and short on real revelation.

B00C5ZORES|4.0|I haven't had an album drag me singing along in quite a while. It's strong from start to end, and there are some very notable punches here that make this album a catch.<br /><br />Patrick Stump's delivery on every song is Uuuuhmazing (and determined to drag you into singing along). Pete Wentz is surprisingly in the forefront with a much stronger, slightly more complex baseline than I am used to hearing from him. Andy really brings the driving beat that makes all of these songs so catchy I almost don't know what I'm doing with myself trying to drive and sing and stomp my feet at the same time. What I am missing, is Joe's guitar; I have trouble digging them out of the synth. It's there, it's just a bit anemic in the mix.<br /><br />The first two singles are so powerful as to be no brainers on likes. But the song that ends up sticking in my head with the tenacity of a patch full of burrs is \\"Where Did the Party Go\\".<br /><br />The genre ride on this album can be a bit whiplash worthy between some songs, namely through the middle, where it goes from Adele-ish blues to gritty dirty hip hop/rock trips, to a straight up Blondie punk disco run, to dirty rock with dubstep punch, to a ukelele-esque sing along. To me, it keeps it fresh, interesting, and keeps me from turning on the shuffle. It's already there!<br /><br />Rat A Tat has great drive, and Joe's guitars are finally there for me to listen to. Courtney Love's speak is interesting, but kinda muddles the song in the end.<br /><br />Oddly enough, Save Rock and Roll is the one song I could do without on this album.<br /><br />Final thoughts? Do you like singing along with your music? FOB has that covered! Has it saved rock and roll? Depends on your definition of rock and roll (maybe it will save pop, because that is a wasteland at this point).

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|My husband & I both love this flick, he quotes it regularly so in turn my adult children know this movie as well as we do!<br />I would highly suggest this movie be watched with a friend/spouse, it is enjoyed better w/commentary & discussion!
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|Lots of fun. I still like snark buster series better, but this is close to it. Great for passing time. Not too hard, storyline was good. And I never got bored through it. Totally worth buying.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the most interesting books. It definitely opened my eyes and made me rethink what I wanted in life and marriage. I believe every male and female should read this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome because you get to move. That's way better than the original minecraft on my kindle fire. So that's why I posted my title as BEST GAME EVER!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I liked it a lot, because it had a lot of things that were tiny mistakes that we usually do daily. He points them out and tells us how to make it better so thank you Peter W. Murphy, for you had helped me extremely. I am not a shy person but sometimes we deal with small situations that don't allow us to do it right and to be able to talk to a person New or not,  keep the conversation, maintain it etc. One of the thousands of things we do that this book tells us how to do better is our lack of confidence, lack of self esteem,  and so on.<br />So in other words I should just say that if your shy or not it doesn't matter, because it helps to every type of person
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good ending to a trilogy...sad it's over! I would've never guessed that it would end that way! Read it...I hope that they can convey this on film with perfection!
B008RLTUUA|5.0|The information in this book is absolutely necessary for anyone contemplating or taking a drug, or whose loved one is contemplating or taking a drug.  It is incredible how our current sick-care system has so many problems, but one of the most frightening is the fact that NO ONE BUT THE DRUG COMPANIES can know (and then, only sort of) what the real effects might be--both beneficial and potentially harmful--of any drug.  The complete failure, from the probably naive points of view of safety and efficacy, of the drug-development system from Step 1 through delivery to a patient is phenomenal.  The fact that prescribing doctors can never know the real history, and thus potential impact on you, of a particular drug was illuminating.  Yes, the author repeats several messages, but with this kind of message I didn't mind.  His writing is direct, succinct, lively and engaging.  He is careful to document and cite references.  Even if 50% of what he writes is inaccurate (and I have no reason to believe it is), most drug development today is a crime.  We need the civil rights movement that Otis Brawley recommends in reforming the delivery of \\"health care\\", in which every citizen works for reform.
B0095T3ES2|5.0|I loved this movie! I really didn't hear much about it but I'm so glad I watched it. Funny, sweet, and creative. Definitely worth the time to watch it! Sad that it didn't get noticed more because it deserves it!
B006PGL7OQ|1.0|We need a new edition of this Bluray, I can't believe they release a region A Bluray without Spanish subtitles! Region A is for the American Continent! They need Spanish subtitles!<br /><br />Release another edition!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is so  fun depending in troops and killing things from long distances I will probably like the second one :)
B00BKBCF38|1.0|This band is a joke. This album is watered down Mercyful Fate meets Blue Oyster Cult posturing. Soft, weak vocals, dimestore Satanism and garage band rhythm section. This is NOT METAL. If you think it is you're a moron.<br /><br />There's no way this band would be popular without the silly image. It's soft rock with a dumb satanic backdrop. Their first album at least had some punch. This is watered down piffle for the easily impressed and emotionally immature (think it's cool because they talk about Satan. Yeah that's original!)
B007T967X4|5.0|This app is good for gutair players ( like me ) to practice notes if you need to.<br /> I memorize songs fast and my teacher wants me to look at the notes<br />So this app is good for people like me
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Hidden object games with a story are some of my favorite time wasters!  Works well with touch screen, no bad clicks.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Short review. So it was really the quality of the print that is reviewed. Blue ray, five stars, Nuff said.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|It's okay but I don't really play it because it is just not my style of game.  However if you like bubbleshooters then you will probably like this.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Keeps the mind working! Just when I'm about to give up, I stumble across the solution. Can be quite the challenge:)
B0091REZMW|4.0|I absolutely luv this game. its hard 2 find good games any more. but this game is awesome. totally luv this game.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Willie Nelson<br />\\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\"<br />(Sony Legacy, 2013)<br /><br />Approaching his 80th birthday(!) Willie goes back to the well and explores the great American songbook again, with Tin Pan Alley standards and other pop oldies... This record isn't as lush or as large as his \\"Stardust\\" album, but the rough edges and prominent twang are heartwarming and welcome to fans... As always, Willie's unusual, idiosyncratic jazz-influenced timing and quirky phrasing won't appeal to everybody, but if you're on his wavelength you'll feel pretty fondly about this album. For me, it's all about the repertoire, and standout tracks include \\"Twilight Time\\" and \\"Walking My Baby Back Home\\" (those great old songs that everyone in your great-grandmother's generation knew, once upon a time...) along with the mournful \\"I Wish I Didn't Love You So,\\" and \\"Is The Better Part Over,\\" one of Willie's old compositions given new life in this melancholy rendition. Happy birthday, Willie! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|An excellent accurate and complete history of the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.  I lived through it.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Witty and warm. Snarky and clever. With just a HINT of ponies. That's Veronica Mars.<br /><br />The combination of smart writing and a terrific cast just keeps me coming back to this funny, dark, noir tale. On the one hand we have rich kids Jake and Logan, the 09ers. On the other end of the spectrum is Weevil, Wallace, and the other disenfranchised students at Neptune HS. And smack dab in the middle is Veronica (and her dad), keeping this whole universe spinning on its axis. Keith Mars used to be the town sheriff, till he got booted. And the apple, as they say, doesn't fall far from the tree. Everyone at school knows that is you have a problem, Veronica specializes in making it go away.<br /><br />While there's not a vampire to be seen, this show is easily the successor to Buffy. Its got a tight cast, marvelous biting humor, and great stories. Not sure what took me so long to look into it. Don't make the same mistake. Enjoy the DVDs, then sit back and wait. Its fanbase has funded a movie for this cancelled TV show. And if we're all lucky, there may just be ponies.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|A truly horrible and boring film. Full of hate, brutiality, and graphic violence to no good end. Painful to watch, as it keeps getting worse and worse, if possible. Save yourself from a horrific experience.<br /><br />south
B00B5A9FOG|3.0|However the fifth season missed many opportunities.  I enjoyed the overall series but I think the wriiers were tired by this season  and I had hoped for so much more. Quality of the DVD was great - had Bluray delivery was as promised Thanks Amazon.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A great and fun book<br /> So read it enjoy the book and funny best book and I hope you do to
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Engaging story that touched your heart. James upbringing was so sad. I'm glad the ending was a happy one and he found a family. I didn't expect that Lily would become his sister that he believed had died. I will be happy to recommend this book to my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey was great!  I was so happy I watched season 2 on my Kindle.  I was able to go from episode to episode right away, not having to wait.  I love the characters and all the story lines.  Love Downton Abbey!!
