B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this app for hours and hours .I feel like I am in heaven you should get it.To me it is the  better version of Subway Surfers.I am sure you will love it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very fun and love the challenges. Wish that earning diamonds was a little easier and rooms didn't take so much energy. Overall I have enjoyed the game.
B000SQMLAS|5.0|this is an epic album.  This album alone would make its artist a legend....the fact that it came from a man who had already been a Beatle just cements his legend more permanently.  George was always my favorite beatle, and this album is the best of all the beatles solo releases (in my opinion) it is such a statement that the &#34;junior&#34; partner could have a double albums worth of material!  The third disc is unimportant jams musically, but interesting because the sessions for the jams yielded &#34;Derek and the Dominoes&#34; which of course put out one of the best blues rock albums of the 70's.<br /><br />Every song on this album has its own merits. The songwriting is top notch and here Spectors wall of sound fits well.<br /><br />I really love this album and was incredibly joyous to finally get it on vinyl
B00AB7HESI|4.0|it is one of the best apps ive ever had but it took like freaking 5 minutes to download. other than that awesome app
B000P6FXPQ|5.0|this was my first experience with the beatles.....i was in grade school when the album came out, and I have always loved it.  It does sound a bit dated at times, but that owes more to the production than anything else.  all-in-all one of my all time favorite feel good albums.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I can never put his books down.  I love the play he does on fact, fiction, and history.  This book will have you wanting more!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Is not well explain how to use the device can't get it to work having a hard time trying to figure it out
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really like the graphics and found it very entertaining. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to kill time with some addicting game play
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome very fun when you're bored gets a little hard when u keep going but awesome
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've read a few other reviews, and I've found that there is a wide difference of opinion amongst readers.  I'm leaving a review, if for no other reason than the fact that I seem to be the only one who had never heard of John Green before picking up this novel.  The people who didn't care for this seem to be pitting it against his other works.  This is something that doesn't apply to me and my experience with this story.<br /><br />I think the characters were terribly endearing, and also really realistic.  Not every teenager thinks and speaks the way that they do, but there are a fair number who do.  And, in my experience, kids with cancer or other such illnesses are much more mature than their peers, simply because they are dealing with things that no kid should even have to know about, and they don't get the opportunity to experience that sense of carefree invincibility that most of us do as children.  I don't know how anyone can read this and not fall in love with the main characters in this book.<br /><br />What really made me a fan of this book was that it was such a fast read, and I rarely put it down.  It isn't like there are cliffhangers at every turn; that would be a case of \\"I couldn't put it down.\\"  In reality, I just didn't want to.  And, it completely changed the way I look at people with terminal illness.  It isn't like I had previously thought badly of them or anything, I just really hadn't been inside their heads.  I don't know where the author gets his knowledge of such things, but it seemed very genuine.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this is a very sad book, which seems weird since I spent lots of time smiling and laughing throughout.  I highly recommend this to everyone!
B008B68IEA|5.0|The bed was really cute and she put one of dolls on it.She cant wait till xmas comesso she can get more things from monster high.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Super addictive game! Starts of really easy and the difficulty intensifies at a nice gradual pace. Very good game. Worth the download.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Incompatible with LG Nexus 4, please explain, this is unacceptable. What devices does this game work on can you tell me, WTF
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|DeNiro, Liotta, Pesci. Do you need a whole lot more? This is one of my favorite mob movies and is based on a true story. I remember reading about the Lufthansa heist when I was in school. A guy that lived on my block was arrested for some minor part in the heist.
0062255657|5.0|This is a wonderful book, pure Neil Gaiman. Worth the read, which won't take long because you won't want to put it down.
B00742GBDM|5.0|This is my favorite version of Mansfield Park by far. Frances O'Connor played Fanny perfectly! I would love it if someone would come up with some sequence movies based on the Jane Austen books!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Loved Hosseini former books but this was just simply boring. This book is filled with wonderful writing, but it just simply could not hold my interest.  Each section jumped around characters, situations, and time so it was confusing at times especially if you stop and start reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Even if you can't have a real pet for one reason or another, this works good to teach responsiblity and pride.  It teaches about coordinations and such,too.  And I will not lie, I like to play on it as well.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|I bought the CD as a gift for my husband who is a Blackmore's night fan. I can't tell you how excited he was to open it.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I last saw the movie when I was the age of most of the Goonies, about 12 or 13. I remembered it being suspenseful and fun. Watching it as a dad, now, with my 11 and 9 year olds - it held up wonderfully, but I forgot how much cursing the kids did, and the adult double entendres had completely gone over my head when I was younger! My kids giggled at the kids cursing, knowing that is verboten by kids, and were scared at the right times, relieved and happy for them at the end.<br />Joe Donner did a nice job with this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best .must buy! It is the closest thing to minecraft I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B005ZMUXDC|3.0|I enjoyed this very much! Lots of classic Disney touches - gorgeous animation, adorable human and animal interactions, lovable romantic leads etc.  Touching in some parts too, and an insight from Rapunzel that a lot of seekers will resonate with. Songs were just ok and not on par with Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast. But, great dialogue, very watchable and a nice wholesome family movie.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Using an Amazon Apps program, Kindle for Android would not install on my daughters Kyros Android tablet.  The several attempts to get it to load ate up a couple of hours.  That said, I was able to install a version from a non-Amazon site (freewarelover.com like others have done).
B00992CF6W|5.0|So worth buying I already made a castle get it quick but downside is that you can't make a game on kindle
0783234996|5.0|Love Robin Williams. Have watched the movie many times. I had a VHS but it got stuck in my player and  getting it out the tape broke. I ordered anothe one because my grand son and I  watch it a lot.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The characters, writing, and story lines suck you right in. Everything is full, rich, and neatly sewn up. I want to read all of Liane Moriarty's books!
B003QJME5G|5.0|The Fan Controller-FC6 Black is one of the best I've owned yet. Much better than the Scythe Kaze Master Ace with more features. I really like the option to change colors to match your setup. I choose Red and its pretty cool. Another nice feature that was a seller for me is the braided fan and molex cables. The sensors are not braided for those of you that like a clean look but they are easy to sleeve. I would recommend this product and buy another if needed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book has an amazing set of characters and a unique concept. You will be hard pressed to set it aside.  A great story that is incredibly well written. I read it on the Kindle and did not want to see it end. All the makings of a classic.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel, the first book in the Old Kingdom Trilogy, is set in two worlds - polar opposites of each other. In one, a bygone-era style world, electricity is common, science is advancing and the laws of physics rule supreme. In the other, electricity and technology fails. Magic is common, and dark forces are moving. This is a story about worlds colliding, about the decline of a monarchy, and understanding the nature of loss.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the story. Loved the characters.  Absolute page turner!  My first time reading anything by this author.  I highly recommend.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Good book. It will take much mental flexibility for people of faith -it all about the power of positive energy and thinking. Creat you on reality.
B00ERWZYX0|5.0|I lucked out and found Catty Noir at my local Walmart store for a reasonable price. She is very cool. I love her outfit, including her silver boots. Her black skin is striking against her bright pink outfit and hair. She has a microphone in her hands, as she is a singer. She will be an excellent addition to my daughter's collection. I'm saving her for a Christmas present, but I know my daughter will be thrilled. She's not scheduled to be in stores until September 13, but look for her now, because she's out there. Happy hunting!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I thought it was a mahjong game.  not too sure I like this.  I had to use the hints on everything.  Not really much fun.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This kit got my mini-maglite working again, after the original upgrade LED lite failed, and batteries corroded the original switch.
B000VR824S|5.0|Little to say here but WOW - what a cast, what playing, and to see it in Blue-Ray with high bandwidth sound in 1080p video is almost too much - I have to take it in time slices, and each time I listen, I hear more and more that is imbedded.<br /><br />Advisory:  this is my third set of these.  I have loaned the other two out, and they do not come back.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I don't even like computer games but I couldn't test myself away. It was ready enough not to get crushed frustrated, but challenging enough to keep me glued for two days. Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote on my phone, laptop and kindle. I tried a number of other similar apps before I found Evernote only to find that they were too simplistic or complicated, took up too much acreage, unable to sync within the program on other devices, cost a bundle...the list goes on. Additionally, it is easy to install and easy to personalize.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Great movie with another great twist to it.  Didn't expect the ending and great CGI for a Tom Cruise movie.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|A bit heavy on using words that start with &#34;n&#34;, but overall very good.  I would definitely recommend watching it without the kids.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie had an unexpected twist and it had you guessing all the way to the end.  However, the same day I bought it, it was available at Redbox for one dollar.  I think I will check out Redbox a little more often.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This clock has one of the most beautiful designs that you will see.  It works well, all the functions were operational.  I had no complaints until my anti-virus software alerted me that it contained malware and needed to be removed immediately.  What a shame, it had a very alluring appeal.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Great cover. Exaxctly what I had expected it would be. Would recommend d to anyone. Ridgid yet soft and comfortable in your hands.

B00CS65QGW|4.0|Love Pharrell and all of his creativity with music. He has been around for awhile and it is good to see him out in the spotlight again.
1118156307|4.0|A reference book as good as they get. If you are going to engage in service design constantly you need this book, if you are just starting to study service design you need this book. Dont expect any deep insights or a-ha! moments but this book offers a comprehensive list of tools and methods and will always have something to offer while you are designing services. There are some issues with the layout but the richness of content compensates them.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy set up.  Able to watch netfix, youtube and other streaming from laptop with minimal set up.  Only downside is that there is a power cable that needs to be attached either to TV usb port or power outlet.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Eric Kripke really created a show to last!!! And as each season passes you see how much better each actor gets, the bond that has formed between them.  They have become brothers in real life as well. We all know blood doesn't always make family. Each season seems to get better and better. My only complaint is can't they keep a strong female around for a while?
080701429X|5.0|While some of the book's content might be a little outdated for an individual having lived most of her life in the 21st century; it offers the reader an insightful, detailed account into the mind of a person having gone through what can be accounted for as the worst experience in Human History. It's moving, to say the least, and it makes you think about life, and rethink it. Beautiful.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander writes very persuasively about the afterlife.  It seems a bit generic; however, given the nature of the topic, how can anyone offer proof?  The experience of his life journey into the afterlife shows a certain spiritual development which made me want to read for more.  I especially enjoyed the parts where he writes about meeting a sister whom he did not even know existed.  Her ability to show him around and relate to him on a personal level gave me some insight into the other books that I have been reading.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|This movie was so raved about and honestly I gave it my best shot, 30 minutes into it I was ready to call it quits. At 44 minutes I had all I could take. Robert Pattinson has amazing acting abilities, maybe the movie got better and showed those. However after 44 minutes, I felt like I had wasted enough money to purchase a nice pizza, and am stuck with a movie that made him look like an idiot for taking the script. This helped remind me however that if critics rave about a movie, it is going to suck. Listen to the people.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun game, a little different from the other games like it. Definitely a good game to play in your free time.
B008469DGY|5.0|Out of the possible choices, those being one, two, three, four, or five stars, I would prefer to give this app a 5-star rating.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|A fun game. You can choose your difficulty depending on how good you are. Sometimes you can't win, and it can take awhile for the app to stop the game, but you can do it yourself if you really want to.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|Bought this for our nephew and it is safe to say it is his new &#34;go-to&#34; toy. Thick durable plastic with realistic coloring, it's durable for any rough and tumble kid!
B00393SFU2|5.0|To classify M as a simple melodrama, or a thriller, or a crime drama would be to underestimate it. Fritz Lang's M is, at parts, tremendously funny. At others, it is immensely disturbing and psychological. But always M holds us in it's grasp; riveting, gripping, and brilliant.<br /><br />One of the first films about a serial killer, released before that term had even become popular, M didn't just give us one of the most compelling and twisted villains in cinematic history, it makes us identify and perhaps even sympathize with him. The impact of M cannot be understated, as it gave us one of the Golden Age of Hollywood's greatest character actors: Peter Lorre (Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon), popularized police procedurals and serial killers in cinema, and influenced countless other famous filmmakers with it's brilliant expressionist cinematography and visual style.<br /><br />Though the plot is blindingly simple (A child-hunting serial killer holds Berlin in terror and paranoia. When the police's methods get increasingly desperate and dangerous for underground criminal bosses to sit easy, they send out their own men to apprehend the murderer. Finally, the killer is marked and followed...), M is a complex film that still resonates within our day and age, with it's subtle commentary on our modern society. It's final message (\\"Someone must watch over the children\\") is a little forceful, but Lang get's his message across with haunting effectiveness. I think this is a movie we need more than ever today.<br /><br />Of course, most praise should go to Peter Lorre, who before his role as baby-faced serial killer Hans Beckert was mainly known as a song-and-dance man. After? He was shot to international fame and became one of Hollywood's most sought after actors. The praise is hugely deserved. Lorre gets under your skin and stays there for a long, long time. As Beckert he is unbelievably creepy - Lorre's mirror scene will send chills up your spine, and the sight of his face illuminated by a flashlight like a deer in the headlights is unsettling on a psychological level. But it is in Lorre's electrifying final scene that he establishes himself as one of cinema's greatest actors. And this is his greatest performance. His final speech is one of the most compelling, disturbing, and gripping scenes I have scene in any cinema. Top marks for the true simmering intensity lying under that mask of pudgy innocence. This is one for the ages.<br /><br />I want to touch on just one more thing: the stunning visuals. You really shouldn't expect any less from Fritz Lang - this is the megalomaniacal genius that gave us cinema's first sci-fi - Metropolis. But the film is full of arresting imagery of almost startling clarity and beauty. Scenes and shots linger long in the mind after they are seen, and the cinematography (shadows, lights, and darks especially) is the kind that directors dream about in their sleep. But as I said before, this is FRITZ LANG we are talking about!<br /><br />In conclusion, I can only say: _watch_ M. A classic, but still relevant today, M is a showcase for a peerless and haunting performance from Peter Lorre as one of cinema's most twisted and chilling villains, brilliant visuals, and with a sharp plot, dark humor, satire, and subtle social commentary...this is one of the GREATEST films in foreign cinema. Ever. 10/10.uminated by a flashlight like a deer in the headlights is unsettling on a psychological level.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I can honestly say it was one of the best, if not the best, books I've ever read. Beautifully written, The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most moving books ever written. John Green has created a masterpiece

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|On kindle fire, level 21, and still can not get any friends.  What is wrong with this picture?  Why can't G5 Entertainment add social interaction to the game?<br /><br />Dec 2, 2013.  I'm now on level 65 on the kindle fire.  No friends no new photos to research.  When will there be an update to add all of this.  I missed out on the Halloween update that my wife got on the IPAD.  Am I going to miss out on the Christmas update also?  Am I going to have to purchase an IPAD just so I can play updated versions of this game (Secret Society, Hidden Mystery).  Let me know, someone, please.

B00EDF43MY|3.0|This one is a little difficult for a 2 year old. Difficult.  It's hard to understand what to touch to make this app work. My grandson doesn't like it that much.
B002MGIIZE|4.0|Interesting movie, you never quite know what is real and what is delusion. I recommend it. Funny and sensitive. A must see.
0380713802|5.0|This is the book that made me drop.everything and travel to Europe. No one skewers tourists like Bill Bryson. If you ever had that urge to run off into the sunset I couldn't recommend this book enough!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I got this set for my husband's birthday. He has enjoyed it soooo much! He had a Smallville marathon. Great choice.

B0000041LL|5.0|This integral of the Beethoven string quartets is simply best by best. The interpretation is majestic. The sound very beautiful. All wrapped in a warm and lyrical atmosphere. There are many other great and comprehensive this work. But this is simply a must. The price, quality, very good. The presentation is very good, in the typical cardboard box to a small but accompanying explanatory booklet. If you like Beethoven string quartets, do not hesitate.

B003NX76BM|5.0|One of her best. Enough suspense with romance and mystery all balanced for a wonderful read. Definitely recommending this to all the Nora Roberts fans. She amazes us with each new adventure.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|The price to purchaces hours of reading enjoyment was just too attractive to bypass. Conan Doyle's dectective is great - insufferable, but almost always right.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Great read about a young man's journey into the wild in which he never returned but raises the question of did he ever intend to ?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I gave The Husband's Secret five stars because I could not stop reading. I had to know what was happening next.<br /><br />I will definitely read more books by Liane Moriarty.
0064471837|5.0|I was in 7th grade when I first stumbled onto Sabriel. That was 13 years ago and I have read it every year at least once sometimes twice. This book never stops giving and has the endless reread ability of a true classic. Even as the seasons of my life changed the books depth changed in its reading. The timeless tales of good versus evil and love versus duty course through this novel and its companions like life blood. Though given little time, few weapons, and a thread of hope, good does prevail. These books eventual triumph over adversity is what makes them so great. I recommend them highly as a perminant fixture in anyone's library.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Good story. A very richly imagined fantasy world with interesting characters and plot. I am looking forward to the next one but can't really comprehend how the author will manage to wrap up the story in just one more book.
1451626096|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I think this is my favorite of the series. With other Phillipa Gregory books it took several chapters before I really got into the story, but with The White Princess I was hooked from the beginning.<br /><br />The White Princess follows Elizabeth Princess of York as she enters a loveless marriage with Henry the VII. Her husband and her mother in law do not trust her as Henry the VII fights the people's loyalty towards the last remaining members of her family, the Yorks. Elizabeth must choose between her divided loyalties. She must choose between her husband and the pretender to the thrown which she believes is her brother.<br /><br />I found the subject matter very interesting and I am very eager to read more about Richard III, the two princes in tower, and Perkin Warbeck.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Heart-wrenching, thoughtul, and uplifting, all at once. A brilliant work of magical realism.<br /><br />The sense of infinite possibility and wonder, and the subtle cosmology, match my sense of how the universe is put together. I feel at once inspired and daunted - to put my own youthful memories of magic into words.<br /><br />I only gave four stars because the ebook opens after the epigraph by default - a simple enough error to fix, this appears to be common in Kindle books and no fault of the author. But the book is made even better by that opening quote, and I hope that you my reader might learn from my experience (and you as well, dear Amazon). If they have not yet fixed it when your copy arrives, go back a few pages to get the full effect.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Although this book totally creeped me out (particularly the photos), it is may favorite read of 2013! I can't wait for Book 2!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app works well.  Helpful for planning daily activities. Liked it enough to download after restoring my kindle.  Count on weather updates.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this game. Fun and easy! Wish things would cost less but you do move quickly through the levels.
B008220D7S|4.0|My wife and I loved this movie. Found it funny and could relate well. True to life. The title sums it up! Although the younger crowd my not find it very funny and hard to relate to.
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|This app does what it says it does and includes a clean, good looking user interface.  However, it doesn't really offer anything that most if not all music players already have and with a price tag rivaling that of the music players themselves it simply doesn't add up.<br /><br />If you're looking for an app with features and the best sound you've ever heard come out of your device, look up Viper4Android (V4A) on xda-developers.com [and it's FREE!].
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoy playing this game and building my own city. I do not enjoy having to post to Facebook to level up or having to purchase items with real money in order to level up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Quite a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming. A quick and easy read.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Great show! Love the story line but enough already with the graphic sex! It should be renamed &#34;Fighting and F@&$ing.&#34;
B005IQZB14|5.0|In the beginning, I closed the book twice thinking that i couldn't read this book. There was too much pain in the author's writing and some of her experiences reminded me of my own.  However, due to my sister's glowing review, I opened the book again and found myself unable to put it down, at times even thinking about her experiences and how much strength she had to do all the things she did at her age.  This is a book I highly recommend and think that I could open it again in the future.  What a journey!
B004OEMRGI|5.0|I first saw this cat on a show that comes out on Palladia, live with Jules Holland, he blew me away with his hypnotic rhythm on the title cut &#34;My Love&#34; Bombino has guitar chops that are reminiscent of Santana of the 70's, Hendrix attack on  guitar and John Lee hooker big blues swing. This guys is just starting and he has put the rest of the guitar world on notice. It is so refreshing to her this type of music coming from these region. it only goes to show why the Stone, Zep and The Beatles were influenced by this desert music. I just wish more of this music could be played on rock stations than some of the other stuff that sound so repeated now over the air waves. Hey, if you want to spend a few good $ on some genuine and heart felt music, then pick up a copy, slap it into you CD player and crank it up!!
B007ZB06OW|5.0|if you are over 8 and have some general idea about building model kit, this is perfect kit.<br />whether you are beginner or novice, you will like this model kit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Reminds me of a game I played a few years ago on a pc. Enjoyable if a little annoying at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so much fun! First played on friends ipad and now got it on moms kindle works great :)
B00ESY77LO|1.0|So, I had purchased TV shows for streaming from Amazon in HD before and had no problem watching them from a PC that is connected to my living room TV. I had assumed that the situation would be the same with this (and any movie). However, this was not the case. As far as I can tell, the only way to watch it in HD is by using a Kindle Fire HD (even though they don't actually say that, there aren't many devices that can have Silverlight and aren't a PC). I should have spent the extra few bucks and just watched it on demand through my cable company instead of dealing with this mess.
0060839872|5.0|I have to keep replacing this book, as when I lend it out, it seems I rarely get it back.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is such a well-done PBS series. I can't wait to see the next season. I hope they continue for years.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the story and the acting is fantastic. I think that the setting and period clothes make this story wonderful.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does NOT perform as advertised. The ONLY thing it does is YouTube and Netflix, if you have an account. The advertisement stated 3 free months of Netflix which did not happen. .ALSO, the box clearly states, &#34; Send video OR anything on the WEB to your TV from your smartphone, tablet or laptop'. This also does NOT happen. VERY disappointed in this product!!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I love it ;love it; love it. I have to concentrate and it really keeps my focus. I have. to plan a strategy before I begin. and I love the colors.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Typical Hollywood action movie.  Would have given two but there were few good amazing action scenes - mountain fight scene
B003B02O7I|5.0|Loved this book, one of my favorite Grisham novels. Nate and Rachel were great characters and I was sorry to see the story come to an end.
B005WBBYXO|3.0|Yes, I understand what the book was about. But really of course if your going to rip a hole in the wall between over worlds, bad stuff happens.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|There needs to be options, like the ability to change app screen location and the ability to hide and or remove the notification icon.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee is so brave for writing this book. She did not hold back when telling her story. Definitely a great read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What fun to revisit season 3, before season 4 comes out.  Sad ending though, eagerly awaiting season 4 next Jan.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Well-acted, directed, incredible movie. The visual effects were stunning and cgi is seamless. It's fantastic to see this come to life
B0002EXH5O|4.0|hell yeah this album is good.<br /><br />i LOVE that the bass guitar is so audible,<br />mixed so well, and actually has parts that are different than the guitars.<br /><br />this was maybe reactionary,<br />in response to albums like metallica's \\"and justice for all\\"<br />(which has bass guitar but its so down in the mix<br />its basically two guitars panned l-r w drums in the middle)<br />and to me is a genius move that gives the music a timeless quality.<br /><br />the real killer is the songs you might not hear about as often<br />(five magics, poison was the cure, lucretia)<br />as the hits<br />(holy wars...the punishment due, hangar 18, tornado of souls)<br />but all the songs are dead-on grand slam home runs<br />as far as sound, energy, and execution;<br />and speaking of..<br /><br />THE SOLOS!<br /><br />a bona-fide heavy metal classic. get. it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said? This is my all time favorite DVD of any genre. The vocal work, acting, and staging are incredible. Ramin's voice is even more exciting than Mario Lanza's. Sierra is superb and well beyond excellent. Hadley is excellent. Instead of a mere five, I'd give it infinite stars!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|The photo sparks my curiosity... The description further seduced my soul!<br /><br />&#34;If on a winter's night&#34; is truly a must have collection of folk and traditional English songs, some of which span from the 14Th century! This collection of song has been personally gathered by Sting himself, most taken from the British Isles. This winter collection is quite intimate, authentic and extremely well done! You will fade into another place and time as you realize an almost dream state, as you relax and absorb each tranquil and at times festive musical masterpiece. This collection is as genuine as the centuries of English and Irish & Scottish tradition/history in which it conjures! Beautifully done Sting! Thank you for straying from the main stream and having the courage to walk that crooked path!If On A Winter's Night...If On A Winter's Night [Amazon.com Exclusive CD/DVD Deluxe Edition]If On A Winter's Night...
B00AO3K05S|3.0|As someone who works in sales directly, I wanted to know what Daniel H. Pink had to say about it, knowing beforehand that he is not an expert per se, but rather a very good communicator, able to resume the information and studies in a concise and easy to read way.<br /><br />For those who haven't read much about sales and persuasion, this book is a very good start. The author compiles the changes that have occurred to the sales process, focusing on the asymmetry of information as the root cause of them (it used to be the case that the vendor was much more informed about a product that the customer but that has changed radically with internet and the social networks). This change of direction of who has more information about a product results in sales strategies that need to be different and an approach that has to evolve. I liked the last part of each chapter in parts two and three of the book, where a toolkit of ways to use and interiorize the concepts presented in the chapter is given.<br />For those looking for an advance book on sales strategies, how to convince someone or persuasion, this book won't add much. If you've been in sales for the past 5-6 years, you probably know much of the stuff written in here and you'll find yourself nodding as you read, but not learning anything new.<br /><br />The book is written in a clear and delightful way and has the right length, so reading it is a matter of a week, at most.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love Castle and only have dvd player where I am.  Best of all, no commercials. Love it!!<br />Many thanks!!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|So excited to build this when I have he space and my son is old enough. Gona collect some more.
1932100660|4.0|I have had this book for awhile now and have been so busy that I haven't had the opportunity to read it. Browsing had great info
B00271B752|5.0|This film hit home when I first saw it in the theaters. I could see the very same police corruption and brutality portrayed in Serpico in the 9th PD Precinct streets in Philadelphia. My landlord in Philly had several apartment buildings.  A high ranking PD officer made the rounds once a year asking $100 for each apartment building. My landlord refused to pay. We had street cleaning on alternate sides of Green St. on Tuesday and Thursday. Every Tuesday and Thursday car 914 would park on Green St. between 22nd and 23rd, Two officers would write up tickets for any illegally parked vehicle. The street cleaning times were 7AM to 3PM. At exactly 7AM the two officers in car 914 would put the tickets on the cars. They never missed a street cleaning day. In Philly all police were on the take. The money went into a pot. The higher ranking police got a bigger cut than patrol officers. Al Pacino at his best. The real Frank Serpico is still around. He has a website.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love this play, one of our family favorites. When it was being made to a movie I was concerned about who was going to play the part. Most of the casting is superb and it was done very well. Brought a tear to my eye.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I listen to the I Heart Radio all the time and it nice to be able to adjust the sound. I found it easy to use. I took away a star because I can't adjust the sound while watching a movie or tv.<br /><br />For the FAOTD, Can't go wrong.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third of the book was much better than the second book.  I liked the way the series ended and I was glad that I experienced this series.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|At first I didn't think I would enjoy this game but the more I played it I found that it really is entertaining.
0810983915|5.0|My son, who is currently 8 years old, loves every book in this series.  He laughs out loud frequently and can't stop talking about them.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Very interesting, proving that God has created all things with a special purpose, and that we are all interconnected.<br />Relates to the book by Gwen Cooper about the cat named &#34;Homer&#34;, another excellent work.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was interesting, we read it for the book club I belong too and it generated the most amount of chat.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is such a handy app!  I downloaded it to my phone also.  I am always forgetting things, now I can just jot it in here, and I always have it with me.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I love this series so much I want to live at the bar with the gang or I wish my life was as exciting :)
B008J05EL8|1.0|This app is crap... it doesn't work!!!! I lost my money and my time... do not buy this s*** app
B006LSZECO|5.0|We read this book for a book club that I belong too.  I am so glad this was chosen.  I couldn't stop reading it and you could tell there was going to be twists and turns but couldn't imagine what they were going to be...recommended for everyone!
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|This is a must have for the diehard minecraft fan. Not sure what else to say, it's LEGO. Solid build and a neat addition to the other LEGO minecraft sets.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This was my least favorite of the three books.  The book was okay but the first book was so great and I had really high expectations.  The third book was much better but you need to read the second for the whole series :)
B000J2BRQU|5.0|I love the actors and actresses in the movie. Brian Tee is amazing and hot too!! My favorite of the Fast and Furious movies
B000002KNU|5.0|There isn't much to review here.  The Talking Heads are what the are...amazing!  I collected all the CD's so I could have them all.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this book series I can't wait to read the next one the glass city will be great im excites
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I so very much love How I met Your Mother.  Everything about it is amazing and the DVD for Season 7 isexactly what I needed!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game kids love it a lot the whole family love to play it on my Kindle never have time to play by myself
0810994739|5.0|My son, who is currently 8 years old, loves every book in this series.  He laughs out loud frequently and can't stop talking about them.
B005LAII80|2.0|Was expecting so much more based on the reviews. Let me ruin it all for you. Dredd kills a whole bunch of bad guys. Mind numbing boring after awhile. There is also a drug that slows things down. You get about 5 plus minutes of slo-mo camera. Yeah this movie flopped for a reason. It's very bad.
B000002KZ6|5.0|It's the Talking Heads how can I review awesome.  If I must say they are one of the best bands EVER!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|REALLY enjoyed this game! Played it on expert level and it was just difficult enough to keep me interested without wanting me to throw my kindle fire across the room. I didn't use the hint button at all, only skipped two puzzles, and only had to use the strategy guide once. Items in inventory were labeled which is a huge plus in my book. Graphics were good, interesting enough plot, and the HOs were crisp and clear. Well worth the money!
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I love every book in the Sigma series.  I can't get enough of them and I have to wait impatiently every time I finish one for the next one.  I love all of them because just when you think the book is winding up you look down at the percentage complete and you are only 1/2 or 3/4 of the way completed!  It's like Christmas every time a new book comes out!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Chose it out of curiosity for the movie (haven't seen) and really enjoyed it. Some aspects were confusing but I think it was intentional. Even for such a fantasy, this book was decently rational in personality building. I found myself laughing aloud on more than a handful of occasions.
B004RKXNDU|3.0|I bought this by mistake so I then returned it.  I'm trying to review everything I buy.  I sure this was great. They made it into a movie :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great read. I wanted to read this before the movie came out and put it off for so long. Interesting concepts and outcome. Going to dive into &#34;Speaker for the dead&#34; next!
0757302661|4.0|No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get focused but it's more of my personality than the book.  The idea behind HypnoBirthing is awesome but I would highly recommend finding someone to help you along the way if you want to do this for real.
B00821OX98|5.0|Not original, lots of material out there that follows this scenario, but good actors and lots of fun.now  I guess I have to write two more words.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a great book in the series.  I think it set me up with high expectations and ended up being a little disappointed by the second book.  Overall, the whole series is pretty good and I'm glad I jumped on the bandwagon and read the series.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade is a beautiful songstress. This video captures her timeless appeal, her humble persona, the tantalizing sexuality of her music. Bravissimo!!!
B001NLL0RW|5.0|As usual James Rollins kills it.  Book after book is a great read.  I love every one that I get my hands on to.  Sigma series is AWESOME!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app because it pops up quick and gives me the information I want at a glance and it is accurate.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|We saw it in theaters and this was such a cute movie.  This was a great Christmas gift for my son.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I couldn't get it to go  past the first level.  Game would get stuck on the map and could not figure it out. No help tool.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A tremendous book - well written and engaging. The author provides insight into politics and human nature during a turbulent period with lessons that continue to resonate today. But more importantly it is a compassionate, well crafted and intelligent story about a remarkable individual. This is a worthy addition to anyone's personal library.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Action packed movie with great actors, especially Dwayne Johnson.  Good storyline, made me want to see more.  Watched on my long plane flight, made the time go by fast.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown's testimony is truly inspiring! Thanks for allowing his full story to be shared. This book is a must read!
B00BHMEALA|1.0|I didn't get Argo at all.  I'm aware of the situation involving 6 Americans being held hostage in the late 70's by the Iranian hostage crisis, but what I either didn't know or what is most likely false for the sake of Hollywood movie writing exaggeration, are the segments about film making concerning science fiction and in particular, Planet of the Apes, robots and aliens.  This portion of the movie -which incidentally dominates the entire first half- was really hard to understand.  Totally downright confusing, in fact.  Its inclusion is really perplexing and odd.  I certainly don't remember reading about any of *this* in the history books, haha.  Argo makes viewers unsure if they're supposed to learn about a real incident that took place, or take the entire movie as tongue in cheek.  At least we don't actually SEE aliens and robots.  Imagine how unbelievably awkward that would have been.<br /><br />At least it begins to make sense near the end when the group of Americans disguise themselves as Canadians to try and rescue the 6 American hostages.  That makes sense.  Nice touch when the group learns about Canada enough to make their Canadian portrayal seem believable.  Not sure how much of this film is total exaggeration though- that's the biggest problem I have with the film.  I don't like being played a fool trying and figure out what is realistic and what is not, of course.  If this is supposed to be some kind of sophisticated version of Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by combining reality with fantasy, please Hollywood, go away forever.<br /><br />The biggest problem however, is that Argo never even tries to be captivating or tell an interesting story.  Instead it goes for short bits of information that goes by without any suspense or drama, and makes the entire movie feel more like a news broadcast. That kills any momentum the movie tries to build right there, and makes Argo an incredibly overrated movie.  Not worthy of all the accolades it has won over the year.  It's only regarded so highly because of the many big name actors and actresses that star in it.
8866131059|5.0|This is without any doubt the best diary/planner out there.  I have been using similar products for about 15 years now and I depend on them for my work and personal errands.  This product is superior to others because of the nice, luxury, yet understated feel and look.  It also is extremely well organized in the inside.  Every day gets its own page, yet the pages are not too small or too big and the book itself is a perfect size.  There is a little hidden sleeve at the back where I keep business cards, stamps etc.  Highly recommended.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This one grows on you.  All the parts and clues are there in plain sight and it all comes together in the end.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love all the books! On number 3(city of glass), but this is definitely one of my top 5 favorite books
B005PK57NU|5.0|I really enjoy the story lines and actors. It keeps me waiting to see how the writers  develope my favorite characters.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is beautifully written and brings attention to a misunderstood culture in a new way. Author brings you on a wonderful journey through connected characters.
140006922X|4.0|Reslan's book is very readable and presents and interesting, if controversial perspective, of the life of Jesus.  Added a lot to my historical knowledge of the  times and presents an interesting theory regarding the origins of Christianity.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Zealot makes a credible argument that the Jesus of orthodox faith is significantly different from the historical Jesus.  This book can be disturbing to orthodox Christians, and could be seen as undermining the authority of the scriptures.  Aslan distills non-orthodox New Testament scholarship into a readable form. I doubt this book will be the subject of church discussions.  The most disturbing revelation to me was how the New Testament's non-historical depiction of trial of Jesus became the basis of centuries of anti-semiticism.  This is not a forgettable book.  Though its target is not scholars, it is one that should be debated and argued in halls of academe.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It works and works well, but they want 15 words, so here they are:  It works and works well. It works and works well. It works and works well. There.  Now they're happy, and you know its good.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a very good book I enjoyed it greatly I hope to find the other books so I can read them and find out about the rest of the family
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|This is a book that is not merely entertaining.  It is important.  As westerners we peer into the evolving/devolving face that is Afghanistan and react in not dissimilar fashion  to those who encountered Thalia or Roshi.  Some of the righteous disappoint. Some scoundrels rise to acts of heroism.  And when is the best course simply to accept what we see?<br />I am as a fish that has been hooked and pulled through sparkling cultural currents, left breathless, gutted and grateful for the journey.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Wow ! This was the best book I read this summer! I look for a Harlan Coban book when I want a good read.
B00008FRWR|5.0|it is very nice to find vinyl at a price reasonable :)<br /><br />I am very glad with my pourchase.<br /><br />Thanks
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It was boring at first I was not getting it but 1/2 way through the boo got really interesting. I enjoyed it a lot.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|A good show with a great cast in the classic tradition of good science fiction.  Great effects and cinematography make this movie compelling and fun.
1400052173|5.0|Ms Skloot has really put her soul on this book. The book contains pieces of the history of slavery, racism, ethics, cell culturing technology and genetics. The life of Henrietta Lacks and her family is presented in a heartbreaking and touching manner. This book has everything. Drama, tragedies, deceit, complex jurisprudence issues, and greed. It is a very well-written and fascinating book. I absolutely enjoyed every word in this book.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This is a great movie and much more cerebral than the usual hollywood pulp.  A great all-star cast doubling up on roles throughout the multiple stories woven across the times in the movie.  I will watch it again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Once you start reading it, it is hard to put down. She is just as, or more hilarious than I have seen her on TV.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Too much glitz and glamour not enough substance. It moves a lot faster than the original because of SFX but the acting does not cover the story well. Don't misconstrue the comment as referring to bad acting but the original conveyed more of the message.
1451624468|5.0|When I read that our universe is precisely 13.72 billion years old and mostly filled with Dark Energy and Dark Matter, skepticism bubbled up.  How are we going to measure energy that we cannot, by any definition of energy that I understand, detect?  How are we going to \\"see\\" dark matter whose only measurable affect is gravity due to its mass?? It seemed to me that more questions had been raised than answered.<br /><br />Physicists to the Ramparts !!  Construct a model, consistent with what Quantum Mechanics tells us about matter and energy, to explain this !!  Then explain this model in non-mathematical terms that mere mortals can sorta understand, and even sorta accept.<br /><br />For me, Lawrence Krauss has done just that in 190 easy-to-read pages. Add a dollop of humor, sharp words about science vs. religion, and the best keyword index I've seen; the sum is a book to which I would affix 6 stars if it were possible.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|this is so much better than the  new one ,the new one had rape music ,i thought that was so silly
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This met every expectation I had, from the quality of the DVDs to the series itself.  Bravo!  Something to curl up and watch with a bowl of popcorn, although watch out for choking...from laughing too much.
0446401307|4.0|This proved to be another solid installment in the adventures of Harry Bosch, albeit one that is notably shorter than the others in the series. Michael Connelly never ceases to impress me. Just when I was getting toward the end of this book and thinking, \\"boy, he really dropped the ball with the misdirection in this one; it's just not like him\\", he proves me wrong and throws me a curve ball that I never saw coming. The plot for \\"The Overlook\\" seems a bit \\"out there\\" as far as Bosch crime novels go, but by the time all is revealed, it fits in perfectly with the themes and tones of my favorite hard boiled detective's universe. And I also enjoyed watching the tense relationship between Harry and Rachel, following the explosive fallout of \\"Echo Park\\". This was a fast, fun read that kept me engaged throughout. As always, the reader did a fantastic job with the audible edition.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I learned a lot about Tesla and his struggle against Thomas Edison.  Some of his later claims were hard to imagine, and I felt the author didn't have the technical background to put them in perspective.
B00000IUKQ|3.0|Pricey  part, but sturdy. Would like the tunnel size to be larger. Attching this part to others requires a child to have more dexterity than a two year old.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Her personality comes through in an honest, well-told narrative. There's a real person there who speaks to the reader like a funny and interesting friend.
B001706I5I|4.0|Another silly movie my niece begged me to order!  Lol showed clearly and we enjoyed! Will I order again yes sure will
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|the graphics are awesome the music is awesome the cars are epic I love every thing about it espacialy that u ca. make ur car fast but others slow&gt;:D but I regimens this game u can do replays and stuff and just have fun I like the music the most
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Classic movie order for my niece that loves this silly movie! Played clearly! Yes I would order agAin we enjoyed
B007HACDLK|5.0|I just discovered this writer and I can not get enough.  The action begins on the first page and continues to the last.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|This was a smart science fiction movie and Tom Cruise delivered a stunning performance.  I tried to see this move when it was in theatrical release but never found time to go.  I would have like more plot development concerning the aliens nemesis from outer space but other than that I think this is a worthwhile movie to invest 2 hours.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Shipped faster than expected and brand new. 5 star movie! I hadn't watched this movie in years, so funny and a great movie for the whole family!!
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Love this movie! It's been one of my favorites since I was a kid! Was overjoyed to see it on Amazon Prime!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I loved the story telling. Can't wait yo read the next saga. Do not want to put the book down once I started reading.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|I know it is rally racing, but I would have more traction on wet ice. Ok game The graphics are great for a mobile phone game. Just no traction.
B0017VT5E8|1.0|Why did anyone like this film, the story is so boring and the only point of watching this is watching Stallone &#34;Try&#34;.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|Jason Statham - The mechanic is a really good action film. Jason Stathem did a very good job like always did. I don`t use to watch action movies but sometimes I enjoyed watching movies like this and  I recommend it if you like this kind of movies.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ok I know it's petty but the last update screwed up the icons transparency on the corners. Now instead of invisible,they're white. Please fix!
B00881VLCE|5.0|love this puzzle app! others are not as great as this one. super easy and fun!!!!!!!! great great great great app!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This is not a very easy game to play,but I was able to figure out the answer to most everything without a lot of help
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love thus book. It's so amazing! I'm so glad i read thus book. Off to number 2! Read it most definitely everyone(;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the more fun games that I have found on my kindle so far, it's easy for the kids to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing and its finally up to date! Its an awesome game and you should buy it my siblings are addicted along with me.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|It's the second time that I've read this book. And what a difference it takes, because the first time I thought this book was too dark, talking about poor, addicted, minorities. A very hard to change environment, a very hard to succeed in life. Now, I see another angle. It's full of data and it can build the basis for a great life.
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|A Very good record player for a reasonably low price. I have a vers1Q speaker hooked up to mine and it sounds great together :-)
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Like everyone has said, this is possibly the best show ever. Many here have compared it to Seinfeld. I was not a Seinfeld fan, (I watched it a few times in reruns) and really don't see the similarity. To me the Seinfeld characters didn't have any focus. Back to BBT, sometimes Sheldon gets on my nerves, he is just such an egomaniac. How he thinks he is the center of the universe. That shows what a great actor Jim Parsons is. Makes me want to write the show, and tell them to have Leonard or one of the others take him down a peg or two. You can see how Leonard gets so frustrated with him.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I'VE SEEN IT IN THE PAST AND THINK IT'S A GREAT STORY AND WANT IT PART OF MY LIBRARY.  ROBBINS DOES A GREAT PERFORMANCE.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I won this book in a contest and absolutely loved it! It is well written and I am a fan of Rebecca's writing. I will buy more of her work just based off of this book.
0385528787|3.0|MaddAddam is the third book in Margaret Atwood's Orxy and Crake trilogy. I only gave it three stars, but three stars for Atwood would be four stars or better for anyone else. As always with Atwood, the characters are strong, the setting vibrant and the plot imaginative. If you haven't read the first two books in the series, for goodness sakes, don't start here. You'll be completely lost by page 5. Actually, it had been a while since I'd read the first two myself and I had to go back and reread them Atwood doesn't spend a lot of time filling her readers in on the back story. This may be the weakest in the series, but it still ain't chopped liver. Start with Oryx and Crate, then read After the Flood before diving into MaddAddam.
B0047E9TRA|5.0|I love this movie!!!!  Carrie is one of my old time favorites and the entire movie is played on my Kindle.  No movies parts are deleted, you get the real theater movie.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|Hesitation Marks is certainly different from NIN's previous works, but as always, it's amazing and well worth the time to stop and listen to.  This album came at the perfect time in my life and I can't help but to feel every song on here touch a chord in my own life.  Thank you Trent Reznor, I always knew you couldn't stay away from Nine Inch Nails forever  :)
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I just stayed watching this show during season 4 so I went back and began watching it from the beginning.  This show is<br />Very funny and very touching at times as well.  Just love it.  Well worth buying ALL Seasons!!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Always wanted to see this and the price was right on the mark. Very good movie ! If you havent seen it , you might think about buying it. Remember, once you've seen it you can gift it. :)
B005DJREJS|1.0|You will like it if your a teenager ...!! It's ok for people of other ages..!! So I didnt like it much
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like the Grisham style, you'll like this book.  The plot has some good twists and although admittedly Grisham notes the plentiful use of fiction, he weaves plausibility throughout masterfully.  I docked him one star for the lack of a strong protagonist, but you can decide that for yourself.  Overall, an entertaining work with his signature page turning style.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really loved Wonder because it is never sad to the point where it makes you cry. It really teaches you to respect people like Auggie.
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|I have been using the MEGA256 for  automation projects and was very pleased with the extra punch (memory, speed and language) that the DUE offers. If you have been using Arduinos in the past, the only thing to watch out for are the inputs. The DUE inputs accept 3 volts whereas the others are 5 volts.<br /><br />Great little device. I love it.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I like Will Smith but After Earth was slow and anti-climactic.  The same here.  The climax wasn't that climactic.  A little mind bending but slow and kind of painful to watch...
B00DGN51O8|5.0|I watched this with my son because there are so few APPROPRIATE quality movies for intelligent kids. I was expecting to have to endure another completely predictable, totally unimaginative and derivative script written by greedy Hollywood executives. To my complete surprise, however, both my son and I were kept on the edge of our seats the whole movie. What a clever interpretation of the Jack and the Beanstalk story! It is not without its flaws. The dialogue was too modernistic for my taste, and the depiction of social class relations was anachronistic. But, despite that, the story was fantastic. If you are frustrated with how few movies there are for kids, don't miss this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it the fun game ever I love the fun stuff  and how you f flight<br />It fun and im
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game that you don't have to play constantly.  Levelling up is easy at beginning but gets harder after about level 25.  I started over and am not upgrading trucks and buildings until the game tells me to.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book was so much more than I expected, the experiments were very simple and the instructions were self-explanatory. Once you start reading you can not put it down, Pam will have laughing so hard your sides will ache. This book was so enlightening, I sent copies to friends. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|very addicting. fun to play on a long plane ride in bed on a long road trip or just to have fun
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|First, let's get the misconceptions of the 1 star reviews out of the way:<br /><br />The app launches to a volume control. That's true. If you use some ingenuity you'll soon discover that tapping the small EQ button opens the Equalizer.<br /><br />Once you tap the EQ button you have a 5 channel equalizer at your disposal, and it adjusted the sound of my music with effects that sound just like the equalizer built into every stereo receiver I've ever owned. It really does a nice job.<br /><br />The equalizer comes with several presets for styles like rock, rap, classical, dance, and others. Or you can just drag and drop the equalizer controls to set your own balance. I've personally always achieved pleasant results by setting channels one, three, and five toward the high end of the settings while placing channels two and four towards the mid range.<br /><br />I could hear the equalizer effects quite well on the stereo speakers of my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and they had an even more pleasant effect when I connected my larger Bluetooth stand-alone speaker.<br /><br />This app does run in the background. A short tap on the power button in the upper right corner minimizes the app and it continues to effect your music play while you do anything else you wish with your device.<br /><br />This is a no-brainer as the Free App of the Day, and easily improves the quality of play to make it worth more than the four dollar (as I type) regular price.<br /><br />I only dock a star because it would have been nice (and dead easy) for the app to include a simple help screen to explain how to find the equalizer function to everyone who couldn't read EQ on that button, and possibly give some finer points in the significance of equalizer settings, including the Bass Boost and Virtualizer controls.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001383XT8|4.0|Low end crunch. It sounds good and the more I use this pedal the more I like it. Mid to High, not so great but down on the bottom you'd better have a good amp. I recommend it for the heavy duty hard core rocker only.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is an emotive, fantastic piece of fantasy literature that lends itself to be read by any age. It is a book that has found a place on my bookshelf from the age of 8 and it still has a place there today at the age of 24. Nix builds an amazingly detailed world, one that readers will wish to explore despite the threats that may linger in the form of dead-hands and Mordicants.<br /><br />Sabriel herself is a strong, intelligent female lead that still has enough growing to do that we can sympathize with every pitfall she finds herself needing to make her way out of. Her companions only add to her strength of character, rather than detracting from it. Sabriel comes into her own throughout this novel, going from a girl trying to retrieve her father so he can take up the helm of Abhorsen again to a young women stepping into the role she was always meant to take on.<br /><br />This novel is one I cannot recommend highly enough, if you are to pick up any fantasy novel make sure this makes it onto your list.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy was an excellent read. I can't wait for the next movie to be released. Looking forward to reading more books by this author.
B005I548B4|5.0|It was just a lovely book to read. One minute I was crying and the next I was smiling, I wanted to finish it but when I did I was sort of sad. I would recommend this book to any woman with a heart.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. I can't stop playing. I love puzzle games. Fun, Fun, Fun! Addictive. You must try this game!
B00E5C3AJM|4.0|it wont let me download for some reason....but I heard that this game I very good....so I guess I recommend it!!!! :-)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched it on my Kindle and plan on buying the DVD HD version.....great movie & can't wait til the next one!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I know it's a cliché, but I couldn't put it down!  Even in the car (luckily I was a passenger on a road trip.)  Hooks you in right away and has great plot twists and surprises.  Highly recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This novel was only interesting until about half-way through. I would just skim the sex scenes and go back to the dialogue, which was no longer interesting. I had high hopes.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Needs more ways to make city credits well I'm not sure what they are called but when you have to remove a hill those things. Um other then that its a really good game! You should get it for sure&hellip;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my wife, the kids, and I have all played for hours on multiple devices. sooooooo keel and frustrating and addicting. can't wait to see else is yet to come.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love Supernatural.  the way they poke fun at at the entire 'supernatural reality show' genre is hilarious.  Forget Ghost Hunters, Sam and Dean bring a realistic quality to hunting ghosts.  It's not something they do for fun on a day off, it's the hunter's way of life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The first time I play the game.<br />So you should play the game it is awesome.  So you should play the game it is a boom.  So play the game now

B005XDHNF4|5.0|I bought this for my fiance who is a Lego lover to the extreme. For our upcoming wedding we plan on using this as the topper for the grooms cake! It is a perfect gift for my fiance! Would recommend having this cute little topper for anyone who loves Legos.
B000063K2W|4.0|An old fan of gentle yet humorous classics<br />This is a delight - and a classic vehicle for local  PTA and theatre groups raising money for good causes<br />brings back fond memories<br />Delighted you had it
B003E88TKS|1.0|This has got to be one of the most boring, if not the most boring movie I have ever seen....  couldn't go past one hour and that was one hour too much....  one hour wasted....  one hour of my life that I will never get back....  BORING, BORING, BORING.....
B008JFUNYG|2.0|The original \\"Evil Dead\\" was made on a very low budget, so it was interesting but not great. \\"Evil Dead II\\" was basically an improved, high budget remake of the original, and I loved it. The grossness was so over-the-top that it was purposely hilarious. Bruce Campbell was perfect in the role, despite the fact that, when I later interviewed him, he scoffed at all his early horror work as merely a means to show his real acting ability (we're pretty much still waiting for that, although he's not bad in \\"Burn Notice\\"). \\"Army of Darkness\\" was fantastic too. All the horror elements, cleverness and humor of its predecessor.<br /><br />Which brings us to \\"Evil Dead\\" (2013), which had a high budget but none of the other elements that made the original series of films so great. It's blood and gore topped with a larger helping of blood and gore. No humor, no cleverness, ... nothing but sickening slaughter of the characters. There are references (physical and verbal) to the original films, but that's all. This re-envisiong of the series turned me off completely. There is no Bruce Campbell humor to redeem this terrible movie. Sam,<br />Ted, Bruce, Robert, and the dentist Raimi (all partners in Renaissance Pictures), please, you've made a ton of money off the endless versions and editions of the \\"Evil Dead\\" series. PLEASE, just leave it alone! It was and is a classic, so don't ruin it by remaking the films in a way that is dull, sickening, plotless, and not worth seeing.
B004X80QNG|2.0|It is a good thing that this was a FAOTD. It is not worth $9.99 and this is an old version of this app with the new version also selling for $9.99. It is supposed to sync with Google account calendars on other devices. Entries made on this calendar and entries made on the Google calendars on other devices never appeared on each other - after repeated times of trying to  have both sync. Support for this app is minimal. There is nothing offered in this app that cannot be done - and better - on the stock free Android calendar apps. I uninstalled this from my Android tablet the same day that I got it.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Took me awhile to get into the story. Once I did it was an easy, light read. Not as good as some of her other books but still an enjoyable afternoon of reading.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|\\"Riddick\\" is great! This is how the story goes: When Riddick is left for dead on a lifeless planet, however, he realizes that he is not alone. With a storm due to hit the planet, Riddick activates an emergency beacon from an abandoned outpost on the planet. 2 ships respond to the beacon's signal, one of them a mercenary ship and the other ship, piloted by someone connected to Riddick's past.<br /><br />The cast led by Vin Diesel (also produced) (as Riddick) is great. The directing & story & screenplay by David Twohy is great.<br /><br />The music by Graeme Revell is great. The cinematography by David Eggby is great. The film editing by Tracy Adams is great. The casting by Anne McCarthy is great. The production design by Joseph C. Nemec III is great. The art direction by Jean-Andre Carriere is great. The set decoration by Daniel Carpentier, set dressings by Louis Frederic Denomme is great. The costume design by Simonetta Mariano is great. The special make-up effects by Adrien Morot is great. The special effects supervised by Ryal Cosgrove is great. The visual effects supervised by Tim Carras, Ryan Epp, Gunnar Hansen, Alain Lachance, Pierre-Simon Lebrun-Chaput, Nordin Rahhali, Ollie Rankin & Mathieu Raynault, coordinated by Ryan Burcham, Cynthia Carrier, Jonathan Cronk, Charles-David Deschenes, Sabrina Gagnon, Lauren Guerard, Amelie Marcoux, Laurel Montgomery, Jessica Newhouse-Smith, Svetlana Tesnes, Mathieu Tremblay & Kelly Wong is great. The stunts coordinated by Michael Scherer & fights coordinated by Guillermo Grispo is great.<br /><br />This is a great second sequel in the \\"Riddick\\" franchise, that is well-done and well-made. It is also entertaining, as well, with solid sci-fi action and thrills packed into it. This is a better movie than \\"Chronicles Of Riddick\\" and is just as great, as \\"Pitch Black\\", was. Vin Diesel is solid as usual as Riddick, not missing a step at all after the franchise's 9-year hiatus.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't like to read...not enough time and honestly I would rather do anything else.  Now that I am commuting on a bus I have a little more down time.  A buddy suggested this book to me and I ignored him.  A few months later, I got a wild hair and bought the book and almost immediately was hooked.  Growing up in the 80s, I was flooded with memories of all the electronic things I used to have or wanted as a kid.  If you are like me...an old Zork gamer or a young pup who's parents grew up in the 80s, then I would suggest this book.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It's a really good game,and the animals are cool. I like the wolves, except for the fact that they are mostly out at night. Me and my little sister like building walls and trapping the wolves in them. We do throw fish to them to eat. I also like the killer whales, except for the problem that they get beached sometimes, and if you don't throw water over them and push them back into the water, they end up as fish food for the sharks. It's still a really good game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Keeps me up to date in style. Once I got used to adding feeds I really fell in love with this program.
B00E978FGQ|1.0|You can't have a good story when your \\"twist\\" character stays in character when he's alone.  It's cheating with the story.  Lots of people raving about this.  Ok, I'm a minority.  I thought is pretty much sucked, the story was uneven, totally implausible and then the twist at the end was just pathetic.  Sue me with Not Helpfuls.
B0040I09RM|5.0|A unique mix of life, action and family. Love the entire series! It is worth watching a second time, just to see what was missed the first time!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I liked everything about this game except for the fact that I can't blow up tnt in creative mode I mean what's th point of tnt if you can't blow it up??
B008M87GJK|5.0|What's to write BBC free, it is a steal! The ability to select stories rather than wait til it shows on tv is an added bonus.
B00AX6KNOY|4.0|This has got to be in my top ten of &#34;horror&#34; flicks. It's got it all, scenes that make you jump, scenes that that are disgusting and most important, scenes that make you LOL ;) No, it's not some serious horror/psychological thriller. It doesn't quite hit &#34;campy&#34; either. It IS however a very typical 1990's movie. If you are a fan of the Scream movies this falls in the same range. I actually like it better than Scream. Elijah Wood is an adorable geek who you immediately root for. The other classic personalities are there too. The cheerleader, the jock, the goth girl, etc. When a sickening parasite starts to take control of teachers at their school, it falls onto these kids to &#34;save the day&#34;. I don't want to go into too many details but definitely give this one a chance. It's a great Friday/Saturday night movie at home!
B004UA8D2S|5.0|i like this movie! Great on blue- ray! I don`t dislike nothing the delievery was fast and on time. loved it
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app helps me fall asleep night after night. I like that I can customize the soothing sounds and the duration. I may consider upgrading to the paid version just to discover the additional sound options.

B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Simpler days long gone.  I wanted it to have that happy ending.. on that farm.  This book I never forget.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching this series.  I cannot wait to watch the next season to see if the caliber of the show continues.
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.  It has the same feel and similar story.  Lots of good one liners and nearly every action movie actor that has ever existed.
1623420148|5.0|This entire book had me laughing my ass off from beginning to end. Seriously, full on asthma attack here people! This book is detrimental to your health. It should come with a warning.  WARNING: If you suffer from respiratory issues, a weak heart, pregnant, recent surgery - it'll seriously rip you to shreds.  I don't remember when was the last time I enjoyed any book so much. I laughed, I was entertained, I swooned. Tangled, book with witty and sarcastic hero as narrator, is a MUST READ. This insight into man's head and thinking is fascinating and a lot of fun.
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I wanted a  small backpack to carry my camera, one extra lens, some small accessories such filters, remote shutter release, etc. a tablet or laptop and a few personal items like a jacket, cap and gloves.  This one is perfect.  Not too bulky.  Also, the quality seems to be very good.  The only improvement I could suggest is the addition of a water proof hood to fit over the backpack.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Very good book, and also a great show! Definitely an interesting perspective on a very complex subject....hope the rising popularity can help shove along the movement of prison reform.
B0084B0656|5.0|The message is still appropriate for today and will harden the resolve of anyone who chooses to read it. I really enjoy Chesterton's humor and wit.
0385535147|2.0|The Racketeer<br />Grisham fails to keep the suspense. Very unbelievable. In my opinion one of his worst books I have ever read
B004HD61KE|5.0|The only problem I had with this book, was that I couldn't put it down!  It captured my attention from page one and kept it all the way through.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved this book. It is a great story on a piece of history I never knew about.  It is a story of perseverance under hardship.<br />I only wish it would have been longer. I felt there were some things that the author could have put more into.<br />Overall it was amazing!
B0037TPMOA|5.0|An amazing story, written to perfection.  You just can't stop reading it once you get started, you just NEED TO KNOW what comes next.<br />If your a fan of Kubrick's Shining, know that you won't find the same story in this pages, but you'll sure find some explanations to certain scenes in the movie.
B00EYN3HTA|4.0|not usually a poem lover but i gave these a try as they were linked to the great book i read by this author, a little while back, so they were fantasy poems which i think i could get around to liking, i did and enjoyed the book.<br />Has it swayed me to liking more poems? That we'll have to see, i just hope William releases a full blown sequel at some point. Anyone who is needing a quick fix though should read these.<br />I received this book for free in exchange for a honest review
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this game. my child loves this game too.This game is a good game.I am telling you I love this game
B0002KPIQY|1.0|I think Angelina Jolie is one of the most talented and beautiful actresses today and with all the rave reviews for this movie, I watched it as soon as it arrived.<br />What a waste of time. I should have quit the first few minutes but waited to see what others saw that was so terrific. It's, however, interesting to see how AJ's nose used to look like.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|A superb exposition on the issues that exist with most forecasts (especially those from experts), and a guide on how to improve the quality of the same. Well written, easy to read, and full of examples. Only downside (not unexpected given Silver's background) is that there are too many baseball references and terms.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie should be required viewing for every one. This was an eye opening and provoking film and also a call to action! I had never taken the time to sit down and think about where our food actually comes from and what is involved in this process. I was both moved and alarmed and can say I plan to make more decisive choices in my food shopping as a result of this film. I would highly encourage others to watch and share this film with their friends and family!

B00BGD07KS|5.0|Mariah Carey Knows her limits. With almost home she did a great job with staying true to her craft while still pleasing her fans. If this is what her upcoming album &#34;The Art of Letting Go&#34; will sound like, I am so excited!
B008K9UZY4|4.0|I owned the original Sonic CD computer game years ago, but never managed to beat it. Now that the CD is obsolete, I bought this game to take another shot at the title (so far I'm three levels further into the game than ever before!).<br /><br />Sonic games have always been fun, and this game is no exception. Run threw the levels going either as fast as you can or slow down and grab the coins and powerups, and eventually beat egghead. The controls work pretty well, but if you aren't careful, your fingers will wonder just far away enough from the right buttons to screw you up at the most important moment. But it isn't like the designers could have done any better with that flaw.<br /><br />All in all, a fun game, but I think three bucks was a little too much.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I really enjoyed this flick... My only complaint was that the sound effects were loud, but when people in the movie spoke, you couldn't quite hear them right.  All other movies sounded fine, so not sure why this one was different.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Read the three books in the series,this was the second...great story can't wait for her next book!<br />One of my dirty little secrets lol
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It's always challenging but fun and relaxing. The game is a matching game on a cube. I like having it as a fill the time such as when I have to wait somewhere.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book had me frustrated at first.  It's a bit difficult to follow for the first few chapters.  However, once I got into a rhythm I found I couldn't put it down.  It has many twists and turns and kept me intrigued all the way to the end.  If you like page-turning, suspenseful books that will keep you guessing, then you will enjoy this one.  I look forward to reading more of Haynes's books.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|The app works great on my Kindle Fire; always enjoy playing free cell games and this one is as good as any other.

B0024FAG6M|4.0|The 1960s saw a lot of social change. The hippie movement, the increased exposure of recreational drugs, and the idea of freedom were all on the rise. Easy Rider captures that time and tries to depict a feeling. For the most part, it succeeds.<br /><br />Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) star as two bikers who are riding across America on their choppers. We see them buying and selling drugs, and meeting up with other like-minded people. They are determined to leave behind the established system and make their own way in life. In a way, this is a road movie, but it's also much more.<br /><br />The biggest source of conflict in the movie comes in the form of people who see Wyatt and Billy as dangerous non-conformists. They are arrested on dubious grounds and receive verbal abuse from some of the townspeople they meet along the way.<br /><br />The story itself is actually pretty thin. This is a movie that is more about the lifestyle than the plot of its characters. The idea of communes and free love are not as shocking as when they first appeared, but imagine watching the ideas portrayed in this movie when it was released.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson shows up as lawyer George Hanson, who helps out our rebellious heroes when they find themselves locked up in jail. Nicholson's role is brief, but memorable. Hopper and Fonda do a great job of portraying the free-spirited bikers.<br /><br />Music plays a big part in the movie and helps to establish the 60s feel. Be ready for Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Roger McGuinn, and many other performers from the era. The other star is the American scenery. The mountain locations are particularly spectacular.<br /><br />The movie is dated now, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend it for people born in the 50s or before, as well as younger people who are curious about what life might have been like at the end of the 60s.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation from Criterion (in the America Lost and Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.<br /><br />Overall score 3.75/5nd Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.<br /><br />Overall score 3.75/5

B00DDXJRJG|1.0|I got this app because it was the free app if the day and it looked cool. Here are the reasons why I give it one star:<br />-it doesn't fit the whole screen or even close<br /><br />-if you play a song and then want to go to that app to do stuff to the song, it doesn't let you<br />-to confusing!!!!!!!!!!

B000SEGMAU|5.0|Mitch Albom really knows how  to bring a main character to life (even after death)<br /><br />This book is a good study on forgiving yourself and forgiving others. It will make you want to pick up the phone and call old friends and family who you may have forgotten to tell that you love them and realize how important it is not to let another day go by where you put the task off.<br /><br />This is the second time I have read this book; this time I wanted it on my Kindle where I can peruse it over and over.  Don't put off reading this book.  Then go on to read more of Albom's books that provide guideposts along that road we all must travel.
034580709X|4.0|Harry Hole (hoo-leh), Jo Nesbø's main character in his bestselling novels, is introduced in The Bat.  Harry is sent to Australia to observe the investigation of the murder of a semi-famous Norwegian girl.  While there, Harry becomes friends with Andrew Kensington, who is an Aboriginal, and is on the police force.  As Andrew and Harry investigate the murder, Harry meets Birgitta, who is considered a witness in the case; Harry thinks he may be in love.  As the story unfolds, they discover that the murder is connected to several others, and they begin looking for a serial killer.<br /><br />Because of an incident in Harry's life where he was responsible for his partner's death due to his drinking on the job (he is an alcoholic) and causing an automobile accident which was covered up by the department, Harry refuses to have another drink.  However, as he gets beat up and almost killed during the investigation, he begins to drink to excess after he and Andrew are severely beaten and end up in the hospital.  In addition, there are other incidents in the book where Harry comes close to losing his life, a theater friend is brutally murdered, and Birgitta is kidnapped that insure plenty of suspense.<br /><br />The Bat is fast-moving, and is filled with charming aboriginal fables, which help the reader to better understand the culture.  The book is worth reading for the fables alone, but thriller fans will appreciate the twists and turns that Harry goes through while attempting to solve the murders.  Needless to say, this is a difficult book to put down.  There are a few places in the book, however, that are a little confusing, probably because of the translation, but that doesn't take away from the story or the suspense.<br /><br />The Bat is highly recommended for thriller fans who want something a little different, and it should be read first if planning to read the entire Harry Hole series.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.k was solicited by the author or publisher.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|Game play takes some getting used to. Controls are very sensitive. Graphics are very good. Haven't played enough to figure out how to unlock cars and tracks yet.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|Thanks South Africa & Australia. Too bad this did not catch on in the US when released. Wonder what other songs would followed.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This is really good despite the mixed reviews in the newspapers and web. The characters/actors are good and the plot is always misleading due to the tricks done by the magicians. The tricks and props are like something out of Mission Impossible but with a slight of hand/misdirection aspect that you would never see coming. The ending will blow you away and you will never see it happening. We bought the extended version and we are glad we did. This movie is better than the usual marvel comic remake. It is entertaining and original along with it's plot. I would highly recommend this movie.
1452113432|3.0|This book has beautiful cover and pictures, but the recipe was not what I was expecting. It's a very personal opinion.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book kept my attention, but the reuse of lines many, many times and the use of the sexual interludes may have been over the top. Bought the third book at the same time, hope it gets better than this one.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|I bought Batman Begins, The Dark Knight Rises, all the Pirates and Inceptions Score albums, but for some reason I never got the Dark Knight score until now. Absolutely loving it and have listened to it 3 straight times as of the past two days of owning it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic book that's still can't seem to fully understand as an adult! Def worth the money! :) :) :) :)
B00B52F278|5.0|I happened to catch the very first episode of the very first Spartacus one Saturday afternoon.  I was hooked.<br /><br />I've always liked John Hannah who portrayed Battiatus so kept on watching and was amazed at how fast I was totally involved in the show and its characters.  I don't get Starz so have anxiously awaited the DVD availability of  \\"War of the Damned\\" which I just watched Friday and Saturday.  WOW - even though I knew Spartacus would not have a \\"happy\\" ending - it was less important than how all the other characters and situations would end.<br /><br />Considering the lead actor met a untimely death in real life earlier in the series, the show's producers, etc., were able to keep continuity - and I appreciated a brief revisit with Andy Whitfield as Spartacus via the ending credits.<br /><br />All in all just a really well developed story.  I am so sad to know there will be no more to watch...
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Love story with a twist.  I love how the author switched between the characters so that you could read how each one was feeling.  Read entire book in less than 24 hours, couldn't put it down
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This graphic novel is creative and well written. The style is believable including the illustrations. The main character is relatable and funny.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Very good by super musicians, maybe recording people will take note, and change their way of thinking, as this was done in Vince's home studio.
B00EQRMLNM|4.0|When it has came down to what John Legend has shown to offer the past several years, he has been one of the most diverse singer/songwriters to have ever graced the music industry, not just in heart, but good rhythms as well. His latest song, All Of Me, the second single from his album Love In The Future is a simple and sophisticated ballad that hits the nail on the head well. It is very contemporary to the piano his voice as well. I like the song better than what jokes have overplayed on radio recently. John delivers very nicely in a sincere and eloquent way. This is definitely a nice song to download for any die hard John Legend fan, or for those who are new to his music.<br /><br />Song: B 1/2+
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This games make me think and use my mine every day I play it three or four time a day I just love it my kind of games. love it older people try it make you feel better, it a grate games.<br />Mary.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Every film version of this book has its flaws; this one fails more than others in the liberties it takes with the book, although people under the age of 25 might marvel over the cinematography.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I enjoy this app as I'm one who loves to meditate. A wonderful way to release stress. This app is very user friendly and anyone who enjoys meditation should try this
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Dustin Hoffman waited until after the age of 70 to make his directorial debut, and it pays off. This movie has everything a person could want from a gentle comedy such as this.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoy this app. I highly recommend. It is truly a wonderful way to meditate and just get into a peaceful place.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed the romance with a twist.  So glad finished before the movie.  I wanted the books to continue.  If there was a fourth, I would have read it too

B007VUA7VO|4.0|I've had this app for a while now and it hasn't disappointed me. From what I've realized it's estimations are pretty accurate.  All in all I would give yhis app a rating of 4 stars
B00EY8ARYS|5.0|This looks fantastic..If they can keep up that big screen look this show will definitely be a huge hit. Joss Whedon is so good at what he does and you can always see his hand in things. Looking forward to watching.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Highly recommended. Diverse amount of gametype options, plus very cool control schemes. For the price of free, it's a no brainer.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book!! Can't put it down!! Finished it, but had to read it two more times!! Can't wait to read more from this author
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moDYZFO67Y8HWR]]Google has taken a very different approach to bringing web video to television as compared to Apple, Roku, and others: they're relying on the mobile apps we're already using as opposed to trying to invent a television based interface for every application.<br /><br />As an owner of a Roku and an AppleTV, I have to say that Google's approach is probably the way to go (at the moment).  The device works seamlessly with the Netflix and YouTube apps and can also stream content from Google's Chrome browser on the Mac and PC.  That browser streaming feature is a great way to get content from your favorite TV shows that don't yet offer an app or a way to stream on a television normally short of plugging a PC to the television.<br /><br />For $35 you can't go wrong. This is an excellent device that has some great and innovative uses ahead of it.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment and Stardust is an inspiring set of poems which reopened my mind from the lovely first story of Peter in a Darkened Fairytale. The book exhibits a combination of magic and deep thoughts, beautifully and simply connected to tease the senses. O'Brien's child-like but sensual imagination paints a delicate, although potent, play on words. Many spiritual aspects are seen it this authors writing in both of his works. An amazing palette of fairies, creatures and the love of life itself will touch your heart.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Adorable, charming, creative, entertaining, and cute, cute, cute!  Three generations of our family enjoyed this movie.<br />Another winner from Pixar.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Wonderful  read,<br /> just as exciting as it was on the first time I read it. You cannot beat quality and talent.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Just wish the there had been more hard puzzles.  There were a couple that took more than 10 min but too few and far between, and none that truly stumped me. The interface was well done, the premise interesting, and even the music entertaining.  Would have liked a bit more of a challenge, but a strong effort, and I will,look for more by the developer.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Let me start off by saying if you are downloading this album and listening to mp3 files, or on headphones you are missing the experience of listening to a NIN album.  You need the CD or LP plus a good set of speakers to hear all of the intricacies of a NIN release.  The point of NIN is that each album is different, employing a new set of musicians.  This time around you get guitarist Adrian Belew from King Crimson fame.  Trent's programming is the most interesting thing he has done lately.  I have to admit I am not a fan of the soundtracks and HTDA, but there is plenty of layering that makes HM a good listen.  The electronics on HM reminds me of Cabaret Voltaire and Front 242 circa 1985.  Most industrial music has always had repetitive lyrics, which makes Copy kind of a little sarcastic start to HM.  It's new it's old it's industrial done by NIN.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I decided to watch the series with skepticism, when it was shown on TV, I decided to skip it since it was just another remake of a bad show, then one day I read a letter Edward James Olmos wrote just before starting filming and it intrigued me, the fact that such cast had been ensemble for a re-make! so I decided to watch the first 3 or 4 episodes, I was hooked after the first 20 minutes, and watched the whole series in about 6 weeks (many 4 hours sleep nights), if you appreciate life's journey, do not miss this series which chronicle our own history.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|If you like fashion, Vogue, Merryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and New York, you will love their mix in this smart, fun movie. Is there anyone Merryl Streep can't play? She owns the role of the supposed Anna Wintour (who wore Prada when she and her daughter went to this move) and plays her as a cold, perfectionist witch. Hathaway goes from gawky to glam in a New York overnight after being eviscerated by Wintour aka Miranda Priestly.<br /><br />Emily Blunt and Stan Tucci round out the brilliant acting ensemble, with Emily playing the unfortunate former assistant to Anna/Miranda and Stan playing the wise art director and fashion coach to Hathaway's character, Andy. I can watch this movie every year. If you think it would be fun to work in the fashion industry, this may make you change your mind.<br /><br />I usually like a book better than the movie that brings it to life but, in this instance, this movie has the advantage of showing us all of that fabulous fashion and the glamorous backdrop of the fashion world.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|Why did I buy this film...it's got Rachael McAdams.  While Ms. McAdams delivers a brilliant performance as always, I have enjoyed other films of hers more, hence this rating.  That isn't to say that I did not enjoy this film (4 stars, remember.)  Harrison Ford perfectly plays the aged reporter who is contractually obligated to host a morning talk show alongside Diane Keaton (I still can't be sure which part of this idea appeals to him less) with McAdams behind the scenes as the show's workiholic producer...sidenote, Jeff Goldblume was awsome as her boss who wanted to be behind her but needed the ratings to justify himself.  It's a crime that he wasn't given more screen time.  Anyway, Ford portrays his struggle to continue to be taken serious as a journalist, going so far as to kidnap McAdams (hey, he stole my idea) in order to expose the governor's illegal activities (the Governor of New York involved in something illegal?  Wonder what gave them that idea.)  McAdams is awsome as the fierce producer who seeks to keep everyone, including Ford, in line and to boost the show's ratings.  Wether or not you are a fan of morning talk shows, watch this movie.  If nothing else, it's enjoyable to watch Rachael McAdams and funny to watch Ford and Keaton fight.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love this book. The main character is a very likable guy. You can get caught up in this series of books, always waiting for the next book to come out.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Owen Wilson and Rachael McAdams together again...at least since wedding crashers, and that is just the first (though a very good) reason to watch this exquisite piece of filmmaking.  Director Woody Allen takes to the streets of Paris, both here and in the 1920s.  Wilson and McAdams helm a wonderfully talented cast that includes Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, David Lowe, and Marion Cotillard.  These fine actors and more bring to live such historical figures as  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and Pablo Picasso.  Woody Allen made no bad choices as he brought this project together, giving me both a sense of nostalgia and a desire to see Paris...perhaps in the rain, though I'd have to check what my girlfriend thinks of that last part.  For now, I will enjoy this film time and time again and I encourage you to do the same.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Great read. I am hooked on the Harry Bosch series. I've gone back and started at the beginning, You should also.
0374533555|5.0|Well written. Kahnmen book is interesting and has many wonderful points about how we think & what makes us think the way we do.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I loved the plot line. I love the way Michael Connelly writes this character. I am trying to read them in the order that they were written. So far I haven't been disappointed.
1400069289|5.0|One of the best books I have read all summer.  Well written / not boring...and gives a great preceptive on the way habits controls the way we do things.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Especially if you do not have the understanding that the universe is what we make it. Four more words NOW!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch should receive the Academy Award for his role in this movie.  He made the movie.  I have seen him in three other very different movies, and he is totally different in each movie and each role.  At last an actor!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Knowing that &#34;There is nothing new under the sun.&#34; does not ease my sense of unease about taking ideas from other artists. This book addresses that feeling, and basically helps one to &#34;get&#34; that we all take ideas from some other source.<br /><br />Nice to remind oneself.
B008469DGY|4.0|I don't normally write reviews but this was worth the time. After reading some of other people's reviews I wasn't sure if I wanted to bother with the app but I took a chance and I am glad that I did. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and would recommend anyone to get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Give it a try and you will love it. I just started today and it is a blast. In the beginning it was tough but slow but surely I got it.
B0013ND30W|2.0|Sleeping Beauty has always been my all time favorite fairy tale. I had seen it in the movies years ago, and I had purchased it as a videocassette. When I did not have it any more I had hoped for the longest  time that it would be available again. To make a long story short I do not care for the &#34;extra features&#34; on the Blu ray since I find them to be a waste of time. The DVD was ok, but overall I did not care for the package.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|Just love this album.  Playful and a joy to listen to.  So glad he continues to deliver with the great tunes.  Want a pick-me-up?  Listen to Mika.  That frowny face will disappear.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|A little silly, twists you won't expect and fairly clean. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.
B0000630W0|5.0|Love this overlooked AP jem.  Unique but it's good stuff!  I'd recommend it to anyone who loves the genius of Alan Parsons!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great way to  pass your time it's really nice if you like minion rush.It has lots of cool updates every month.
B00069MQBG|4.0|Really wonderful music on this CD.  Love it!  Delta Goodrem has done it again.  Unfortunately she's not well known over here in the USA.  Hopefully she'll get the chance to &#34;break into&#34; the American market and get the exposure she deserves.
B002CM03PQ|5.0|We watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We haven't watched the bonus CD's that came with it, but we are sure they will be just as interesting.  It even came with a tambourine!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I thought, and I can only imagine the horror that they suffered, knowing their childs life was in constant<br />danger.  Guido was infectious to everyone.  I wish we all could live our life with this kind of hope and enthusiastic ways.<br />I clearly see his win for the best actor academy award that year.  I will watch it over and over again, it makes me feel<br />better about life in general.
0425238091|5.0|not want to ever get sick and have to be admitted to a hospital. Healthcare is such an unpleasant topic these days anyway.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean At The End Of The Lane- I think it is an extraordinary book which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. The author makes one realise our innerself is untouchable - it s hard to explain.....it makes you think as you did as a child when you constantly adapt to the world, but you haven t lost or changed your essence.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Movie ok bit long at times we do like iron man.<br /><br />First one was the best for me.<br /><br />Still like that we watch this as family.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Love the game all I want is to be the zombies again like they did in part 1 hope they have another part with zombie update its the only game I would play like everyone it keep doin what your doin glu
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Should be - star paid for movie t never downloaded:(<br />Tried a second time should of none better. It able to see last part of the movie it got stuck several times.
1616551607|5.0|Fantastic art collection. There's art in there from I-X. Ou downside is the book containing VII-X is the smallest :/<br /><br />Other than that it's really fantastic work. Great case. Books are out together very well.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|love it thank you best tv show in the entire world cant ait till the next season to come out
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is the best app I have. Everyone needs to have this alarm clock app. It has helped me in so many ways-on time for appointments, waking up in the morning. I could go on and on. As I said before you need to have this app.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix brings heart and imagination rarely seen in the YA fantasy genre. The story is classic, one young woman with a few companions, standing alone against an incredibly powerful force - but the character and world development will leave your heart racing and your head spinning in the best ways possible. The necromancy aspect of the series is particularly exciting, using music to control the dead. This book is the first in the Abhorsen trilogy, which is a must-read for anyone who enjoys this type of fantasy.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This has been extremely useful for me, it's very useful for debugging files and accessing my downloads, especially due to how unfriendly the kindle fire can be at times.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|A Beautifully written story - mesmerizing and quite unputdownable. I think I need to read some more of Neil Gaiman's books!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a good app, and it's exactly what you'd expect.  If you like it on any other OS, whether it be windows, mac, iPhone or Android, you'll like it on Amazon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You will love this book, I know I did thank you John Green for this magnificent book. Love this book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|OMG!! Awesome show... I laugh, and cried. I still overwhelmed from the season final episode. Please bring Matthew back, poor Mary. What can I say... I love it, and cant wait until the new season starts. I'm counting the months down.
B00BC24NT4|1.0|I struggled to get through three-quarters and in the end gave up.  Anti-American leftish garbage with a bureaucrat for a hero.  I expected better.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Not compatible with: Samsung Note II, Google Nexus 7 (FHD), Samsung Galaxy Tab, HTC Sensation 4G<br />Also states that its not compatible with my former devices:<br />Asus Transformer, Galaxy Note N7000, Nexus One<br /><br />Seems like there is some kind of bug with the app that is blacklisting everything?
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the wonderful first book in a trilogy, but can stand alone with no trouble. It is beautifully written, with carefully drafted characters and landscapes. It's action-packed, suspenseful, heartbreaking, romantic, and terribly funny. It is my favorite book of all time, so much that my daughter was very nearly named Sabriel! If I have another girl, she might just be!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This was the first season I watched Doctor Who, and it was awesome. Very creative and exciting, and the characters are great! There's just always something new and interesting about it. And The Doctor is an incredible character!
1451695195|3.0|Many years ago, in 1976, I required a surgical procedure and because I was and still am allergic to most anesthesia, the doctor used a drug called ketalar ? or ketamine, which puts you out but also causes hallucinations as you are coming out of it - and these last for several hours, but it was considered a safer alternative to the anesthesia of the day. Fast Forward...<br /><br />When I read this book (bought it at Cosco while shopping with my sister who recommended I read it )what struck me was,\\"Where have I heard/seen/experienced these same sensations or realities that makes them so familiar?\\" Then I remembered my surgical experience of almost 40 years ago. After the surgery I asked my doctor about what I experienced (as it had all the components the author described) and he said they were not unusual for that drug. Does Dr. Eben's experience or my experience prove heaven exists - I don't think so - but it does prove how creative the brain is under the influence of chemicals.<br /><br />What I mostly noticed about this book was how well he could remember such details of everything, including what his friends, family, wife, and children all felt and experienced. Why aren't there more testimonials from physicians, nurses and others who attended to his near-death experience? I enjoy the topic so I gave it an O.K. rating, but as someone else said \\"Heaven sells\\" - so this was a slam dunk best seller from the gate - but how credible it is, only time will tell.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I watched all the episodes but they really started losing me at about 2.5 seasons when it transformed into an everyday soap opera.
B00338QENI|5.0|I found this book to be excellent . I learn about Mrs. Lacks story when reading in my grad program. I truly didn't know about her while I was in high school.  The author wrote the story from the family's perspective of Mrs. Lack life and their search to find out what she was like and what happened to her. In the time era in which Mrs. Lacks lived it was different for African Americans, although she did receive medical treatment many ethical issues arise when it came to consent and concealing information to patients and their families.New laws and codes of standard/ethics in which Medical personnel are to practice have changed as a result of such cases as Mrs. Lacks. It is so sad that her family members couldn't afford health insurance and wasn't even compensated for their mother's cells being sold and used to make the world such a better place for everyone. She truly touched so many people lives before and after her death. The author never waiver in her commitment and compassion in helping the family in so many ways that others never attempted because they only wanted to know about the cells and not the true woman. I am very blessed to have read the story of Mrs Henrietta Lacks I will never forget it. I will encourage others to read about her. Thank you Ms. Skloot.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This was my favorite season. The characters gave their all against incredible adversity. The show did not take the easy way out of any situation.
9382951008|3.0|Persians and Afghanis hold their poets in high esteem. A hospital in Kabul, Rabia Balkhe, is named for a a woman poet-activist. I found the story to be well written in the Farsi tradition, but with a wandering tendency. It will reach an audience that wants to dwell in thoughts and angst of characters who lived the Afghan experience. I'm more of an ADHD type of person and sometimes had to go back and reread. I preferred Kite Runner, but Hosseini is, undoubtedly a talented author and Afghanistan is well served by humanizing it.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I wish that we could just transplant Sam Waterston's performance as Nick into this movie.  Then, it would be a 5 star entry.  Tobie Maguire was the weak link in an otherwise strongly acted film.  But nothing will ever match F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel.  Still, I hope they keep trying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is the best game that I have ever played. It is very entertaining and easy to do.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is one of his new favorite game's now he been on this for like the hole day like really must be fun maybe all play it on his iphone and give it a try I hope he does not read this
B005DD7TI0|5.0|So well put together I loved it both times I watched it. Bradley cooper is awesome, perfect for the role
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I really like this movie, but some parts of it at the end could be a little bit scary for little kids. Otherwise it's very magical.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A subject not very often a topic of discussion, but well worth reading about. A great tear jerker to read on vacation.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|The feature that was the most fun was the selection of costumes for your monkey boxer. I DO NOT LIKE THIS GAME.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love the series. Hated the ending. But what do you expect? American Horror Story has a way of making you want more.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|i enjoy how people are when I know, they know they're on camera!  but it did cost too much for the extras...probably could have found it online for free...
0060254920|5.0|This book has worked its way into a tradition in our household. I have a 6 month old son and we usually read this book on the weekends. We are now &#34;wild things' obsessed. Classic read.
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|Have a listen. Love to crank &#34;Carousel&#34; by night driving around atop wheels. Won't you do the same? Let's rock!
0920668372|5.0|So, I bought this book to read to my baby boy. I stared reading and thought that it was a sweet story. As I continued reading, my eyes filled with tears and my voice became shaky as we reached the last few pages. I absolutely love it. I hope my son enjoys hearing me read it to him .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I think it is so cool and a great learning game about horses. I am going to probably play this game all the time.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|Tottaly rocking and get amazing 1unmentioned flaw you can't save them on kindle fire hd in the best way possible to do this so yeah pretty much it.
B001230JXC|5.0|This was their best album and still sounds as good today as it did when it came it.It is the quintessential one to have from these guys.They were truly at the top of their game and still never have gotten the respect they so richly deserve.If you buy this album you will see why.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I have not read the reviews before watching the movie. This might not be the wisest move but it worked for me. The story turned out to be so standard that it was not hard to guess each step and the end. However that does not distract from the fun. You might even want to watch it again to see the subtle clues and not so subtle clues.<br /><br />I was surprised by the mix of actors. Seeing Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman playing virtually the same characters that they played in many movies saved time in trying to figure them out in the story.<br /><br />For the technical, I only saw the Blu-ray version. Blu-ray is no longer unique but they also did not have to create extra CGI to show it off.<br /><br />The story:<br /><br /> It is after the war (Earth vs. aliens) naturally we won or you would not be seeing the movie. However the Earth is a goner and everyone moved to a move of Titan. The effective team of Jack and Victoria are cleaning up the last of the oceans needed for their new home.<br /><br />Only Jack seems to see some inconsistencies in his life and mission. Slowly a truth is reviled. Jack may be pressured to take sides and act.
B00EQUP3Q6|4.0|Trent has done it again.He has reached into his bag of tricks and included some sounds from earlier albums.While also adding some new twists and turns throughout each track on his new album.It takes a few listens to grow on you as a whole album.It starts off loud,goes a little mellower and then finishes strong.There is plenty to like about these songs still a few tracks kind of sound like some of his other work.I even heard a sample from the first Final Fantasy game.While it is not his best effort it is more than worth getting.His tone seems to have softened a bit which is a nice change from all the negative energy he usually exudes.It is best enjoyed at home not while driving though.Yet I will keep it in my rotation for quite awhile.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it long time.....best app ever. I hope they come out with many more apps like this one so I can write many more reviews like this one.
1401938906|5.0|I loved this book. I actually looked forward to reading this book each evening. Very easy to read with fun, easy and inexpensive experiments.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Love BSG -- great sci-fi story and drama that remains compelling throughout the series. Looks and sounds great in Blu-Ray.
0064471837|5.0|The world of the Old Kingdom is fascinating and beautifully drawn - it really feels alive and the descriptions in the book make it come to life in a very rich way. It's also very different to most of the other fantasy settings that I've read and has remained so despite the years it has been out. The way death and the 7 bells work is really interesting. The excellence of the world building is happily matched by the characters, particularly Sabriel herself. Definitely worth a read if you are looking for more female characters in your reading!
B00C2IJJDM|5.0|I LOVE this movie! Great motion picture, with great special effects! Would absolutely recommend to anyone! The steelbook packaging is BEAUTIFUL!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Very well written. Characters are easy to love. I read in only a few days! I don't believe in reviews with spoilers so with that being said buy the book and read!
B007SGM084|3.0|I read this trilogy after some co-workers and friends raved about how good these books were. After being harassed so much, I finally \\"caved\\" and checked them out of the library due to not wanting to purchase them because of  my children coming across these books.  I really did not think that these books were my kind of books. With that said, my first thoughts were immediately that the author was not original in her characters. I am a twilight fan to the fullest and I immediately saw Edward and Bella. Honestly in my opinion the only difference between fifty shades and Twilight is that there is tons of graphic sex scenes in fifty shades and there are vampires/werewolves in twilight. A lot of the dialog was very similar to the dialog of Twilight. After getting into the first book I was really thinking I was not going to read the 2nd or 3rd book. I have to admit that the ending of the 1st book made me want to read the 2nd one, then I did just continue to the 3rd book.  IF you can keep an open mind about the books they are not a bad read.. but I would not purchase these books. If I ever want to reread I would just recheck them out at the library. I am giving a 3 stars because I really though the books were just ok. I wouldn't rave about them, I am disappointed that the books were not written on it own standing. The author was just trying to grab some of the spotlight that Twilight received. The plot is in Seattle WA, Ana birthday is 3 days before Bella Swan's birthday. Christian views himself as a monster just as Edward in twilight. Ana sees herself as ordinary as Bella saw herself.  if I wanted to read twilight over I would just pick up the original copy of the book.
B00CHILW64|2.0|The movie was well done and did tug at my heart strings.  What really turned me off was the efforts and handstands the director went thru to make sure there was absolutely no mention of, no picture of, no oblique reference to religious faith.  It is stupid to imagine that at least some people in this situation would not turn to their faith for help to manage.  It is also stupid to imagine that there would not be a single religious figure, priest, minister, rabbi, imam or whatever on the scene anywhere.<br />I found this somewhat insulting and totally unrealistic.
B007EZJKS2|5.0|AMAZING<br />PERFECT PETER AS USUAL<br />FABULOUS  ILLUSTRATIONS VIVID CLEAR PICTURES TO FOLLOW A TIMELESSS TALE<br />CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW MOVIE!!!!
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Chris Andersen has done a spectacular job of capturing the essence, spirit, energy and potential of the maker movement.  This is both a well informed overview and marvelously useful manual.  The author blends the origins, evolutions and future of this phenomenon in a way that's both intriguing and entertaining.  If you want to get &#34;up to speed&#34; with regard to the maker culture, then this is, hands down, a perfect place to start.  I hope we'll hear more from Mr. Andersen on this topic since it's unfolding at warp speed -- a lot has happened in the year since this book was published, nearly all of which was accurately predicted by the writer.
B007P9ELWC|5.0|If you're an OSI fan, you have to get this album. I have all of them and listen to them religiously, but this one... wow. It sticks with the usual OSI feel, but maybe a little more mellow as a whole than the other OSI albums, but still has plenty of heavy moments- a great dynamic and blend of sweet and spicy. Indian Summer is my favorite OSI of all time now and Wind Don't Howl is not far behind.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|I've owned this very app before from the Google Play Store before. I liked it very much and decided I'd like to buy it to get rid of ads. Turns out there was no 'buy' option. Instead all I had to download a few other apps, run them and finally delete them. Voila, one free equalizer app add-free. That said there's no point in paying for this app, even though it works. Secondly my only real down side to this app is that the bass boost gives every other range a kind of muffled sound. There's the virtualizer to compensate for this but I feel it falls a little short. Long and short is I ended up, after a year and a half of using this one, switching to Bass Booster pro which does the same as this app but better and cheaper. For only a $1 on Google Play it doesn't have the muffled sound and has a variety of other options including a free version. This is good but not great. Three stars for the second best EQ app avail. The loss of the second star is for the asking price when it's not the FAOTD.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|Okay. I knew going into it that this movie was pretty bad. But I couldn't resist the idea of glimpsing sexy Rachel McAdams playing lesbian. Or bisexual. Or I don't know what she was... crazy, kinky, controlling BUT UTTERLY HOT power slut.<br /><br />Christine (Rachel McAdams) is the very manipulative and ambitious boss of a big ad agency abroad. Hoping to make it to New York City, she takes credit for the ideas of an attractive employee she likes to flirt with... setting off a chain of retaliation and revenge. I was enjoying the initial seduction. But it doesn't go ANYWHERE you really want it to go if you're hoping for some appealing chemistry and fooling around.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams seems to be reprising her shallow Mean Girls blonde... all grown up, in charge, and probably a closet lesbian. She has this thing going with a slender male employee who wears a feminine mask when they boink, and I had a great laugh over the strap on he pulls out of her drawer (but no, we don't get to see her wear one dammit, lol)... unfortunately, we never get to see her play out her fantasies with any women either. Disappointing. Lustful looks and a few hugs and kisses is all the f/f action in this movie. Meh. Just another silly psycho lesbian thriller... a 1980s throwback.<br /><br />McAdams was awesome and believable in Mean Girls... here I couldn't buy her as the boss with the similar persona (and looks). Too immature and crazy. I don't know. It just didn't work. But she sure was beautiful and stylishly dressed in any case. And when the movie only focuses on the brunette the last half hour... how dull it was. I laughed out loud at the ending, though I probably wasn't supposed to. Oh hell, I laughed all through this story even though I probably wasn't supposed to!! omg... this was so bad, lol. It shoulda been made as a (black) comedy. Regina George wasn't meant to be in any other genre. But I loved how stylish the filming was and how beautiful Rachel McAdams was. Disappointed she didn't get to play full on lesbian (yep, that's all I came here to find)... but what can I say. When you're a fan, you sit through the bad stuff, lol....
B009A9EPLM|5.0|I LOVE THE WAY JOHN WILLIAMS DOES THIS SCORE. IT IS SIMPLE AND NICE THERE ARE SOME CIVIL WAR<br /> SONGS. BUT HE DOES IT SIMPLE AND LOVELY.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This account of true heroism is awesome! A great read start to finish. Unbelievable sacrifices made for our freedoms that so many Americans take for granted everyday.
1476733953|5.0|I was turned onto this book I believe during a Reddit discussion about post-apocalyptic stories, of which I'm a huge fan. So I purchased the Wool omnibus and added it to the \\"unread\\" stack. Finally I got around to reading it, and I am so glad I did. I'm even happier to have just discovered there are two sequels!!! I just purchased the second and third in the Silo series and will be reading them straight away (I just finished Wool).
B004YM6JI2|5.0|What can I say about this.  We have every season and season 8 is on the way so waiting on it,
B003H4I4JU|5.0|It's more than just a novel, it's a philosophical and psychological inquiry into human behaviors and beliefs concerning others (be it species or aliens). Orson Scott Card does an excellent job of engaging the imagination of the reader. Couldn't put the book down!
B007C3TVEY|5.0|Does justice to the novel . Would think Lionel Shriver(author) was pleased.Wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography . Don't know why this did not go mainstream.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This is a fun app if you have time to kill and very entertaining. Just be aware if you want the full version you have to pay for it. But other than that, enjoy! :)
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This book literally kept me reading! I never saw the end coming. I recommend this book to all readers who like courtroom drama, twists, turns and suspense.  A great book.
B007MDB71O|5.0|If you like Edgar Rice Burroughs, you will LOVE John Carter!  It was true to the book and full of action and adventure!  The casting was perfect, and scenery just as described in the novel.  Disney should be ashamed of themselves for not making a sequel just because it was not a box office hit!!! They have enough money!!!! It was very imaginatively produced and rivaled AVATAR and the likes!  I loved it Disney...please make a sequel !!!!

0064471837|5.0|I have read this book so many times and each time I find something new and am charmed by the unique characters. so awesome
0439023483|2.0|Such a rip off of Battle Royale. Even the little details are stolen from Battle Royale. It's just the PG, less interesting version.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I read this fascinating book in one sitting. It's an incredibly interesting page turner. The history of the Jews and Romans of that time period alone is worth the read, and the respectful speculations about Jesus was riveting.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book makes you think about what is important in life but also makes you wish you had know this wonderful man.
B00BFV1K0M|2.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed Thr Hunger Games, I was disappointed by Catching Fire. I found it disjointed and the story flow was weak. The arena experience was nowhere near as convincing or riveting as in the first book.<br />I did however enjoy the last page and in some ways learned what to avoid in my own writing.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Immediately eliminated at least  half the static from a radio station I can usually only listen to Roku. Just adjusted the settings like a previous comment advised.
0307341550|4.0|When the frenzy surrounding Gone Girl started, I eagerly grabbed a copy and devoured it in days. It left me with chills and make me feel a little sick. I was interested in Ms. Flynn's previous books, but with the holidays approaching, I picked much lighter reading materials. I finally picked up Dark Places last month and read it in days. I was still hungry for more and immediately ran out to grab Sharp Objects.<br />I knew to layer a lighter fare in between, so I just got around to Sharp Objects this week. And I loved it! It isn't nearly as evolved as Ms. Flynn's later books, but it has a deeply interesting, if somewhat cliche, story. I tore through the pages anytime I had a free moment. The book gets slower about 1/3rd of the way through and some characters are never fully explored. I often wonder why the protagonist's father is ever mentioned beyond the initial confession of never knowing him. The stepfather Alan also seemed to lack any type of characterization. I understand he is meant to be dull, but he seems utterly under developed. The ending was interesting, though not unexpected.<br />I suspect I'll never look at dollhouses quite the same again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoyable and easy. You can test yourself to try to beat your previous scores. Recommend to any and all age groups.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Same great animation and voice acting, same writer, same director. It's basically a two parter with a nice new musical style and and and humans , one of which is actually a pretty pony princess,  pretty high quality throughout, I'd recommend it...<br /><br />...I have to say it, lol almost interspecies romance.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|The movie avatar was about a soldier who was hurt on the battle field and was left with both his legs dysfunctional. Jack Sully, was a paraplegic, He was only called back to duty only because the military needed him, but not to fight for he was not even able to walk. They needed him because his brother was a scientists who was working on a planet called Pandora. He was killed and to work on what he was working on they needed his DNA. They were only there to discover it and work around it but found out about the others living there and in order to not look odd, they created `Avatars' in which Jack found the people and made connections with them. He fell in love with one of the `Navi' people. After falling in love he did everything to stop them from ruining their sacred lands in order to obtain a priceless gem, or rock they would call it.<br />This movie is an overall good movie and really well relates to a lot of things. In regards to world religions, it shows us how where ever we go we need to tread lightly and make sure as to what we are doing and how it affects others. For in the movie where the Military just ran into the lands and then were threaten when they started to fight back they went and crushed everything they walked on. May it have been plants, animals, anything? I feel really bad for the Navi people when the military wanted to give them  a warning to they were coming and did not care about them, they gassed the people and took down their `Tree' which was home. They did this and it reminded me of how they just went on thinking they could do this and not really give a thought as to why these people had it sacred and if they wanted to get something out of this, they needed to respect their ways, and respect their beliefs. For this was their land and the military just barged in and ruined families, killed many honorable people of their tribes. Just to get a priceless gem.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|This is a great EQ app that vastly improves sound quality. However the widget they advertise in the description does not exist in my Galaxy Tab. A slider EQ would easily make this a 5-star app.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|I'm a sucker for fairy tales -- I especially liked the unique twists added to the classic plot in this production.  Great cast, great special effects, great fun!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This product is clear and easy to use. I love the color options and the clarity in knowing how much battery life is remaining on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is the battery drain by this app.<br /><br />Still it's a nice enough app to keep and use!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Can't wait to see the characters come to life in the movie. I have enjoyed the first story so far.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I just love this show, especially when the lawyers be planning their cases. They research and do a lot of maneuvering just to win a case.
2877065081|5.0|I just got the product and the book is great for those in advance french. Compared to other french readings such as Asterix it is pretty advanced.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I find it very helpful that all the entire file list can be readily accessed to choose which file will be viewed and that there are choices available for viewing Ppt files. Makes speaking from a slideshow presentation extra easy.

B00A285OOW|3.0|I was so excited to read this book - i had been waiting YEARS for it.  I prepurchased it in May and waited patiently for it to auto download in July.  I tore through the book in a day ... but was pretty disappointed with the story told.  Perhaps Elizabeth of York wasnt as strong as the women that came before her so the story was a bit of a let down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love loved it still wanting more wishing there was another trilogy. These books have captivated me over and over again
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Just started this series a few weeks ago. It is a fun read. She  had me invested in the characters from the start.

It makes you use your brain which is a great change from most games! But it's not too much of a riddle that you'll want to chuck your kindle at the wall ya know. Lol I thought it was super cool. Two thumbs up!! Just wish it had more rooms for me to break out of! Haha

B0090KZDSK|3.0|Enjoyed the series to date & character development but with this book it is obvious that the $$ are the motivation. If your invested in the series you will still enjoy the journey but it doesn't come close to its predecessors.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was awesome though I must admit. SPOILER ALERT:It's hard to keep reading after Gus dies. However, still agood read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a pretty good game I guess not really into horses so it doesn't do much for me but people who do like horses it's great for.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Like others says you need patience with this game. I love this game and they don't ask for your money. All you need is energy to play and if you run out then have patience and let the energy fill up again. The games are so much fun and its worth purchasing this game if you love hidden object games and challenging puzzles.

B0040QYROK|4.0|Metropolis (1927 - restored) Bowling for Movies Score: 198 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />Metropolis - we don't own this one but watched it streaming<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />Freder, son of Joh Fredersen, ruler of Metropolis, leads a charmed life full of visits to a pleasure garden.  Maria, a beautiful and mysterious woman, comes up from the depths and Freder falls in love.  This begins a chain of events which no one could have predicted.  Turns out the city is run entirely on the blood, sweat, and tears of the people who live in the underground.  Freder finds out and becomes even more enthralled with Maria when he is asked to be the mediator - between the rich of the above-ground and the poor of the under-ground.  This does not work well for Joh Frederson, who employs the help of Rotwang, your local mad scientist.  Rotwang has ideas of his own, intertwined with unrequited love and the death and resurrection of someone that both men loved.  This all works out into a story of revolution and eventually, understanding.<br /><br />This movie (to us) was really a study in extremes.  The story shares the extremes of wealth and poverty in the future city of Metropolis.  The character of Maria (portrayed by the lovely Brigitte Helm) is as moral and upstanding a citizen as could be possible in such deplorable condition as the undercity - she is the essence of beauty, hope, and moderation; later, after she has been transformed into the mechanical wonder, she is all things corrupt, rotten, and deplorable - a real life Whore of Babylon.  We were subjected to the evils of industrialists who attempt to exploit, control, and rule over the masses; we saw the ugliness of mob rule as the revolting workers' destroy the machines which run the cities without regard for the safety of their own families.  The movie itself is a visual splendor - incredible special effects for the day; exotic / erotic images of decadence; on the other hand, I fell asleep (not once but twice) as the slow pace of the story and musical accompaniment lulled me into slumber.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />~ The special effects were just awesome, even by today's standards; while I completely understand modern movies rely (too much) on CGI generated imagery, you have to respect the level of artistry involved in bringing Metropolis and Machine Maria to life; a science-fiction revolution for sure.<br />~ The imaginary city of Metropolis was not unlike a modern city of today - skyscraper, uh, scraping the sky, elevated freeways, angry mobs trashing their own neighborhoods when something goes wrong with the fabric of society.<br />~ The movie beautifully illustrated the disparaging chasm between rich and poor - class divisions which have plagued humankind likely from the beginning.<br />~ This is a masterpiece of pure German expressionism with exquisite cinematography and stylistically =  art-deco everything.<br />~ Machine Maria was quite the sex-pot performing her seductive Whore of Babylon dance... I'm sure she inspired all sorts of naughty thoughts back in the roaring 20s.<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />~ I did not like the Biblical imagery and subtle references.  It was just not my thing.  I think that the story could have been told without all the savior allegories.<br />~ It was really significantly longer than it needed to be.  The story could have been told in probably an hour less time.<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

B00DDXJRJG|5.0|As I sat listening with very expensive headphones I couldn't imagine my music sounding much better, but I am pleased to say that this app has proved me wrong! The sound improvement is significant. It works with audio programs not listed,  but the VU meter doesn't work on some programs,  but that is tolerable.  What's really missing is a true widget. When you run it, you have a widget of sorts,  but you don't have a widget to keep on your desktop if you want it. I was  going to rate it a 4 because of the shortages but the sound improvement is significant enough to merit all five stars regardless.

B003G4W49C|4.0|A great book ,classic science fiction. Some have said they can't wait for the movie to come out. But my anticipation is tempered by what Hollywood did to dune. In the hands of the right director it could be an instant classic or it could be another hatchet job. That said I would love to see ringworld made into a movie

0064471837|5.0|When I was ten years old, my grand mother presented me with an audio cassette, read by Tim Curry. I was a late bloomer when it came to reading, (I learnt to read that year) so I listened to audio tapes. My mum, after reading the blurb for Sabriel, asked my older brother to listen to it first, in case it was too scary. He came back a couple of days later and said it wasn't, but I shouldn't listen to it going to sleep. I remember how proud I felt that I was brave enough to listen to a story like Sabriel, and at ten years old I loved every second of it. That a young woman could be the hero, that no-one in the story was obsessed with how she looked, though she was obviously beautiful. I loved the journey Sabriel goes on, from a world very like ours, to one with a fascinating magic, a talking cat and a house built at the top of a waterfall. Several years later, when the second book in the trilogy came out, I bought it with delight and read it. Lirael is a brilliant continuation of the story of the Abhorsens. It was after I had read Lirael that I decided to buy the book of Sabriel read it, for the first time. I listened to the audio tape so many times, I could quote sections of it! However, reading the book was an entirely new experience. The way it is written flow smoothly, and it is certainly not a children's book. The relationships between all of the characters are wonderfully real, and for me that is what truly matters in a fantasy setting. No matter how fantastical the magic, the cities the landscape and the concepts are, as long as the relationships are real and believable then it is worth reading. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves fantasy, thrillers, action and horror. Especially fantasy and horror, because Sabriel has some moments that are not for the faint of heart.<br />I have read this book at the very least ten times, and have no idea how many times I've listened to it. It has been a constant companion and is well worth a read.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|What a beautiful portrayal of turn of the century England. The characters are quite charming... Life was hard, yet simple back then...oh where did all the complexity come from....I have enjoyed the whole series immensely.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie...the soundtrack is amazing as well.  Leondardo was excellent as he always is!  Will be watching over and over again!
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I really enjoyed this activity monitor, for at least 3 weeks.  I have a couple of the other Withings products, the scale and the blood pressure cuff.  Both work very well.  This also did for a while.  Set up was easy.  It worked seamlessly.<br /><br />The for some reason, it stopped making a full connection.  It seemed to think it was connecting.  When it was finished it would show the cute check mark that indicates a successful sync, but it wouldn't have actually delivered any information from the pulse to my iPhone.  Frustrating to run for an hour and then not get credit for it.<br /><br />I'm hoping that this is a software glitch that they will fix.  I have hopes for it and do like other Withings products.  In the meantime, I'd advise holding off buying until they fix the thing.
0451196716|4.0|THE STORY WAS VERY INTENSE AND COMPLETELY HELD MY INTEREST THROUGHOUT.  I COULDN'T WAIT TO FINISH THE BOOK TO FIND OUT THE END OF THE STORY.  TO SAY THE LEAST, I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I REACHED THE END OF THE STORY AS IT WAS SO WEAK AND DISAPPOINTNG AND CONFUSING.  IT WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN.  VERY DISAPPOINTING AFTER BEING SO PUMPED UP BY THE ENGROSSING WRITING OF MY FAVORITE AUTHOR, STEPHEN KING.  I AM AN AVID STEPHEN KING FAN AND HAVE READ ALL HIS BOOKS, SOME OF THEM TWICE.  THIS ONE WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I found the reasoning processes undergone by the characters, especially in their contradictions and the outcomes after very real to life.  However I didn't always enjoy the writing, a little too prosaic.  But I admit to a few chuckles.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is the most imaginative and beautifully written book I have read in a long time.<br /> The fantastic images, so lushly described, are like poetry.<br />The characters are well developed and unfold like an elegant fan. The story is unique and<br />creatively composed like a fine piece of art. This book has the brilliance and depth<br />of a rare jewel.<br />I eagerly await Erin Morganstern's next novel. She is a master of words and vision.<br />There are so many books to read and so little time but I will read Night Circus again!
193700788X|5.0|It was a really good book! I'm fine with how it ended, just wish there was alittle more dialogue and action with the vampire side of things, but otherwise I liked it a lot! Wish that it would continue......
B00AZRP2GA|4.0|Only thing I'd like to know is where does the &#34;consciousness&#34; of a Ghost Brigade soldier come from? Otherwise very enjoyable.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I really like this series and bought it so we can watch at the cottage too. Filmed in Toronto, very odd I had to buy this in the States and bring it back home.<br /><br />This is the story of Sarah Manning ... and a host of her 'twins' all the result of cloning experiments some years before by neolutionists who had the embryos birthed by surrogates and have been secretly tracking and monitoring their lives through the secret placement of someone very close to them. The ones in this series have become 'self aware', they have found out about each other and someone has been trying to knock them off. Some appear to have some medical issues, others psychological.<br /><br />Sarah has a troubled past being raised by a foster mom and very much the rebel. The story starts with Sarah's arrival in 'New York' (the only time New York is mentioned). She has come with the objective of picking up her daughter whom she left with her foster mom almost a year earlier and wants to get away with her to a new life. She is at a train platform where she encounters one of her twins (Beth) for the very first time -- who shockingly commits suicide in front of her. Sarah, needing to become difficult to find from her abusive ex, takes Beth's identity and becomes embroiled in the drama of discovering who she is.<br /><br />It is all very well done and Tatiana Maslani does a convincing job with the many clone characters, their foibles and accents.
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|This is a great prequel flashback to the Halo universe, but if you don't know anything about Halo this could be frustrating to watch.  All I can say is, give it a chance.  It makes a ton more sense if watched completely.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Felt that the writing was sub par, Halfway through the book, I felt like I was not reading any type of plot. Felt more like a diary on all the people she met in prison.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series! Can't wait for the new season. I also love the fact that I was able to catch up on the last season.
B009AY04A8|3.0|i downloaded this game on my kindle. it was a good game. keeps your eyes working.  just wish it was longer.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I think most are missing the point concerning this movie. It's a story of unconquerable human spirit that produces a love that transcends death!  I almost feel sorry for the film critics because a great steak is never as good as the first time.  Objectivity can be lost due to familiarity with the film industry.  I urge the critics to encounter each movies as an excited opportunity to read another good novel! I loved the fact that despite the efforts of advance alien A.I. entity could not quinch the human spirit!  I the relationship that the main character that Tom Cruise displayed for his sufficient other was noteworthy.  To find that one soul mate is rare but you know when you do find the one! Ladies don't dismiss this movie due to the Sci-Fi and technilogically aspect.  Listen to it with your inner ear and your heart.  I am a former Marine but this movie touched me.  Reminded me of why I put my life on the line for the livelihood of others.  It was a modern day cowboy movie.  The ranger or homesteader is pushed to his limites to protect his land, his family and his livelihood.  Good for you Tom.  I would take you to war anytime.  I know in this film you would have my back!  Siempre fidelis - John Wayne would be proud of Tom's character,pilgrim!  I rented it twice from Red-box and will buy.  I also download the Oblivion song (its the song playing while the closing credits are being displayed by M83 on my mp3 player!  USMC

0062255657|4.0|This book is like a childhood memory and a nightmare with bits of wonder and joy mixed in. It's melancholy and deja vu. It has beauty and ugliness, happiness and terror. It's both entertaining and touching, and I enjoyed it very much.

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I loved this game! Trying to figure out the process to the results is simple t first, but it get more difficult with each level... almost to the point of giving up. It sure is a challenge and that makes it worthwhile. Not an easy game. I just wish it had more levels. I hope there's more to come from this game.

B00DDXJRJG|1.0|Slow to respond, affects playback quality because it makes the audio choppy (and no... Its not due to lack of RAM or a slow tablet. It sucked on my S3 and Galaxy Tab2). The built-in DSP manager on the phone (running Android 4.2.2 with CyanogenMod 10.1.2) is light years ahead and free. The built-in EQ controls on the GTab running stock Samsung TouchWiz are far better and also free.<br />Oh... And to the moron who said this app had 5 channels? No... They are bands or frequency ranges, not channels. They range from lower (bass) frequencies to higher (treble). Alternating every other band is likely to produce a really bad sound.<br />However you set it, it still sucks, and for $4 it really sucks because it's akin to stealing... In my opinion at least. This latest &quot;free app of the day&quot; reminds me why I don't buy any apps from Amazon. I'll stick with the play store where I can get refunds when I accidently buy garbage.
B00AFEY354|5.0|1st of all, it was filmed in Pittsburgh, my hometown. But what a great story. I would recommend it for 14 & up. A real coming of age movie that touched on many social problems of today.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This is one of the craziest action movies I've ever seen. Most of it's hand-to-hand combat and it's incredibly high tension.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|This is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it.  Some people hated it.  However, some Kubrick's fans loved it.  After all many people hated Clockwork Orange.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Two Steps From Hell is great music. Just take a listen and you'll love it. It's that type of music where you can just picture the type of thing that would be happening in a movie that had this music playing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's taken a couple of weeks to read this short book. Not because it wasn't good, it was excellent, it was to process the questions it bring up. The emotions and so much more.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Ghost in the Shell has delivered yet another convoluted situation that Section 9 gets wrapped up in. It feels very much like an extended episode of the show.
B00B19H2KU|5.0|Liked this one a lot!  It's so hard to find a good horror flick nowadays.  Looks like I hit the jackpot on this one :-)
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I bought this because some guy on youtube made a music video that had played To Glory over the fight scenes from Legend of Korra. Now I can't unsee it when I listen, but that's not a bad thing. All the music is still great.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I know now why I didn't see this movie at the theatre ! I bought this movie due to an recommendation of my nephew, he claimed it was very good. Dugh, I do know that it was long, all over the place and boring ! I love Tom Hanks but not that movie !
B007FH22VQ|5.0|Nice mellow music. A band the whole family can enjoy :)<br /> Makes me proud to be part Swedish yes sir.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|We have really liked the King  &  Maxwell  series on tv  so I wanted to see what the<br />books were like. I enjoyed this first one very much, and in fact have ordered number two .  I will try the whole series of K& M
B009WUBERW|5.0|This was better than the first Expendables movie. There was more action, AND it has Chuck Norris! I would definitely recommend this movie!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Th Netflix movie is good, but the book is so much better. You get more of Piper's feelings, and it is much more believable. Piper is a better person than what you see on the show.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Doesn't show lists of similar videos, my son uses this app on his kindle and wants to see similar videos, instead he complains of using up his free time trying to find part 2 of a video.<br /><br />He also says those ads are on everything...
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|To me, this game is just &#34;okay&#34;.  I don't find it to be exciting at all.  I haven't found any suggestions or information anywhere that gives you hints or clues as to how you really play this game successfully.  So far, everything is trial and error.  This game just gets more frustrating everytime I try to play it.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|LOVE IT.  Great FAOTD!  Best through headphones or external speakers than kindle speakers, but the sound can be greatly improved.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Can't believe anyone would give this 1 or 2 stars. I never read the book but the movie is incredibly well done. I was pulled into this movie from start to finish and it was very well put together. The acting was top notch, the film making was top notch, the effects were top notch. It really makes me angry that anyone would give a movie like this 1 or 2 stars compared to all the terrible stuff that gets put out. This is a quality blockbuster movie compared to the dumbed down explosion driven trash that gets released on a regular basis.<br /><br />I assumed this would be terrible because everything usually is and I hate zombie movies. So maybe I went into it with the right mindset. Anyone going into any movie thinking it will be the best movie ever will usually be let down. Maybe that's what all the 1 starrers did<br /><br />Anyway I've never written a review on amazon before and seeing 1 star reviews really irked for this. Particularly one review i saw. People can be stupid... we get it you read the book and it let you down because it didn't include your favorite part in the book or something...sorry bud.<br /><br />EDIT: Just to clarify I wouldn't have given this 5 stars if people were being unfair about it and giving it 1-2 stars. I just wanted to offset the unfairness k thx bye!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun kid friendly game. Simple to use and appropriate for all ages. Horse lover's will enjoy the realistic graphics.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really good game. Just needs more rooms to complete. You really would play the rooms that it has. There are 10 rooms all together.
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|Game was offered as free app of the day however, it's not the full game.  You only get five levels of the games then you required to pay $4.99 for full game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use and encourages you to get back to reading your bible. The bible plans work for me.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|The blade on the bottle cutter was very small and it was difficult to score the bottles properly.  I ended up using my wet tile saw to cut them which worked pretty well.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I'd rank this up there as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They rip off the seventies version left and right, but Leo aint no Robert Redford. This movie is all about plagarazing the other version scene for scene,so I can see why they hired Jay Z. Watch that one it's 1000x better. As the NYTimes said, the book literally spells out the soundtrack so it should have been very easy for the director. Baz Lurhman is not \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\"; he just sucks. This is what you call a \\"feelie\\" to take a phrase from Brave New World- it's all schlock and no substance. It's like a giant commercial made for five year olds or maybe raccoons who only require that their films showcase a lot of shiny objects. I don't see the chemistry between the love interests at all. They totally misunderstood the message of the book and glorified all of the wastefullness of that age. I could not wait to get out of the theater!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is just the funniest, sexiest, most genius book I’ve have ever read. I was dying through the entire book I was laughing so hard. Can't wait to read what Emma Chase has for us in the next book.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a very good game. I like the different stages that you have to go through. I like how the different commanders get you to do things for them. I wish I could get this on my pc.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I hate how it is not that awesome than the second one. But this is also good if you want to play an action game that is awesomely horrible.
B00AIRRDIM|5.0|My family enjoyed watching this movie. No need to worry about language. Good colors in the film. Gets the little ones attention.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|For the money the best I have played so far. Not to easy not to hard. Graphics are good with a decent story line. I would recommend to anyone who likes this style of game
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Gout has a talent of summarizing and explaining fairly complex principles of &#34;manifestation&#34; in such a succinct manner. The only aspect that left me somewhat dubious is giving the universe a schedule or a time limit when a desired manifestation is to occur. Anyway, a great read.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Do you know how hard it is to find a blue face clock, alarm. At a glance weather,alarm, time, and now I can add music too my bed side. And the price,nice. I can leave it plug in, I hope that leaving it plugged in does not hurt my battery. My android is new.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!!!<br />It just keeps getting better as the season keeps going.<br />Grap tissues for the season finale.
B002DQDV6Y|2.0|Kid born to two witches has his life saved by his mother sacrificing her life. An (the?) evil witch is out to kill all the \\"good\\" witches and so the mother sacrifices herself for her son's life--Harry Potter. So we watch him grow up being trained to eventually, by the series' end, fight the evil witch as the son is the \\"chosen one\\". This pretty much sums up the Harry Potter movies, which this review comments on.<br /><br />But the problem here is we have seen this tale many many many times: Star Wars, Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Etc. This is a cheap knock off of all the others before it. And it somehow manages to cheapen the story by interjecting witchcraft, sorcery, black magic, and the occult into the base story line. After all, all of these stories mimic the original--Christ's story. And to do it in a way that is anti-Christian with all this evil witchcraft occult stuff is just sad. Actually it is sick. Surely the author could have come up with something better than a slap in the face, an affront to God, for supplying her the plot that made her rich and famous.<br /><br />Anyway the movies are long. Boring. An annoying part is that before you get to the last 2 in this series the volume is raised so high at certain times and brought so low at others you have to rest your hand on the remote turning up and down the volume constantly. It was extremely annoying. The special effects were mediocre. The dragons and creatures were sad. Actually the entire occult underpinning was pathetic. . . if you can just wave a wand and chant some spell to do anything why be frightened or sad or mad at all? There were scenes that actually were brought to the climax only to let the viewer down. There were some that were elevated beyond what seemed to make sense. I think if I were to witness my mentor and father-figure being killed and thrown over the side of a wall to fall to his death I would grieve a lot more than for some little Lord-of-the-Rings-rehashed creature that only appears twice in the entire series. I mean stuff like that made no sense. If you came back from the dead wouldn't you be ecstatic enough to see your best friends of life enough to give them at least a hand shake? a hug? instead of just standing there looking at one another only to walk off to the next scene . . . not run off with a sense of urgency but walk off casually???? Again just weirdness. If you were a can-do-anything witch why would you drop an infant off with some abusive David-Copperfield-stereotypical-British-Dickens foster family? Again where does that fit in???? Why does it have to be??? No explanation. If you could just hold hangs and disappear to anywhere why be scared when a bunch of rabid spiders are after you to eat you alive? Just disappear to safety. No sense whatsoever. So even the author knowledge of or respect if you will for the occult is immature because if she really knew what it was about she wouldn't be selling it or writing about it let alone mixing children with it. I guess that is why these movies were born out of children's books . . . she knew adults would have problems with the holes in her plot.<br /><br />Anyway I watched all of these in a week as I had never seen them all or read the books before. Never had I gone to the movies to see one. But given the celebration through out the 2000's you couldn't help but know their existence. Heck, I've watched news clips of actual adults letting their kids dress up like witches and goblins and Harry Potter sorcerers as if this is just the modern day Winnie the Pooh gang. But then I watch this and see snakes killing people by eating them or continually stricking them with their fangs leaving the bodies to draw their last breath while soaked in blood. I watch these movies and see spiders crawling around chasing people trying to eat them. I saw kids tied under water by the ankle to a rock on the bottom of a lake left to drown in a \\"game\\". I watch a Satan-like character speaking to a kid and the kid speaking to him. I mean this is not a movie series I would let my kid near, if not for the sacrilege themes but for the adult scenes.<br /><br />Just more cracks in Western Civilization. . . it was our ancestors that fought to eradicate paganism in society.aking to him.

B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Great musicianship that combines the technical aspects of three musicians in the top of the music pyramid. A modern update of the blues rock sound pioneered by Humble Pie, Cream, ZZ Top and many others. Lot's of positive energy, great grooves and wonderful vocals by Ritchie Kotzen. Too many words have been said about all three musicians and their skills. The triad is much more than the  sum of the musical legends that make up the group. One of my favorite releases of 2013. I would love to see these guys tour with Kings X, Rush or ZZ Top. That would make for a great show with power trios.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel. You are Detective Kate - forgot her last name, sorry. The game starts with a woman running through the woods with what looks like a dark shadow chasing her. When the game starts you have amnesia but you start to remember things throughout the game. Not going to say anymore as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. But I will say this - I started this game at 9:00am on Saturday and it is now just after 1am on Sunday morning. Yes, I played it steady all day long and enjoyed it immensely. I can't wait for the sequel. Yes, I know, I said that already but it was that good!
B001FA0H3E|2.0|Some of the old le Carre is still here. The theme is very relevant to the current times, as his stories were during the Cold War. The characters are developed fairly well. The plot moves along very well up to the middle of the book or thereabouts. But then the author starts to show strong political bias. The Western intelligence agencies are depicted badly. The Americans are particularly made a caricature of. From an old intelligence hand I expected better. As a result the ending is a disappointment.<br /><br />The worst of the book for me, however, is in the author's depiction of the Arab charity organizer who is also suspected of financing terrorist activities. The author essentially treats him as 95% good and 5% bad - in proportion with the money's ultimate usage. Wow. talk about moral relativism. By this logic most first-degree murderers are only 5% bad and should be treated that way. Am I seeing in Mr. le Carre how far the West has declined since the 1960s, since I do not recall him treating the Soviets this way? Or is it just old age setting in? I hope it is the latter.<br /><br />A disappointment overall because the author had constructed a good story that could have concluded in more satisfatory fashion had he not let his political biases take over.

This would keep it from flopping outward when you just want to hold it to read a book or play a game.<br /><br />Barbara Garber<br />Pottstown PA

B009RH9FR6|4.0|Good protective cover. Nice fit. Opening and closing the jacket gives me the feeling of holding a real book,one of the few things I miss with digital books. Like that the cover puts the kindle to sleep or awakens it when it is opened or closed.<br /><br />Really love the fact that the k-fire can be rotated within the casing to accommodate whatever app or book is open at the moment,or for charging.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is such an amazing movie! Great story and I can't wait for the sequel to come out in the summer.
B0013WJGJ0|2.0|I was 8 when I first watched this movie. It was pretty good for my age, in the 80's. Today, it's basically unwatchable. It's hard to believe Jack Nicholson got $60 Million from this film. He just played himself. He didn't play the Joker. Couple that with the awkward dance numbers and poorly done action scenes, and the film is pretty terrible. All the old Batmans are. I have to admit that the production values are pretty terrible, even for the 90's. They didn't even age as well as the Bond movies, even the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan movies. That's pretty bad.
0739384198|3.0|The back of the book listed it as &#34; Johnson County KS Library&#34; as the owner of the book. This should be intvestigated as this operation is so loose that it did not take the libraries owner`s name off of the book.

B00CPTUNBK|5.0|A good effort into bringing the world of MLP to the big screen/feature length form.  The quality is quite good on Blu-Ray, the features are interesting a, 3 part featurette of behind the scenes stuff,  mainly interviews, sing-a-longs, and a short &#34;ponify yourself&#34; video which is essentially putting colored clip-on extensions in your hair, and some strange previews of other Shout Factory releases. It also has the standard DVD and VUDU digital copy.

B00CSYR432|2.0|It has been three to five years (depending on if you go by the Japanese or US release of the film) since Goro Miyazaki's last film \\"Tales From Earthsea.\\" Studio Ghibli released \\"The Secret World of Arrietty\\" in US theaters last year and while Hayao Miyazaki was involved with contributing to the screenplay (which he also did for \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\"), his last animated film as director was \\"Ponyo\\" back in 2009 (\\"The Wind Rises\\" was released in Japan earlier this year and looks to be Hayao Miyazaki's final film before retirement). Studio Ghibli is to anime what Pixar is to computer animation; they tend to have a reputation for producing and distributing exceptional animated films that take pride in affecting your emotions and capturing your imagination in ways live-action films only dream of. Unfortunately, and this seems to be the opinion of only a small few, but \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" doesn't live up to Studio Ghibli's marvelous back catalog.<br /><br />The animation in \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" is just as fluid and crisp as other Studio Ghibli films and it features some magnificently vibrant colors. Satoshi Takebe's music is the film's biggest asset as it absolutely establishes the animated film's intimate yet somewhat troubled atmosphere. The music leans on the eccentric side as it has hints of Chopin and swing music, is heavy on piano, flute, and jazz influences, and even seems to have shades of show tunes at times.<br /><br />While the film is incredibly pretty to look at, \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" is extremely boring. The entire film is mostly watching Umi eat, do chores, cook, and go to school. In between gossip among schoolmates, Umi still raises the flags every morning in hopes of seeing her father return home from the supply ship he captained during the war. The concept is kind of interesting, but after you learn what comes between Umi and Shun you will never look at flagpoles the same again after viewing the film.<br /><br />When \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" isn't following Umi and her errands, it revolves around the three storey Latin Quarter building which everyone wants to renovate and save from demolition. As Shun begins to get popular after jumping off the building, the film also introduces a few songs to make it feel like a musical. This isn't in the enchanting or Disney movie sense. It's more of an awkward cramming that makes you wonder why people are singing at such a desperate time.<br /><br />\\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" has drama, romance, and focuses on the importance of family, but it does so in a really roundabout way that fails to be absorbing or trigger any sort of emotions whatsoever. It doesn't have the sensational fantasy elements that other Studio Ghibli films like \\"Spirited Away\\" or \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" have to capture your imagination and isn't nearly as captivating or heartbreaking as \\"Grave of the Fireflies.\\" \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" may be able to boast about its outstanding music and smooth animation, but it's far too flat to leave much of an impression.<br /><br />The Two-Disc special edition of the film includes both the Blu-ray and DVD and over 3 hours of bonus features including the Japanese version of the film, Feature-length Storyboards (meaning you can watch the entire film in storyboard format), Director Goro Miyazaki on Yokohama (17:37), Yokohama - Stories of the Past and Present (22:36), \\"Summer of Farewells\\" Music Video, an English Voice Cast Featurette (21:48), Press Conference - Theme Song Announcement (39:33), Hayao Miyazaki's Speech After the Staff Screening (6:14), Japanese Trailers and Teasers, and the US trailer.n't following Umi and her errands, it revolves around the three storey Latin Quarter building which everyone wants to renovate and save from demolition.

B00563M11M|5.0|Terry Pratchett's books are always a joy; funny as hell, exciting, witty, empathic. A humanist with a sense of humour as big as his heart.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|The first Ghost Rider film from 2007 was fairly faithful to the comic. When Ghost Rider came out in 1972 it was more of a general idea than a fully fleshed-out premise. This was clear as the stories changed from writer to writer and one artist to another. Ideas were added as the years progressed, like the &#34;penance stare&#34; and Blaze's growing awareness of the former angel of justice Zarathos. The book was canceled in 1983 after a ten-year run. In 1990 a new version of Ghost Rider was introduced with a different character and it ran eight years.<br /><br />The first film was an amalgam of the ideas presented in these two series, mostly the first, and struck me as the comic-book come to life. Really, the only thing that was disappointing (other than Cage being too long in the tooth for the role of Johnny Blaze) was the villain, Blackheart, who was seriously scary in the comics, but fairly bland in the movie and looking totally different.<br /><br />&#34;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&#34; (2012) is a worthy follow-up with Nicolas Cage returning as Johnny Blaze. The story switches to Europe and, more specifically, Romania and Turkey, where the film was shot.<br /><br />This time the devil is played by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, rather than Peter Fonda, which isn't a big deal considering Satan could presumably take different physical forms. The devil's main minion is played by Johnny Whitworth, a different character than Blackheart from the original, albeit similar. The hot female is Violante Placido, who's arguably better than Eva Mendes. Another positive is the rockin' soundtrack.<br /><br />I don't mind the story switching to Europe since the locations are excellent, particularly the amazing cave-monastery, but there are other changes that I'm not so crazy about, like the charred biker jacket of the Ghost Rider, but this is just a matter of taste; I simply prefer the cool &#34;costume&#34; as opposed to the dirtbag biker look. A more significant negative is the overactive camera that's annoying and draws attention to itself. I can't wait for this &#34;hip&#34; fad to pass.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: &#34;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&#34; is a quality sequel that interestingly fleshes out the nature of the spirit that possesses Johnny blaze (I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it). People who claim the film's more &#34;serious&#34; and &#34;faithful&#34; to the comic are off the mark. It has the same quasi-serious, cartoony-horror vibe as the first film, with glimpses of humor. As radical as the first movie was (in a comic booky way), this one ups the ante and is the better for it. Unfortunately it's marred by the hyperactive camera.<br /><br />The film runs 96 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Btion to itself. I can't wait for this &#34;hip&#34; fad to pass.

B00A285OOW|5.0|This book goes back to before Henry VIII and tells about his father Henry VII. Most of Ms. Gregory's books are about the royal family and this one tells a fascinating story of an insecure King and his queen from the previous royal family. The characters are some of the people that are in the current TV series White Queen. It was throoughly enjoyable and kept my attention. BAM

B009LMTDL0|4.0|I gained some valuable insight from her philosophy even though I also really believe that Anne-Marie Slaughter's piece in The Atlantic magazine was spot on.  Sheryl has a somewhat unrealistic life based upon a normal middle to upper middle class household, but everyone should invest in both career and family because it is with that mix (I refuse to call it balance because it never is in balance) that life is interesting.

I would probably recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, write...or just curious about a few words they would like to know what it means..or how it's pronounced. Better yet..it can also be used to school too. That way you can build up your vocabulary skills or TRY at least TRY to sound smart. Lol. =)
0385738765|4.0|The Scorch Trials is the second installment of Dashner's, Maze Runner Triology. Now that the Gladers are out of the maze, they have a whole new set of problems to deal with. You quickly get drawn back into the Gladers new reality. We are introduced to some new characters and new human zombies--described as Cranks. The chapter where Thomas and a friend are being chased underground by Cranks is very well done - creepy and entertaining.<br /><br />The book teases you with the question of who WICKED is, and leaves you hopeful for a resolution. In the end, Dashner leaves all the questions unanswered. I can't wait to see how he wraps up all this crazy madness in the final installment.<br /><br />My favorite line: \\"Hello, noses!\\"

0345803485|1.0|Until I read this brilliant paper-back \\"novel\\"-ty, busting a grumpy had been so boring. I would sit for long periods, legs numb with loneliness, wishing I had something to read. But who wants to hold a book in 1 hand and a wipe your turd cutter with the other? I can't be the only one that feels like reading while wiping is an inefficient use of my time! If only I could absorb information like TP absorbs the spicy bile of my hot scoots! But as lady luck would have it, there is such a fateful combination. Taking their inspiration from Pantean's 2-n-1 shampoo+conditioner, Charmin Ultra is proud to present their most popular (and only) line of paperback novels.<br /><br />Now for the first time on tripple-ply you can get Fifty Shades of Grey Gone are the days of tearing out recycled sandpaper from your favorite hard-back novel to wipe your BH. Now these literary prose can be pulled conveniently off the role and across your ass, saving you time and money. How does this save you money you ask? Because now you no longer have to use your eyes to read! With Charmin Ultras Fifty Shades of grey you can simultaneously wipe the browny from your corn hole while reading via osmosis. Charmin's crack team of indian snake charmers, Tibettan lama-shamans and unpaid interns have discovered a magic Incan formula that allows you, the human play-do factory to \\"Ass-sorb\\" (TM) the book directly through your brown eye! Thats right! Thanks to Charmin's magic pooper-picker-upper you can read with your ass! And reading has never been so sexy.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is a story about a sex-addicted cock-slinger who mows through woman, like I mow through an Indian buffet. This lavish bathroom reader explores the fetishy world of every woman's slut-bag rape fantasy. Its like playboy but for germans! Ultimately he winds up in the same place I am now, in the toilet, or at least I think he did. But in truth I don't actually know how it ends because as I thumbed through it, I accidentally putmy thumb through it and ended up with a self-serve proctology exam.  As sad as I was to ruin this novel, I'm happy to report I don't have polyps.<br /><br />In conclusion if you have ever wondered what Fabio does in his spare time, I can't suggest this book enough! However if you're like me and you only came in here to poop, then don't bother reading it. Instead just imagine what the biography of Richard Gear's Gerbal would be like and you have 50 Shades of Grey on a roll.<br /><br />Travis the Impalor, ameture proctologist and amazon product reviewer

0618526412|4.0|This book was very well written. I am shocked that a woman so young as the author was had the maturity and insight to write this book. The characters are all quirky and you find yourself wondering what each one is hiding. The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because I do not feel the ending was completely developed.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Definitely kept your attention.  So much empathy for the family. Life can change so quickly and glad it ended well.

0064471837|5.0|I first read this book as a young adolescent and absolutely loved it. The unique take on necromancy and magic, creatively spun into an intense, and riveting plot line make it an excellent read. I loved it then and as an adult now, I pick it up about once a year to revisit the magical world of the Old Kingdom.<br />Sabriel is a thrilling ride, full of interesting twists and turns that take you into a world of magic that's never really been done before. Nix weaves together a tale of unique fantasty and even ties in a little bit of romance. Sabriel is a definite page turner that will keep you going until you've discovered all of its mysteries. Even now that I've read it several times and know all the secrets within, once I pick it up I won't be stope until every page is turned.<br />Nix creates enjoyable, distinctive characters like Touchstone and Mogget, my personal favorite. Sabriel as the heroine is lovely; she isn't a damsel in distress requiring rescuing, or the brunt glory filled, over the top powerful heroine frequently seen. She is a young, strong woman just trying to understand the role she's been thrust into and who desperately wants to find her father. She is an excellent protagonist.<br />Overall this is a wonderful book, and one I strongly recommend to other readers. If you enjoy fantasy and want to see a truly unique world of necromancy and magic, then this is definitely the book for you. And if you can't get enough of Sabriel there are sequels that are equally as good. All are very worth reading!

There is a storyline kind of like a hidden objects type game, but mostly it's just good majong.  There are different tiles for the different locations.  The boards are various arrangements of tiles, just as a good majong game should be.  I haven't gotten any pop up ads.  I did notice that my battery dies quicker since installing this app.  I read that others noticed that this app runs in the background for no reason.  Other reviews have details on that.  I'll stick to what I know, which is that I enjoy this game a lot.  One star deducted for the battery drain.

0451205766|4.0|As far as I can tell, Mario Puzo coined the phrase \\"get the poison of your system\\" for whoring around, which Johnny Fontane says he is going to do at one point, after a fight with his ex-wife.<br /><br />I am unusual in that I read this book BEFORE I ever saw the movie.  It is an engrossing work of fiction.  I read someplace that Puzo wrote it on the studio lot, as a prelude to becoming a film.  In other words, this is more of a film treatment than a novel.  A lot of the details that don't make it into the movie (Johnny Fontane helping to get Nino Valenti into the movie business to please the Godfather; Lucy Mancini and the brilliant abortionist; why Luca Brasi was so feared -- he threw his unwanted child into a furnace shortly after the birth) enhanced my enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />The reason the movie is so well-liked is not, in my view, its take on the timeless themes if the ambiguitiies between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" or the desecrating of the young idealistic war hero, Ivy-League-educated Michael.  If you break this film down into \\"Michael saves the day by killing a bunch of people who may or may not have had it coming\\" it is nothing to get very excited about.  But there are some very exciting, interesting moments.  Amerigo Bonaserra reluctantly accepting the Don's friendship.  Don Corleone telling Johnny Fontane to \\"Act like a man\\" after making fun of him crying.  Arguably the best part -- Don Corleone saying if Michael gets struck by lighting when he returns, he will blame some of the people in this room.  Michael's interaction with Moe Green in the book is also much better than in the movie.  Michael doesn't come off as such a jerk in the book, but makes a reasonable point: we gave you some money to get this casino going, and now you're losing money.  I am talking about paying you a fair reasonable price for the casino, how can you object to that?<br /><br />A lot of the flashback material from the GF2 film comes from this book, too.  While reading something about Vito's humble beginnings did help the story a lot. I wish there was more information about how Don Barzini and Phillip Tattaglia started out as Dons.  The other 2 of the 5 families are really barely mentioned.  If there is a weakness in the book, I couldn't figure out how Don Barzini got to his position, since Vito's path seemed like such an unlikely one.<br /><br />If you like the film, you will probably like the book.  If it's not your kind of thing, you won't like it much.  It is more story driven than artfully written or anything, exactly as a film treatment would be.

0140386335|3.0|Full Review on my blog:<br /><br />[...]<br />Ok, I love the Neverending story movie. It is a true classic. I think this is one of the rare cases where the book is not as good as the movie adaptation.<br /><br />The Neverending story really should have been two books in my opinion. There are really two stories. One story is about Atreyu and his quest to find a cure for the illness plaguing the child like empress. The other story is Bastions time in Fantastica. I had a really hard time switching gears from Atreyu's story to Bastions. Also, once Bastion got to Fantastica I thought the book got really slow. It felt less like a quest story and more like a tour of Fantastica.<br /><br />I was really into the first half of the book but honestly almost didn't finish because it got pretty boring to me.<br /><br />I also wasn't crazy about the end. Bastion tells his father all about Fantastica and his dad believes him. No questions. Nothing. There is also a book store owner who has also been to Fantastica so his acceptance I understood. But it isn't said if Bastion's father had been or knew about Fantastica one way or the other. If not then it seems strange he would just accept that his son was gone two days and fell into a book. I don't think I would accept that.<br /><br />If you are really into the fantasy genre and just love details and world building then you would probably enjoy this book. If you have a low tolerance for that without too much plot then just see the movie.<br /><br />This review by Jane B Night. Author of [[ASIN:1483932346 Educating Autumn]]
0887307280|5.0|Michael Gerber tells a story as he goes and keeps it interesting. His method of teaching is repetitious enough to make things stick but never boring since he teaches the principles in different ways. He profiles many common and very successful businesses and makes their achievements reachable to any small business. The principles taught here have been extremely helpful!
B00ENBTI8C|4.0|An amazing and befitting conclusion to a magnum opus production. A story about freedom. A single individual can definitely make a difference

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game. Highly recommended. Try it out as guest player. Only down side I don't buy the bingo coins. But get free one when you check in everyday.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|For a while I've been looking for a good racing game like in arcades. This one I really feel takes the cake. The steering is tricky to pick up but once you figure it out the game is a blast. It is a great casual racing game and well worth 99 cents.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 3.5 / 5<br />audio - 4 /5<br /><br />somewhat disappointing video and audio on this blu ray disc on<br />a new take of a zombie movie.<br />video was a real letdown in quality as expected on a newly released<br />2013 film, with it not being that much better than the dvd copy.<br />that said, it is a brad pitt vehicle, as the movie itself was pretty good,<br />a must have for you fans out there.<br />again, disappointing video throughout.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|OMG finally I have a rainbow Dragon anyways  this app is AMAZING please get and its FREE please get this app OMG it's super awesome
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|If your young enough not to watch the orginal TV series they you would love this.  If you are a older trekie like me and remember the orginal tv series, you will definatly enjoy the movie but may be a little disapointed that they vered off from the orginal story on the tv series.<br /><br />The producers could have kept with the orginal story and still have a possabley even better movie.<br /><br />With all that said I still recomemed this movie to all.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|I thought it was very funny, but maybe next time get rid of the bad words, otherwise it was great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my children and their friends love it really makeshift the wheels turn and they love playing it as a group
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting and addictive game. It's challenging and fun. I hope it has a lot more levels. I will enjoy this for a long time.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Normally, I find myself disappointed after viewing film adaptations for novels I've already read, because I feel like they hinder the original images & emotions that I drew from my own reading experience. However, I can't wait to read Fitzgerald's classic novel again after watching this, with a new-found appreciation for a story with such depth & beauty, yet tragedy all at once.<br /><br /> This is not only an excellent portrayal of an American classic, but they did a spectacular job of incorporating modern music into a story that takes place decades ago. I would never have thought that songs by Jay-Z or will.i.am could fit into a 1920's setting, but the songs were tastefully placed in a way that I personally felt added to the film, rather than detracting from it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the artistic talent displayed in this film in every aspect, and highly recommend it!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|What an awesome hog (hidden object game) I can't put it down! The one thing I would change is... the energy part of it. This game would be soo much better if you didn't have to have energy to play.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I have a kindle fire hd 32g. Other programs can either access or simulate GPS on my kindle even shows the GPS symbol in pull down bar. I knew this and bought it anyway to work it manually. Total waste of money. Once I do a close-up of a planet or change the view (add/remove satellites). It usually messes up the whole program. Have to shut down and restart. I gave it two starts because it may be good on other devices, but I was the dummy for purchasing it for my kindle after reading so many negative reviews.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It is typical of Hussein, beautifully written and emotionally stirring.  I loved it and look forward to more by this author.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app. Has a lot of useful info, but not to over the top. Easy setup of favorite cities.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app, Lots more speed and picture clarity. Facebook is so much better with this app, I'm glad I accidentally downloaded it.
B0019IIPZO|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It kept my attention the whole time!  Good suspense and plot. It was a pretty good sci-fi movie.
1476734941|1.0|THE BOOK IS GREAT<br /><br />i FOUND IT TO BE VERY INTERESTING--AND I MIGHT ADD IT WORKS--I LOST 12 LBS ALREADY
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Game does not work at all after the opening chapter. Trying to continue playing after that and the game simply closes itself back to my home  page. Tried for over 20 mins and it simply will not load chapter two. Complete waste of money, a broken ripoff
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love it. Has lots of remote Alaskan cities and weather. Very useful when traveling for work or vacation. A must have!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I pre-ordered this when I first heard about it in July, and it only arrived September 4th.<br /><br />After using it for a day, I can already see why people are so adamant about how amazing it is. For $35, you get a simple dongle that can literally be set up in 2 minutes, and from there can immediately start streaming Netflix, YouTube, or Google Movies / Music. It's ridiculously intuitive; the kind of thing you could give your parents and have them use with minimal instruction.<br /><br />App-wise, there are currently only 4 applications supported: Netflix, YouTube, Google Movies and Google Music. But that's fine by me: Google is testing the &#34;Chromecast SDK&#34; and when it's ready and 3rd parties can begin integrating with the Chromecast dongle... well, get ready for a flood of Hulu / etc support.<br /><br />I've already ordered another one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was a good book and I'm hong to start on Enders shadow I hope that you will like and continue reading this series
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how well this works on my kindle fire HD. You can't go wrong with this app.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Great movie. True to the comic. Dirty, gritty, very entertaining. A little cliché, but that's what Dredd is supposed to be. The action gets a little stale at times, but not enough to take your eyes away.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. It is not too easy but is also a challenge. I would definitely recommend this game.
B0024DQXW0|1.0|goes 27 minutes and that's it<br />after 27 minutes goes to reload and than starts at the beginning<br />great movie, very poor amazon
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Probably the surprise hit of the year at the time, it combines Light Humor with Dark, stamps it mark on every spy spoof and blends characters better than many of the &#34;Big Budget&#34; films.  Bruce Willis is perfect, but John Malkovich steals any scene he is in, and plays the paranoid/schizophrenic/pentagon-experiment-gone-wrong to a tee!  Can you help but feel that Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are really spies?  I could go on and on about Morgan Freeman, Richard Dreyfuss and the rest of cast who are either directed to perfection and are enjoying playing together.  Absolutely entertaining in a way most films are not.  A bit violent without being too bloody, or even violent for violence's sake — it is merely the silliness of excess violence that makes it fun.  No one gets hurt in the filming of this movie — except for the competition!  Not quite as silly as the original &#34;Casino Royale&#34; (David Niven, Woody Allen), it manages to entertain to the max.  You might say I could even recommend it...  But don't tell anyone.
B007MDB71O|5.0|We are a house of geeks. I admit that.  We love Doctor Who,  Farscape, Firefly, Star Wars. .. you name it and we have geeked over it.  We also admit that we didn't have high expectations for this one. The marketing really led us to believe that it was only about Taylor Kitsch with no clothes on. Not an actual. .. you know.... story.<br /><br />Imagine our delight when my whole family sat down to watch it and found an engaging story with a great plot. By the end we were all clamoring for more. Beyond that, we even bought the movie the second we finished watching it and then we watched it again as soon as it arrived two days later.<br /><br />The marketing team on this film are wholly to blame for its downfall at the box office. Instead of playing with the idea of time/world travel, mysteries to be unraveled (ala National Treasure) or the father of all science fiction (before Star Wars, Star Trek, or Battlestar Galactica there was. ...), they hinged the entire marketing campaign on Kitsch.  Now I adore him.  I've met him and had the opportunity to spend time with him and I am a huge fan, but he wasn't enough to market the whole film on. Not for a Sci Fi audience.<br /><br />This movie was so good! I hope the outpouring of continued support allows a sequel to happen. It deserves one far more than 90% of the movies that get them these days.
B000Q79HTC|5.0|It is a good action film, so well done that I looked forward to each movie in the Bourne series. For any Robert Ludlum fans, it is a good watch.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|Pitch Black is one of my favorite science fiction films.  It is not a masterpiece like the original Star Wars films, Aliens, Blade Runner, etc.  However, I find Pitch Black a very cool and fun film that I have watched many times over.  The mark of a truly good film is how many times you can watch it.  Films like the Departed are good, but I would not re-watch them again.  Pitch Black is a decent film and also a very entertaining movie.  It has good characters especially the main character Riddick (Vin Diesel).  The story is simple but effective.  The effects are great as well especially considering when this was made.<br /><br />The story is as follows.  A transport ship is transporting a small group of people including a notorious criminal named Riddick to a space outpost called New Mecca.  However, the ship crashes on a remote planet with three suns.  The survivors try to find a way to get off of the planet when there is an eclipse and the planet goes completely dark.  Afterwards, strange creatures that live in the dark surface and hunt them down one by one.  Riddick has to lead the remaining survivors to safety.<br /><br />The cast is really solid.  This is the film that introduced me to Vin Diesel and made me a fan of his.  The character of Riddick is badass and has a great deal of mystery surrounding him.  We know he is a notorious criminal but we do not know anything else about him including what he did that made him a criminal.  He also has somewhat of a superpower.  He had these special eyes which allow him to see in the dark.  We get more information about Riddick in the sequel to this film.  Normally not knowing much about a character is a negative but in this case it makes him more fascinating.  He is one of the big reasons why I love this film.<br />The other characters are good, but without Riddick the film would not be as memorable.<br /><br />The other characters are decent as well.  You have Fry (Radha Mitchell) who is a junior pilot on the ship.  She is the one character who goes through a character arc in this film.  At the beginning she tries to kill the rest of the passengers to ensure that they survive the crash.  Throughout the film she tries to make amends for that.  You also have Johns (Cole Hauser) who is a police officer in charge of bringing Riddick in.  He is kind of the semi-villain of the series.<br /><br />You also have a priest named Imam played by Keith David.  I am a fan of Keith David.  He is my favorite voice actors.  He voiced Spawn in Spawn the Animated Series, the Arbiter in Halo, and he has even done a number of documentaries.  He does well in this film as well, though he is not given that much to do.  The characters have good chemistry with each other especially Fry and Riddick.  They make the film very fun to watch since the aliens themselves do not appear until the third act.<br /><br />The effects are amazing too.  The look of the planet is awesome.  That scene in space at the beginning is also done very well.  The aliens themselves look great.  They look like creature I see in some anime.  They really did well with the low budget that they had to work with.<br /><br />Overall, Pitch Black is a fun science fiction film that is worth seeing at least once if you are a fan of the genre.  It has memorable characters like Riddick, great effects, and great action when you have it.  If you have not seen it and are interested I'd say give it a look.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Whereas this is a novel, I suspect it is a good depiction of life in North Korea.  Very frightening and sad.
1594489505|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and I love how the author weaves so many relationships together- this book is definitely a trump over Kite Runner, for me at least. However, this book tends to cater to how the media likes to portray other countries- and I hope it does not sway people into formulating a certain set of beliefs about another culture. This is a work of fiction, and although there are violent men all over the world, nothing is concrete, static, nor set in stone. If I were to portray a typical Midwestern American family, it will, of course, not be a fair representation of America as a whole.<br />I have been enjoying this book for sometime now, and reading it for the second time- it's crisp and refreshing than before!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Did not enjoy this movie at all.  It was confusing and really wish I wouldn't have wasted my time watching it.  I do love Tom Cruise and he did a good job, but the movie just wasn't good.
1609611543|5.0|You will never look at the 1% of anything the same again. You learn A Lot after page 40 or so. First part is history and groundwork. Then answers to life's mysterious questions about your body and your health.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Looks to the future of NYC or London.  They should not have picked Atlanta! The producers can see the future.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Great concept that really works.  Good range of tools and the built in stands work perfectly.  Smooth plastic makes for easy use.  Also easy to clean.
0143124544|4.0|After hearing so much about this read, I finally took the plunge.  I leaned more to the positive in rating this one but I actually am wanting this to be more of a three and half star rating and here's why: It was a let down to come to the conclusion, after the engaging sessions...the debates, the tussling to and fro. I also found that there was not enough of a clear distinction in the separate voices of the characters.<br /><br />Certainly, high marks to the author for the great subject matter, some good scenes here.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love the game, I can connect through facebook and compete with my friends. Thank you for giving me more options than playing on my computer.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|i usually know whats happening in a movie way before its over. this one kept me on my toes, made me think the entire time. loved it very entertaining and wiley.
0064471837|5.0|These books have it all: action, adventure, romantic, strong female characters, a plot. So often I have picked up books that just didn't have believable female characters, let alone strong ones could take care of themselves. Just often I have picked up books with weak plots and poor writing. These books did not have any of these problems. From beginning to end, I loved the characters and was sad to get to the end of the last book. These books contain a lush and vivid world, with characters who feel like real people. This trilogy will remain my favorite indefinitely, as will the writer remain one of my top five favorite authors.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for the last part of the triology to come out later this year.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have not opened the season to watch it because I have already seen the season. I plan on giving this away as a raffle prize for a Halloween party I am having this year. I will however say that the price ( About $ 18.00 ) was fantastic and it arrived quickly ( About 4 days total ).<br /><br />I love The Walking Dead show and this was a great first season for a new show. I am a huge fan and plan on watching the show until it is no longer on the air.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this show yet, then I suggest you purchase it at this great price and start watching. You will enjoy it, especially if you are a zombie, horror, suspense fan.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is addictive. I couldn't stop playing it. It has random levels so you never run out of levels. Also, it has different difficulty levels. You can play against AI or go on the internet and play other people. This game is just so versatile.<br />Now, the game itself if I can explain it. Is you produce ships, little dots that you send to different stars. You then continue to build your ships and expand to other stars. Meanwhile, the enemy starts at the other side of the galaxy and tries to expand toward you. Thus, the battles ensue. When you have defeated or taken most of the galaxy, you win. Some side items are special powers and abilities you gain as you get better. You use them when your in trouble or you want to expand.<br />To put it mildly, you will just have to play the game because I can't explain everything that you can do.<br />This game is going in my app collection. I love it and can just sit and play for hours.<br />You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Battle On!!!!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I loved it!  They have matured into beautiful people/vampires.  Loved the storyline & Plot.  Graphics were awesome.  Leaving you wanting more.  Definitely worth buying and watching over and over again.
B008469DGY|5.0|This was a fun little golf game where you use your finger to get the golf ball into the hole.  As in most golf games, your ultimate goal is for a hole in one, although you are rewarded for close approaches to the hole as well.  The wind affects your shot nicely as if you were actually out on the course, and you can even apply top or back spin to your shot to help get it in the hole.<br /><br />I just wish it wasn't called a flick game.  Although you do &quot;flick&quot; your finger across the screen for all controls, the &quot;ball&quot; is not actually a wadded up piece of paper, and the &quot;hole&quot; is not a trash can.  The &quot;wind&quot; is simulated as if you were actually out on a golf course, instead of created by a fan. They really could have just called this game &quot;golf with your finger&quot; to avoid confusion. Still, it was very fun and entertaining. As a golf enthusiast, something I could spend hours enjoying and mastering.<br /><br />(for all who are still reading this and don't yet catch the sarcasm, this review is in response to all the &quot;it's not really a golf game&quot; reviews.  Overall I would highly recommend, especially if you are looking for a new time waster. I can see coming back to this one over and over.)
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game it is so so so fun would highly recommend this for bubble shooter overstate yay yay super fun
0689878451|5.0|This book is well-written and a great teaching tool.  Not only does it focus on how penguin families function, it introduces having two dads in a non-sensationalist way.  Tango is just like all the other penguins, with just one small difference.
1595825045|5.0|Lovely book can't believe it took me this long to get great art and wonderful insight to how the characters were created as a avatar fan I wasn't disappointed
B009RH973I|4.0|The case arrived as promised (and before my Kindle), was packaged well, and met all my expectations, but one. I'm new to the Kindle, and I'm still not sure if the case will turn the Kindle off (to save power). However, it seems to protect the Kindle well, folds easily into a standing easel, and the bright color makes it easy to find in dark purse or bag.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|While Electric is still a great album, I found that I prefer Peace by a long shot.Like previous reviewers have said, it sounds much more like the Love album. The only thing I would change would be  maybe some liner notes, and give the Peace album a kick a** remaster treatment. If your a fan of The Cult don't hesitate to pick this up.You cant go wrong with the vinyl copy!
B004H83IG4|3.0|This is a well made film, with first rate actors, Ryan Gosling, Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella.  It's based on a true story which adds interest to the film.  All the actors do a good job.  Ryan Gosling makes a very sick fellow seem almost sympathetic, at least for a while.  Dunst is a sunny delight to watch.<br /><br />After seeing the film I read a bit about the actual event that prompted the story and that filled in some of the missing piece about Deborah, the friend of the husband.  Apparently in \\"real life\\" she married the fellow.<br /><br />It's a good film but not one that I'd recommend as great entertainment.  I'm giving it three and a half stars.
B002M87V0A|5.0|The Music Man is my favorite film of all time, and this Blu-Ray is excellent!  Great sound and perfect picture quality.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The slender man chapter 1 is fun but it's really not that scary slender man is not that scary he appears from far away and not up close and the screen is not that dark
B002NZK5TG|5.0|My husband and I just saw the play locally and it brought back a lot of memories.  My kids loved this movie growing up so I had to get it again.  Fast shipping, really nice product!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great movie! I am surprised I never saw any previews for it.. very good and I highly recommend it to any one who is interested
B007VUA7VO|3.0|So far I like this app. It's easy to understand & let's me know where I stand with battery & other important usages. One of the things I don't like is when I plug in my kindle fire it takes me straight to the battery charger app & when I try to move onto something else, it comes right back to the battery charger app.
0064471837|5.0|After being recommended this series countless times, I finally gave it a shot. It is absolutely incredible. The world building is unbelievable and I devoured all three in the series in less than a week. Sabriel is a very likable character and reading about her adventures is terribly addictive. If only there were even more books about her, I'd read them all!
B00B9ZBZ2C|4.0|This novel is a portrait of two \\"individuals.\\"  The first protagonist is Soviet intelligence agent Leo Demidov, a rather unintelligent hunk whose unquestioning loyalty to Communism makes him perfectly suited to his work.  The novel centers around his search for a serial killer whose brutal crimes are systematically covered up by Soviet society, crimes that reveal fault lines in Stalin's supposedly harmonious utopia of perfectly reeducated citizens.  The second protagonist is the Soviet Union during the 1930s, when collectivization policies led to massive starvation, suffering, and even cannibalism in the Ukraine, and in the early 1950s, at the height of Comrade Stalin's bloody reign.  This is one of the bleakest worlds that I have ever visited in a novel.  The state sees all independent thought and initiative as a mortal threat to its absolute rule, and so brutally suppresses it; the crimes of Andrei (the serial killer) represent on a small-scale this systematic annihilation of Russia's children.  \\"Barbarity, certainly,\\" Leo says of the Soviet way, \\"but barbarity for a reason, barbarity for the greater good: 'Greater Good the Greater Good.'  It was necessary to repeat it, to carve it into every thought, so that it ran like ticker tape across the bottom of your mind.\\"  There might be hope for Leo-- whose investigation leads him to slowly, painfully develop a conscience-- but we are left with little hope for the like redemption of Soviet society and its people as a whole.<br /><br />The big plot twist detracted from an otherwise tightly-wound, well-plotted novel, for me-- it felt too facile and false.
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|I love this from start to finish!  It is unusual for all the songs on a cd to be good but this one - every song rocks - it is great!
B00A50PBEA|5.0|Didn't know if I could enjoy the Magic Flute set in the world war I era, but rest assured everything falls into place and I rate it at the top of my list of operas turned into movies.  Kudo's to Kenneth Branach and all involved.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really a good read.  The facts were straight forward and the story line was easy to follow.  I enjoyed it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Funny that a book told from the point-of-view of a dog would leave me really thinking about humanity, emotion, and how and why we get through life like we do.<br /><br />This book was phenomenal.  It was a quick, easy read from which you can spend as much or as little time pondering the meaning of life and humanity as you want.<br /><br />Warning: Don't read it on an airplane.  You will cry and that gets awkward when you are trying to remain as quiet and un-sniffley as possible.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Really is a great protectant.  I feel very confident that should my kindle fall that it will be protected really well.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Within the particular genre of super heroes and their super adventures fighting super villains, \\"The Avengers\\" is a smart colossal achievement, and within it's genre, it is a 5-star film.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Quite honestly this has got to be the best gay movie I have ever seen. A superbly crafted work, with great acting and a wonderful, heart-warming story. So many memorable scenes.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Bought this for the Kindle we gave my 7 year old. Love the durability it offers! Easy to wipe down from little fingerprints too!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought I had figured out the ending, but was wrong, and that made it a four star, not a three star for me.  This book is written as though you are reading a diary of several people. Easy reading.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Inspiring which behavioral manners affecting economic,  societal,  and personal levels. I highly recommend for everyone seeking insights for thoughts and minds
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun and entertaining keeps you guessing and helps you to improve your mind skills by using coordination and matching skills. My daughter and I had lots of fun sharing this game by solving it together.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I taught this book to 7th graders years ago in public school. Just read it again with a different perspective. A thought- provoking, must read.
B0095P31L6|5.0|great cartoon movie; easy to watch many times over and over again. The characters are very unique. Children and adults will love it
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|This does not work and it won't even open all the way. So the screen is only  about 6 inches long.... disappointing, very disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game. Actually my 4 year old introduced me to it. Now it's a part of my game options.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the newer, Keira Knightly version of Pride and Prejudice, but this one runs it a close second place! It is amazing, and follows the plot of the book more closely. Both are good, and I recommend this one too!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|My husband and I saw this at the theater and we both couldnt shut up about it even when we were in need of some sleep that night. Thiss movie is fantastic on many levels. Acting, story, purpose, heck...I can't even give it enough stars. We both said we are getting this on DVD when it's out because we need to see it more than that one time because we thought this to be one of the best movies in a long time. Just when you think you know where the story is going you are dead wrong. I am a pro at figuring out a Hollywood movie plot in the first 15-20 mins and I loved that I didn't even see the end coming. Bravo to the cast, writer, and director...what a breath of fresh air in this sad world of hand held home movie/ found footage garbage and reality tv dribble.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I'm exited to see the broadway version of this epic movie!  This movie is very sweet and made me cry
B009GEYX5E|3.0|I used old Polaroid film in the past and after reading about the product and reviews from other users, took a chance on the product. As I shot through this pack of film, I noticed two things: 1. The color was off, shifted subtly towards warm tones and 2. Photos were much less clear than some of the pictures I took with Polaroid film in the past.<br /><br />+ works with old Polaroid cameras requiring 600 film<br />+ resurrects the magic of instant photography<br />+ a fun trip back in time<br /><br />- VERY HIGH COST per image<br />- image quality isn't up to expectations, especially considering cost
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The pictorial photography of the movie was incredible.  The sunlight played a significant role in this movie.<br />And the young man's struggle at sea with his friend the mighty tiger was quite interesting
B009RH9FR6|5.0|The case looks nice.  However, what I like most is the features.<br /><br />The case does rotate 180 degrees for full access to HDMI and charging ports while your kindle is inside case, and it does rotate in the case so you can use the stand to view your kindle from three angles in either portrait or landscape mode.<br /><br />I also like that it wakes or puts your kindle to sleep when the lid is opened and closed, respectively.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is fun with a few jump scares here and there. So far it is great like any other g5 game.
B00181JGI2|2.0|After a friend recommended, I watched it and feel like I missed the point, since it comes as a &#34;cult classic&#34; film.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|The second one is better then the first one and the third is better than the second one am hoping for number four
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|It seemed like a funny concept, but the &#34;tutorial&#34; didn't really give much guidance, and then the game caused my Kindle Fire to freeze up, so the monkeys were punching in slow motion!
B009NNMB70|5.0|My best friend and I went and saw the movie and we dragged our \\"belieber\\" friend there. She hates hates hates One Direction and even she admitted it was good!! I cannot wait for christmas so I can get my own copy and laugh, sing, and cry all over again!!!!!
B00ARF92HK|3.0|I'll bet close to a hundred bad guys get killed in this mindless movie; the plot is weak (I'm being generous), and the acting is not top notch (especially in the verbal portions).  However, it is mildly entertaining if you ignore the fact that the  heroes are almost invincible (exception at toward the end where one is wounded), and the outcome is never in doubt.
B008469DGY|3.0|It's not golf. But it's still a fun game the whole point is to try to get a hike in one. I got this on free app of the day. I don't think I would have bought this but if you want to waste five or ten minutes. Then go ahead.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Very enjoyable game, my kids love it.  I play it pretty often as well.  Also great for when you need something to entertain you while waiting around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's  great all I can say is you should get this game  it's so fun and realistic I had.  Goo  Tim  taking care of all th  horses an  doing co.pititions
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game very addicting can't stop playing thanx for making this game Gameloft you're the best you guys should make more places to run at!!! Thanks don't know what to do without this game
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I love this game so far but there seems to be a huge difficulty spike when i get to the fungus plague. Even on easy. Plz just fix this and it will be five stars
B00992CF6W|4.0|To me I think minecraft is awesome. It is easy and FUN. When I first played minecraft. I played pocket edition. To me pocket edition is different than other mincraft  versions like XBOX and PC. For Christmas I am going to get mincraft on the x box 360. Well any way I just love minecraft so much
B000YABYLA|4.0|I didn't LOVE this movie, but I still enjoyed it. It delivers ALOT of laughs, although I found parts of it to be bad humor. kinda more irritating than funny. I definately think it could've had a  much better ending; however I loved the story line.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I believe this book is one of those books you just can't get enough of. John Green opened my eyes in world most people don't know. Hazel was of course the best John Green had created, but the ones I noticed more was, no is, Isaac and Augustus. Isaac is one of the cancer kids that is NEC , and towards the middle HE goes blind. And then it makes you wonder \\"wow we take advantage of our five senses and we spit it back without thanking God\\". Then their is Augustus… smart, charming, and unique. He is truly one of a kind character you won't read upon every book.<br /><br />To Gus: your life is a roller coaster that only goes up, but eventually gravity takes a toll and you must come down eventually<br />TO Hazel: … live life to the fullest<br />TO THE AUTHOR: my only complaint...if only Gus and Hazel Grace meet sooner
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I couldn't stop reading it, in spite of what seemed like the ten thousand occurrences of &#34;wait, how can that be possible!,&#34; followed by an equal number of passages of painfully-detailed explanations. The book's formulaic nature means that we guess almost everything long before it is revealed, and so it's really up to a master of 'mystical mystery' to keep one engrossed. If you must read it, get it from the library.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|I watched Equilibrium in order to see Christian Bale.  But the &#34;emotionless&#34; society plot line was really thin.  They did not portray the lack of emotion well, just the suppression of certain behaviors, such as indulging in sensory stimulation (perfume).  I had seen it once before, and had forgotten.  Now I remember why it was so forgettable.  Didn't even bother to watch it until the end.  I was disappointed because I'm starving for more good science fiction.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I immigrated to this country when I already was 30 something and with no formal education on English. I read in Spanish a few works from American writers, some of Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Mark Twain to name some, but I never read anything from Steinbeck. Lately I have been reading in English now some work fro Faulkner and now this book. It has fascinated me, the descriptions are so detailed, the characters thoughts and emotions so well rendered! It is fantastic!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This is a very good movie.  Although I didn't like it as well as the first two Men in Black movies it was still very enjoyable.  John Brolin was excellent as the young Tommy Lee Jones.  I would just have rather seen more of Tommy.
0064471837|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy. I started reading this book when I was 14 and I stayed up all night reading it. It's such a wonderful novel that just draws you in with the allure of its characters and magical realm. This will always be my favorite book, and I hope it will be a favorite of my children as well.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it. my kindle never crashes with it. and also,  to all those whining about 'I cant get Rarity!' maybe u should have saved up gems from start. I'm level NINE and I only need 2 more gems for her. And also, you can get gems by playing 4 or 5 days in a row.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Have not used the sharpener yet so have not really had opportunity to evaluate the tool. Looks like it would do OK.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|This is a great action figure. Well made, good price. Shipping was fast too. Wish they had one of Walt in his green shirt & underwear from the first episode.
0880293225|5.0|I Recommend this for improving your memory. I had a seminar and this book was recommended to me, order today.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have a kindle but also a tablet and downloaded it to that and the only problem is that it doesn't always sync to were you were on the other device.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|This has to be one of the most seen movies of all time and for good reason. The entire production was done in good taste with fantastic music, unforgetable characters and undertook a touchy subject and presented it in a great humerous musical. I hate to think of dialogue we would get in any modern remake. Also, the extra materials and pictures presented in the anniversary issue are a great collectors prize.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Keep a good supply of current series and past to give us our favorites when other services are out. thanks
0142422010|4.0|I have been near to foaming at the mouth waiting for this book, a companion novel to Perkins's debut, Anna and the French Kiss. Anna was one of the best books that I read this year and I couldn't wait to get my hands on Lola.<br /><br />Lola had many of the same things that I loved about Anna: the writing had a sense of humor and whimsy, but most importantly a romance that felt powerful- but real. It didn't shock me to read somewhere recently that Perkins based the love in Lola and Anna off of the love that so often comes in paranormal books because there is that sense of magic to them, even if it is in a contemporary setting.<br /><br />But while I was able to enjoy cameo appearances by Anna and Etienne (just try to wipe the grin off of my face when I see their names), I really enjoyed getting to know Lola and Cricket.<br /><br />Let's talk about Lola first. This girl is so damn interesting. She definitely doesn't have the traditional family structure, with her two fathers and her birth mother later thrown into the mix, but I really appreciated the way that it was approached. Not as one father being the \\"mom,\\" but as them both being wonderful co-parents. Lola has just as many teenage rebellion issues that someone with just a mother or a father would have. ESPECIALLY because her boyfriend, Max is five years her senior.<br /><br />Now, to be honest? As myself, I don't understand the draw of Max. But as Lola? Lola who likes elaborate costumes, whose goal is never to wear the same thing twice that year, who has a tendency to be a little bit dramatic, and who speaks in capital letters WHEN IT SUITS HER? Yes. Because Max is older. He gets jealous. He's in a band. He's nice to her and he (mostly) puts up with her parents and he picked her. I'm not surprised she wears the rose-colored glasses for a while and doesn't see that he's a jerk to the Nth degree.<br /><br />Now... now we can talk about Cricket. Cricket, who makes my heart pitter-patter just from  thinking about him. My love for him is matched only by my love for Etienne St. Clair. I want to stride into a party with one of them on each arm. One thing about Cricket? He wants to be there for everyone who matters to him. Another thing about him? He's upfront about his feelings and OH THE FEELINGS, they TWIST my heart.<br /><br />Something about both of them? Neither one of them has recovered from when they last saw each other two years ago.<br /><br />Overall rating: 5/5. Perkins has the ability to make you think that True Love can exist in the real world. While Anna is probably my favorite of the two, Lola was an excellent novel in its own right.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B004MPESSY|5.0|I have seen the original movie and thought it was okay. But the remake to me was much better and had me on my toes. I am also a female and I could agree the rape scene was hard to watch but let's be honest, it's a movie not a documentary. If you didn't like it, why watch the whole movie. I would definitely recommend anyone that love suspense to watch this but not with any children around.
0142419400|5.0|What I liked: My original review of this book on Goodreads read like this: \\"5 stars is not enough. I need 10 stars. Or possibly 15. I may or may not have burst into tears while reading this book. I loved it. More than I've loved any book in recent memory. I promise I'll get to a coherent review soon, but for now I need to just lay back and accept that this book now owns a piece of my soul.\\"<br /><br />You know that still kind of sums things up for me. I wrote that non-review almost a week ago, and I still can't be very coherent for you, but I'm going to try.<br /><br />Etienne St. Clair is not your typical swoony adolescent. He's British (kind of), American (a little), and French (physically). Oo la la. And one of Anna's friends likes him too. And homeboy's short with a girlfriend problem. BUT I LOVED HIM ANYWAY. And so does Anna. He's friendly and funny and he and Anna are perfect together.<br /><br />And Anna... oh Anna. She is so confused. She likes this boy, but he is an idiot even though he likes her back. So she is a typical hormonal girl and draws lines that she crosses too often and rationalizes them and tries to brush her feeling for Etienne aside by concentrating on other boys, but it never works. Anna was so real. Of course things don't work with the cute boy in her French class or the boy from back home or anyone when all she really wants is for Etienne to notice her. Etienne, I love you, but you're such a moron.<br /><br />I really did not expect to like this book. I thought there would be too much Frenchy-ness, and too much squealing over kissing and too much woe-is-me-my-parents-have-shipped-me-off-to-Le-France! But there wasn't. The tension between Etienne and Anna only culminates in one kiss before the grand finale. And while the Frenchyness was fun, it was barely there. It set the stage but not in a snooty look-at-me-I-wear-ascots-and-am-so-tres-cultured kind of way.<br /><br />My heart was a writhing mass in my chest while I read this book. I still can't be coherent so forgive the capslocks, hyphens, bolding, and italics... I-LOVED-IT-TOO-MUCH.<br /><br />What I didn't like: I suppose my only criticism would be a bit in the pacing of the book. I felt like we got off to a slow start, but setting it in Paris amongst Americans necessitated that a bit. We, just like Anna, had to get the lay of the land. And some scenes felt like filler, but that didn't mean I enjoyed them any less.<br /><br />So, do I rec it? Yes. Yes. Y-E-S!!! If you like young adult chick-lit and romance... this was perfect. I loved it so much that I will be obtaining my own copy so that I can reread it at my leisure. It needs a spot in my permanent collection. I Couldn't Put it Down. And I really mean that. I stayed up until 2 or 3 reading it when I knew perfectly well that I needed to wake up early for work. Stephanie Perkins is my queen.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was 15, devouring all books I came across then. Once I was handed this darkened, dog eared copy by a friend, I had no idea it would mean so much to me by the close. Its an amazing memory to have, the one where you are handed a book that ends up finding a place in your shelf of impossible to forget books. Always I remember thinking naively that a book I am handed will have no place in that mental realm of stories that grab you. Yet when they do, there is something sweet and pulling about the memory of first opening that particular book. Similar to receiving a present you first thing nothing of and then find it becoming such an  intricate  part of your life. Few authors find themselves on this ethereal shelf for me; Neil Gaiman, Diane Wynne Jones, Terry Pratchett, and Garth Nix.  Sabriel was the book that brought a new author a permanent place in my incorporeal bookshelf.<br /><br />Spending the last of her school years across The Wall, a barrier that acts to separate a land of magic from one more similar to our own, Sabriel has found herself nearing her last year of learning. Being placed close enough to the wall for a small amount of power to still seep through, the amount of magic she was able to procure held such a small match against what she found herself suddenly faced with. Being the daughter of the Abhorsen, a long line of those versed in the ability to place the dead back to rest, she was able to narrowly protect he boarding house from an undead creature that came baring a message- A call for help from her father, the current Abhorsen of the Old Kingdom across The Wall.<br /><br />Finding herself pressed to save her father she ventures into the Old Kingdom now overrun by undead at night. Throughout her wanderings she finds companionship in a small white cat named Mogget, whose ability to speak only adds to the enigma of being a servant of the Abhorsen family.Even with his guidance, she finds herself having the role of acting Abhorsen thrust upon her nearly overwhelming as she learns to wield the weapons of an Abhorsen, seven bells, by having them be the only means between her and the hordes of evil that seem to be tracking her way.<br /><br />I sincerely recommend this book. I have found myself lending it and recommending it for years after I first read it. I remember waiting at the bookstore for the books that followed the end of this story. I really do believe that if you find yourself with this book in hand, you will  not be disappointed.sen thrust upon her nearly overwhelming as she learns to wield the weapons of an Abhorsen, seven bells, by having them be the only means between her and the hordes of evil that seem to be tracking her way.<br /><br />I sincerely recommend this book.

0375842209|5.0|I feel like I need to speak about this book in a hushed whisper because my respect for it is so great.<br /><br />This book had been on my TBR for a while, but I tended to pass it over for \\"shinier\\" books. You know... happier ones. I finally got around to picking it up thanks to the FYA book club this month. And it's not a happy book, but it's certainly a beautiful one.<br /><br />The Holocaust is a difficult subject for some obvious reasons, but I'm recommending this book anyway. I wouldn't change a thing. There were so many \\"quotables\\" and the prose is just perfect. And the last 50 pages or so of the book completely undid me. I was sobbing hysterically while reading.<br /><br />This is a short review but the reason for that is simple: This book is too amazing. I don't have the right words for it. I am so glad that I read it.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 5/5. This is an absolute masterpiece. I hope it's one of those books that is/becomes required reading in schools.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is the kind of book that keeps me reading David Baldacci.  Everything in the book is related to the plot so it just keeps moving through the whole read without alot of extraneous material.  These are characters I hope to see again. Thank you Mr. Baldacci for a great time.
159514188X|5.0|I had to mentally prepare myself to read this story. Suicide is a topic that almost everyone, myself included, tends to shy away from.<br /><br />Asher uses the unique format of audiotapes in the style of an audiotour to tell Hannah's story and utilizes a double narration style that is almost haunting because you know how one person's- Hannah's- story will end, no matter what other twists and turns the story may take.<br /><br />Both voices: Hannah and Clay ring extremely authentic. Hannah is a girl with who is angry that no one cared enough (in her eyes), a girl who has given up, and a girl with an understandably macabre sense of humor. And Clay is a boy that liked her who is horrified that he may have somehow caused her to kill herself.<br /><br />This book makes you second-guess how you treat everyone around you. It makes you realize how one move that you think inconsequential may affect someone else deeply.<br /><br />Rating: 5. This book is in a class all its own.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie is a must see. Very entertaining, and the illusions done were suspenseful and memorizing. I had a great time watching this movie.
0143119680|2.0|What I liked: It had a lot of my favorite elements for a novel: the supernatural, a love story, and nearly insurmountable odds. I also liked Diana in the beginning. She was very intellectual, passionate about her work, and had a dark and twisty past.<br /><br />What I didn't like: I read this book on the recommendation of People magazine. The review raved that if you liked Harry Potter (love it) and Twilight (am ashamed to admit it), you would like this book because it was fantasy for grown-ups.<br /><br />And there was a time when I might have liked this book. If I hadn't grown up reading fanfiction and thus becoming all too familiar with the \\"Mary Sue\\" and\\"Gary Stu\\") phenomenon, I probably would have liked it. Because when I was thirteen, and in high school... I didn't mind Mary Sues so much. Homegirls were all-powerful. They could do anything!<br /><br />And that's the problem. Diana Bishop's only flaw is that she's too powerful. She has powers that have been gone for generations. It's unheard of for a witch to have that many powers. And anything she can't do, it's doubtless that her lovey-turned-hubby, vampire Matthew Clairmont (aka our \\"Gary Stu\\"), CAN.<br /><br />Once Clairmont entered the picture it seemed like he was all Diana really cared about and I just couldn't respect her anymore.<br /><br />It just read like `fic. Really, really long fic, the kind that garners tons of reviews and following, but the nothing particularly fantastic. The prose wasn't exciting, the characters were bleh, and I just think it was built up to be way more than what it was. I found it so-so. Not the worst thing ever, not the best.<br /><br />So, do I rec it? I give it an Eh. If you've got nothing but time for the 579 pages and nothing else to read... why not? But I was definitely not impressed.<br />- See more at: [...]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! Awesome game it's addicting like you are really caring for a horse!  My kids love it too.  And it's clean fun no dirty stuff! The graphics are great.
0321934946|4.0|Scott Kelby really make reading this book fun.  It has just enough tech stuff to get you used to the lingo, and a lot of common sense so that you understand concepts and makes you want to learn more!  I would also recommend Kelby Online Training Courses as well.  Very useful.
B00DHHWY9I|1.0|This is a fair movie... if you can manage to sit through the first half.  The first hour of this film made me want to scratch my eyes out, it makes no sense, has no consistency, is historically inaccurate to the point of bringing tears my eyes and is just abolutely retardedly ridiculous.  Poorly made is an understatement, this film will stand for all time as a testament to the fact that a big budget, big stars and outrageous CG effects do not mean the movie is good.<br /><br />Other than the fact that the first half of the movie (unlike the book) made absolutely no sense, seemed to completely lack any purpose and was nearly sickening in it's constant camera-angle changing motion spinning toward making as much noise and pretty colors as possible without advancing any kind of plot... it was freaking BORING and completely uninteresting.  The only reason I even made it through more than 30 minutes of this tripe is because my wife refuses to not watch a movie she's paid for, no matter how awful.<br /><br />Now, at about half-way through the film, after this absolutely ridiculous excuse for a \\"party\\" at Gatsby's (see below), the film slowly becomes tolerable.  As if they suddenly changed directors the film starts to turn away form flashy, noisy \\"look at how cool looking my new movie is\\" (which it isn't) toward an actual character and circumstance driven story.  Too late though, because by the time it really gets interesting it's pretty much over, and to be honest I was more than ready for it to be.<br /><br />Why it sucks more than anything else:  Historical piece, base upon classic literature, with absolutely NO historical accuracy or base of reference.  Dear director and producer, this is supposed to be the roaring twenties you idiots, do some research.  JAZZ MUSIC DOES NOT SOUND AT ALL LIKE CLUB MUSIC, people didn't dress like that, the world didn't look like that, they didn't have super-charged cars that could outrun the batmobile, they didn't talk like that, and nothing was made of plastic.  Ever heard of this thing called art nouveau?  No?  Well they did in the twenties.  Truly, the opportunity this movie had to protray life in the twenties should have been inspirational.  Instead, the production team used it as an opportunity to go retarded.  SHAME ON THIS MOVIE AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN MAKING IT.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to a drunken monkey, do not waste the money or time required to watch this.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I like this one very much. Both of them. It keeps you interested from the beginning to end. I like the music in it also.

B002RI99IM|4.0|I think Taleb is an intellectual snob BUT, he is so well read and understands what he has read so well that you have to forgive his snobbery. Not as good a fooled by randomness but I am glad I finally read it so I can be an intellectual snob too. There is chronic misinterpretation of this work by people who have only ever heard Rumsfeld's quote about the various unknowns.

B008AIGWVA|2.0|It is cute, but doesn't do anything.  It might be amusing for young children but be aware that it does have noises such as burping and a ringing phone which could get annoying.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|This depressing movie was a testimonial on why no one who should do any form of drug.  Not entertainment in my book.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel as a book itself is one of my favorites and the series it is part of is fantastic. Its full of action, suspense and generally a great story with relatable and loveable characters that creates a book that is literally unputadownable.<br />It's all kicks of with this book where the lead character leaves school and the relative safety of Ancelstierre and heads north and across the wall to the Old Kingdom (where she is originally from)to try and find and save her father who has sent a distress message to her. She picks up some interesting and hilarious companions on her way and a destiny she never thought she'd have to step up to this young.<br />I love this book because whilst it was accessible to me as a teenager it is still enthralling as an adult as its not your usual 'oh I'm 16 must find who I am and a dark and mysterious man'. Shes a smart strong 18 year old who doesn't shy from a challenge and runs head first into danger. Sabriel is just fantastic and the sequels are equally brilliant.<br />I've heard Garth Nix is writing a prequel as well and I am waiting in anticipation of the new book!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Grabs my interest till end of book. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Very well written, keep up the series.

B0002HY7JG|1.0|I was so looking forward to adding this Blue Budgy to my daughter's bird cage with fake Parakeets.  I was so disappointed when it arrived.  It is very small.  It was not worth the $5 I spent on it.  It sure is easy for Amazon to trick people with the size since we are looking at a zoomed in pictures.  My daughter was disappointed as well.  This looks like one of the toys that comes in a tube with 20 other small toys.  I wish I could return it, but if they make me pay shipping then I will be out the cost of the bird and the bird.

B00C0YPH7U|1.0|This review is only regarding the 2013 Japanese reissue of Red. The album performance is 5 stars but this Japan 2013 issue is one star because it is not pressed in Japan.<br /><br />I have never had this experience buying a Japanese record - the vinyl is NOT pressed in Japan. It says clearly \\"Made in England\\". Yes, the packaging of my copy is Japanese with lyric sheet and Obi. But not the pressing. If you buy this release expecting the usual high quality Japanese pressed vinyl as I did you shall be disappointed!<br />This is not the fault of any seller, I understand that.<br />You might as well buy any 2013 reissue of Red because they all appear to have been pressed in England - at least each of the 3 I bought trying to find a better pressing were. Disappointing to say the least.<br /><br />So how is this \\"Made in England\\" pressing? I have had 3 different pressings of this title now (ALL Made in England) in my quest to find a good one.  All 3 had problems of some kind.  Strangely, there is one problem that is present on all 3 - a loud tick in the second line of the second verse of \\"Fallen Angel\\" - specifically between the words 'switch' and 'blade'.  Exactly the same.  I don't know why but this sounds like something that was missed and probably affected a batch.  When there are no ticks or pops, the sound is really great.<br /><br />I have all the Panegyric reissues of King Crimson so far - sadly, this is the least consistent by far as the others are great.<br />Good luck and hope you find better pressings than I did.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Most everything written by Michael Connelly is enjoyable.  After taking a break from his books, I returned to read more from the Harry Bosch series and I have to say, this book was a good read.  I love how fluidly Connelly writes and having ADD, I appreciate how he gets the plot going right away without too much character development or arduously constructing the storyline.  This book kept my attention all the way through to the end.  If you are looking for a good escape, I recommend this series.  I have read the first four Harry Bosch novels in order and have not been disappointed.  I began reading Trunk Music yesterday and it already looks to be another good escape.
B0049MPHY4|5.0|I've been through quite a few of this guy's books, and for me this is the best... It's got everything, good characters, huge ideas and a touching story. If you liked any of his other books, this one is a definite readd.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|Very good watch. I enjoyed the artist and musician education. I think it was presented in an entertaining format as well.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Cleverly written and creative thoughts kept me wanting to keep reading. Can't wait to continue reading the rest of the series

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Getting tired of mindless syfi with only graphics, violence and sex to keep your interest.  Here was a captivating story line with intriguing  twists and turns.  Acting was excellent.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|I'm so glad that I read this book! The story has many twists and turns, and the characters are well developed and truly believable. Altogether, this book was entertaining from start to finish, and I'll be investing in more of this author's work.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I didn't know much about this movie before I saw it and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It was a cleverly put together mystery where you weren't sure what would happen next.<br /><br />The actors were really good. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were great as well as Woody Harrelson and of course Mark Ruffalo. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco (James Franco's brother) were good too.<br /><br />It also didn't have alot of violence or sex so if you want to know if you could have kids watch it I think it would be OK. They mention sex in one scene but that's it.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Enjoy!

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I really do like the up-tempo of JJ Abrams' Star Trek Universe. And after all the TNG movies which were like 2 hour TV episodes, not really movies, the were disappointing with the small exception of the TNG Nemesis, which was badly acted but the story was good. Into Darkness will allow Kahn's character to maybe even have more development than it ever did before, since his demise isn't complete at the end. I know some Trekkies will disagree. But this movie is well-paced, has a complicated story-line, and leaves some opening for revisiting the best villain Capt Kirk ever faced. It reminds you that the worst villain is the one you can see yourself being. That's what Benedict Cumberbatch's Kahn does to our new Captain Kirk. He reminds him that certain qualities admired in some, can become very easily the reason to become the worst. person. ever. Thin lines between love/loyalty and hate/betrayal.<br /><br />And now of course, we'll get the story of Capt Kirk and Dr. Carol Marcus, with whom he had a son in other universe, so now the timeline of that can be that his son lives in the future! Which I happen to think is a good thing. But JJ Abrams has only covered maybe a year of Enterprise time, so how long before we can expect to see the return to a weekly series JJ-style, in the timelines now established, in which there is a New Vulcan, will pon-farr still be an issue for a people whose original home-world is gone and they need to repopulate? It would be logical that even Spock's half blooded DNA is needed for a breeding project. I see so many possibilities and maybe even Abrams can manage to do it without all the screaming dialogue. I look forward to that.
0064471837|5.0|I re-read Sabriel at least once every few years.<br /><br />It was the first book I packed when I was moving overseas for a year; it's my flagship recommendation to anyone asking me what to read next. It's been my favorite book since middle school and has been one of the longtime friends encouraging me to live fully, travel and be brave when facing the world.<br /><br />Because Sabriel, the main character, is brave. She travels. She fights for what she believes in and risks walking in the realm of death itself in order to confront the dangerous world she lives in. Sabriel is a role model. And since childhood she has frequently reminded me that a mixture of striving, learning and doing are the recipes for a remarkable heroine.<br /><br />The Old Kingdom is an atmospheric, often dark place that feels full of secrets, beauty and magic. It's a fantasy setting that manages, with swords and spells, to reflect a sense of danger and vibrancy that lends it deep authenticity. It's a setting where Sabriel is constantly put to the test with believable consequences.<br /><br />That is why this book had gone with me through my life. It's a compelling fantasy, but it transcends setting and genre and gives us characters who stick with us even in the real world. Characters who point the way, who remind us what it means to be heroic. Characters who we come to see as personal champions and who inspire us.<br /><br />I re-read Sabriel once every few years. Every couple of seasons, when I need to remember how to be a brave young woman in a tough world.<br /><br />This book will stick with you for life.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|corny, cheesy, full out shout outs to almost every movie any of the actors have been in.  lots of explosions, maybe kind of fun.  just watching it will cause you to test positive for steroids.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Loved this show. I hated to see it end, but at least I can watch it free on Amazon with Amazon Prime!
B004CMBZJC|4.0|nice little spinoff from the recent Dr Who series.  don't expect to be blown away, but definitely worth a watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book!! Kept my attention all the way through. Not crazy about the ending, but I understand how it was necessary in order to lead to sequels.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Robert De Niro has always been one of my favorite actors, and this movie is another favorite. Joe Pesci  with De Niro is always an amazing combo!

B000NGTJTY|5.0|Love this movie- All my favorite actors- many unexpected twists. What more can you ask for in a great drama movie?
0451196716|3.0|I had high expectations for this book because I had read under the dome before reading the long walk and I really liked under the dome a lot. Now since I'm a teenager I don't really know a lot about king and that this book was written as Richard bachman, a pen name king gave himself because he wrote a number of books before his first books Carrie and The Shining. The main reason that Stephen king wasn't written on the cover because king thought that these \\"Bachman\\" books weren't good as his first books like Carrie and he was right.<br /><br />I first heard about the long walk in 6th grare when I was coming home from a school sport and I was telling my friend about The Hunger Games and my friend's mom said,\\" That reminds me of The Long Walk by Stephen King, \\" and I wanted to read it ever since. Now that I'm older I finally read and was deeply disappointed in it. Well for starters the book is about Ray Garraty and that he is participating in The Long Walk where 100 teenage boys walk for The Prize but if you get more than three warnings, you're given a ticket or more simply you get shot to death. Throughout the book, Ray makes friends with some of the other boys and this is how character development is created.<br /><br />The main problem I had was that you guess that this is in an alternate future but its never explained what happened in the past that brought us to this alternate future.  One of the characters references to The Change but nothing is said to show us what The Change is. But this is just one plot hole in the story. Another plot hole is that none of the characters give reasons as to why they would walk hundreds of miles non stop and face the probability of their imminent death!! Which leads me to think of how this society has evolved into what it is in the book where they cheer on their Walker that they've betted on and cheer for the deaths of 99 innocent boys. And none of this is explained to you while reading.<br /><br />Now you may argue that people like books that let certain parts of the plot left out so you can interrupt what would happen and I hate these kinds of books.  Why waste your time not trying to fully create your entire world and let the reader be taken for a ride and hope they like it? And one last thing too is that this book is truly horrifying and depressing to read just thinking that this event could happen in our society today with reailty tv and such programing.<br /><br />Overall, this book really gets you thinking and is a short read because of Stephen King's writting.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Love, Love, Love Robert Duvall, and this movie is a FABULOUS way to spend a few hours on a crummy day indoors. Have to say, this movie would appeal to both men and women- Western + Love story- doesn't get any better than that. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend you do!!

B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This parody of a classic sci-fi movie is wonderful.  Enormously funny, and Enrico Colantoni is perfectly cast as the alien leader.  He's wasted on Flashpoint and serious drama; comedy is his forte.
B00003CXAA|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this series?? Amazing, classic gangsters, UNFORGETTABLE, Have and will watch many times over- My hubby and I still stop and watch when it's playing on TV, no matter what point of the film it's at!!
B0056VGOZI|5.0|This, his last novel, is unquestionably autobiographical.  Not about Steinbeck's outer life, but his inner.  One cannot help but be empathetic with Ethan Allen Hawley, the protagonist.

B003JH8LPW|4.0|If you are into computers, this is a must read.  It held my interest from beginning to end.  Great book.
B00406UK5A|3.0|A good action epic to an extent. As a &#34;sword & sandals&#34; genre, it left much to be desired. The main portion of the movie consisted of the bad guys chasing the good guys.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele at her best in about the post prestigious setting in England.  The supporting case is just as good a Adele herself.  This is one of the few discs I will watch over and over.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|It's a love story that gets in the way of the other earth looming in their sky.  It's a movie about redemption and second chances; of how we see ourselves outside of ourselves. This time the dopplegangers are not sinister or nefarious. They are us.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This film is a classic. Even though I already have it I am looking to get it on digital copy so I can download it to my ipad and I can watch it whenever or wherever I want. Any ways great film. It is probably one of my favorites.
0307352153|5.0|When I first picked up the book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain, I was hooked from the second sentence on the back cover referencing those \\"who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion\\" and thought to myself \\"I'm not alone in the world!\\"  As I began reading the book, I found myself repeating this response frequently.  Being a book lover, I typically abhor writing in books, but I found myself underlining and starring many important points Cain makes throughout this work.  I can honestly say I loved this book and it has impacted me more than many other books I have read recently.    Cain begins by describing the temperaments of introversion and the \\"extroverted ideal.\\"  While not putting down this ideal, she describes how the extroverted ideal and the culture of personality were not always seen as ideal and how society has shifted from valuing the characteristics of quieter introverts to the current emphasis on loud extroverts.  For example, in today's culture individuals who talk more are seem as leaders and are more likely to have their ideas accepted even if the idea isn't that great.  I imagine many introverts related to the examples of being passed over for jobs or promotions because they were quiet rather than loud. Cain researched Quiet very thoroughly and includes 271 endnotes.  While including many examples and anecdotes, every concept is backed up by research as well.    Since receiving a copy of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain to review, I have heard references to this ground-breaking work in a variety of conference presentations and in conversation with others.  Originally published in 2012 in hardback, the copy I received was published in 2013 as a paperback and includes a reader's guide.  Quiet is a book that needs to be read by teachers, leaders, professors, and anyone who interacts with others in any manner.  After reading Quiet, introverts will understand themselves much better and realize they are not inferior or less of a person for being introverted.  Extroverts will have a better understanding of their introverted colleagues and be better able to work with them.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Except for The X-Files, this Battlestar Galactica series is the best show ever on TV.  And Blu-Ray makes the experience even better.  I think if everyone sat and watched all the episodes of these people who are desperate to find Earth, maybe mankind would take better care of our planet.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wonderful story of dedication , commitment and love . Told from A loving husband to his beautiful bride of many years . James garner is a wonderful actor , as is all the rest of the cast . I ordered this movie to have my fiancé watch it with me , cant wait !

B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Why can't we choose zero stars?<br />I won't buy this until Paramount backs off the greed a little. By spreading the special features around all the exlusive deals, they are basically saying \\"screw you\\" the customers. They are telling me that if I want to see the all the speacial features I must buy the same movie from 3 or 4 different places and join itunes. That is just absurd. Don't buy this until they release a \\"special edition\\" later that has all the features together.

B00000IREA|1.0|Jane Fonda looks embarrassed in director Roger Vadim's infamous comic-book adaptation — a campy sci-fi sex romp that goes nowhere. Once you get past the colorful opening credits, &#34;Barbarella&#34; (1968) plummets to earth with a dreary thud. Mario Garbuglia's stylish production design cannot relieve the boredom. A big-budget bomb from &#34;King Kong&#34; producer Dino De Laurentiis.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|First of of all, I have loved Ben Nichols of the band Lucero for over a decade. The director of the movie, Jeff Nichols is Ben's brother. This is the first reason I watched the movie, but I have to say I absolutely loved this film and it's not just because I like the director's brother. I loved the scenes from a rural poor town in Arkansas and the simplicity of making a life with your hands. The two young boys are Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn on a deeper search for the meaning and possibility of what love and family truly is. They finally find that inadvertently at the end of the movie. I love the scenery, and the music is spot on. This is not a movie for the theater that everyone will love, but if you like poignant tales of deeper meaning on life's journey, then this is a fantastic movie to bring back the running around and fresh viewpoint of basic love and life of youth.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|While I am still trying to figure some things out about this game, I am thoroughly enjoying the distraction it provides.
B00E9PXI3S|3.0|Despite being tonally inconsistent and silly at times, it's a (somewhat) welcome return to form for De Palma, even if his Hitchcock-aping doesn't really take effect until the last act.  Structurally and tonally, one can divide this movie into three parts: The first is kind of like a dramedy (suggested by the soundtrack), the second is more of a melodrama and the third (and final) act goes into full WTF mode as De Palma pulls every trick in his admittedly small book and tries to get the viewer to question the reality of everything they see.  As such, the movie isn't really that effective until this section, with most of the prior dialogue seeming sophomoric and shallow, much like the relationships and characters in the film.  Still, this movie is worth watching for that final act.  It's style over substance, but it's got quite a sense of style.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love everything despicable me so its safe to say I lobed this game and how it works. its a lot like temple run but a few extra twists. the downloading process at the pegolinning is a bit long but width it. I love that you can sign up wig fb and play with friends.
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|I read the reviews and downloaded the mp3 without even sampling.  I really like this.  I don't know about the Chris Cornell reference, they sound more like Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow to me (Ronnie James Dio?), which is good.  As others said, if you like LedZep, Deep Purple, and those bands from the 70's and 80's, then you will likely dig this album.  It's not groundbreaking...it's refreshing, just good music.  Can hard rock be comfortable?  I guess if you are 56, like me, then it sounds good.  I am only disappointed that their Fall tour doesn't come close to Vegas!  I imagine these guys are GREAT live! If you live in northern Cali or Denver, pay attention and catch them.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|The unique idea of a sci fi western set in the distant future was so original that it was bound to get a large fan base from the get go.  I discovered this series on Amazon Prime Streaming, instantly I was hooked and enjoyed every episode. The characters work so well together and the stories are clever - that's enough to get and keep my attention and is a lot more than the average rubbish that the networks seem to be happy serving up today.  Yet it was cancelled after the first season and I have to ask the question &#34;Why?&#34;  Were the networks smoking crack ? This was a winner that died too young even though the film Serenity was produced. Perhaps in the future it will be picked up again and a second season will debut - I certainly hope so.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A perfectly cast, visually beautiful film. Very close to the book. You'll became a Richard Armitage fan once you watch this. Great Date Night film. LOVED IT!!!!!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although the book falls under the category of &#34;youth&#34; this is a wonderful read for adults as well.  The author certainly has a deep understanding of the impact a serious disease can have on the soul of each of us.  Once you begin this book, you will not want to leave this insightful story.  I recommend the book to anyone who cares about the dignity and courage that can emerge in the lives of those who face great challenges.

0743297334|2.0|This \\"classic\\" is a huge disappointment, and I don't see why this was the book that catapulted Hemingway into a pantheon of great writers.<br /><br />Almost none of the elements of what constitute good fiction are in this book, such as any emotional or psychological growth among the characters. The main character, Jake, is really Hemingway, and this novel is a barely disguised diary of his time in Europe wasting time in cafes and bars with his friends, talking about their inability to write (hint: maybe it's because they were always drunk?) and in particular, his famous travels to Spain to watch and write about the bull-fights that mesmerized him. It is also about the love and lust several of the characters, including Jake, have for Lady Brette Ashley, a not-quite-divorced, penniless, beautiful and reckless woman who continually runs off with men she has just met, notwithstanding her engagement to Mike. She is supposed to be a sympathetic character, but her total lack of judgment, total lack of consideration for the feelings of others, and inability to pull her life together, don't earn sympathy in my book.<br /><br />In fact, the only character who I found even slightly sympathetic is Robert Cohn, a Jewish friend who became a boxer in part \\"to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.\\" Part of my disappointment in this book is that Hemingway opens the story writing absorbingly about Cohn, but then he lets Cohn disappear from the narrative for a very long time, leaving the reader to wonder what role he will play later in the story. Cohn also loves Brette (who doesn't?) and while his judgement in women is just as bad in this regard as all the rest of the men who fall for her, I felt his pain at having been able to run away with her for a week or so and then, as all her other lovers, get unceremoniously dumped for a newer face. Also, he knows he is disliked in this sophisticated crowd for being a Jew, and behind his back is called a slew of anti-Semitic names.<br /><br />Having just read The Paris Wife, a pretty good historical novel about Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, I also knew that The Sun Also Rises makes no mention of Hadley as a character, though they were married at the time of these experiences and she was with him in these travels. Though he dedicates the book to her, Hadley must have been enormously hurt to have been written out of this narrative, which Hemingway finalized with the help of one of his many drinking buddies, F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br /><br />Giving credit where credit is due, Hemingway's spare style of writing, often the subject of parody, can be arresting, but the repetition of the most mundane details is tiresome, as is much of the narrative:<br /><br />\\"I feel sorry about Cohn,\\" Bill said. \\"He had an awful time.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, to hell with Cohn,\\" I said.<br /><br />\\"Where do you suppose he went?\\"<br /><br />\\"Up to Paris.\\"<br /><br />\\"What do you suppose he'll do?<br /><br />\\"Oh, to hell with him.\\"<br /><br />Jake is almost alarmingly empty as a character; he is seemingly moved only by the artistry of the gifted matador and his love for the unattainable, impossible Brette, but his voice, Hemingway's voice, is stilted, spare and ultimately unsympathetic.<br /><br />The title of the book comes straight from Ecclesiastes, from which Hemingway quotes when the book opens, but the characters in the book usually miss the sunrise because they are sleeping off their mindless drunkenness from the night before. Maybe this \\"Lost Generation\\" wouldn't have been quite so lost if they had all met at an AA meeting instead and made something of their lives.ind his back is called a slew of anti-Semitic names.<br /><br />Having just read The Paris Wife, a pretty good historical novel about Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, I also knew that The Sun Also Rises makes no mention of Hadley as a character, though they were married at the time of these experiences and she was with him in these travels.

B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Loved this movie and how they combined old time style with modern touches. It doesn't even feel like you are watching a love story
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A must read for anyone looking to understand the universal power.  Changed my life. The simplicity of it made it easy to understand.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play minecraft on the Xbox but now I could play it when ever I want!!<br />And I highly recommended this game for people who just want a game that you could do what ever you want to do.<br />You could play with friends and create an awesome world.

1878424319|5.0|Reading about the Four Agreements is the beginning of ultimate freedom; following them is more difficult, takes more discipline and commitment, but it is not impossible.  I am already seeing positive results in my life after starting the book just last week.  I recommend this for anyone who is serious about becoming the person he or she was created to be.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I would have given this game 5 stars but the last puzzle is impossible to beat thus not being able to move to the next treasure chest level. I have many games like this and love to compete with myself but this last puzzle makes me want to pull my hair out.....
1490313370|1.0|There are no words to explain how little substance there is in this book.<br />Constantly I was waiting for it to get even a bit serious, but it never got there.<br />It's like taking advice from a drunken stranger.  Avoid it, your time is precious.

B0056031VY|3.0|The rating is for the blu-ray quality, which I'll describe in a bit.<br /><br />Neither my wife nor I have read the book so we were able to enjoy the story as-is.  My wife wanted to watch it again the next night - something she's never done in the past 30 years.  So 4.5 stars for the movie itself.<br /><br />It was fun to see Blake Ritson (Edmund Bertram) from [[ASIN:B0099116J0 Ken Follett's World Without End [Blu-ray]]] in a more-likable role, and to see Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford) from [[ASIN:B00429MLT8 Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth [Blu-ray]]].  (Those two movies were altered beyond belief; because of them, I decided that watching Mansfield Park BEFORE reading it would give me the best chance to enjoy both movie and book.)<br /><br />I don't have enough interest to be a blu-ray connoisseur but this one has a problem that even I noticed.  In the dark scenes (usually indoors), it's as if the movie was digitized with only 16 bits of color: subtle tones in the actors' faces seem to be rounded up or down to the same color.  People old enough to remember when PC graphics cards were relatively new might remember how a picture of the ocean, for example, might contain only five different shades of blue and would look blotchy: a large patch of one blue dissolving into a large patch of a noticably different blue, and then dissolving into a large patch of another blue, etc.  This is how the actors' faces looked and it took me out of the movie several times.  Perhaps my copy is from a bad batch; I'll watch to see if others note this problem before exchanging mine.<br /><br />With or without flaws though, I daresay we'll enjoy watching this movie quite a few more times.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I ordered this Chromecast the day it was announced and received the 3 free months of Netflix, and I was extremely excited when it arrived, but at this point it's not as great as it can be. Being able to quickly put on Netflix on different TVs in my apartment is neat, but that's all I really do. It sort of works as my HDMI cord for now since mine broke, but it's only my HDMI cord for applications it is allowed to stream. It's cool for $35, but it's nothing to go home to mom and rave about. My roommates were completely in awe that I could control it from my iPhone though. It's an all right little gizmo.

159102594X|1.0|This book was recommended to me as a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series, so I had some high expectations. I have read plenty of bad fantasy novels, and while this is by no means the worst, it isn't far off. There is little here to inspire interest. The characters are not unique or distinguished, the plot is plodding and sluggish, and worst of all, there are a lot of words that don't hold much substance. In reading this book I found myself constantly searching for something to hold on to, some scene or interaction that would inspire a desire to read on, and I was consistently left wanting. By the end I found little to leave me wondering why I cared about the characters, with no motivation to carry on to the next book.
B009AY04A8|4.0|At first I didn't know what to think of this game but it seems to grow on me the more I play it. The puzzles can be challenging to figure out and that is what keeps me interested in coming back for more. I'm only at level 7 and I see that there are  more than sixty levels to play. I appreciate the length of time this is likely to take me to complete. It makes me feel that I'm getting my money's worth. The puzzles can be frustrating but the hint system helps me get through the trickier parts. I use the chapter breaks as stopping points. Over all I like this game and probably will purchase more games by this publisher in the future.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Am hooked to this game from inception. The physics engine is quite awesome and accurate. It's a good game for brain storming as well as enjoyment. :-)
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I ordered to use it with Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset, it fits into it perfectly well, and it's a lot cheaper than the original one for this model.

B009WUAK2M|3.0|For kids it is OK.  All these actors use to act better than in this movie; the best one was Van Damme.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|remember seeing this in the movies.  was drawn back to it after reading &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;  i thought the beauty of the LOVE outshined the fact that the children were killed in a car crash.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|I love all kinds of movies for any number of reasons. I can overlook flaws and suspend disbelief in most case. However, I personally have always had issues with robots (let alone gigantic ones) that are hyper-human in their actions and responses. No motors, servos, gears, supercomputers, gyros, or stabilizers will EVER match the human machine. Reach over to the person next to you and give him or her a little push. Notice how their equilibrium kicks in and nearly the whole body in nerves and muscles reacts in micro seconds to balance itself. Any robot would tip over before it could react. *sigh*  Yeah, I know. A silly hang up. C-3PO i can handle. Real Steel I won't even watch. Anyway, this was almost a deal l breaker for me and I almost passed on Pacific Rim, but I love creature movies too much to skip it. The Kaiju monster were awesome. The story was bloated with cliches, and consistency and continuity were absent most times. Some of the characters were almost interesting. As always the asian chick was hot. Other racial stereotypes were present, but not offensive - just more cliche content. Overall the movie looked great and at the end I found myself entertained and satisfied.  I definitely recommend it. Despite my aversion to robot movies I know I will buy this movie and watch it many times in the future,

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show.  Refreshingly free of sex and bad language.  Great stories, great scripts, great actors and great individual lines.  As soon as I finished watching it the first time I started from the beginning again.  Can't wait for season four!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I has a lot of trouble putting it down. The way the story unfolds, really gives you a chance to bond with all the main characters.

140006922X|3.0|Maybe  2 1/2 stars.i was moved to read this book after I saw the author on the,Stephen Colbert Show. He seemed like an articulate scholar with interesting new historical facts I could learn about my religion. I was excited about reading it after I saw the blundering  interviewer make a fool of herself speaking with him on Fox News ( surprise?) . He again, was articulate, gracious and very well informed. His writing style fell short of his interview skills. Perhaps I am a biased, as a Christian, just about every page in this book flies in the face of what I was taught about my religion. ( Not that I have grown to believe in all those nuns taught me in Catholic School !) the historical facts presented in this book are troubling to me if they are true. I feel like I have been misled as to who Jesus was as a historical figure and that Jesus as Christ was pretty much made up by St Paul and the early apostles. ( Again, if one believed the contents if the book). It was really interesting, for those who like history/ religion. Not impressed in the writing style. Repetitive, smug, and overly loquacious. The chapters seem fragmented and facts are repeated over again in subsequent chapters, as though we are students of the author, and he is tutoring us for an exam.<br />On another note, I was appalled at how the author was treated with such self-righteous indignation on Fox News-because he is a religious scholar with several advanced degrees who also happens to be Muslim- how dare he write about Jesus! This is the sort of right wing Christian conservative extremism that alienates us as citizens, embarrasses us as a religion, and degrades us us humans.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show moves so quickly- no wasted time on bad plot lines or lame side stories!  A glimpse into the class system-  both in the society level and the servant level--is intriguing.
140006922X|5.0|I am SO glad I bought this book.  This is the information I thought I would get in the \\"Bible as Literature\\" class in school and did not.<br /><br />Most of the information I have read before, but in parts.  Having it all together in one place with the historical context, the authorship, the political situation, etc. makes the whole picture very clear.  It is very well researched.  Even the notes at the end explaining the source of the material are interesting to read, though I wish they had used larger print!<br /><br />I wish someone would give a copy of this book to the judge who would not allow the couple to name their child \\"Messiah\\" because there was only one messiah.  As this book points out, Jesus was one of many messiahs in the Jewish culture.  And he was crucified for his political sedition to Rome because he wanted the Jews freed from Roman rule.  He was NOT killed by the Jews. He was a devout Jew who was not just religious but also political.<br /><br />My only question about the book would be when the author talked about the fact of whether or not Jesus was married.  He said there was no way to tell in the gospels but that it would have been strange if he were not.  But I have read in several places that he probably was married and the clue in the gospels is the first miracle when he turns the water into wine.  What I have read says it was in that culture the responsibility of the groom to provide the wine.  So the only reason his mother would be seeking him out at the wedding to tell him they had run out of the wine was that he was the groom.  If they were just guests at the wedding, even if they were relatives of the groom, they would not be in any way responsible if the groom had not provided enough wine.<br /><br />I love the fact that Mr. Aslan did not stop his book with the death of Jesus but went into how and when the New Testament came into being and the cultural and political motivations behind what has become recorded in these books to so skew and mysticize Jesus over the years and change him from a man to God using many falsehoods, mis-translations and misrepresentations.  It seems there were as many factions of Christianity then as there are today and there was infighting until a consensus was decreed which has spread the falsehoods.  He explains how the original word in the text is \\"alma\\" which means young maiden.  It has nothing to do with virginity or perpetual virginity.  However, the teaching is now that Mary was a virgin and remained a virgin after giving birth to Jesus.<br /><br />I love the fact that he saved all the stuff that many would put in footnotes to put into end notes. They were a wonderful read in themselves and by saving them to the end, it allowed you to read the main book without interruption and really get the flow and feeling of the era he was discussing.  Often footnotes are distracting and break up the flow of a book that would read much better if you were not being distracted.<br /><br />I don't care what Mr. Aslan's religion is.  It has no bearing on what he has written.  I see why he would disclose it up front, as I would disclose that I am a Catholic.  However, his information is factually based and well documented so those who seem to think his religion has some bearing are crazy.  Some of the things I have read about this book are truly insane and obviously written by people who not only did not read the book but have no knowledge of the Muslim religion but no clue that Islam came after Christianity and honors Jesus and his story.<br /><br />I think the last two sentences of his book are a perfect summation:  \\"Because the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth -- Jesus the man-- is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ.  He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\"and mysticize Jesus over the years and change him from a man to God using many falsehoods, mis-translations and misrepresentations.

B009AY04A8|4.0|Very in depth many different levels, an has an amusing story line not very difficult but enough to be fun. The only negative is the sometimes improper grammar and the penalty for random taps which interferes with moving the puzzle around when zoomed.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game has a lot going on. There are a variety of games within this game where you look for items and collect coins and energy. I enjoy games where you look for hidden items so this is a great game for me. There are also other games you play to collect items, too like pipes and others.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Too often is this book attributed to the preteen set. I found it a remarkably engaging read despite its relatively simple narrative style. Faulkner could have taken notes from Collins.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book has moved me like none other.  It left me almost breathless.  The Author did a outstanding job at depicting the characters so we all could get a complete understanding of this beautiful tale.  I won't soon forget the feelings this book has drilled into me.  A must read!!!!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|What this is not:<br /><br />It is not Toy Story, Wall-E., Up, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.<br /><br />But it also isn't A Bug's Life or Cars 2 (or 1 for that matter).<br /><br />When Disney purchased Pixar, I was concerned that it would lead to the inevitable decline of Pixar films.  I would consider Wall-E and Up to be masterpieces, as well as Toy Story, if for no other reason than its technical significance.  Furthermore, The Incredibles is certainly one of my top 20 favorite films, and it is the one Pixar film for which I've always most desired to see a sequel. But I'm not sure that is fair.  I was a young teenager in the late 80's and early 90's, and so I remember that before there was Pixar there was Disney.  Disney experienced a similar golden age, from the Little Mermaid to Beauty and the Beast, from Aladdin to the Lion King.  At the time I was confident that Disney would continue to deliver a movie a year, each better than the one before.<br /><br />When I was 18-22 years old I hated Pocahontas and Hunchback and Hercules and Mulan and Tarzan, certainly more so because they fell short of the standard I had come to expect and hope. I wouldn't watch any of those movies now if I you paid me. Perhaps, if I were 18-22 now,  I'd feel the same way about some of the more recent Pixar offerings, but now, in my 30's I see what joy Pixar films still bring my children and can see the tremendous value in that.  As I consider it now, I suspect that the fault lies less with Disney, and more with the tremendous challenge that comes from trying to maintain that level of excellence, and the unreasonable expectation that excellence produces.<br /><br />Monsters University isn't a great film.  It isn't boring, but it doesn't engage adults in anywhere near the same way most other Pixar movies do, nor does it incorporate a unique perspective/conceit that defines many Pixar movies.  Whether it is living toys, silent robots in love, or Monsters who are afraid of children, Pixar has made a living making films the audience has not likely seen before.  Here the opposite is true.  Since there is no longer any novelty in discovering a world where monsters are afraid of children, this film simply retraces ground that has been covered dozens of times previously, from at least Animal House though certainly earlier.  Sully and Mike are an odd couple.  They are different and don't like each other.  They are confronted with bullies.  They see the benefit of working together and find friendship.<br /><br />None of that is the point though.  Monsters University is a bright, well crafted film.  It is certainly family friendly and all of the main characters are eminently likable.  If you have children from 3-9 they will absolutely love it, and most children within a few years of 9 will likely love it as well.  And if you find that, as you get older w/children, you can forgive Pixar for not meeting its earlier, nearly unreachable levels of excellence, you might also see a film that does a job fully- entertaining children, even though we might long for more.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Knowing children and adolescents have cancer is a horror of truth.  Adults wonder at their strength through the process of fighting it and parents are tested beyond limits considered humane. Seeing your child loose their hair, their strength and possibly never reach their potential, never knowing the experiences adults remember of their own lives is just not what our society expects for their children.  This book covers much of this. It brings forward unpleasant thoughts and emotions we know exist, but don't want to have.  The saving grace is the way it is all presented in this book. The feelings are real, emotions pure, subject something we fear, but a book we won't forget.  Read it.

B00COGY2P2|3.0|First let me say I really enjoy reading the Jack Reacher series.  The movie on the other hand.  The screen play was a bit disjointed and the acting too hammy.  Tom Cruise is like a lot of other actors who have had a lot of success over the years in Hollywood.  They were fortunate to have the right script, the right director and a good supporting cast that allowed them to have successful movies.  Unfortunately this time Tom Cruise just plays Tom Cruise.  I would like to see future episodes of the Reacher series hit the big screen but I hopeanother talented actor can be chosen for the lead..

I remember two of here singles were played on FM radio, but not anymore yet this album is another incredible work of art by Madonna, new sounds, new themes and I love the album design, it's so addictive, this is Madonna's last great work of art in music.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Stories like this don't get produced in America. Ambiance was so wonderful. it made me want to be in France...and I was for a couple of hours.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I think this album has the greatest art and photography, it is rich in artistic expression and the music is at the frontier of experimentation. It has the sound and atmosphere of New York city, this by far is one of the best albums released that year and is one of the best albums released by Madonna. It has two number one songs which both caused a lot of controversy but that is how art is created. Every adolescent boy should get this album!
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|terrable , the first had at least some humor and bullok and stallone this one has none of that and is kind of dark. not much more i can say.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|I hear them play her single on the radio all the time at work, so I had to get a copy of this album, it's different, it's controversial and funky. This girl's got a lot of potential and I'm so glad she's made to the top of charts and now is up there with the rich and famous.
0920668372|5.0|Saw this book at a baby shower and fell in love with it!  I bought half dozen copies so I could share it with each of our kids and their children also.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. The moral dilemma posed is one that everyone can relate to! I recommended this to my book club. Can't wait to hear other voices' opinions on &#34;what would you do?&#34; Great entertainment.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Story has been done before.  I preferred The Running Man, or I robot however this moved quickly and was an easy read.  Violence against children doesn't impress me, and I hope the other books take a different twist.  All in all I was kept interested and it was put together well with just a few twists to keep you reading.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This Sorcerer's Series is a page turner.  I am on my 6th book and just started the series one week ago.  Very exciting and intriguing to read good versus evil, and the magic powers that are entered in the story, just when all looks and feels like it is downhill.  I compare to the Harry Potter books because that too was a page turner.  I recommend young and old will enjoy.<br /><br />LA
0316227706|5.0|I've follow Seth Casteel since he first started---a friend of mine has a black lab featured in Seth's first book...Seth brings amazing shots of these precious creatures to film....you will enjoy every single one!!
B004OSPTSM|5.0|I read this in paperback and was pleased to find a quality hardback at such a good price!  This is a story every young girl should read because of it's timeless messages about respectable behaviors, family devotion and making positive choices.  I love it!
0920668372|5.0|Some parents cry as they read this book to their children and /or by themselves....it's a timeline message about loving forever...
B003H4I4JU|1.0|This book is set in a wierd time 1870?. Comon And it doesnt make any sence.<br />dont get me wrong card is a brilliant writer
B001E5CH0G|5.0|If you are a Will Ferrell fan---you will love this DVD---he is one of those actors/comedians that will go down in history---this DVD is one of the reasons why!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This is a good game but its very  short the real version is better you get more time I love real version
0671449028|5.0|This &#34; The Going-To-Bed Book &#34; is a great first book for a toddler...I gave it as a gift---they love it
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I loved the movie. The special effects were awesome and I really enjoyed the \\"magic scenes\\" in the movie. It is worth seeing. I am sorry I missed it on the big screen.
0142419850|3.0|The story starts slowly and ends pretty quickly. In previous books, the reader knew as much about the plot as Alex and learned as the story moved forward. In this book, the goal and almost all the plan to reach it are given to the reader in advance and we simply watch Alex struggle to discover what we already know. It made the story less interesting than the previous books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|excellent quality product , good assortment of goods , bought because I know these brands as the best in its class!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very intriguing!!  Loved it!!  Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!  Great read!!  Kept my attention the whole way through!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Good story overall, mommy porn gets old after the first two books. You want to see more depth in the story but then you determine the author isn't going to take you any further.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book. Very Few errors were made during the translation to a kindle book. I would recommend the whole series.
B0080R3PSE|5.0|A true perspective of the 'Real&#34; birth. The way it used to be. No fuss. No stress. No horror stories. Raw, natural, knowledgable Women with strength, producing life.<br />I loved the sections on history & evolution of birth through the ages & how it has ended up where it is now. -Feared.<br />I am now 7 months pregnant, have looked at pamphlets & alsorts of hospital stuff & have read a few books on giving birth. I BECAME SO SCARED !!! My gosh! The stories i hear. I could feel within myself that I was starting to doubt myself & my abilities to 'coap' with this (make believe horror). So seeked something else. Got this book & stopped listening to main stream hospital run organisations & 'help'. (Best thing ive done!).<br />This book is a well needed breath of fresh air. Peaceful, soothing, aknowledgable, grounding.<br />This is my first baby & I am now having a Home birth, with no drugs & have a new, strong faith in all women for the ability to give birth naturally & as calmly as possiable. & I Highly Recommend this book to all :)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was pretty legit! I loved all of the casting choices special shout out to hulk, he has a special place in my heart
1594132054|5.0|What I love about this book is that it is really several books, all revolving around the author's basic thesis, but with so much variety. And it is an intimately personal book as well, as opposed to a tome merely laden with facts. From Big Corn, to Big Butcher, to Fast Food, to Big Organic,  to Polyface farm and food produced by a conscience, and then off to hunting, killing, gathering mushrooms, abalone fishing...to preparing great meals and eating! We all have to eat, and this book is very enlightening about food and eating on a number of levels. It will make you think with every bite, and every time you get hungry and wonder \\"what should I have to eat?\\".
B003VANOFY|4.0|would be a 5 if you could connect via bluetooth or something to other devices besides PCs but I knew that when i bought so its still a solid buy if you know that.
B00005O3VD|5.0|This movie is the reason the world fell in love with Barbra Streisand!  She's funny, she's moving, she sings like...well, like Barbra!  It's an all time classic and a movie that must be on every film lover's shelf, musical/romantic/comedy/drama/history so many genres, all done well.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I love the walking the dead.  I have been hooked on it since day one.  I am huge horror fan so I had to own this dvd.
B0013TTLDE|2.0|I don't quite remember how I came across this book, but somehow I got a sample, started it, and decided to get it from the library, mostly because of the time period--I'm interested in works set in the early 20th century, a time when the world was changing so fast people couldn't even keep up with it.  On a sentence level, it seemed to be well written, with detailed (perhaps too detailed?) descriptions, and I thought, why not?<br /><br />(Warning:  contains some hinted spoilers)<br /><br />It was something of a disappointment to me.  I held on for awhile, especially struck by the early parts when Grace, our narrator, overhears conversations about impending war, and many of the things I find so tragic about this time period were discussed:  that the war (WWI) would be over by Christmas, that it was a gallant adventure.  Of course, it was not, and it was a war that devastated England and the world.  I was intrigued by this part, but of course, later, I thought, that conversation was no different than what I've read in many other books, which I  might find forgiveable if something more were done with the war, but it was really only a plot device, it seemed (the same with the Spanish Influenza that was also mentioned).<br /><br />In the meantime, I was left with a book that depended too much on descriptions, and conversations that went on and on.  Grace was intriguing to me as an elder (the frame story), but not so intriguing as an adolescent housemaid, where she really did become invisible, as she was told she must be as a servant.  To keep my interest, she had to have a little more personality that she did, and I found it hard to believe she later went on to get a PhD and have a career, as dull as she was as a narrator.  Most of the \\"mysteries\\" were so easy to figure out as to be laughable, and when one big one was explained, it was juxtaposed with another big event in the narrator's life, and the scene was so forced it became laughable!  Really, she's so engrossed in a mystery of her mother's life that she doesn't notice what is going on with the young man in front of her?  Hard to believe.  And while the author does a good job of including comments like \\"it was another time\\" to explain the servants loyalty to their masters (and while that could be very interesting), it didn't explain the main character's total lack of personality, and lack of ability to think of another life for herself (because frankly, her obsession with the daughters of the house, esp. Hannah, was not well developed enough to be convincing.)<br /><br />Also, there is a brother in this novel (brother to the young ladies of the house) who seems very important early on, and then he is pretty much erased from the narrative in an unforgiving way.  Really, the narrator tells us she \\"doesn't want to think of it\\" and that's that!<br /><br />I suppose for those who watch such things as Upstairs, Downstairs, this might be interesting (though apparently other reviewers find it too derivative of that series as well).  I even suspect that I might have enjoyed it more 20 years ago, when I was more interested in reading books with an element of romance, stuff that is not romance per se, but family sagas with a romantic twist.  Not chick lit per se, but something akin to it.  However, I am not that reader now, and even then, I suspect Grace would have bored me (how much more I wish we had had of her adult, elder voice, perhaps with more analysis of the story she was telling, for surely a woman who had been an academic and an archeaologist would have been able to intelligently analyze her own life in a more interesting fashion.<br /><br />It was just not my kind of book, and I plugged along for quite aways, then read the end to see if how the author pulled that off would capture my interest (not really), then sighed and decided to read the whole thing anyway, but I can't say I really enjoyed it and I probably won't seek out this author's work again.  It's not quite my thing..
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Saw it in movie theater and left feeling creeped out.  Had to buy it on blu ray for my collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I was waiting forever to get hill climb racing on the kindle fire my kindle broke and when I finally got a new one it was here I used to play it on my dad's phone all the time and I was adicted
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I love the walking the dead.  I have been hooked on it since day one.  I am huge horror fan so I had to own this dvd even if I thought the second season wasn't as good as the first.
B00EB6ENXO|2.0|Iron Man 3 is not an Iron Man movie. It's a Robert Downey Junior movie. Don't get me wrong, RDJ is a great actor and I love what he does with the Tony Stark character but there's this implication in the film that he doesn't need the suit to be considered a superhero. I get what they are trying to sell but the movie makes the suit (or suits) appear to be fragile and worthless.<br /><br />This movie's take on the Mandarin character has no respect for the comic book character. I'm not a comic book purist and I generally approve when movie studios take liberties with characters to make them more believable (Spiderman's Green Goblin for example) or relevant, but they completely trash a character for their own purposes.<br /><br />Hollywood blew it with this movie. They've been given some creative freedom by fans but here they took it too far. It's as if they don't like comic book characters so they are trying to just use them as a vehicle to show us what they consider is art.<br /><br />This is good action/suspense movie but a terrible comic book movie. RDJ is a great actor but through most of the film I was waiting for him to just shut up and get in the suit.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking the dead.  I have been hooked on it since day one.  I am huge horror fan so I had to own this dvd.  thank goodness season 3 got better... more gore and zombies... can't wait to for season 4
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing book. When the story really kicks in you just cannot stop reading. When I finished it I immediately went and bout the next book!
0064471837|5.0|I came across this in the store years ago and I am so glad I gave it a try. It seemed, at first, a little out of my usual YA world, but Nix quickly develops an incredible world that I wish was real.  I was impressed with how well Sabriel was written as a character and how seamlessly she became a heroine.  I tore through the pages during my first reading, and I'm once again revisiting the Old Kingdom.  While this was my favorite in the trilogy, the next book is just as good, again, so glad I took a chance!
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|Where is the variety? Where are the nice graphics and music that add to the gaming experience?  I found this game to be a boring little rhinestone--now jewels here.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I like both Cher and Christina A. and I think the movie has a realistic feeling to it. The singing was awesome and throw in the relationship with a nice guy- as a whole a great movie:-)
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  It was a combination of good storyline, poignant, sweet, funny, and it was all about redemption.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it works well on all of my devices I use it on and it saves space! its having 100 games in one app!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good story great graphics plus puzzles.  Hints are readily available.  Even the best player gets stuck at times in the most usual places for crazy reasons so the hints are a great asset
0061998885|5.0|I LOVE THE BOOK AND THE SERIES. KEEPS  ONE HANGING AND DEVOURING EACH BOOK IN THE SERIES.KNOW I WILL READ THEM AGAIN AFTER AWHILE AND BE ENGAGED ALL OVER AGAIN....GREAT STORIES...AND AUTHOR !
1856697061|4.0|I like this better than the first book.  The illustrations are lovely and helpful.  The ideas are plentiful and interesting.
B005HF1CR8|5.0|I love this show This episode is special to me. My husband and I watched Medium every Fri together before he passed. I watched this episode the first Fri I was home alone after his death. It was as if he was telling me that he will be waiting for me too.
0446581356|5.0|This book gives you essentials as well as things that you already know but more detailed is the perfect book to have for a make up guru
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|FABULOUS....FABULOUS...FABULOUSSSSS...FABULOUSSSSS....Have watched Star Trek since I was in grammar school..these actors fit so perfectly and thank God I have this Movie to look forward to..for I see many many GREAT SEQUALS to come...thank you!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one of the coolists games ever!!!you should try it to you never know you mite like it to
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We love this game the kids love it also age 7 and 10. I didn't know how to play until my kids showed me. My husband even loves it and he doesn't play computer games. I will keep playing and will definitely pay for any future versions . It really is a mind teaser. I really love it and can't wait for more versions to come out.<br /><br />The traveling family of 4
0553296981|5.0|I don't know how I lived 40 years without ever reading this book!  Somehow, it managed to be omitted from the required reading list for my class each year I was in middle school, high school and college.  I blame my teachers for this drastic oversight (but not too harshly).<br /><br />While reading this book, I often found myself forgetting that it was an actual diary of a child.  Anne Frank's voice is mature beyond her years, both in tone and in content.  For some reason, I was surprised to see her dealing with some of the same introspective angst of a typical teenager - misunderstandings between her parents and her, crushes, sibling rivalry, and humor.  I think from a sociological standpoint, this is interesting; that even in forced hiding, near starving, cramped and frightful situations, we remain human to the core.<br /><br />Anne's prose is beautiful, and the book reads like a work of fiction.  As the story unfolds, it isn't the cockeyed optimistic view I was expecting, but it was heartbreakingly hopeful.  I didn't want it to end because I knew why the diary ends.  I've heard it over and over again, but it's true - Anne Frank's diary really does encapsulate the strength and optimism of the human spirit.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good version with nice, simple game options. free, so gotta expect ads; not sure why anyone would complain. about that.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was very moving and provided the reader with a real insight into how a young child survived a horrific ordeal (emotionally, physically and socially).
B00979CS50|5.0|ny and crazy horse once again give us their brand of off kilter rock and roll with the twists and turns we have come to expect
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I loved this movie but he kept the helmet on for the whole movie.  That was a little disappointing cause he is a very nice looking man.  But he did an excellent job on being Judge Dredd.  Highly recommended but a little too violent for children under 10 in my opinion.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|not because of the program it self, but because now i have to wait for the third season,  not fair
B004X80QNG|1.0|Purchased app and a couple of days after vendor released version 3 and expects one to pay $9.99 to upgrade. A really incredible approach. Do not plan to pay ....thanks but .... no thanks
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|really?  they actually made 2112 better!  top notch 5.1 mastering, crystal clear sound with much welcome space between instruments,  the accompanying animated story book makes it just so much better
B004I744AS|5.0|Don't waste your time with other dictionaries. This is the best dictionary I've found out there! It's precise and accurate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. I just love horses. Wish u cud buy the specialty horses with coins but great game Neway.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I read the first book, Peter: A Darkened Fairytale and it was amazing, so magical with bizarre characters and never-ending superbly detailed fantasy lands. To be honest, I am not really a fan of poetry but the first book was so good I thought I would give it a try. The poems open all sorts of wonderful doorways, some relating to the story and other enchanted places- a lovely collection of mystical words. O'Brien knows how to paint pictures with words and certainly draws the reader inside. I can't wait for the next book!
B004IFYMYI|4.0|I had never seen this film and was interested in it from its historical perspective regarding John Hinkley's obsession with it and his assassination attempt on President Reagan. I had heard different opinions on whether Robert  DeNiro's main character in the movie was psychotic or not. Interestingly, there is no convincing evidence that the character was psychotic even though he decided to look psychotic at the time of the actual shootings. Without giving away the ending, it appears that the main character did have a bit of a conscience even though he was seriously disturbed.
1401917186|3.0|It was not what I was expecting.  Have read a number of her books...this feel short of her others. Disipointed.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|There was very little character development and NO on screen chemistry at all!I was very disappointed with the acting.<br />Then there's the problem with the cinematography!  Most of the motion/action scenes consist of extremely quick, choppy angle changes and very shaky filming.  I was getting a little nauseous and it didn't have anything to do with the children fighting.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the CGI!  I had this great image of the chariot scene and the burning costumes when I read the story, but the movie scene gave them two little candle-capes. So sad...<br />That being said, they did do a pretty good job creating the Capital.<br /><br />The book is fantastic!  And aside from the usual details and side plots that are usually left out when a book is converted to film, the movie was still missing a lot!  Since half the book is a narration of Katniss' thoughts, her decision making, her fear, her confusion, even her love struggles were basically omitted in the movie.
0062231375|4.0|If you like the irreverant man you will like this book. It is a fun read and Mr Bourdain does not dissapoint the reader.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|It was really good. It keeps your interest and you can't stop reading. The characters are really interesting as well as the way their different perspective of sexuality mixes together
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING SEASON FOUR.<br /><br />YOU WANT MORE WORDS THATS CRAZY .<br /><br />NOW YOU HAVE YOUR NUMBER OF WORDS BUT IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME I GIVE YOU A FEED BACK.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game for both adults and kids alike. Age range I would say is from 5 years old as it can get rather fast
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|So good, in fact that men might like it too.  Kind of a mixture between Sleeping With The Enemy and a Lifetime tv movie.  I enjoyed it a lot...great suspenseful ending. Filmed in Southport, North Carolina.  Just a nice, easy love story with good actors and a good plot. Highly recommended for what it is!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool game...i recommend to get this game although it takes a little while to download and update and stuff of that sort but its simple and entertaining
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I like Harry Bosch and liked this book. Received electronically, thus no question about shipping or condition on arrival. Good book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun! I enjoy the challenge without it being extremely hard to play! What a great game
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|i love me some joe ..this cd is awesome!!!!love every song.thank u joe for a good r&b cd keep it comin
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Enjoyed the Hunger Games although it is fantasy the way the world is progressing it could be a scary reality well written and keeps you interested.
0316066524|4.0|Funny in a weird way, but very funny.  This is a tome; 1100 pgs.  Your arms will get tired holding this book.  Takes a while to read as the pages are large and the print small.  So many different story lines going on, much of which seems random at times.  Kind of like a Franz Kafka gone Einsteinian amok.  Foster's use of language is extraordinary, challenging.  Sentence structure?  Throw your diagrams away.  Sadly ironic, hilariously demented,
B008B68IUY|5.0|Being a first time amazon buyer i was sceptical of the condition and whether or not it was a true product, but I'm extremely happy i bought it.it's a beautiful car and would definitely recommend it. And the priceless much better than store prices.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Eccleston brought a sexy quirkiness with a hint of darkness to this interpretation of Dr. Who. I had not seen all of the episodes so it was really nice to see them consecutively and see how some other shows appeared from those episodes. I like the graphics but the show still urges you to use the imagination to enhance the experience.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the challenges and change ups of obstacles. My grandson beats me, makes me look like a rookie, but we have a great time competing. Fun, fun, fun.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Nothing too special here, but its nice to see a movie that does a lot of things right and doesn't try too hard. The character development is solid and the plot makes sense throughout. Definitely worth a watch for a solid drama.
159562015X|4.0|I think understanding your strengths and preferences you have for various types of environments or tasks is great. I think maximizing your strengths (or your team's strengths) is also a great idea - I just don't think that a majority of jobs, in any profession or area, in a for-profit company, can or will let the vast majority of employees, focus only on your strengths.<br /><br />Having said that, finding out what your top 5 strengths are, seeing which of the key attributes resonates with you, and how to maximize them, is worth the investment.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|My son recommended this and was so excited to talk about it but didn't want to ruin it for me.  He was right... It's a lot of fun, pulls up all sorts of memories for those of us active in the 80's, and is just exciting to read.  The knowledge about the old games was massive.  It had me playing the old text-based and vector-graphic games again!  What a lot of fun!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I've been struggling with metabolic syndrome and its health effects for nearly 20 years now without realizing it until recently and without realizing what to do about it until I finished this book. I've stumbled on some of the principles Gary explains and saw some of the benefits he describes, but always ran into backsliding. Now i know why. Now I have all the knowledge I need to turn my health around and so can you. Highly recommended.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Fabulous research and a very convincing theory as to the answer to an ageless historical mystery. Gregory is a wonder in how well she creates real people by the depth of her characters personalities.  Can't wait to see what she brings us next!!!!!!!
B004L3AQLU|4.0|It's a good rom-com that has enough romance for the women and enough comedy and a naked Hathaway to keep the guys interested.  A good movie for both.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Very well done, and brought back the times of the original Star Trek -- excellent movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent. Easy to use. Versatile. I use on all of my devices. Love that all the devices are always synced.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|Hesitation Marks diverges enough from the familiar to challenge expectations but still feels like a solid Nine Inch Nails record. Extremely well crafted songs.
B006X96PF6|5.0|I love to listen to Irish music it is probably because then I am Irish. And like the old pub music. And like all the instruments and vocal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply and beautifully amazing... Wish I could read it again... Must read for all... Even if you're not a reader
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I Was engrossed in this book from the word go. The scenes and dialogue felt genuine and realistic to me. Enjoy!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Wow -- Excellent show.  I'm ready for the next season, and will definitely watch this show as long as it is presented.
B006QV30JU|5.0|This has been one of my favorite musicals for a long time.  Brigadoon & Singin' In The Rain are my favorite musicals!
068485015X|5.0|A must read book for anyone wishing to understand life and wanting to grow in all areas.  A must read for anyone.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
