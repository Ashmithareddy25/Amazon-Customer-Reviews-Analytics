B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has surprising depth for a free app. The graphics are great and I am enjoying playing daily.  Five stars!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very well written.  Gives a lot of attention to the &#34;other&#34; side (Germans) which is quite interesting.  Spellbinding descriptions of dangerous flights and damaged planes returning to their bases.
B0094D462M|5.0|I've watched this movie back in the day and it never gets old.  It's a very exciting and entertaining movie. Makes me want to be in the navy as a to gun pilot!
B007STBUIW|5.0|There's nothing new that I can add that other reviewers haven't already said. This version is incredible. The picture is crystal clear. It is like seeing it again for the first time. The goodies on the second disc are real treats. I really enjoyed 'The Shark is Still Working&#34; as well as &#34;Jaws&#34; 'The Restoration', which shows how painstaking the process was of going through the original print and cleaning it up frame by frame.
B003R50FRI|5.0|What a writer! Breathtaking phrasing. Puts you right there in his experience makes you love Indian and it's various inhabitants. He dives into the Mumbai culture and it's many levels educating you while painting pictures most travelers would never see, inspiring! The hardship of their lives yet the depth of humanity that would rival if not embarrass any Westerner. I place this in my top 20 reads of all time. Thank you Gregory for your brutal honesty and the bearing of your soul, written in the blood of your heart with such eloquence.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great puzzle game! I wish it was longer, but it was well worth the $2. I will definitely purchase the next Fireproof game.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|I can never get enough of listening to this man sing.  Half the fun of listening to new albums is listening to the story telling come through the music.  He may be in the news way more than some people can handle, but his talent has no bounds in my mind.  The Voice is just a brief glimpse into the artist that has become one of country's biggest performers today.  Seen him in concert 3 times.  Worth listening to.
0345529057|5.0|I ordered this box set for my husband so he could read them as I was reading them on my e-reader. We are both big fans of the HBO series, but I am an even bigger fan of these books having read all 5 numerous times. The seller described the item &#34;Like New&#34; and I was more than pleased when the item arrived &#34;Brand New&#34; The box set was in perfect condition in the original packaging. The only complaint I have is that the text is soooo small, my husband is having a hard time reading the books. I would definitely order from this seller again. Oh yeah, it said it could take up to three weeks for my purchase to be delivered but it arrived in just over a week.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Michael does it again with this wonderful album of tunes to keep you humming along on your way to and from work.  While other people jam to modern hits, this artist takes up back to a time of classy fanfare. If your looking for classic songs with a modern feel, this is your man.  Josh Groban is also another singer to listen for too, but this is not his album review.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|Offbeat, irreverent humor with lots of familiar faces!  Feed me Seymour!  Wish you could see Audrey II grow like you can in the theater production!
B00881VLCE|4.0|A great game to play alone, or with a grandchild.  Much more fun than the actual arcade machines!  You can actually pick up the prizes with the claws.
B004YSDT52|3.0|Too much left for you to imagine or figure out. Some of the action scenes were not real. Such as the running on rocks and no one falls? I expected more of Alaska views.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Finding Nemo is a classic Pixar film. For people who want imagination and fun this movie is for you! A great movie to sit up and watch with the kids.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I got the Neptune a few weeks ago. I used the SwiMP3 before and I think the Neptune is even better. The sound underwater is a lot louder and very clear. The big plus for me is that I can hear people talking to me while having a break from swimming because the speakers are on the side of the ear.<br /><br />I had no problems copying all my music onto the Neptune. It works like a USB stick.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I understood the Crossfire novels to be a trilogy and was expecting this to be the final book.  However, I was annoyed at the plot twists that took away from Gideon and Eva's relationship.  The story is just being drawn out and who the heck wants to wait another 9 months for another book.  Only to then have to wait another year for the final book.  That's absurd and unfair to the readers that support Day's work.  Give us our happy ending in the 3 books that were promised and make your money writing another story line.  Will not buy another one of these books!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|came in on this series in the middle so it was great to be able to go back and see how it started.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really love this game. I am so glad I bought The Room. The puzzles are awesome. The hints are there if you need them but it's more thrilling to NOT use them. I love that I can play this offline. The game looks so AMAZING and the sound is helpful and not annoying. I have enjoyed several hours with this puzzling game. I'm anxiously waiting  The Next Room,
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good game with lots of the arctic ocean and relationship stability of the arctic ocean and I am looking for my next step
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie because they actually had a real conversation which was enlightening. They did not appear to me as though they were well suited to each other but were very caught up in the romance of their meetings.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My 5 year old great-grandaughter enjoyed while we where at Myrtle Beach. I have deleted from my kindle,not my kind of game!!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I really like Quentin T. movies, the gore and crazy violence reminds me a lot of Mad Max movies.  This one in particular was great, I really enjoyed how Jamie Foxx played his character and the story line wasn't as predictable like most of Quentin's movies.  The excessive use of the &#34;N&#34; word, was well.....excessive.  But it didn't take away from the movie or add to the movie either.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any Quentin T. fan, but just make sure your kids aren't around.  This movie is pretty graphic.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie is wonderful! The perfect mix of sports and drama! And great acting. I highly recommend it for both guys and chics. Good movie to watch together!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I was a little skeptical of getting an Alfred Hitchcock movie. I looked at previous ratings though and decided to try it.  This movie was recommended to us as a great &#34;family night&#34; movie to watch with our teens. The plot line was engaging and had unexpected twists that surprised us all.  There was some romance, but it was not overdone.  The violencewas a bit &#34;fake&#34; looking by todays standards, but i appreciated that.  Also, the drunkenness was treated sternly - the mother was exasperated by son's drunkenness and didnt believe his story since she implied that this was a common occurrence.  If I had one objection to the movie, it was the amount of smoking that went on, but that was a more common thing back when the movie was shot.  All in all, the whole family enjoyed the movie.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Late nights reading and a whole new world of not so stereotypical creatures has me starting the next book in the trilogy immediately!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|this game is worth the money,  engaging story moves well and graphics are awesome. cant wait for the next installment
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|Not a bad movie,it is geared more for kids. They could of done without the narrator,the special effects was very good.The story line did a good job of tying in how the wizard arrived in Oz.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was PhenomiNIALL. Its just breathtaking. Hazels and Augustus love story unravels beautifully in front of you. It will bring you tears and opens your eyes about the world.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|These movies are great! I have watched all of them. No problems. Would recommend them. Price was Ok. Could have been lower priced.
B004TI5N38|5.0|The story is what I expected and wanted to read on vacation -- big, brash, brave hero saves the world.. body count is high but not too gruesome.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Snug fit. Nice case.Worth giving up the color and design elements that cheaper cases offer (cheetah or zebra print cases didn't last very long).
B005LAIIPS|5.0|great addition to collection.what else can i say. nothing more to say have a nice day you can't count can you
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Funny, intelligent, real. Very good story and very relatable. Strong performances from all actors and just liked it enough that I didn't want the movie to end.
0425263924|2.0|I am very disappointed.  I had been waiting for this book just like the other reviewers.  The author could have at least tied up a couple of her twists and could have certainly been clearer on how she was going to proceed from here.  Up in the air to whether I will bother with the next two.  I have enjoyed the series so far till realizing that I was sold a half of a book which was billed as a complete package. Unlike a few of the other reviewers I did like all of her characters and would love to see them developed along with the main story or by themselves in other books later on.  Sylvia write a novel and don't get strung along by your publishers to release too soon if this happened.  Your fans will wait if you just let us know.  Looking forward to a better 4th. If I do bite on it and if it isn't any better than this one you won't see me reading anything of hers again. I have a feeling lots of other people feel the same and I would hate for a good author's career to come to s screeching halt...
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|Back in the day this was my kind of music it sure takes me back. I had good times with this band.
B0023FFRQW|3.0|In an attempt to re-read some of the classics, this was the first book our book club picked.  An interesting and fascinating story of the intertwined lives of the characters but written in a style that is very dated and goes into almost painful detail when it could have been said so much simpler.  Back in this time, books were serialized in magazines...and people had very little else for entertainment.  We moved on to Picture of Dorian Gray and Gatsby, both of which I much preferred as long as we're getting into the &#34;classics&#34;.
B005ARYDYC|5.0|Fantastic movie brings back a lot of memories. This was back in my day. If you like movies with dancing you'll like this.
B00AEUPOVQ|2.0|slow & dull .just could not get into it at all.  like many movies from England - not up to US style.
B00AEFXZ1C|5.0|If you like movies with dancing in it you would like this one. I remember this one when I was young, it brings back a lot of memories,
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Much has been said about the story and how well the documentary was made.  I would like to add another dimension.  The sound on the CDs are absolutely first rate.  There was a lot of care done in the recording of these songs way back that it is now possible to appreciate it on CD.  One must also appreciate the very effective accompanying music which must have been written by some other talented individual(s) that support Rodriguez's unique melodies/sound.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very unique and exciting plot with great characters. Best deal I ever got on Kindle. Can't wait for a sequel!
B003SI5NX0|5.0|What can I say other than that if you have a child who missed out on Oliver & Company, go ahead and get it!  This is a Disney classic, the story is rich, the characters very well written and depicted.  My son loved it!
B00C3JU7D6|4.0|I have only heard Fall Out Boys, Folie a Deux, and this new one, so not sure what the early FOB sounds like. I love the new FOB and have played FAD to death. I ordered both on Vinyl and the new Save Rock and Roll, come on a 8 inch record. smaller album. Sucks and the sound is really scratchy Just a heads up, if you buy the Vinyl you get a smaller size record.
0395925037|4.0|I read this book because I was noticing that while it's allowable to revise history in favor of Lenin, Mao, even Stalin and Pol Pot, you must never, ever, ever, stray from the party line concerning (dare I even say the name?) Hitler. Something fishy going on with all that. In reading this book I gained sympathy for the young man who saw the grinding poverty of workers in Austria and the callous disregard for them by their \\"betters.\\" How dare he dream of economic rights for workers when they can just beg for jobs or charity? Unfortunately, this same young man seems at other times to be foreshadowed by something disturbing, if not diabolical. Anyway, despite the ideological quarantine, I was able to procure the book and learn from it. The most incongruous element was the venomous Introduction (and back cover) by Abraham Foxman. How many books are introduced by someone who hates the author? This would seem to fuel, not dispel, any suspicion of undue influence by special interests within the publishing industry.
6304698798|1.0|How can you possibly not notice that the sound on this movie is horrible!<br />The sound \\"engineer\\" must have been drugged while transferring this movie, or is simply deaf. I had this movie in VHS and transferred it to DVD. It may not look as good, but you can actually understand speech and enjoy the whistling song and flying bullets.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I have never met a little girl who at least wanted to ride a pony. Ever since Inwas very little I've always wanted a horse of my own and I can at least have the virtual experiance of taking care and training of a horse. The other day when I was jumping my horse I pictured the bar they show you on the bottom of the screen when ever your jumping or training the horse, and we made the jump! A real excellent game.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Love stories can either end in death or estrangement. .I have read many a tale of love ending in a tragic death. I thought I will close the book as soon as I get a gist of the plot. After all , what new will this love story have?  So what kept me going till the last page were the characters Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. They have cancer and they are teen kids. But they have super cool personalities. Indeed they have this mature attitude towards life that it is hard to believe they are so young. But imminent death could do a lot to people. When you do not have ample time, you try to focus on the big picture. Hazel and Gus are in love inspite of the futility of their relationship. They think it is worthy. To quote from the book , some infinities are larger than others. A short time spent with someone special might feel like forever and infinite. I read some reviews that people cried a lot. I cried a little at the end but that's it. What I felt was sadness and wanted to get over the book as soon as possible. I did not want to be haunted. As long as the characters were with me , I neither loved them or despised them. I was just a silent observer. But as soon as I closed the book, I felt  a terrible loss. Though I wanted to move on to another book so that I can stop the haunting , I still cannot let go of the book until I went through all my notes and marks. I reread sections of the book and fell in love again and again.<br />&#34;I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly at first and then all at once&#34;<br /><br />A beautiful book in retrospection!
B00C3JU7D6|5.0|This CD has become my life! I listen to it while I am doing everything! It is hard to pick my favorite track, but if forced I would pick either Young Volcanoes or Save Rock and Roll. I am so glad Fall Out Boy is back!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not many shows these days are worth watching.  This show is well written and leaves me wanting to watch the next episode right away.  Highly recommend.
B0053TMP24|5.0|A great novel for young adult readers. I extremely recommend this book to anyone eager for a mythology adventure. Rick Riordan truly expresses another great book. For readers who enjoyed this book I recommend the rest of the series and the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.
140053271X|5.0|So this first bit is a general rant on e-ink readers. THEY ARE GREAT. Especially for the reader who doesn't really care to consume other media (tv, movie, internet, music) on a 7-inch tablet. I have an iPhone and a laptop, but do a superior job in their respective field. The 13-inch laptop screen is just better for watching things. If I can't pull out my laptop to watch something, I probably shouldn't be doing it anyways. The iPhone also has a great screen and great native video apps to manage that and internet on the go. I really just want a tablet TO READ.<br /><br />This is where I like the Nook. Disclaimer I have only owned a Nook Tablet 16 GB before and rooted it to allow full Google Play access. Even then I didn't like the battery restrictions and always wishing it was bigger or smaller depending on the area. The Simple Touch (ST) gives me the perfect format to read. Small design with excellent SIDE BUTTONS for quick flipping. Seriously I can read for 15 min and never move my hands. I can rest my fingers on the appropriate buttons and it feels natural, even with shorter fingers. The weight is phenomenal and doesn't cause any wrist fatigue.<br /><br />The e-ink screen display wonderfully and reacts to touch well. I didn't get the backlight version cause I had read about issues with screen cracks. I'm pretty rough on my hardware. Software works good and even manages to go through my medical review books easily and do keyword searches. TEXTBOOK USER beware though that charts and tables are at a fixed size and cannot be enlarged.<br /><br />Overall very happy and most of all I love not looking at a backlit screen for enjoyment. Seriously my eyes and brain are happier.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This is the best series on TV and it is extremely sad that the final season is coming this month. Dexter shows a compassionate side to his loved ones while still keeping his dark passenger hidden from them.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love Dr. Hosseini's first two books and was anxious to read his latest. His language, as always, is beautifully descriptive but I found this book more disjointed than the others. At times, I wasn't certain which character was being developed and the time spans between the chapters were such that it made for more difficult reading.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is the greatest TV show ever! This season has lots of twists and turns and keeps you on the edge at all times. Couldn't stop watching it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|what can i say. glad to have finally read it but sad hat have fo wait.  cant wait o see what happsns
B009KKLQVS|1.0|This recording has a major lip sync problem, particularly the first 4 or 5 songs. It suggests that much of the vocals have been rerecorded and then they do not match the lips of the singers. Therefore this recording, although good, may not be authentically \\"live\\".  Early on there a lot of long shots of the band which may have bee done to disguise this obvious lip sync issue.Very disappointing.
B00821OX98|5.0|Watched several episodes with my son and we both enjoyed them. We will probably finish season 1 over the weekend.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I never watched The Shield when it was live, however, at the recommendation of our son, my husband and I began to watch the series. This series is really GOOD! We both really enjoy watching The Shield.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander, a scientist, makes one question their beliefs.  I am an English teacher and this reminds me of Life of Pi and Martel's statements about the atheist, agnostic and believer.  Proof of Heaven is as Francis Adirabusamy, Life of Pi, states&#34; is a story that will make you believe in God&#34;.
B006DLP6JA|5.0|Very good under-rated processor. Works very well with ASRock A75M-ITX motherboard and Cooler Master Elite 120 Advanced case. Highly recommended processor.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Jolly good fun!  It's a guy's movie, but I love the way they kick butt, and get the job done.  A very nice male fantasy.
B00BHRCD14|5.0|I absolutely love volbeat. however I must not have read the description closely enough... For some reason I thought I was buying the full album on vinyl with the full album on disk with a bonus CD what I got was the full album on disk a bonus disk and a 7\\" vinyl and the book it comes with has like a couple photos but mostly it's a lyric book. I guess I was expecting more for the price, but I just can't say enough about the band that's why the 5 stars
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down, and it was a good read.  I was a little bit disappointed at the end, as I had hoped to find some greater insights revealed to me, but it did make me think, and I will read it again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great TV series!  I can't wait for the new season!  These British shows are amazing - they have the same set of actors which is really a positive!
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|gritty tale of a young girl trying to find her outlaw father so their house is not taken away due to a missed court appearance, good story and acting.....a bleak landscape of poverty and residents having to break the law to survive.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I would recommend Tangled to anyone that is enjoys animation. They are always fun to watch and enjoy with family.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Temple run oz is the best temple run yet it has great graphics a hot air balloon and you can go to different places such as the dark forest<br />Whimsy woods and winkie country I think it is amazing
B00957T6X6|5.0|I watched the series and started going through withdrawal in 1 day. so now I am reading the books. The  show follows the books very closely but gives you a lot more insight to what is really going on and why in the series.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Not many bands garner a reaction like Megadeth and their over the top front man Dave Mustaine does. One of the big four of the original thrash movement they have released some of the best records the genre has had to offer. On the flip side, they are one of the most inconsistent bands as well. Back with their latest record Super Collider, which is released on Dave Mustaine's very own label UMe.<br /><br />Super Collider has generated a ton of negative reactions from the press and the metal community. Once again Megadeth are traveling down a path that they have been many times, a record that is geared towards marketability and commercialism. They have done it brilliantly with Cryptic Writings and Youthanasia and also tragically horrible with Risk. The World Needs a Hero also follows a similar formula and it is incredibly average.<br /><br />That brings us to Super Collider and the fact people have been reacting like we haven't seen this side of Dave Mustaine before. It is a common path where he wants to spread his wings as a songwriter. They have released four records in a row that have been more aggressive but also remarkably average with a few moments of brilliance.<br /><br />Super Collider starts out with one of its best tracks with the up-tempo and high energy \\"Kingmaker.\\" Even though it owes a lot to Black Sabbath's \\"Children of the Grave\\" from its guitar riff and vocal melody, the track is memorable and is one of their best in a long time.<br /><br />Another standout is the Shane Drover and Chris Broderick co-written \\"Built for War.\\" It is another driving track that showcases some excellent riffs and intricate drumming and guitar playing. Megadeth hasn't been this good in a longtime.<br /><br />The catchy \\"Dance in the Rain\\" features a guest appearance from David Draiman of Disturbed and Device fame. This is clearly the best of the overly poppy material with an excellent closing riff that is classic Megadeth right off of Peace Sells.<br /><br />Super Collideralso features some cringe worthy and forgettable moments as well. The title track and \\"Burn!\\" are trying way to hard to be radio hits and fail miserably. The chorus in the former is downright horrible.<br /><br />\\"The Blackest Crow\\" finds the band incorporating banjos, fiddles and violins for a southern country flavor. Even though I applaud their attempt to try and create something that has never been part of a Megadeth record it is unfortunately filled with cliché's and has no place sporting the Megadeth moniker.<br /><br />The guitar playing of Dave Mustaine and Chris Broderick is once again some of the best metal has to offer. I think Broderick is setting himself up along with Marty Friedman and Chris Poland to be one of the best players in Megadeth's incredible history.<br /><br />The biggest improvement is with Dave's vocals. On recent Megadeth releases his voice has been horrible and distracting at times. Producer Johnny K has captured his voice perfectly (listen to the venom Dave performs with on the excellent cover of Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\") as this is the best Dave has sounded since Cryptic Writings.<br /><br />Is Super Collider going to light up the world or be mentioned in the same breath as some of their past releases that can be considered some of the best ever recorded? Of course not but it isn't the worst record released this year and not even close to being the worst record in the Megadeth catalog.<br /><br />This isn't a throwback to the thrash glory days of Megadeth and if that is what you are wanting than this isn't the release for you. Maybe not as strong as some of their past attempts at a more mainstream approach but far more enjoyable than some of their other endeavors. There are some gems on Super Collider and the musicianship is top notch and jaw dropping at times.<br /><br />- Originally published at About.com Heavy Metal
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I laughed out loud too many times to count and was brought to tears more than once, too. Cheryl has such a unique way with words - a natural talent for writing so eloquently. I got lost in this book and it was a true joy to do so. I highly, highly recommend it!
B003L77GGK|5.0|literally the product I received is perfect. The casing was completely undamaged and all the discs worked with no issues.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|i love the series  its just a zombie  soap opera.  great show  great  zombies  awaiting the zombie apocolypse  lol  lol
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It was a great game a lot of clues to find loved it but I wish that there were more crimes to solve then just one bc I purchased the game do wished it and don't want to solve the same mystery again
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like minecraft pocket edition, but I can't have railroad tracks, pistons, pressure plates, levers, minecarts, buttons, and redstone dust!<br /><br />PLEASE ADD THESE THINGS! please! EVERYBODY WANTS THESE THINGS!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I  really loved this book. It was so touching how a fifth grade boy was going to school for the first time and he had a deformed face.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Kendrick uses lyrics like a suburb novelist, weaving themes, imagery, characters, and plot lines in an effort to convey life in Compton. The jarring shifts, the pleasing, yet discordant production (ex: the final chord in the phrase in swimming pools), and the reoccurring skits all serve to paint a world through the telling of a much more focused story. Like any great piece of art, this album is better in totality.<br /><br />Listen to the whole thing. Multiple times.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|What more is there to say, keep singing Michael Buble!  I wait to get a chance to see him live!
B00CCXL9OE|1.0|Dont buy this Aladdin Blu Ray, it's fake! Disney hasn't even released this movie on blu ray!<br />If you are a fan of the Disney movies, keep checking on the Disney Movie Club for the new titles on blu ray, even for the old movies! For example, The Little Mermaid has been around on blu ray, but it's also a fake product, cause the movie on blu ray has been recently released and it's not even on sale yet!<br />Pay attention for those blu rays that has this same circle and triangle on the left bottom of the case, they are usually not original Disney blu ray product! The original ones has now a red star mark from the Disney Movie Club!
B006GLLREU|4.0|I just started watching this season but if it's as good as season 1, i'm sure I'll like it too.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This movie is touching and funny at times. I loved the story and the way they told it. It really depicts what life was like for blacks in the past and sadly some of that is still true today. Racism is on a decline but we still have some more to do and this movie really puts that into perspective
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVE it it is a really good book and I will totally read the next book and probably LOVE it
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love this movie and so does my daughter. She watches it all the time and I catch her talking in that accent every now and then too. Soo cute!
B008OOYALE|1.0|Can only get certain amount of dragons and I always get the same dragons over again. Books are better than this
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I love the raw emotion in this movie. The action is packed and the story line is spot on. In my opinion this is the best Planet of the Apes movie. I have watched this movie over and over and I will watch it again. I cannot say that about the others.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|\\"I had no defenses against him when he was touching me, helpless to resist the drugging pleasure of spreading my thighs for such a virile, passionate male\\"<br /><br />I have spent the last 2 months anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book. I was NOT disappointed! Eva and Gideon's story continues in this installment of the Crossfire novels. The sex is hotter, the plot thickens, and you are left gasping for air at the end. Just like a good orgasm. Eva and Gideon continue to be on my list of favorite book couples and I will be reading the next 2 novels to follow their story! 4 out of 5! {babusbookshelf.blogspot.com}
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I liked this movies. The plot was decent the guys were hot and the girl was pretty. The action was ok but I felt like it was lacking something somewhere. I thinks its worth four stars,
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Game freezes a lot. Otherwise a below standard Diablo like dungeon crawlers. Uninteresting story and lack of buildable sets put it further behind the times.
0399226907|5.0|I bought this book for our toddler granddaughter.  She's a little young, at 18 months, to sit still to enjoy the story but I know that before long she will enjoy it as much as her daddy did when he was a little boy.
0547564651|4.0|This book brings to the reader's attention  that torture by the United States does exist.  The U.S. is involved in torture which is very sad.<br />Ms. Cohn's book is excellently documented with detailed notes at the end of each chapter.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Rod Stewart is so good at singing the Great American Songbook. He had my 88 year old mother-in-law singing along with him. She was so tickled to hear old songs being sung again. We had an enjoyable car trip with Rod!
B000BISBDY|4.0|This is a good overall collection, not comprehensive but containing most of Johnny Cash's hits and some of his lesser-known work. A budget CD that is well worth the purchase.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|I admire Rod's long career. I am in awe of his talent. You need this wonderful music in your collection.
B0053O89KG|5.0|What a magnificent show! I am a raving fan ... the chemistry between Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion is so incredible that I am almost convinced that they are lovers in real life, and the rest of the cast, from Molly Quinn to Seamus Dever, are so well suited to their roles that this is possibly my favorite show of all time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Riveting I could not put it down.  I saw the movie first, and wanted to read the books before the next movie came out because you always get more detail and more background story.  Even though it,s fiction it,s disturbing how realistic it is.  It,s not a Cinderella story by any means.  Characters that you hope make it to the end and live happily ever after Don't and the nasty politics of war and human greed  are all interwoven beautifully.  It's sad that we can't live in a fairy tale world, but it's something that people young and old need to learn, and the these books teach the horrors of war, politics, human nature good and bad, and the human spirit that drives so many of us to keep striving for a better world.  I think  the authors has a very good grip on humanity and how we work.  Excellent.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway surfer for a game to play when I'm board. It has decent graphics and has a lot of power ups and upgrades.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I enjoyed  this book as much as I loved his previous two novels.  This author has such a beautiful way of describing things and at times his writing is like reading poetry.  His characters have so much life and his stories are unusual, interesting and thought provoking.  Love it!
B00633W614|5.0|I loved it and can't wait to read the third in the series. Jeffrey Archer top notched writer as far as I'm concerned....
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I originaly got the free version but I loved it sooooo much I got the full one please get this it is worth every penny if you are sceptical then get the free one but get it pleeeeease
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love the music from this play, and actually enjoyed watching it on my laptop with headphones to really hear the music!
6301976258|4.0|This is another movie that is often available on cable TV around Memorial Day. I watch it about once a year.<br /><br />Parts of it seem a little quaint these days, but the craftsmanship of the production and the star quality of Gary Cooper make it worthwhile to me.<br /><br />Like many war movies of the era, it takes a very one sided view of war and portrays it in a highly sanitized fashion. One cannot have teenagers who are going off to war realizing they might get maimed or killed. In many ways it could well be considered as pro-war propaganda, and that would not be unfair.<br /><br />How true it is to the real story of Alvin York is hard for me to say. I suspect as virtually all movies do that it diverges considerably from the truth to make for a better movie.<br /><br />The battle scenes are limited but pretty well done for the time period the movie was made in. Most of the movie explores his life prior to entering the US Army and what happens after the event he was awarded the medal of honor for.<br /><br />It is a classic of its time and worth watching just for that aspect alone.<br /><br />Walter Brennan does a fine job in a supporting role as a hill preacher/storekeeper.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of showing just how isolated from the rest of US society some parts of Appalachia were back then, and the poverty that was endemic there.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Truly touching book about lose, healing and self actualization.  I think we could all benefit from a self discovery walk along the Pacific Crest Trail.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a great read, and the most exciting is that you can read it for free. I was happy I had this too, when I was traveling on vacation. Helped the time go  by quickly.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is on of a kind, breed and takecare of dragons, try to get. rare or legendary dragons, use your income from the dragond to buy more land and decorations.  ( the only reason I put ★★★★ instead of 5 is because it took almost half of my kindle data space)  I do recommend this game for those who need a great game for time consumption and overall an amazing time.
B000UVT3OI|3.0|I thought I liked Garth Brooks more than I do.....there are only a few songs on this very long CD/DVD that I actually like.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|This season's shows just kept building on the fantastic foundation of the previous two.  Every single episode was compelling.  The only thing that was disappointing was the final show, and its cliffhanger, game-changer sort of ending.  Immediately, my wife and I had an unpleasant reaction to it.  But you better believe that we're moving ahead to the next season of shows!  Maybe you'll appreciate the ending more than we did.  And maybe we'll appreciate it more, after we see what becomes of it in Season 4.  Regardless, each individual episode is excellent.  And the principal characters are ever more and more intriguing.  Get watching!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|This Headphone(s?)  can reproduce quite vivid, dynamic & sensitive sometimes sound of esp. pop music, rock 'n roll, country music, rhysm & blues etc. The only weak-point is that it's rather too heavy for my ears & head, I regret .....
030758836X|2.0|It took me about 50 or more pages to get into this book but once the plot started to unfold I couldn't, at times, put it down. However, overall, I was disappointed, especially with the ending.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I encountered this album, or one of the songs in this album to be exact, when I was watching cable TV music program in my hotel room in London : that was \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" .... And later I bought this album. After listening to all songs, I could not help nodding deeply! I've \\"NEVER\\" \\"EVER\\" heard such sophisticated songs as these!!! I was, & am still, a GREAT FANATIC of Japanese \\"AKB48\\", \\"Ayaka\\", \\"Perfume\\", \\"miwa\\", \\"Ikimono-gakari\\", \\"Kuraki Mai\\", \\"Hamasaki Ayumi\\", \\"EXILE\\" etc. and of \\"Shojo-jidai\\", \\"KARA\\" (K-pop) etc. and of \\"Pat Benator\\", \\"Exposé\\", \\"Kylie Minogue\\", \\"Madonna\\", \\"Lady GAGA\\", \\"TOTO\\", \\"Queen\\", \\"Cheap Trick\\", \\"Pet Shop Boys\\", \\"U2\\", \\"Guns & Roses\\", \\"Michel Jackson\\", \\"Bon Jovi\\", \\"John Denver\\", \\"The Beatles\\" of course, etc. But this \\"RED\\" as well as Avril Lavigne's latest album \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" is incomparable to the songs of those above-mentioned  classic singers as for me. These 2 ladies are fabulous, indeed !!!
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Great story for Spanish upper levels! I enjoyed the story line and the Spain accent! The kids enjoyed it as well.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|Re-invigorating metal is what these guys do. And they do it well.  The fact that after two decades these boys are still putting out new music, and that it just keeps getting better, is both scary and @#**-ing awesome!  Every song is packed with fist-pounding Germanic energy, anthemic hooks, and sweeping melodic arrangements, all crafted with true artistry to boot.<br /><br />Critics of the genre would do well not to lump Rammstein in with the dinosaur rock of the '90's.  These guys are fresh, inventive and contemporary.  Their CD's are still hits and their concerts still sell out.  There's a reason for that, and it's all right here on \\"Liebe\\".  Going sometimes years between releases, like true artists, Rammstein wait until they have great new material before releasing a follow-up CD.  It's always worth the wait.  Buy this CD!!
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Great documentary about sushi, Japanese culture, and most importantly the search for perfection.  Don't watch this on an empty tummy.
B00ABA1OP4|5.0|This Blu-ray set is a great way to relive all your favorites, and see some fantastic new stuff too.  Til and the boys prove once again why they've had the staying power to outlive so many of their peers.  Still touring AND putting out new material throughout a career that has spanned two decades of awesome, face-melting rock.  Who cares if you don't speak German...  their power and artistry translate and transcend.<br /><br />You will dig this video collection.<br /><br />Period.
B003U53GK8|5.0|One of the all time great series. Classic conflict between good and evil. It was good to watch it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very interesting with lots of details. The plot is continous.  The ending is a total surprise.  John Grisham does it again.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use this app every day to wake up for work and remind me to take my daily heart medication. It works very well.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|My husband and I were at a dinner party a few weeks ago, GoT was all anyone was talking about.  So we decided to see for ourselves what all this hype was about.  Even though the genre was was new to us, we quickly discovered that we had joined the fan club.  We watched all three seasons in two weeks.  Highly recommend, even for non- fantasy/historical period lovers.  Great writing, great acting, and a lot of action.
B00263HWM8|2.0|So cheesy, the plot line and the acting were mediocre. I actually didn't finish it, becuase it was so bad and kind of predictable. Luckily the movie started to buffer so I was able to stop it while I had an excuse.
B003O86FMW|2.0|This is to join the ranks of Book of Secrets, Palace of Stone, and Sea of Monsters in the list of not so good sequels to the awesome debuts of The Hunger Games, National Treasure, Princess Academy, and The Lightning Thief.<br />3 sad signs of a problematic storyline:<br />They drink 3 cups of tea in the first 2 chapters (are Panemites originally English?)<br />They decide to pull an Arthurian style romance, meaning the love triangle that makes or breaks the Kingdom<br />They are so short on storyline they decide to stick Katniss and Peeta back in the Arena!
B003I55BIA|5.0|I'm still in awe......any wait to read the others. As a romantic I highly recommend this (and the other) book(s)
1401937519|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying Anita's Book.  It gives me a perspective that I never thought possible.  It is very healing, especially after losing a loved one.  I relate to Anita and her feelings.  She explains some very complicated things in a very uncomplicated way.  Bless you, Anita.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|This is just exceptional. Whether she's doing her own songs or the old standards, she's top shelf. This quickly became one of my all time favorite Christmas albums.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I have to say, most of the songs are great and the ones that aren't my favorite are my mom's favorite so it all works out in the end.
B00337KM2S|5.0|This is George Clooney at his best with a very good supporting cast. The premise of the movie was original, the writing is sharp, and the movie escapes becoming predictable. I thought is might have been the year's best movie.
B0012239EE|4.0|I bought this album to replace the CD I lost but it didn't have the title track...which is my favorite song eva. Still, most of the songs are awesome!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I have to say that this wasn't a real Die Hard franchise movie. In my opinion, more like a payday for Bruce and a showcase for a Russian actor hoping to be discovered. Certainly not a Bruce Willis Die Hard movie. So, the title is misleading. Bruce clearly and visibly does not steal the show, in fact, he even positions himself so that he is never really center stage. Doesn't act with enthusiasm but performs workman like. He is trademark Bruce Willis; even though very much toned down and left center stage. The story is forgettable. The center piece happens at the beginning of the movie--a long multi-car wrecking chase that wrecks more vehicles than The Blues Brothers movie, maybe, certainly tries to.
B00785P2QC|1.0|Just all around a bad game.stupid. a joke of a game. Boring. Not wat i expected. Blows.<br />Nhfhgghcghvgngjbhf ft h y h
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun to play!! The only thing that I don't like is how the game sometimes becomes slow or the runner slows down.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|ok we have yet to stump this guy, and my son thinks of some really odd people! he has guessed John Deere, the Pirate Captian from that movie, even people from Minecraft! Lots of fun, and its neat you can customize pictures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the a really good game.though ,I would have loved to know at the begging that the places changed .it's really really good though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read constantly, very rarely sci-fi, but this saga has really caught my interest. Well done. Looking forward to the next!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, a story of many people, many places and many times. The various threads knit together extremely well, this book didn't just happen, it was well laid out from the beginning.<br /><br />I recommend this on as a must read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As an engineer, I am science driven and fact based and this book has helped me put together my vision, beliefs in my &#34;higher power&#34;.  I think Dr. Alexander is a brave soul to have written this book and agree that part of the goal of his journey here was to share his story to those of us that have gone to church forever, but hadn't personalized our connection to the Universe.  Thank you.  I truly am thankful that he took he time to go into the science behind his condition and flat out humble himself to admit he was close minded by science.<br />Sincere thank you to the author; don't stop sharing your story - you're helping others.
B00821OX98|4.0|Many have tried to make a run at the alien invasion series, with most falling flat after one season or even before a full season.  So I'm pleased to see Falling Skies doing so well.  And it deserves it's success, at least as far as I can tell halfway through season one.  A great ensemble cast, believable characters, believable aliens, and a good mix of action, suspense, and human drama.  Can't wait to watch the rest.  Noah Wylie is great, although I will always see him as the young doc from ER. :)
B005NGKMOU|4.0|There have been many that have claimed that Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid did not die in the famous shoot out in Bolivia. This is one of the stories of what might have been. It stars Sam Shepard (`Black Hawk Down') as the ageing Cassidy, he has retired in the backwoods of Bolivia to raise horses and marry himself one of the locals.<br /><br />Then he decides to take one last trip home to see his only known relative that could have also been his child. He takes all his money out of the bank and heads off north. Then events conspire against him and he loses both horse and money. He is then forced to team up with runaway robber and Spanish gentleman - Eduardo Apodaca. The two of them then attract the unwanted attention of the people who have been robbed and the law alike. One of the Pinkerton men is played by Stephen Rea who as ever, is brilliant value for money and very good at scene stealing. That is quite something considering the performance from Sam Shepard who does straight and comedic both expertly. Some of the story is told in flash back to road sign how he got to where he is now.<br /><br />This is also shot beautifully with both nasty and comic asides to keep the whole thing balanced. Not a single bad performance either make this both entertaining and a real visual treat. There is a fair bit of Spanish spoken too and my DVD did not automatically translate, so I had to activate manually, so please note if the same thing happens to you.<br /><br />The plot may seem a bit far fetched, but it is done so well that it actually works. If you are a fan of old fashioned westerns that benefit from the modern touches that make films better, i.e. not CGI, then this is a film you will want to see.
B008220BLG|5.0|The headline says it all.  Add humor, and you have it all!  This movie is a new twist on what is becoming a tired genre (zombie films).  Don't get me wrong, I love zombie movies, but how many different ways can you tell the story?  Here is a different way.  It is fun, funny, and actually has a good message (bonus).  I think you'll enjoy this one!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. I finished it days ago and am still thinking about it.  I long for a sequel.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is just a fun romp of a movie, with so many of our favorite super heroes in one place.  As with all Marvel movies, stick around until the end of ALL the credits!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Though highly improbably, the reader is drawn into a story that incorporates fantasy with a look at historical events that spans decades.  The characters are just that...characters.  Engaging and interesting.
B003UYV08E|5.0|This movie is a must see for fans of the Iron Man franchise.  It is not as good as Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 3 (in my opinion), but is still a fun ride, and is important for an understanding of the progression in Tony Stark's journey.
B00C8985DU|5.0|If you are interested in owning only the music (which is FANTASTIC on its own!), buying the standard or 3-CD is probably the way to go. But, if you are a Forever PAUL fan who loves photos and everything that has to do with PAUL, this deluxe set is truly deluxe and a treasure! The contents are absolutely superb at recreating the sights, sounds, and experience of that monumental Wings tour.<br /><br />If I had my personal choice, I would have made the Humphrey Ocean book of drawings slimmer and made LINDA's book of photos thicker with more photos. But, that does not deter from this first-rate, lovingly-put-together, deluxe souvenir of one of the greatest live shows ever from my VERY FAVORITE Performer! I love this box set!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a fun take on the Star Trek journey.  Purists may take umbrage with some of the ideas posited, but some (like me) enjoyed some of the new &#34;takes&#34; on the original ideas.  It is an alternate reality, after all!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book as well as the first two.  I was not expecting that kind of ending especially when it was not mentioned when the next book will be out!
B001KZG99A|5.0|...of the Avengers group of movies.  Tony Stark is a fun character, and this movie tells his story from the start.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good app. No errors occurred while playing . It is fun. I wish there were more levels, hopefully there will be more with the updates.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Based loosely on the Grimm Brothers fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel it follows a similar vain to previous movies in the fantasy genre.  Special clothing and weapons uncommon to that time period make them more dashing, but they aren't so different from what we have seen in other movies.  We first see Hansel and Gretel kill an evil witch after their parents sent them into the woods.  Then a collage of posters and news sheets show us what happened as they grow up.  As adults they save a white magic witch from the Sheriff.  Next they prepare to go after a meeting of the witches for the orange moon.  Meanwhile when they both get separated in the woods, the Sheriff and his men make the mistake of hurting Gretel while a troll is watching.  We learn Gretel's secret as to why the troll goes after the Sheriff and his men.  The sets and costumes are well done and the acting isn't bad, nor even the music although a bit grating at the end.  Somehow it doesn't quite have the pinnache of the Grimm Brothers or Van Helsing.  Nothing seemed new or different about it so I felt I was just along for the ride.  Certainly worth a rental, but I can't recommend a purchase unless you are a huge fan of one of the actors and fantasy.  I purchased the Blu-ray and the video and sound quality are excellent.  It includes extras along with a digital copy.  Rated R mainly because of the gore, colorful language, and some nudity but I would say it's more of 14+ movie not an R based on what is out there already.<br /><br />Recommendations:  [[ASIN:B006R6ZP6U The Brothers Grimm]], [[ASIN:B001JIHGO0 Van Helsing]], and [[ASIN:B000LGOPW2 Sleepy Hollow]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The writing is witty and clever w/o getting too cutesy.  I watch this series several times per year.  It never gets old!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Although beautifully filmed and starring a brilliant cast, the plot and storyline (or lack thereof) left much to be desired. It was too disjointed to get to know any of the characters, let alone develop an empathy with them. There didn't appear to be much of a point to the story. I have not read the book, but know several people that have. They highly recommend the book over the movie.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I love this game and how you can replay the levels with more carts!!  I love all the cute animals!!!
1476733953|2.0|Wool is about as middle-of-the-road as it comes. Howey is an ok writer; not good, not great, but there are certainly worse out there. The world of the Silo is somewhat compelling, but seems incomplete and fairly limited. What Howey does well here is keep the chapters short and the plot, for the most part, moving forward.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as the narrative grows in sophistication, borrowing from George Martin and ricocheting us between multiple 3rd-person narrative perspectives, the story becomes bogged down in unnecessary exposition and action. A large portion of the final book, for example, is consumed with one of the main characters attempting to reconnect large sump pumps in order to drain 5 flooded levels of the underground silo. Her underwater adventure is recounted in excruciating detail. However, this action ultimately has no bearing whatsoever on this novel; they never even turn the pumps on after she has reconnected them. Huh?<br /><br />If I could give half-stars, this would rate a 2.5. Probably worth the read if you like this sort of stuff, but not groundbreaking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is as addicting as any game I have played. I also like that it is a game the whole family can play.
B009EDZB6C|5.0|The story was fantastic. Add a little comedy and drama to the mix and you've got an excellent movie.<br /><br />I've always like flying; I've always like history; I've always like war stories. What a perfect combination! Dive up into the air and learn about the Tuskegee Airmen and there struggle to fight during WWII.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie to anyone interesting in flying or WWII.
B002AKPECW|5.0|Lots of puzzling pieces laid out through the book make a marvellous sense at the end. And the setting is bold, invented by an author that doesn't feel challenged by the task of imagining what we will have millions of years in the future.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|This movie definitely kept me interested throughout the duration. High action and a great story earned itself 5 stars.<br /><br />There were a few scenes that would make young children and teenagers cringe; add the swearing and you've got a more &#34;mature&#34; movie.<br /><br />Grab your popcorn and get ready for a worthwhile 2+ hours.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This is an easy read and keeps your interest.  This includes all of the Boone series.<br />Pre-teens who are interested in genre will enjoy this series.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have been waiting on this book for MONTHS. And what am I rewarded with for my dutiful patronage to Sylvia Day? Nada.<br /><br />This could be a wonderful series, but not with installments like Entwined. There is no resolution whatsoever. The pages might as well have been blank. I'd have the same questions I do now.<br /><br />Well.. What happened?<br /><br />How can a review even contain spoilers when there's nothing in the book to spoil?<br /><br />Sylvia Day is a terrific writer. I've read several of her books without complaint. But this? It's like a teaser. A really long teaser. Clearly deadline driven (a deadline that was prolonged numerous times). Who let her do this? Who's in charge?<br /><br />I want answers!<br /><br />Why did I wait for this book? Why should I eagerly anticipate another? I can't. I won't set myself up for this disappointment again.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Dexter is truly one of the most creative shows in a long time.  Michael C Hall does his character so well, so believable, even though the show is beyond reality.  Great suspense, drama and fun.  Season 7 brings a whole new experience to the show and does not disappoint fans.  Definitely recommended to watch for people that like something different.
B00C1N9JWO|3.0|Took a bit to get into then it was over to soon!  Very much a book to re-read over and over.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is a great follower to Casino Royale and Quantum Solace.  I personally like Casino Royale the best, but this is a great movie.  Daniel Craig  is a perfect Bond, and the action scenes in these movies are always well done.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|This is by far one of their best albums. I loved it the first time I listened to it. I almost missed out and I am glad I didn't. How do you get better as time goes on, I don't know but Garbage does it, completely reestablishing themselves. I hope they are around for a long time.<br /><br />This album is not to serious, it's just fun and terribly easy to listen to. The lyrical comment is sick, for lyric whores like myself. Not to mention the sound. Listen to I hate Love (my fave track), beautiful freak, Felt...listen to every song it's all good.<br /><br />Thank you Garbage for this, you have renewed my faith in just buying your albums without even hearing one track. In a time when everyone is lazy and doing everything half assed, good job!<br />Here's to twenty more years!
B0095P31L6|2.0|It was free so why not try it. I generally watch all of a movie but this one just did not keep my interest. Perhaps it got better as it went along...
B00BB22GQM|4.0|Okay let's start by saying yes they did go way left field with this album, way! Way! WAY! I was so excited about this album for months when it was suppose to come out in March some time and was I understand now why it was pushed back, and pushed back, and pushed back again.<br /><br />I was so ready to tear them apart, and that would really hurt because they are one of my favorite bands. I had to listen to this album again and again; I even had to listen to some old music by them before I could write this. I had to keep in mind the whole time advice a friend gave me, \\"...Bands should be allowed to experiment, try different artistic styles, grow...you know evolve.\\" And despite her stupid advice, that is true and I have been using that when my bands decide to go left field and it has worked everytime. With that said I like the album.<br /><br />I was going to say to look at this as a different band and separate it from Vampire Weekend, but I have since disregarded that completely. This album is Vampire Weekend, and I actually feel this is Vampire Weekend at its core (I.E: Vampire Weekend is the name). This is the more dark, spiritual, more serious tone while we are use to getting the light, fun, airy side of the band. If we actually look inside of ourselves, we always knew this was coming and I think the band finally thought it was time and that we could handle it. From the brilliant response I think that's the case, although some people don't get it that is understandable I was like a lot of them at first.<br /><br />I do feel this album is different but good and if you open your mind you can really get down with it. Listen to \\"Obvious Bicycle, Step, Finger Back, Ya Hey,\\" they are amazing and Vampire Weekend are still in there. I feel this is more New York inspired, as it was named, and the album cover shows and gives us a little more of their New York City music roots then the more up-tempo wordiness of the band and the music. Like they said in Unbelievers, \\"I'm notexcited, But should I be, Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?\\" Kind of appropriate here, don't you think?<br /><br />I am sure the band felt a lot of pressure and they should be allowed to try new things and evolve. We get stuck in our own selfish wants we forget that they are their own people and we don't own the music, the music owns us. We are blessed to live in a time where our favorite band is alive and together and just so happens to be putting out music while we are alive to enjoy it. This is the music of our time and we are watching it evolve and grow itself. We should just be lucky about that part and stop trying to make the world what we want to be, how successful is that ever, really!?<br /><br />So I for one am anxious to see what one of my favorite bands goes from here and this seems like a good start. I couldn't give it five stars because it's a lot left field, but good. I love Contra even better and so glad that came before!!!! But it's good!
B005U9RXWE|1.0|I was billed twice for this movie. Watched part of it one day then the next day went to view and it charged me again
B0008ENIAC|5.0|The performances are superb, the storyline captivating.<br />It also provides a glimpse into the time period with the cars, smoking, and style of the WW2 era.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|I love this movie. I remember going to the movie to see this when it first came out. This movie is mind blowing, and will have you looking at things in a different perspective.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|From the first to the last song is top notch! Scotty is amazing... I cannot pick one favorite, every song is great.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The author knows a lot about our justice system, no doubt about that. So, he concocted a story reflecting our current digital world with a good accuracy.<br /><br />To the end of the book I just wondered what the last pages would reveal. I will not reveal anything here - just read the book.<br /><br />All I can say I really did not like ANYONE in the book, all predictable stereotypes. Especially the wife who appears to be the ultimate righteous one. I would hate to be around a woman like this even for a second.<br /><br />So, only two stars for keen observations of reality. Nothing, however, for the story itself. People may behave like the characters there but that does not make any of them creatures I can like or identify with.<br /><br />In any case, with almost 3,000 reviews of the book this one is quite redundant. I'll try to post it anyway.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I love how the cameras will not fall off and it feels just great walking around now with two camera and not have to worry they bump into each other
B008Q08EV8|3.0|It's an OK movie - very predictable. Lots of action. Lost of running. No real character build up. Ok to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would say this book was AMAZING!!! I loved how detailed it was! The book was also nice and easy for me to read!<br />It was the best book I had ever read!!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed it and didn't want to put down. A lot of twists and turns and the ending was GREAT.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed the book and found the questions at the end of the book very interesting. A worthwhile read for sure.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game IS fun, and a little addicting! But it also doesn't have a lot of variety, you have to keep doing the same things over and over, besides that it's great!!
1469220725|1.0|There was so much left unsaid in the last book and this addressed absolutely nothing. Reilly disappointing . Why would she write this.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I love the Star Wars series and when I saw these online for a discount, so I got them! Really really cool
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written and so full of surprises. It transports you to SF and into the life of a very unusual character. Plus it immerses you in  a netherworld of the beauty and meaning of flowers and how they can both soothe and inflame the soul.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Was not sure what I was getting and what kind of movie it would be, but surprisingly it was a great movie with a lot of underlying themes that made it entertaining.  The movies moves quickly between several different stories and may be difficult for some people to follow.  You must watch this movie and pay attention.  I enjoyed it immensely!
B0011E9LBI|4.0|A classic comedy.  Well worth watching.  Good all around acting and an entertaining ride.  Tommy Lee Jones is really hilarious.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is great it gives you a lot of energy and I was very pleased with that. You level up fairly easily. The game has nice graphics. I give it 4 stars and 2 thumbs up.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever!!!!!! It lets you buy your own horses,clean them,feed them, take care and much much more!!!!&amp;
B0013F1D02|4.0|A very entertaining movie.  Funny and heartwarming, it is well worth a viewing.  If you enjoy fantasy films, this is a good one.
B0031R5K68|5.0|The thing about Dan Brown is that he inspires you to read more about history and the truth behind the fiction. Excellent holiday read.
B007HJ9LXE|4.0|This is a very strange, but good movie.  If you like the artwork of Frida, then it is well worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first played this game on my friends kindle fire and was immediately addicted. this game is so much fun to play.I love it. It's a challenging game and is very exciting.would recommend it to anyone, even adults.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Got hooked on this from the minute I started playing it.just wish it didnt take so long for some of the dinosaurs to hatch.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really like the crossfire series such drama and so many relationships left and right. The doctors in one family yike heaven help them. At some point Gidion and Eva need to catch a Brake.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I am admittedly late to the party but Matt Smith is the best Doctor ever and season 6 is a fantastic romp. Love it so much.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I am impressed by how Tessla have continued through all hardship to maintain his only belief in sharing free electricity, I can only imagine a portion when he has hit the rock bottom for his intention of helping the world. He was encountered countless times with other financial investors then have his ideas dismissed and but that does not deflate his desire to make his dream of electricity to be shared among us.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I was skeptical when I first heard of the movie BUT I decided to give it a try and was on the edge of my seat the whole time. One crazy scene after another and the ending... WOW!  I highly recommend this movie and I not the greatest zombie movie fan around.  It is really worth watching. We are planning on adding this to our collection of movies!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Best show ever. Prepare to lose your life to the pattern. Great filmography, great acting. Feels like a long movie
B00AZF13KG|4.0|It seems like there are hundreds of 10 year reunion movies and to one degree or another, they all pretty much follow the same story line.  The jock, the homecoming queen, the funny guy, the sweet girl all having gone their separate ways, return to reunite like they were still 18 again.  Frankly there's not much different here.<br /><br />But...  Looking back some 17 years now check out the cast.  Matt Dillon, Noah Emmerich, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Max Perlich, Martha Plimpton, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, Uma Thurman, David Arquett, Sam Robards and the remarkable Natalie Portman.  Why does Portman stand out?  While everyone else is just short of 30, Portman's character, Marty, is only 13 and lives next door to the Conway home.  Willie Conway (Hutton) has returned home to this New England small town, after years in the city (Boston? New York?) playing piano in small clubs.  Disillusioned, he's thinking of changing careers.  He's also not sure where his relationship with Tracy (Annabeth Gish) is going.<br /><br />He strikes up a casual conversation with Marty and finds her engaging, smart and quick witted.  As Marty says of herself, \\"I'm an old soul.\\"  Marty develops a crush on Willie.  Willie sees the characteristics in Marty that he wishes Tracy had.  Before this sounds like it is going into the icky stage, it doesn't.  But that doesn't mean Marty and Willie aren't marking their calendars ahead, 5 years as far as Marty is concerned, 10 for Willie.  Their byplay is what makes the film special and Portman is amazing in what was her 3rd film after \\"Leon: The Professional\\" and \\"Heat.\\"<br /><br />Another excellent performance comes from Dillon as Tommy who is currently playing house with Sharon (Sorvino) but also getting it on the side from the married beauty (Holly).  Also watch for Rosie O'Donnell as Gina, who has a memorable rant about skinny fashion models, especially those that adorn the room of Paul (Rapaport).  Director Ted Demme must have felt like he was wrangling cats with this ensemble, but it all works.<br /><br />Don't expect much on this Blu ray version.  It comes in 1080p and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While it is certainly watchable it is flat and lifeless.  I noticed several darker scenes with background noise.  The audio track is DTS HD-Master Audio 2.0 and it is OK but again nothing special.  The extras are pretty lame.  A 27 minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" and 3+ minute piece of what the cast sees as \\"True Beauty.\\"  Yawn.e felt like he was wrangling cats with this ensemble, but it all works.<br /><br />Don't expect much on this Blu ray version.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best book of the series so far. It really sucks you in and it has the same George R.R. Martin easy to read style that the previous four books had. I really recommend it, and can't wait for the 6th installment of the series to be published!
0553801473|5.0|I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone looking to buy items that are in amazing quality. You get what you're looking for, and there's nothing else to really say about that. Book came in a timely manner, and amazing, also the day after the S3 finale of GoT premiered. I'm not entirely sure if this was intentional, but it made for a pretty exciting coincidence!
B0089XH38M|5.0|I've finally found a mobile security app. That does what it says. Simple<br />Yet it works. Keep up the good work.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good and unpredictable storyline.  Enjoyed it much.  Characters were believable and entertaining. Fast paces reading, could not put it down.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|Unconvincing and simple.  Dog character tells story and dumps author's preferences of tv shows into reader's lap. Others will like it, but it was a waste of my time on this earth.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I don't usually write reviews but I was so disappointed with this book.  Why must Mr Sparks give us such twisted endings?  I felt like the book should have ended much sooner.  Also the characters didn't seem authentic to me.  Dawson is just simply too good and too much of a martyr.  Amanda seems pathetic allowing her mother and others to dictate her life's choices.  The further I read in this book, the more I disliked Amanda.<br /><br />What a hot mess!
B00ANYJ3NI|4.0|Recommended by my boss and was a good read...got hooked on it the first day I picked it up. Of-course you need to actually care about who and how many people actually benefited from the housing crisis. I wish I knew that guy and also wished I had couple million bucks so he could make me a couple million more.<br /><br />The rich get richer....that's how the saying goes and it is well justified. But good book! lol
B004KPQK2S|2.0|Did not like this movie. I was expecting something similar to Seabiscuit but better since Secretariat is one of the most amazing horses to ever walk the earth and it fell short. John Malkovich was kind of an unconvincing trainer, although he wore some sweet fedoras and sport coats in the movie. The plot itself was not very captivating and the drama to the story line was glaringly manufactured. It was a rather poor produced movie and I prefer Seabiscuit much more than this one. Which is unfortunate, because Secretariat was a tremendous horse/athlete and his owner Penny Chenery was a great and strong woman, especially for that era. Overall, it just seemed to be a manufactured feel-good story as opposed to the genuine great story it actually is.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I like the movie. It runs fast and you fell involved in the discussion like being there with them. and it looks so real and natural. I will not spoil the plot. But it is like 2 real people reconnecting after a long time. You start with the best of your life and superficial till you get deeper and deeper. Somebody in a review with few stars wrote that it is anti-american because of a talks about guns made by Celine at the beginning. Sorry. I confirm that situation. I am in the USA since 2004, from Italy. The first thing my  neighbor in Bethesda told me to do was to buy not 1 but 2 guns for self-defense. And also about the police talk and bureaucracy I confirm as well. Given that the movie overall is a so good that you can see it more than once and not get tired of it.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|It was a purchase as a gift and my husband really liked it and uses it all the time everywhere he goes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the creativity put into this game! It was<br />easy to play, but delightfully challenging! I would definitely enjoy to play more levels!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay I had planned on buying this one in paperback to complete my set until I found out this wasn't the end...Glad I bought it for my Kindle because I hated how this book played out and how it ended and would probably have thrown it away. The four star review is because while it may piss me off how the story develops and ends, it's still a good story and it's well written. Gideon and Ava are my favorite. Now, while I'm so looking forward to what happens next, I'm torn because I'm disappointed in the fact that this didn't feel like a complete book.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Many guitar styles combined and just overall the Satriani we all enjoy!  A must have for your collection.  Get it today!
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|For: I wanted to see this one for a long time. Also, the little yellow guys were hysterical in their slavish devotion to being minions without losing their individuality.<br /><br />Against: It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. Kinda sad, what with the little girl orphans having to live in that horrible orphanage and Mr. Despicable being constantly slapped down by Mom. Despite the orphanage sadness, I think the girls were too annoying for me to care enough about them. This really impacted my interest in later events.<br /><br />&#34;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&#34; is a much better version of this story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this rating because I love the book and it was amazing!!!<br />I will always love this book. Thanks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the card game. But it isn't as good as I thought it would be. I'll keep it but only play it occasionally.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I really wish I didn't have to pay to finish the game. I understand it's how they make their money, but it'd be better if you had to pay to get special features, not the whole game
B009R659L8|5.0|I loved this book, it is very intriguing. I love the author and can't wait for her to write a new one.

B00847KFDS|5.0|Fantastic Fogerty with help from some of his talented friends! Absolutely great!  My favorite singer/writer. What a showman.<br />Judith Key
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The game makes you anxious.the same thing over and over just to collect sea creatures to swim in your space.  Yes I am still playing.you can't get an octopus until the game lets you no matter what you read.That goes for all the sea creatures.So what I am saying is that the game is in charge!!!! But for some reason you can't stop playing .
B001MKQS4O|5.0|I never review movies. This one was so shocking.  Shut your eyes at the end. Don't cry for the bad guys.
B00AK57N00|5.0|I got this because it was the free app of the day but I'm glad I did! This game is really fun and addicting it totally worth it :)

B00BNWWUDY|5.0|Medical-psychological thriller with great acting, good pace, excellent plot, and twists which will keep you glued to the screen. Just when you think  you figured out what is going on and are ready to pass ethical judgment on the story and the actions of the characters, another piece of the plot pops up which makes you change your opinion of the characters, again! Who's doing what, who is manipulating whom, are there professional ethics being violated, is there money involved, is there a victim, and if so, who might it be?  I can't review much  more without revealing key aspects of the plot which you should find on your own to truly enjoy this first-rate film. Phenomenal creation.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is very entertaining and fun for all ages. This one of the best cut the rope games yet.
B004F1F32A|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this one, T2 was good but not as good this one, but it's not too often that a sequel is as good or better. If you like action/spy type stuff, you'll enjoy this.
0857051873|4.0|This turned out to be a very good thriller/crime novel. I had some reservations, particularly in the early part of the book, but in the end I found it enthralling, exciting and very well done.<br /><br />The story begins with a brutal and very cruel kidnapping, but there are genuinely surprising, intriguing and just about plausible plot developments which take the book in unexpected directions. The narrative alternates between the activities of the criminal and those of the police which I found extremely effective, giving drive and mystery to the story. The characters of the small police team were very well drawn and I hope to meet them again in future books. The d&eacute;nouement is excellent, avoiding the now tedious clich&eacute; of a Tense One-To-One Stand Off With A Cornered Killer, but with things emerging cleverly in police interviews which for me were some of the most gripping scenes in the book. Whether or not you accept the explanation for the killer's actions, it was depicted and drawn out with a great deal more ingenuity and subtlety than the sort of facile psychobabble which we quite often get in crime novels.<br /><br />I had two reservations. One was a minor one about the translation which was a little clunky in places and often couldn't quite make up it's mind whether it was in UK or US English. The juxtaposition of distinctively UK usages with those unmistakeably from the US was a little disconcerting - especially at the start - but certainly not enough to spoil the book. My other problem is the level of cruelty and violence. There is a thin line between realistic depiction for the sake of the plot and gratuitous torture-porn. At times I thought this book strayed over the line, and despite finding the book as a whole very good this made me uneasy. Certainly you should be warned that this isn't for the faint of heart.<br /><br />That said, I thought this a good, exciting and gripping book and can recommend it as a very involving read.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Retirement has certainly given me increased reading time.  My list of favorite authors was not deep enough to provide enough new reading material.  A friend with similar taste in books had been recommending Lee Childs for several years but I had never indulged, until now.  As they say, it's never too late.<br /><br />Having recently seen the Jack Reacher movie, I decided to start reading this Lee Childs series from the beginning.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As Childs explains in the prologue, it's the characters that get remembered more than the books themselves.  Jack Reacher is that kind of character, memorable.  The fact that the plot was also good was icing on the cake.  Yes, there is some major coincidences in the plot (as has been pointed out by the critics), I can get past that for a well written book.<br /><br />I am now looking forward to working my way through all of the Reacher novels.  Lot of catching up to do....
B006LSZECO|1.0|the worst and most implausible ending of a story.  After suffering through the first half of the book things took an interesting turn and I continued reading.  I should've have tossed it and saved myself the time.  Luckily I was on a long flight, so I can feel somewhat okay with having wasted it with this book.  Never another Gillian Flynn.
1451629184|2.0|While what happened to Jaycee is terrible and I know this memoir was part of her closure, the book wasn't really that interesting after the first few chapters. She was in captivity for 18 years, but much of that time is skipped over.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great story, could not put the book down if you like Tom Clancy you  have got to read this book
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Don't get this if you want something mindless. No you don't have to be a chess player to enjoy the needed brain exercising you'll do with this puzzle. If you ever fancied being a treasure hunter solving clues, like the characters in the movie National Treasure or Laura Croft Tomb Raider, you'll be in heaven with this. Your turn to solve! Graphics are top notch. My wife walked up and asked me where I got the puzzle, at first thinking the thing was real, and in a glass box! Then she realized it was my Fire HD sitting on the coffee table and gasped: &quot;oh my God I thought that thing was real&quot;. If you like solving things logically, GET THIS!!!
B0012HQKZE|5.0|I like Anthony Hopkins. This move is one I saw a few times before and it was worth a rent because there is a lot in it to catch. Several viewings are required. Good story. Great ending.

B000FC1336|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the ending.  The story line was good and made you think, but did not elevate my heart rate. I am not a naval expert but I do know that nautical knots is not equal to land speed.  Overall, was ok
B001XVD21Y|5.0|I am not one for violent movies, but this all-star cast and great storyline made me a believer.  The picture quality was excellent, too.
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|Suspenseful and disturbing movie.  Twists and turns constantly keep you guessing what Jack will do next!  A must see classic!

B004XDYJRU|1.0|I used to use this app most days. This morning I got a message saying I must be logged-in to Amazon Appstore to use the app. I paid full price to get  the pro version weeks ago. Too many apps require you to be continually connected to someone else's server. Enough spying, prying, and nibbling away other people's bandwidth!!! A shame, but I'll take the loss rather than play along. BTW, the latest update I just tried failed with an error.

1455115215|4.0|Saul Bellow was one of the most critically lauded authors in the latter half of the 20th century, receiving numerous awards including a Pulitzer and a Nobel Prize in Literature. Unless you have a proper contextual understanding of the author and his work, however, you may wind up like some of the unfortunate readers here, spouting off in an uninformed 1-star review about how depressing and uneventful his stories are. Bellow's savage psychological and philosophical explorations might not appeal to everyone's taste, but those who 'get it' certainly reap the rewards. I suggest perhaps reading a few articles on Bellow (or at least his Wikipedia page) before diving into Seize the Day. This novella is an excellent starting point for newcomers.<br /><br />I just finished listening to the audiobook edition of this work, and I am extremely pleased with it. Read by Grover Gardner, the novella's characters simply come to life. The corrupt Dr. Tamkin and the spiteful Dr. Adler are presented it all their glory, New York/Jewish accents and all. Play time is 4 hours. Give it a try.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Nice to be able to red on the PC at home and the kindle when not at home.  Check it out.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Though the live scenes became tedious, the rest of the plot was surprisingly thrilling! Can't wait to read the last book.
0307968502|5.0|I seriously felt like the last person left on the planet to read Anna and the French Kiss so I finally sucked it up and decided to borrow the audiobook from my library. WHY did I wait so long? I fell in love with this story, the characters and Paris.<br /><br />I adored Anna. She was quirky, emotional and just overall a great character. I loved how imperfect she was, she definitely had her flaws but she was adorable and I loved her. And Etienne ... well does anyone not like him? I swooned over him just like every other character in this book. He was sweet and handsome... oh, perfect.<br /><br />The narrator, Kim Mai Guest, did an amazing job. I was nervous about trying this on audiobook because it's such a popular book and I didn't want to dislike it because I wasn't reading it myself. I had nothing to worry about. Guest did so much to add to the characters, I think I felt more attached to them because this was an audiobook! You could hear so much emotion through her and the voices she put on for the characters were fabulous.<br /><br />I loved the buildup to Anna and Etienne. There was so much tension and by the end of it I was practically screaming for them to get together. I really enjoyed the close friendship they built first and the fact it wasn't insta love! I haven't read a lot of books where Paris is the main setting but I immediately wanted to go to Paris after finishing. I can see why everyone loves books set in Paris, there is just this amazing atmosphere surrounding it.<br /><br />I really don't have much more to add that hasn't already been said. PICK UP THIS BOOK! It's cute, HILARIOUS, a great summer read, the audiobook is fantastic... I could just keep going. I am definitely picking this book up now and will be \\"re reading\\" it in actual book form.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Wow. Genuine 5 star book. I am not a fanatasy fan but decided to try this book after my wife raved about the TV series. WOW. I could not stop reading. I read a lot and widely but this must be one of the best story  books i have ever read. Enjoyed every page. I am hooked and will read them all. Wonderful  complex storyline with more twists and turns than a bagel with strong credible characters and yay the heroes die. I am  sick of  invincible superheroes. This book is a  breath of fresh air. Author keeps  complicated  and involved story  together wonderfully and develop the charaters very well. Creates a new believable fantasy world. Although it has 800 odd pages I was sorry to reach end of this book.  Cannot wait to start book 2. Do not hesitate. Get it now. This is not your ordinary dragons and castles fairytale fantasy. Goodbye Follet  Yancy Gimenez Childs etc. What a book. Pity I did not discover this author years ago.
0385349831|5.0|This awesome writer takes your mind and your heart to its full potential.<br />It opens so many doors to the real world we forget we live in.<br />Thank You Paulo Coelho.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The author had an excellent story.  That alone makes this worth reading.<br /><br />However, in the third book the author got in a little too deep.  Her writing style offered limitations when describing highly volatile and tactical situations in the story.  Much of it came across as rushed or forced.  Some scenarios were 'silly' and too infantile - which was a derivative of her being 'in over her head'.  The ending was abrupt and smelled of a desperate attempt to 'wrap it up' before the deadline.<br />I loved these books, and I loved the first movie.  The brilliance of these books is that the movies have an opportunity to achieve what very few can where the 'movie was actually as or more enjoyable than the book'.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Ok so after the first book and halfway through this one I'm glad the story is finally taking off. Reflected in you is starting to venture from being a copy of the Shades of Grey trilogy. This probably should have been the first book. I'm a little disappointed by the drawn out story line Sylvia!
B004J4WN0I|3.0|This book is fun, with a wisecracking dog and a witty protagonist.  Lots of Celtic lore with a sprinkling of southwestern US tribal animism makes for an interesting mesh of cultures.
B0014WSWTY|5.0|This set, well recorded between 2005 and 2007, comes with an informative and thorough booklet in several languages, but each one taking up about 30 pages of text. This care for detail in the booklet is symptomatic of the care taken over the performances and recordings presented here.<br /><br />Introduction:<br />A few salient points covered more fully in the booklet and which are of significance and may be surprising include Czerny's assurance from personal contact with Beethoven, that the composer could hear very well until 1817. This means that he was completely able to hear all of the first eight symphonies at the time of composition and knew from practical knowledge that what he asked for in print could be achieved in practice. He also sketched the first three movements of the ninth before 1817 but was totally deaf by the time he composed the last movement of the ninth.<br /><br />Viennese pitch using instruments made at Beethoven's time was significantly higher than in other areas and approximated to A = 440. This is closer to modern pitch than that used by many 'period'orchestras not using Viennese instruments.<br /><br />Tempi, which on modern instruments is too fast to be comfortable, is not a problem with older instruments which are invariably less powerful but more flexible than modern instruments. In the case of brass and woodwind this is a matter of bore diameter and can easily be understood by considering water flow through hosepipes. Wide bored hosepipes lack control but produce lots of volume ideal for putting out fires. Small bored hosepipes produce much more accurate jets of water which can be accurately aimed, ideal for precise watering but hopeless for fire control. Older instruments have narrower bores.<br /><br />Balance between sections of the orchestra in Beethoven's time achieved though numbers of instruments used, their relative power and their tonal characteristics, was more evenly spread so that musical dialogue was more naturally achieved.<br /><br />The above basic considerations make fundamental differences to the way the music can be played. In addition, the latest edition prepared by Jonathan Del Mar based on Beethoven's final score markings has corrected many previous errors. This is also the edition used by Zinman in his recent set using a small modern orchestra but with natural brass and timpani sticks of Beethoven's period.<br /><br />Overall comments:<br />These are meticulous and thoughtful performances. Tempi are generally on the brisk side but not excessive. Beecham, Monteux, Ansermet, Erich Kleiber and the young Klemperer all played many of these symphonies at a faster pace fifty or more years ago. The performances are based on actual performing experiences which were later recorded.<br />Textures are far clearer than in modern performances and dialogue between the different 'voices' of the orchestra are more naturally achieved. The tonal characteristics of the instruments are less blended than with modern instruments and this differentiates between sections more obviously.<br />The technical skills of the players is such that there are no tuning issues and no suggestion of thin or acerbic string tone.<br /><br />Overall conclusions:<br />This is a notable series of performances which are clearly musically led rather than academically led in terms of concept and delivery. Most decisions of tempi and phrasing are within the bounds of the acceptable norms of 'traditional' chamber orchestras but applied to an expert 'period' orchestra of moderate size. The differences thus heard are the consequences of using a period orchestra rather than using such an orchestra in order to 'make' a certain range of sounds possible.<br /><br />Summary:<br />I would suggest that this is an important set of period performances which will affect the way listeners will view the compositions in the future. For that reason it deserves very serious consideration as a potential purchase either as an 'only' set ofperformances or as a comparative set. It is traditional and period enough to give pleasure to both traditionalists and period followers alike. None of the performances falls below the level of very good and many could be described as outstanding, even revelatory.ure to both traditionalists and period followers alike. None of the performances falls below the level of very good and many could be described as outstanding, even revelatory.
B0000714BP|5.0|Very funny movie, the guys make great impersonators! It also has a moral to it.  Accept people for what they are, not what you would like them to be!
B0058A119G|5.0|Great songs on the 2 CD. Totally enjoyable. Only Barbara Streisand can give these songs justice and the right feel.
0061733199|5.0|This is a good book to read through. You can pick up a lot of good tips even though you aren't in survival mode. Great for outdoor people that like to get off the beaten path and rough it a little or alot.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Not her best but the plot is unforgettable and horrifying.  The audio makes the story move along (even with the trivia).
B000SEGUDE|1.0|too many stories are intermingled hard to keep track of different charecters . it has been very difficult for me to continue reading.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love this book, it has great characters, interesting to follow them through WWII,  Can't wait for the third book!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Flashy production numbers, lots of music, some fine actors strutting their stuff, fast paced multiple plot lines, and a lively mix of drama and humor make for an entertaining series on the launch of a Broadway show.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made! I encourage all to live by the Dude's teachings, especially if you are out of your element Donny!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the other side of the story....told in the famille and inter-generational style providing the reader with the cultural and real life background of a little know eastern culture that time has left behind.  Hosseini has filled a void with honesty and beautiful prose ....personally I was happy to learn that one of my granddaughter,s high school had added one of this authors' books to their reading lists.
B004N868DS|5.0|The pictures don't do this mouse pad justice at all. It's very well made and sits where you put it on your desk without any issues moving around while gaming. I have had a lot of mouse pads and I have to say this is one of the best I have had yet.<br />The gel wrist rest stays put as well and dose not move even without removing the clear strip on it and sticking it down with the adhesive that is on the bottom.<br />I use the speed side most of the time and I love it. My mouse slides flawlessly and I still have total control while gaming or just on the web. I have not had it very long and can not tell you how it will hold up but I will update this review if any issues do come up. So far the performance has been perfect for me and I love this thing.<br />I have other ROCCAT products like the mouse bungee with usb ports and I have found them all to be well made and solid with super performance.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like the game but it seems like it is set up to get you to pay money for things. No surprise with Disney!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|definately fun to play, could use a bit of variety since it gets tedious once you figure out the game
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Simply stated, outstanding frequency response, excellent S/N ratio & dynamic range, great channel separation and sound stage. I have been a audio engineer for 3 decades and this is as good as it gets. You will pay $400.00 to $1,200.00 for a pair of headphones that even comes close to the performance of these. I have been in the audio/video/film business for 29 years so take it from me, I have owned and listened to every major name brand and then some. These headphones will take about 80 hours to begin breaking them in. Don't push them too hard that first 80 hours as they have to expand and relax the diaphragm and other fragile components and they have to learn, for the lack of a better word, how to perform and set their own sound stage. At first, the mid-range frequencies seemed a little dense, but that comes along fine after the break-in period. As far as how they feel on your head, I had no problem with them after several hours of listening. They fit just about perfect right out of the box. Like \\"any\\" headphones, there are cons. But they are so few and far between with these headphones that it's not really worth being negative about them just for the sake of being negative. Would I buy this product again and recommend this product to any audio enthusiast, audiophile, or engineer? Absolutely!!!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I thought the movie dragged on and was boring.  It was nice to see the historical details and some of the stories Lincoln told were interesting...but overall I just wanted to go to sleep.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|If you liked his past material this one will not dissapoint.  My favorite charater of his shows up again and I could have been happier.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the historical accuracy and character development of this British television show. If this is something that appeals to you, than this is a must buy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show if clean, and no bad language is included.  Just goes to show , that you do not need vulgarity, or nudity, to have a good clean show
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not usually a proficient gamer, but I am very impressed with this game and enjoyed playing it very much. Graphics are stunning.  Clues were helpful but did not make gaming experience too easy.  Looking forward to promised sequel!
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I read this after reading &#34;Sister&#34;. Loved the &#34;voices of the mother and daughter. Loved the &#34;fly on the wall&#34; approach to moving the story forward.
B00005N6RU|2.0|The DVD will not function on my equipment.  The information on the screen indicates that I live in the wrong area.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|works with my kindle fire and other devices. High quality all around. I am glad I ordered this product from Amazon.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Khaled's first two books were exceptional, this book was mediocre and was not as captivating as the first two books
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I think the book spent way too much time on non-stop unnecessary details.  I had to skip read just to be able to keep going.  When detailing conversations between the characters, many sentences ended with \\"he/she said nothing\\".  I have read other Lee Child books and this is the worst.  So much was repetitive. Although I like the Jack Reacher character, I will probably not read another of his books. It seems like the author added a bunch of words just to fill the pages that did not mean anything.  I really struggled to finish it.  Do no waste your time reading it.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I love the beatle music and I love this animated movie they did, it arrived in very good condition, and plays just fine.<br /><br />I love this animated version, I love the Beatle music.<br /><br />It also arrived in very good condition.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  The separate story lines added a lot to the movie.  I found it to be funny and refreshing.
0316077046|5.0|I loved Beautiful Creatures. I felt like this book lived up to the first in the series. I'll definitely be ordering more of the Beautiful Creatures series and can not wait for them to turn more of the story line into a movie like Beautiful Creatures.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|A dramady!  done with a combination of humor , imagination , and serius drama rolled into a package that keeps you guessing and makes you think.  Actors do a good job, effects are great for a Tv show, and plot lines vary in all directions imaginable. A good watch.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|Great movie. I wish more of the book could have been put in the movie, but all in all I felt like it followed the book close enough to satisfy me after reading the book.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|It's nothing special, but it's ok. No fancy stuff, it just shows you the percentage that is left in your battery.
B001CO42MU|5.0|this is by far one of my FAVORITE movies and i love that its in Hi-Def with blu-ray!! AMAZAZZZZZZING!!!!!! You better get it!
B003TTCURU|5.0|I love Grey's Anatomy. I was surprised at season 8 ending and the beginning two episodes of season 9. I don't want to say exactly what happened in case viewers haven't had a chance to watch all the episodes, but if they have they know what I'm talking about.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|The motion lights eliminates turning the hall lights on. Kids love them and they call them &#34;magic lights&#34;.  Don't know what took me so long to get them.  All our guests are impressed and we tell them we ordered them from Amazon.  Thanks (Also great service)  Took only 1 day to get them.
B00A3K2PZA|3.0|I saw &#34;Killer Joe&#34; in a small Off-Broadway theater where it worked beautifully - just the right combo of hilarious black humor and white trash sick violence, so I was very anxious to see how it translated onscreen. On film it's all up close and most of the humor is drained from it - there's no audience laughing to let you know what's funny - and what's left is the uneasy, sick horror of the whole situation. There are a few great scenes that make you squirm appropriately, like Joe's creepy seduction of the 21 year old virginal girl, but the violence is in your face, bloody, and unpleasant. The play's most notorious scene - Joe forcing a woman to fellate a drumstick - was hilariously awful and horrifying onstage, but in the movie it's almost unwatchable and ghastly. Well deserved NC-17 rating. All the acting is great, but William Friedkin has never been afraid to rub the audience's nose in it and here he almost goes too far.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I think the book took too long to get into the story  and also its for a younger person around 20-35 of age.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|I bought too much music and now have to pay the price and review it all, albeit, I gave up after one review. Do yourself a favor and don't read this like you are doing at this very moment. Go jog or something, I'll be waiting.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is probably the best bang-for-the-buck quad core CPU out there as of press time! If you're like me and don't game but instead do CPU intensive operations such as video encoding, then this is the CPU for you. The integrated HD4000 graphics are on par with a \\"decent\\" mid-range GPU & power consumption is quite low on these Ivy Bridge CPUs. The lower power consumption of the Ivy Bridge CPUs will pay for it self over time if you live in an area with high electricity rates.<br /><br />Enough has been written about the performance of these CPUs, so here's my setup & results:<br />Gigabyte GA-Z77-DS3H BIOS rev F6<br />i5-3570k (Costa Rica Fab) OC'd to 3.8GHz<br />Cooler Master Hyper 212+ CPU Cooler<br />Samsung 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 OC'd to 1800MHz<br />Samsung 830 series 128GB SSD<br />Cooler Master Elite 430 Case<br />Cooler Master eXtreme 500W PSU<br /><br />Idle: 1600MHz, 45W at PSU, 28C at CPU<br />Max Load: 3800MHz, 90-95W at PSU, 58C at CPU [Handbrake High Profile H.264 encode]<br /><br />Using Win8 RP, but will switch to Mountain Lion soon.

1416550542|5.0|I loved this book. The storyline was rich and the characters have depth. The book starts in England in 1913. That alone intrigued me!  The story covers four generations. As you go thru the book the chapters change back and forth between many different periods of time. That did not make it more difficult to read or comprehend it made the book more interesting and you never know what to expect  next. I highly recommend this book!
B00CVDPAIQ|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years.  I was engaged by the human history, intrigued by the analysis, and agree with his opinions (like that climate change does exist but it's certainly not the calamity people make it out to be).<br /><br />I would never \\"require\\" Americans to read a book, but you get the point.  This would open up so many people's eyes and cut down on the \\"what is wrong with the world\\" comments I hear from my well off, suburban neighbors so much.<br /><br />I might buy this as Christmas presents this year.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I had been avoiding this book - who afterall can remember in such detail a trip from 20 years ago? But after my book club selected it, I decided to dig in. As someone who has taken on long hiking excursions, I enjoyed the physical and spiritual journey. I'd recommend it for anyone though who seeking a coming of age story.
B000091CRR|5.0|I bought this cassette new in '88 and was introduced to their best live compilation of any era. It's basically a best of from their Boston Tea Party recordings. It's all there - the Green God, the psychedelia, Jeremy's raucous slide playing and Danny's haunting instrumental. This is a great CD for anyone wanting to learn more about their roots.
B00BKRON5K|1.0|Book was fine, diet seemed ridiculous to me. I know I'd be craving too many things to make this work.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I really love this game. the graphics are awesome but I would really love more nectar. I haven't seen the movie yet but judging from the game it'll be pretty awesome

0553801473|1.0|The first 4 books, all well written, came to no conclusions, except for the characters that were killed off. -- This book isn't as well written - revealed very little story and less conclusions to the story began.  The whole thing feels like a ploy to make more money, without offering any reader satisfaction. - I have to confess that having read over two thousand of Martins pages, and being a real GoT fan (computer games,TV series, etc.)it was all a gigantic disappointment - but at least I won't be looking forward future books of his, I was a sucker, but I'm done.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|I've read 2 of his novels and they were excellent but he really missed the mark (in my opinion) with this one. He was too scattered in his characters, location and story. I could barely finish this book. I would not recommend this book and may not read any more he writes.

B0032KLAKE|5.0|Fortunately I had seen this movie before. In spite of the streaming that stretched the movie to a frustrating four hours from the original two, it was still worth watching Richard Gere's character determining whether Edward Norton's character was guilty or not. The movie had you hooked from the beginning to the end and the twist at the end of the show will go down in cinema history as classic dialogue!!!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|a total farce! we downloaded the free application and then it wouldn't let you get passed the main screen until you paid for the app.. and It looks like all apps created by this company is that way..
B0081I08CI|4.0|The continuation of Game of Thrones does not disappoint. What I found the most enjoyable is how the author managed to get into the heads of so many different characters, so the reader can see events through different perspectives. Again, it lays on the brutality a little much, and seems a little long, but these are minor flaws in an amazing work.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|pretty interesting game.. Goal is to collect all the buttons and paperclips.. works like a handheld controller with right to left movement controls on the left and jump controls on the right, but tapping on the screen.. cute game..
0553386794|5.0|I was blown away by the imaginative world-building and history that frame this novel. It sucked me in from the beginning (\\"winter is coming\\") and I got lost in the exploits of the Starks, their allies and enemies. It's not a quick read, but an enjoyable one. It's also a bit brutal and graphic in spots, but not to the point the story is overpowered. Be warned that this is just the first installment, so not everything is resolved or wrapped up.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|past CD's enjoyed greatly. This one not so much.. amazon service was as usual great, but CD is a little too splashy/bangy. just different tastes.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The only think I hated about this series is that it ended!!!  I absolutely love the characters, especially Harvey, Donna and Lewis. Great show and can't wait for next season. Pure entertainment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abby is so refreshing.  I love the cloths, hairstiles and the Abby.  The<br /><br />story lines are great.  The show is a wonderful change from all the garbage that<br /><br />is on the other stations.

B005HEPN06|5.0|Love Star Trek!!  The actors are great; the plots are well written and the special effects are wonderful.  I never got a chance to see this series when it was on television the first time as I was a night-worker.  I love being able to see them now.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book makes me wonder why we continue to allow NK to exist as it does today.  It is tragic.

B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like this game. It reminds me of Tap Zoo. I don't like to buy the peanuts needed to achieve the next thing. I just wait until I earn them for rewards. I would recommend this game.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Something of a different pace of movie, this is a great family movie which is becoming something of a rare find nowadays. We really enjoyed watching this one and I would recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this book after having already seen the movie. I'm happy I saw the movie first, having enjoyed it at the time, because I don't think I would have appreciated it as much after reading the book.<br /><br />The book has a much darker feel to it, and also gives you a much better look into the psyche of each character involved.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of the genre.
0756697875|5.0|This book is great for anyone into LEGO, DC Comics, Batman, or collectors. The whole family has read this book and I often find it in my daughter's posession. The pictures are very high quality, and with short captions and LEGO facts throughout. Also included is the exclusive &#34;Electro Suit&#34; Batman minifigure. I keep him safely stored in the book when he's not out with the other LEGO collection on display. The quality and printing detail is really good, and you need this guy to complete your collection. I highly recommend this book and Amazon has amazing prices. I paid only about twelve dollars for this book and MSRP is twenty two. It also arrived at my door in only three days!
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Really good book about how humanity comes together but the rights of the many out weigh the rights of the few.

B00CW665VI|5.0|LOL!  Hilarious, sexy, romantic, all words to use when describing this book.  It was just what I needed after reading a very serious and emotional story I had just finished. If you have read Wallbanger by Alice Clayton and liked it I highly recommend Tangled.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Don't get this app if you have a kindle fire! Does not work! If you have any other electronic it is awesome. It is so funny!
193700788X|1.0|Characters.  The main characters in the book couldn't decide what to do in book.  First of all Eric is a vampire who doesn't take orders and does what he wants.  The last book does a injustice to this character.<br /> Sookie choices were also were kind of weak as well for a main character.<br />  > None of the main characters were likable or someone you felt sorry for in this book.<br />  > Some new characters came out of no where and were plain terrible and not likeable.<br /><br />Storyline: Boring, it wasn't very exciting to me and was interesting like last novel.<br /><br />Don't recommend to buy if a fan of the series.  Last two books were below the strengths of previous books.

B004J4WKUQ|1.0|&#34;I decided that whoever Art3mis really was, I was in love with her. I could feel it, deep in the soft, chewy caramel center of my being&#34;.<br /><br />That's the line that caused me to quit this book and demand my money back, something I've never done before. I bought it expecting it to be bad, but not for it to be so bad as to make me angry at reading it. You know how sometimes something ridiculous happens on something you're watching on TV and you yell at it? I've yelled at this book at least a dozen times, and it's not Game of Thrones' &#34;wow, they killed my favorite guy&#34;, it's &#34;jeez oh man, I can't believe how terrible this is&#34;.<br /><br />The problem isn't the focus on teenager angst as the subject matter, either. I love Catcher in the Rye, Ender's Game has its merits, etc, etc- it's more the absolute lack of any kind of skill for characterization, dialogue or world building- the things that make up stories?- and the utter lack of craft on the author's part.<br /><br />That doesn't even delve into the Mary Sue nature of the main character who the reader already knows is going to conquer the evil bad guys, win his love, lose weight, clear up his acne, and become popular and important- all by playing a video game really well. The reader knows that on the first page. And while the book is filled with literally THOUSANDS of references to the 80's, there is no commentary on the 80's or the entertainment or anything, it's just page after page after page of &#34;this happened + 80's reference+ fanservice&#34; bland, expository writing. That is why the book is trash, and may possibly be the worst book I've ever read. I'm actually angry that I wasted the time I did reading half of it.<br /><br />Reading this book will lower your IQ, please don't encourage this author to write more by paying to do so.
B0084IT59C|1.0|Wow, I was SOOO thankful to see I'm not the only person who found this book terrible. I can follow the herd--Harry Potter was good--but Confederacy just confounded me. Horrible characters, rambling plot....I have to wonder if the fact that Tool was dead made a difference in the publishing community getting behind it. At its best, I saw the book as a sloppy first draft. Could Tool have worked with an editor and made it better? We'll never know, of course, but if I were looking at this book for the first time, it would have been returned with a Thank You But No clipped to it.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|Only fools would not consider this to an excellent LP ....people whom focus on the drumming thing are just being silly. I am into my second listen.This brings me back to the early days of the band i.e. Vol. 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I didn't like this as much as Kite Runner, but still read it straight through without a pause, which means it is in my top 50.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|\\"Best Kept Secret\\" is the third installment in the riveting saga of the Clifton and Barrington families. It begins in 1945 London after the vote in the House of Lords has decided who will inherit the Barrington fortune. When Emma and Harry Clifton and Giles Barrington think their lives have settled into some kind of normalcy they'll find they're turned upside down when Lord Giles makes a grave marital decision that could cost his seat in parliament and the Cliftons adopt a daughter with a long buried secret. In this story the Clifton's son Sebastian marches into their history winning a scholarship to Cambridge, but making a friendship that will not only bring the family international intrigue, but could cost them their lives.<br />Like the previous books Jeffrey captures his audience with a page turner that's as captivating as it is exciting. Woven into the story is betrayal, bitter and enduring hatred, revenge and the love of a family through all the chaos.<br />The characters are as passionate and realistic as they are memorable; Harry's patient, tolerant and brave in the face of danger, Emma's determined and resolute while Lord Giles is committed but naïve in some of his decisions. I loved Sebastian, the Clifton heir an only child who struggles making friends, and even academically at first, but as he comes of age he develops a maturity beyond his years and isn't hesitant to dabble in life's small pleasures even if it could mean his suspension from school.<br />I highly recommend this book although at the end there's more  questions left unanswered and it leaves me impatiently wanting the next book in the saga.
B004XG753W|2.0|The episode is great and engaging like most of the series we may remember well, I particularly enjoyed this episode, however amazon's playback quality has proven sub-par it is constantly skipping and delaying, it only gets worse when you try to play in HD quality so if you do download this only pay for the standard quality.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|Excellent scifi thrill drama serie. The cast and the details of each location is awesome, and each episode let you make you want to watch more and more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story of an upperclass family in England in the early 1900s, kept me completely engaged throughout. I enjoyed it so much, I've now ordered season two and season three! The story takes a somewhat elitist titled family through their daily lives and turmoils, giving glimpses into what happens in the lives of the family and its large &#34;below stairs&#34; staff. A fascinating look at what life was like with fantastic period costumes and decor.

B001VZY4M8|5.0|This &#34;album&#34; (read: vinyl or 33) got me through high school so it was never going to get a lower rating than five stars. If you liked the 60s and 70s for the music, or are just into 'retro', i highly recommend this! It has a fantastic range of music and, in the case of some tracks, will give you a glimpse into the current affairs of that time.

B0058YPG1G|2.0|Even though the package says there is closed captioning, there is not. I believe this is a manufacturing defect.  I've written to Sony to David Bishop, President, Worldwide SonyPictures Home Entertainment, and though he forwarded my request to his consumer affairs department, they have just given me the runaround and there has been no action.  This was a gift for my father who is hard of hearing and needs the closed captioning to be able to follow the story. I said to Mr. Bishop:  I purchased all four seasons of  the AMC series &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; on DVD for my father who is elderly and hard of hearing.  I chose these DVDs because they included the &#34;CC&#34; code on the package which convinced me they had closed captioning encoding on the disk.  This is important to me for my father, but you probably know that 48M people in the US (up to 15% of your customers) are deaf or have some degree of hearing loss. Providing accessibility extends your audience reach in the deaf community, as well as helps you meet legal requirements.  As the population ages, the number of people relying on closed captioning will surely rise.<br /><br />Closed captioning has been provided on a voluntary basis by many movie producers, studios, and distributors for movie videos and DVDs produced for sale or rent.  Though it is voluntary, having the symbol of &#34;CC&#34; on the packaging would seem to me to be a promise that the disks were, indeed, encoded with closed captioning.  Sadly, I tried to display this on several devices and on my PC using Windows Media Player as well as HP's TouchSmart DVD player.  It does not display on any of our three DVD players.

English subtitles could have helped my Father since he is not totally deaf, but you do not have English subtitles on any of them.<br /><br />I paid more than $60 for all four seasons.  I’ve disappointed my fatherwho was looking forward to them.  So, I am appealing to you to explain why you have not included the Closed Captioning on these DVDs.  Your company is a leader in the industry and even though you're not required to encode the Closed Captioning, putting it on the package is a promise that was not fulfilled.

1451637500|4.0|(NO SPOILERS HERE!)  I love her books, she is a GREAT writer.  Time and time again, I am amazed how how eloquently she puts together memorable phrases. That said, this one was a bit different.  AFter so many years of No Miles!!!, this one, set far away from home and all the great characters and entanglements there, seems to be a vehicle to bring the series to a close.  Miles and his trusty armsman alone, lots of 'endings' and 'death'...  I certainly hope not.  The last pages reminded me of how much I love her writing and this incredible world she has created. However, I can ony imagine that as a writer, she would want to evolve and grow despite how disappointed many of us would be to see this ending...  I treasure these books and will re-read them down the line.  I only hope she has it in her to give us one more of Miles in his homeworld / life.
B00CISC2DA|2.0|I have a feeling there are countless BoC fans out there just playing this over and over again, trying to get it to click with them, so they can justify the years of waiting for the next album, but it's not the end of the world to be realistic. The reality of it is this, and this is coming from a huge fan that has loved all of their previous work, it's just not that good. There is nothing redeeming about it when compared to their older albums. Fans look up to these guys like gods who can do no wrong, all because they really are talented musicians who in the past have made listeners recall some nostalgic memories of their childhood. Yes, these guys are really good at that, but unfortunately they used none of it on this album. This album is lacking in every department, and that really is sad to say, but it's not the end of the world. It sounds to me like they just simplified their sound and fell short on catchy melodies. Too much of nothing going on. The best tracks on this album are the ones people are saying sound like 'old' BoC. Know why that is? It's because old BoC is superior in every way. People just need to accept it.

The relationship between Gideon and Eva just keeps going from strength to strength as the story develops. Not as much angst in this one. I loved how playful and fun Gideon and Eva have become with one another. Yes there was still plenty of drama but I found this instalment to be quite fun too! And the sex scenes... whoa... HOT as!<br /><br />I knew going into this book that I would be left wanting more, that not all would be revealed and I would be waiting for more of their story. But I didn't mind that, I just hope that I don't have to wait too long for the next book as I love Gideon and Eva. But it's the other characters as well that I am looking forward to reading more about.  I have become a big fan Sylvia Day. That girl can write!

He's a terrific actor, and he has just the right believable mix of attractiveness, nerdiness, braininess, and heroicism to bring out the many facets of the Doctor's personality. That's not easy to pull off, but I think he does it even better--with greater range--than David Tennant, which is quite a feat.

B007DJUO8O|5.0|...would be the adjective I'd use to describe this album.  The songs are spare, distant, cold, wavy, poorly understood.  Like the mesosphere itself.  Storm Corrosion seems to have its fair share of detractors, but I, for one, really like the darkly ambient/new age vibe of this album.  I naively bought this thinking it would be something like a marriage of the sounds of Opeth & Porcupine Tree, found that it was unlike either band, and was more than pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Melancholy, wistful music for early mornings or rainy days - this album must have flown off the shelves in the Pacific Northwest.<br /><br />I can't choose a favorite song.  I find them all to be equally intriguing.  If you are interested in listening to some atmospheric music with a grim edge to it, then this is your album.  Pick up a copy and give it a few spins; you won't be disappointed.

B001DCQI8W|5.0|How does one go about reviewing a huge body of work that comprises this set?  Like Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and of course - Mahler, Bruckner is a universe, it's so rich and profound, it would take 10 trained musicologists to analyze each of the measures, let alone complete symphonies.  But unlike those three composers, whose work could be interpreted completely  differently by every conductor who touches it, Bruckner does benefit from a single-conductor interpretation - perhaps because he really didn't have an \\"early period\\" or a \\"late period\\", or anything like that - no, Bruckner's work is like this gigantic journey that feels complete and satisfying after the 9th ends.  And as such, having a guide in the great Herbert von Karajan, is most befitting.  While I always felt that Karajan's Mahler was missing the unsettled, neurotic, sarcastic, whimsical parts of the composer's notorious (and endlessly exciting) personality, he completely nails Bruckner's, which is spiritual, monumental, internal and noble.  This doesn't vary from symphony to symphony, and of course, not within the symphonies (well, aside from the scherzo in the Ninth?).  That probably explains why Leonard Bernstein didn't make Bruckner his specialty as he did with Mahler. And conversely, I think Karajan's own convictions and spirituality enabled him to \\"get\\" Bruckner much more than Mahler.  This set is nothing short of spectacular.  Each movement soars and takes listeners' breath away with its strength and grandeur.  It's recorded very well, too, to my ears.  The typical \\"glossy sheen\\" that's annoyingly present in many DGs Karajan records is all but gone here.  The sound is focused, and the dynamic ranges are perfect - not too wide (these are studio recordings, not live) which is perfect for headphones or living room listening; I'm sure HvK and the engineers meant it this way.  If I had to nitpick, I would ask why in the world would DG break the symphonies apart?  The opening movement of symphony #5 is tucked at the end of CD 1, for instance. That's a huge distraction and isn't meant to be listened to in such order.  I ended up ripping all tracks in lossless format to my hard drive and putting them in the right order on a portable hard-drive.  Even this (rather glaring) problem would not me take a single star away from this magnificent collection.  And at such price, it becomes a steal of the century.

B008JFUO72|3.0|I loved Iron Man I and II, and was really looking forward to Iron Man III.  While it was not a complete waste of time, it definitely was not nearly as enjoyable as the previous films, and was a huge letdown as the first followup to The Avengers.  It was not necessarily a bad movie so much as it was not the movie I, and I assume many others, wanted it to be.<br /><br />This movie focuses largely on the character development of Tony Stark and his personal struggle to deal with events and the enormous responsibilities that come with his power.  That is all fine and good, but what I wanted to see in an Iron Man movie is (1) Iron Man and (2) Tony Stark being his trademark snarky jerk self.  Instead the vast majority of the movie consists of Tony Stark moping around and having deep, meaningful realizations about his life.  Again, I'm not saying that kind of movie is bad, but it's not what I was wanting to see in a comic book superhero movie.  Seriously, who wants to watch a movie about Tony Stark struggling to deal with anxiety attacks?<br /><br />In short, this movie suffers from the same flaw as The Dark Knight Rises, namely that the costumed superhero has ridiculously little screentime.  The Dark Knight Rises might just as well have been called Bruce Wayne: The Movie, and Iron Man III might just as well been called The Emotional Struggles of Tony Stark.  I could care less about the absurd plot holes and contractions to previous movies. I just wanted to be entertained, but this movie was decidedly less entertaining than the previous Iron Man movies.

The Preacher hates everything about the west, particularly the UK and US and his teachings have recruited assassins who have killed, among others, the Marine's father, a retired Marine general who was living quietly in a retirement community.<br /><br />The manhunt which follows is typical Forsyth international intrigue, but is certainly not as good as The Day of the Jackal, The Dogs of War, etc.  I would recommend it for quick reading but for true suspense, stick with anything by John LeCarre.  The latter will take much longer to read, but it will be worth it.
B009MJUB90|5.0|I got this as an inexpensive alternative to regular Dungeons & Dragons miniatures. Those figures are usually 25/28mm or 1/72 in scale, which makes this Vulture huge in comparison to human-sized figures of that scale. It is about the size of an official D&D Roc figure. So, if you're looking for a Roc or some similar giant bird for D&D, this is a good-looking figure for an out-of-the-ordinary encounter.<br /><br />The legs of this figure are rather fragile, and mine arrived with the feet bent upward. I managed to get them to bend the right way eventually, but bear that in mind when deciding to buy it. It's a pretty good sculpt and paint job, and it looks fairly realistic.
B009NX409M|2.0|It was completely predictable and extremely slow moving.  I was surprised that these 2 great stars were in this movie.
B0015GF4FO|4.0|Gut wrenching and sometimes hard to watch but it's the real deal.  About as realistic a treatment of &#34;treatment&#34; as has ever been done in television or film.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Adam Johnson has written a fascinating novel. Why not five stars? It's often confusing and provides stretches of tedium—scenes that should be more compact.
B00006AW2G|5.0|A true classic Rolling Stones collection. One of my personal favorites from a band that can do no wrong. I love it!
0307476073|5.0|This book was well written and enlightening.  Would recommend to all outdoor enthusiasts that are going through a &#34;finding myself&#34; period of life.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I actually wish to give this very sad story of the selling of a young, vibrant girl to a wealthy couple that has money 4.5 stars. The sale takes place on a background of destitution unimaginable to a Westerner. And the small comforts that are purchased may seem  as too insignificant to us. But a functioning stove protecting against an Afghan winter and enough food for the remaining children means more than we can probably imagine. The impact of their suffering grows slowing In part because some key aspects  of the family's pain and loss take place &#34;off stage&#34;. What is most gripping is the inner  suffering of the father who gave away what brought him the  only source of laughter in his  life. It is the father, a story teller  himself, whose plight is the core of the story. Any more will give the plot away and each reader should explore the depths of/capacity for empathy rather than simpler sympathy.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Not enough Twist, Turns and Frolicks, I couldn't wait to finish the book.<br />In fact if I had not have paid so much for the book I would not have finished<br />it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|In Martin's follow up to Game of Thrones, the reader is introduced to more places and people that color this epic story.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have been using yahoo for years on my computers but not on the K F because it was difficult to use. Now i use it a lot because it is easy to go on to and I don't need to carry my lap top anymore.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book is easy reading with a quick, but not necessarily fast pace. Pleasant and solidly predictable. Good beach read, not much heavy lifting involved.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Crazy compelling.  I got the free first book of the Wool Saga and didn't realize it was a short story.  In far too little time it was over and I was clamoring back to the Kindle Store to get the Omnibus.  Wow.  Such a compelling story of endurance and such appealing protagonists.  I can't wait for this to come to the screen to give Mr. Howey an even wider audience.  FANTASTIC.  Thank you for giving me a page-turning start to Summer vacation!
B000JIHP88|5.0|We already have our second child using this mobile. Both of them loved it. We love the remote - our 7 month old sleeps in our bedroom. All we have to do is use the remote to turn it on in the middle of the night. Amazing product!
B002KJX4IE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as a kid, as well as, an adult.  Be forewarned that they do say some inappropriate languages; otherwise, it's a fun, silly movie with an old school comical twist.
0062059963|5.0|This sequel was a great continuation of Elite. The author does a wonderful job expanding the story and I cannot wait for the next book. I would definitely recommend both the Selection and The Elite.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Although I enjoyed the story, my experience was jarred by the occasional grammatical slip, such as &#34;lay&#34; for &#34;lie&#34; or &#34;lie for &#34;lay.&#34; I wish I had marked them all, but I hope the author finds an editor who has read Strunk & White. The story deserves better attention to detail. I hope that, as we go along, people become more idiosyncratically themselves.  I'm waiting for characters with real bite to them. Bast became interesting in the last chapter. Kvothe is smart, arrogant, insecure, and somewhat shallow. Dig deep, dig hard, show us the characters's souls.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very addictive and challenging game. Go for the gold frames!  They are my goal and I will not give up on a year until I have reached all gold!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Do be aware that this is a novella, not a full novel, so it is much shorter than most of Sanderson's other work.  While it is very well done, I do not consider it worth the print list price.  If you can find a good discount on it, though, it's absolutely worth it; I picked it up when it was on a Kindle Daily Deal.<br /><br />It is about a &#34;Forger&#34;, someone who can use the world's magic to transform objects by altering their past; she is also a forger in the more standard usage of the word.  She is caught replacing a painting with a forgery and given a choice to Forge a new soul for the damaged emperor (despite the fact that use of this type of magic on a human is specifically forbidden) or be executed.<br /><br />This is very much a character study of the Forger, and what she's able/willing to do to survive, and how much her Art matters to her.  There is not a lot of action.  Much of the book is contemplative.  I very much enjoy this sort of writing, but someone looking for action should look elsewhere.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is totally addicting.....the way the game plays is really cool and it's one of my favorite games on the Kindle Fire.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|Sad!  Her journey was a struggle to read and yet it was peppered with humor.  I chose this book after it was mentioned in &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34;.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Face paced, exciting showcase for some wonderful actors. Found it to be full of surprises and fun. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
1609611543|4.0|I very much enjoyed the through explanation provided by the author, illustrating the damage that present day wheat can cause to the body.  This book perfectly illustrates why so many people are having such a wide range of symptoms that could well be caused by what they are eating.  I had no idea that gluten was in so many of the things that we ingest daily.  A very informative read with exceptional attention to details.  Made the gluten free ginger spice cookies (recipe in book) and I have to admit, that they are far superior to the traditional ginger snap cookies that I am accustomed to.
1781162646|5.0|Not your typical Stephen King novel but absolutely loved it!  Bittersweet stories intertwined with the \\"ghost\\" of Joyland make for a fantastic new read from my favorite author!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is as fun as the movie . As soon as you play it you want more . The game offers so much to do and  guides you through each level. This game is so worth playing you  get to do so much and it continues to keep your attention with each level it becomes even more intriguing. It has surprises at every level. The characters are fun to watch when you tap on them they all do different types of movements. I suggest if you get this game make sure to complete each family for more rewards, it allows you to collect more money and be able to move up faster. I'm on level 37 and loving it!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|If you're looking for a deep plot, then watch Les Miserables. If you want a fun movie, watch Rock of Ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a great app hahaha get it if you love horses. yep get it. u have to get this app. thenbest thing is that its free
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My family began watching Doctor who as the result of one of my daughter's classmates starting a Doctor Who trend in her middle school. I began watching it with her, soon my other daughter, and their little brothers. We still avidly watch this show, even occasionally watching the seasons from decades ago. We continue to watch the show and look forward to watching the 50th anniversary special of the long-running show and Season 8!
B003O86FMW|4.0|As intriguing as the first. Well written. Can't wait to start Mockingjay. Suzanne Collins has outdone herself with this series.
B0010T75W6|5.0|My friend just watched it with me for his first time and he started by saying &#34;I really don't like musicals&#34; but he turned out to be wrong - he liked this. The music bounces back and forth between a rocking late-70s David Bowie vibe with subjects like  botched sex-change operations and the Cold War, then there are fun cabaret sing-alongs about candy and wigs, and finally stunningly lyrical torch ballads about broken hearts, that will stay with you for weeks after you hear them for the first time.  The story is completely unique, and yet completely universal at the same time. If you have ever been disappointed in life and love, you will understand the beauty and power of Hedwig.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Would not download for me on my Kindle Fire. Don't know if it is a good App. But upset with inability to download it.
0738711500|5.0|Such beautiful and mysterious cards! And the book is thorough and offers helpful step-by-step instructions and techniques. The Gilded deck is considered a beginner deck, but they're beautiful and for anyone who wants to learn.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|A life saver when staying in hotels, I fly for a living so I don't leave home without this app
B001SGEUNI|5.0|The First Song I Heard From Halestorm Was I Get Off On The Radio And I Thought It Was Pretty Interesting So I Bought Their Self Titled Debut And Was I Suprised! :) It's Like A Combination Of Joan Jett, Amy Lee, And Dresden Dolls Amanda. The Song That Really Got Me Into Them Was Familiar Taste Of Poison. Only Way I Can Describe That Song Or Masterpiece Is An Orgasm For The Ears! Then I Heard The Song Called Love/hate heartbreak. Another killer song. Over all the album is really impressive. If you like metal and you wanna hear a chick that can truly sing and show the dudes a thing or two, pick up this Album. You'll love it :)
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Loved reading about a young man who had nerve to do the right thing. Being a dog lover helped also.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a fun little reaction game. I wish points were earned somewhat faster than they are, though... The missiles get too fast after a while. Oh, and shooting UFOs should not be a miss.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I could not believe that the author stretched this book out. It is an obvious money grab. I really enjoyed this series and now I could care less what happens to this couple. I will never buy another book by Sylvia Day.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Absolutely superb retelling of what has to be one of the greatest historical examples of humanity... Do not miss the opportunity to relive this moment in history!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This latest book in the series only made me look forward to the next one even more!!! I can't wait until the next one is published!! :)
1457514508|4.0|*** free review copy courtesy of the Author<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this quick tale by Duncan Whitehead. The story is filled with twists that must have made Whitehead's storyboard look like a Christmas tree. I suppose the best part of  The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club would have to be the characters.<br /><br />While fictional, I know these ladies. I've had tea at the Olive Garden with these ladies. One reminds me of a woman I once knew who gave me a book as a gift and then let it slip to my boss that I was reading on the job.  Oh yes, I know these ladies -- the good and the bad.<br /><br />All in all, it was a fun read written in small bite-sized chapters. Having said that, I read about half of the book in one afternoon. If you like sex, violence, and quirky southern characters, I think you'll enjoy The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club.  I give it 4 stars out of 5.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|While the show does work with easy-to-read cinematic cues, bordering on cliche, the execution of these moments are beautiful and delightful. The gore can best be described as elegant (speaking as a horror junkie.) I wouldn't say this show is particularly unique or ground-breaking, but it fits right in with the shows I enjoy (it's a bit Sam Winchester meets Criminal Minds) so I have to give it five stars.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Fast and furious 2009 was an exciting fast paced thrill ride. It was a lot of fun and kept me gripped throughout!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Interesting can't wait for book 2 percy Jackson is coming back to this new series so I guess bye till next book
B003YGSLDA|5.0|Santa Claus: The Movie (25th Anniversary Edition this a good movie to add to your collection i have about 700 blu-rays and this is one my kids love and the blu ray makes it even better
B003XHLIUS|5.0|Its from the first Series of Predators released by NECA, I did want the Tracker Predator to go with the two Predator Hounds that I have as a Predator Hunting Unit, but i got this Falconer , he is also a Super Predator along with the Berserker,Tracker and Classic ,the articulation for the first line of Predators ( series 1 and 2 ) from NECA were much less than the series 3 and later, but still they have amazing detail and are collectors items, not for kids to play as they can break due to the fragile nature, I like these NECA figures better than the HOT TOYS and Mcfarlane line of Predators. But thats my personal view and choice! If you a collector of figures then Get them !! NECA released the semi cloaked Falconer which has the \\"Falcon\\" I wud love to get my hands on too maybe sometime later..
1609611543|5.0|Read this book! In a folksy, affable style, Dr. Davis describes the ruler of the evil empire in today's diet - wheat. He doesn't simply point fingers and give vague suggestons as to how to avoid it. He delves into the science behind our current day wheat and how it's different than what our ancestors (and even our grandparents) ate. He provides anecdotes and case studies to illustrate the amazing and often lifesaving results his patients have seen simply by...ending their relationship with wheat. He even uses his own experience as support for his theory.<br /><br />He boosts his argument citing statistics on celiac and other gluten-intolerant health issues that seem to have exploding in our society. He provides scary data regarding diabetes and its steady climb to the current high U.S. numbers - all starting in 1985, the year &#34;eat healthy grains&#34; entered into governmental dietary guidelines. And obesity? Given its prevalence today, something has to be the catalyst. Sugar? He agrees there's too much of it in processed foods. But too much sugar, he believes, isn't the reason behind obesity. To explain this, he walks readers through how fat accumulates and why. You may find yourself reading with your mouth hanging open in surprise. It isn't pretty.<br /><br />Facts such as two pieces of whole wheat toast is as bad as, if not worse, &#34;than drinking a can of sugar-sweetened soda or eating a sugary candy bar.&#34; (pg. 33) are sprinkled generously throughout the book. Yet he admits that &#34;eating healthy grains&#34; continues to be part of the dietary equation put forth by the federal government and many disease-related associations such as the American Heart Association. He urges readers to ignore their advice on wheat and other gluten-containing grain products. His reasoning? Again, it goes back to the results in weight loss, blood sugar stabilization, increased mental clarity, greater mobility and a host of other positives his patients have seen after eliminating wheat - and only wheat. It should be mentioned that many of his patients didn't begin exercising, either. They simply stopped eating breads, cereals and other offending foods. The weight, and the resultant problems, disappeared almost effortlessly for many.<br /><br />You know something's up when it's better for your blood sugar level to eat a Snickers bar than two pieces of wheat toast with a little butter.<br /><br />While he sometimes delves a bit too deeply into the science, it is an interesting read. He doesn't leave you hanging, either. He provides detailed dietary tips, explains where gluten hides and what grains to avoid (warning: he's not really a fan of any, but admits that eliminating all even non-gluten ones might be difficult). He also addresses many of the modern day dietary advice regarding low-carb and low fat diets. He's a fan of one and scoffs at the other.<br /><br />Finally, he talks about gluten-free products and how they are often no better than eating wheat - at least where blood sugar control is considered. If you are eating a gluten-free diet now, you'll definitely want to pay attention to this information.<br /><br />If you've been plagued with vague health issues that can't be explained, gaining weight for no apparent reason, have a history of heart disease or diabetes, concerned how diet might be affecting your children or you're just curious about what Dr. Davis has to say - read this book. I promise you will think twice about going down bread (and other processed food) aisles ever again.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This thing needs updates. Bad. Lower the amount of gems for ponies and for gods sake, please, try to make it to where the game does not crash all the flipping time. I have been playing this game for awhile and Rarity is the pony I am stuck on. I mean sure, I can grind and grind to level up and get gems and find Derpy in her box and &quot;hope&quot; she has gems . This game is supposed to be fun, not a constant trip to your wallet to get your credit card. Gameloft, stop being greedy and start making a game where the fandom and the kids who play this game can actually enjoy it and not be stuck all the time!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app I love all the different things I can do with my pictures to make them look even better then they were before :)
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I LOVE All-in-one Mahjong. This is the closest I have found to my desk top version. Two minor issues I have: timer doesn't pause if you pause game &amp; I wish there was a way to see just my best scores on each layout.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is so fun..if you like Mario type games where u collect stuff,jump on enemies,&find hidden bonuses you will like this game..you also get to be a submarine,a flying box,and ride a sled..they have a couple extra levels...one is a Halloween one which is cool..another one is a endless,side scrolling, jumping game but the last time I tried it there was something wrong with it..hopefully a update should be coming for that..I wish it was a little more challenging and had a couple more levels but still one of the best apps so far.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I don't like having the ads pop up, but, hey, it's easy to ignore them.  I do like the auto finish.  But I have to limit myself on the number of times I play at any given time.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|The movie was good, but the streaming from Amazon, was not.  As usual, it kept interupting and reloading, unlike Netflix which always runs smoothly.<br />Will not renew this application.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I love the show.................im starting from season 1 since i had never seen it.  I recommend watvhing on own pace.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Not the best of his books (Who could outdo &#34;A Perfect Spy&#34;?) this book moves along with characteristic good writing and tight plotting. What is new is the fairly obvious message that Intelligence work has been &#34;outsourced&#34; to private firms, making that work even less subject to democratic oversight than it has been. No one is as memorable as Smiley, but it is still a good read from a<br />thoughtful author.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a good read for the genre but not much else. The book went by super fast and I felt like there were a lot of questions unanswered. Hopefully next book will answer them :)
B008JJM88Q|3.0|It's amazing how he gets it right every time..sometimes he's not even asking questions that seem to pertain to your character and somehow he still guesses right..the problem is that my kids really enjoyed this game but I had to stop letting them use it..every once in awhile it asks something that isn't appropriate for children..it doesn't happen very often but it does happen.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Have loved playing this for years and was glad it was offered on my Kindle, I enjoy playing on the go and the different layouts.  Wish there were some different designs on the tiles to change up the look.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Overall, this is a good movie.  It leads you to believe its about one thing, and then ends up being about something else.  I must be general so not to give it away.  Mara and Law do a very good job bringing intensity and believability to their roles.  Jones was a bit heavy handed early, but seemed to settle in a bit later on.
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|Very easy to buy on Amazon. Great movie. It had enough action to keep them glued to the tv. My kids absolutely loved it. They would watch it again
B009XIXVU6|5.0|You have to fully engaged when reading this novel  The author had many  people telling the story some from the past and some in the present day. However, that is the beauty of this book. Read it.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Love this show...I'm so happy it ended the way it did. Its great for passing time. Lots of drama, lies, love making, cheating, and death.
B006NUO4US|5.0|I was very excited when I saw that Bridget Jones Diary was also a book..I have always loved the movie and couldn't wait to see what the book was like..the storyline is pretty much the same thing except for a couple little differences..most of the book is written like she's talking to her diary..the only thing I had a hard time with was understanding some of the British words and topics..if you are not from there it gets a little confusing but not so much that it ruins the story..if you find yourself confused I'm sure it could be looked up online..I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the movie and any women looking for a laugh.
B001RPIYV4|5.0|I absolutely L.O.V.E. this movie!  Some people want to bash it for taking Shakespeare modern.  I thought this movie was done amazingly well and I can't get enough of it!  I had my friend over to watch it and she absolutely loved it too and was kicking herself for not seeing it sooner due to the bad review the movie got when it came out.<br /><br />Excellent movie!
B0093QE37S|5.0|Not to be confused with Philadelphia, a movie with a totally different plot, The Philadelphia Story is a delightful romp featuring a star studded cast. I watch it whenever it's on.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Unfortunately the blu-ray disc didn't work on any of my blu-ray players.  I figured the price was to good to be true. What a disappointment....
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Action packed and correct about all the facts. Can't wait for the next book. Great Egyptian book for kids of all ages
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put it down. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a sweet story and great weekend read.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who  is a huge Zelda fan..it came in a very protective package (it wasn't sold on amazon for a very short time do to it getting damaged during shipping but they did a great job fixing the problem)..when I took it out of the box I couldn't believe what a nice looking book it was..it's big and heavy when I expected for the price to get something smaller and less quality..it has a little of everything from all the Zeldas games and history..it shows you beautifully pictures of all the characters and how they got them to look the way they do now..if you love Zelda you should definitely add this to your collection..and for that price there practically giving if away!
0345803507|5.0|Came just as described . Came when expected to really nice packaging and the book is new as described. Worth the money paid for .
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Convenient way to do all my shopping for gifts. Far better than running around town and/or fighting the crowds at the mall.
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|I would expect this to last than the cheapy one I bought. I got this 1st before I got the cheapy one. So you can really tell the difference by just holding it. So far this has never fail to me. It does last me a whole day of shooting. Buy it if you have $$$
B000VI1FL4|5.0|Accardo does the wild man of the violin (Paganini) proud.  For you Paganini fans, and especially for those who aren't familiar with this composer.  Time spent with this recording instead of in front of the TV will be time-well-spent.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|the album is one of the  best from tyler so far he turned a slim shady LP to a Marshal Mathers lp tyler is doing good and i wonder what hell have instore for us in 2015
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I used to struggle trying to figure out certain fraction homework when my kids needed help..this app is amazing..it automatically reduces a fraction to its simplest form which is a big help..there's three number pads..the left for whole numbers,the top right for top of fraction,&the bottom right for bottom of fraction..then you can multiply,divide,etc..this app is definitely worth it if you have to figure out fractions or help someone else with them.
B006ZMMBU4|4.0|This is a great family movie, it shows that we all a have voice and we all have special purpose. It shows that being different is not always a bad thing, and we shouldcare aabout one another.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Every smartphone user should have a good flashlight app and this one is as good as any other I have used
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really  well  written. Kept me on the edge of my seat even though I had already seen the movie. Kind of scary thinking that it's not out of the realm of possibilities that our society could end up like this if we don't pay attention to what our leaders are doing. Great read, can't wait to read the next two in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very good game but I wish that it was faster and there was no energy bar cuz it takes forever to go to just one competition but it's cool that once you get eight ribbons you get a black stallion also I wish you would get more gems faster and that you could put.  Picture on your profile but it cool and you should get it needs WiFi though. Bless you if you sneezed or coughed during this REVEIW. BYE!<br />;)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST IN THE SIERRIES YET . THANK  YOU MR. RIORDIAN 4 BLESSING THE WORLD  WITH THIS NUMBER OF BOOKS!!!!!!!
B0011XBLUS|5.0|If you're an Eastwood fan, you'll love this even if you've seen it before.  It's the extended restored version and nearly 3 hours long, so grab some popcorn and enjoy!
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I usually enjoy items from Sony.  When I opened the record player after paying $150 for it, I was very underwhelmed.  It is basically an entry level turntable with software.  I never used the USB port, but did run the turntable into my computer.  I had an old desktop from 2004 powering a 2.1 speaker system which sounded alright, but I never could get an amplified sound out of it.  Keep in mind that is when I had turned it to the \\"Line\\" setting too.  Well I built myself a pretty nice desktop with HD audio and the sound quality did increase.  However, after one month the automatic features of the record player were malfunctioning. I have to wait to this day for the arm to go up and down at least 2 to 3 times before it stops turning.  The sound, still great with a 2 year old original needle playing stereo, mono and ancient lps.  All in All, looking back at it, not a very reliable machine, but it sounds good when it works.  I think it is worth considering at $100,  I don't want to comment too much on the software because it works, but cuts off some songs or doesn't split them correctly.  I am upgrading soon with step above so hopefully I can leave the frustrations of this turntable behind.  Again, not entirely bad, but you have to be really patient with the turntable. I have had the turntable for 2 years so that should tell you it isn't too bad.  Just be aware.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|New view of older songs and some new songs. Was not familiar with this young singer but she has made a new fan.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Nicely written, thoughtful, pace is mostly quick. Explore the complexities with a friend after - makes for a very interesting discussion!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Cloud Atlas left me completely speechless. It felt to me as if I just came out of a wonderful hypnotic trance. And I didn't want to wake up. I just sat there, thoughtless, speechless. The movie blew my mind. And that was such a wonderful thing!<br /><br />So brilliant! So beautiful! So heart warming! So soul touching! And so haunting. Over and over again, I couldn't stop thinking about it days after I watched it, until I went to Wikipedia and printed out a list of cast of the movie; and watched it again.<br /><br />The movie is mind-blowing because mind tends to think in linear, and this movie is not linear at all. To say the least, there are six different eras over two thousand years, six stories interrelated and interwoven, but the brilliance of the movie is that it's not about six stories. What can you say when a movie is about \\"my life extends far beyond the limitations of me\\"?<br /><br />The list of cast I printed out does help in understanding linear storylines, as the actors in the movie don't just play characters but souls, who travel lifetime after lifetime, meeting each other over and over again. They do a good job in makeup that it's hard to follow who's who in different lifetimes even though one actor carries out the same souls in different lifetimes.<br /><br />But I know I'm going to watch it again without a care of who's who, as I know this is also a movie to be enjoyed in its profundity, mesmerization and visual and acoustic impact. In a sense, this movie is only about one story. A story about life, death, and rebirth - what you bring to life, and what choices you make in each moment. This is a movie, if you can follow at all on the first watching, that you can never be bored for one second.<br /><br />Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future. I believe there is another world waiting for us, a better one. And I'll be waiting for you there.<br /><br />I believe death is only a door. One closes, and another opens. If I were to imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening. And he would be waiting for me there.<br /><br />Despite the negative reviews out there, I know this movie will become future's classic, when we are more acceptive to our interconnectedness and more understanding our soul evolvement.<br /><br />It's interesting that often movies show us where our collective unconsciousness is at, because we often explore concepts that are bubbling underneath the surface of collective consciousness through movies first.<br /><br />Yet I'm not too sure if this movie is about reincarnation at all, even though at one interview, Korean actress Doona Bae said it is; but surely if you know reincarnation, this movie would make more sense to you.  Oh by the way, what a great job Doona Bae did in acting Somni-451! I fall in love with her and Jim Sturgess' Hae-Joo Chang. The scene when Hae-Joo Chang was shot to death and Somni continued to speak through broadcasting with tears rolling off also got me in tears.<br /><br />Look at the sky. There is always a cloud atlas there. That is a map of souls' movements across history.r />I believe death is only a door. One closes, and another opens.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|As a psychologist and a human, I enjoyed this book.  The medical information is fascinating and the subject is provocative.  While this does not rise to the level of \\"proof\\" from a scientific standpoint (an n of 1 never does), it does raise many fascinating possibilities.  I applaud Dr. Alexander's courage and conviction, and believe this is certainly a universal topic worth further exploration.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While I still think Hosseini is a good writer, I was somewhat disappointed in this book.  A Thousand Splendid Suns left me wanting more, but this didn't satisfy me.  I felt the stories of the various characters were choppy and a little hard to follow, and I didn't become invested in any of the characters, as I had in the previous book.  Having said that, Hosseini certainly knows Afghanistan and its people, and his style is very engaging.  I just wish I had felt more for some of the characters than I did.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not sure what all the fuss was about on this story.  Saw the movie and book club read book.  Story quite different in movie.  Spent most of book club meeting discussing mental illness.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I saw this movie when it was first shown on TV, then saw the whole movie later when I was older.  It's about as scary as I remember.  The remastered video quality is good.  I'm glad I bought it.
B000U6BT40|4.0|Season 1 of Eureka was pretty good except for the fact that it bashes white Men at every opportunity. I don't know what drives writers other than bigotry and/or other prejudices yo do such things in their shows or movies, but it is definitely noticed. Are you under the impression that you are somehow making up for the 1950s? You can't. The only way to end injustice is to end it. You can not take turns and hope for a favorable outcome. The stories aside from the aforementioned showed imagination. I liked this Season in spite of the shortcomings of bashing white men at every opportunity. The Daughter disrespects her Dad and it's funny and OK. The subordinate bashes and somehow bests her superior at every turn, and it's ok. THe second in command in the entire complex undermines her superiors authority, and it's ok. All the White Men are stumble Bums, and it's OK. The affable Black character at the Garage is superior to everyone and yet the stumbling bumbling White guy always has to save even his bacon. IF you can overlook this tripe then the show is about as fun to watch as any other modern SciFi, Sitcom. ALL  shows are like this, every single one of them. I love sifi, but I like it when there is actual equality and not oneupmanship.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this because I was struggling with hitting all the rows of keys used in Guild Wars 2.  If you play any class that actively utilizes the Function keys and have difficulty hitting them, this is a great solution for you.<br /><br />The keyboard came with a preconfigured layout for GW2, and I've done nothing to change it.  After a few minutes of play you are able to adjust to the new key positions, and after a few hours you get to be quite adept.  The keys are very accessible, triggering skills is much more subconscious and automatic, and you spend even less thought on the controls and more on the game itself.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gaming keyboard for GW2, I highly recommend this one.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read his last two books and this book was just as fascinating and interesting as those books.  I liked the idea of several different lives and times intertwined and all coming together at the end.  I have not finished the book yet but I can't wait until I do.  I am looking forward to another book written by him.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|It appeared they used some kind of technology to convert 2D -&#62; 3D.  My TV can do that on it's own.  It was not as good as the works that are filmed for 3D, but that is not to be expected.  It was good to see the movie again.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|If you've only read the articles and reviews of this book and can't figure out why companies are embracing it, but individuals are slamming it, you should give it a read.  As a working mom, it was awesome to read the opinion and experiences of a successful woman in the workplace.  Its an eye opening way to look at your career and the balance of your life.  It helped me to embrace the choices I've already made and be proud of them.
B000B5MI3Q|2.0|Nice looking watch but because it's an automatic, you have to manually wind it twice a day. Must wind it before going to sleep. Has fewer than 12 hours reserve. Disappointing. Most people forget and have to completely reset it each morning. Booklet did not mention this.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|If I were to choose a single film as my favorite, this would be it (maybe tied with The Abyss and some others I can not think of offhand).  I traded up my DVD copy for the BluRay (and probably traded up to DVD from tape previously).<br /><br />I also have the 2010 sequel.  The remaining (I think there were) two more books were never made into film.
0451197968|4.0|The Running Man focus' on the exploits of Ben Richards. In the opening paragraphs we find Ben Richards and his wife, Sheila, in their inner city apartment. Two young people in their late 20's with an infant daughter who is deathly ill with the flu. Ben and his wife are unemployed and thus unable to provide the necessary medical attention to their daughter. Further along we learn that Ben is unemployed due to being blackballed after being honest with his foreman (and over the top) about why he was quitting his job at General-Atomics. \\"...Because his chances of ever having children decreased with every shift he spent behind the leaky G-A old-style lead shields.\\" Ben, not gainfully employed, is also unwilling to allow his wife to earn the money by selling her body.<br /><br />  Now that we have a back story on our protagonist, enter the Network. The Network is the television company that has the government in their pocket. Every development is required by law to have a free-vee installed in the apartments. A \\"public safety\\" system that the Network uses to lure in contestants from the projects of Co-Op city and similar slums. The shows they participate in are not that unlike those we watch during prime time... except that they all have the possibility of death. For instance we have Treadmill to Bucks. \\"They accepted only chronic heart, liver, or lung patients, sometimes throwing in a crip for comic relief.\\" The middle upper class and above have no reason to participate in these shows because they are without worry when it comes to their finances, but men like Ben Richards have everything to gain for those they care for by earning the money that comes with participation in these gain.<br /><br />  Ben looking to earn the money to get his daughter the health care she so desperately needs to survive, goes to the Network to be screened.  During the process we witness the disgust that the police have with the scum that come from the south side of the canal. He proceeds through the screening process and is selected to participate in a show, but not just any show. He has been chosen to be on The Running Man. He is informed of his selection by Dan Killian,  who is a major player in the upper echelons of the Network.  Fast forward through the days until the show begins and now we have Ben Richards on the run, earning 100 dollars every hour that he remains free in society. He is pursued by the hunters, a ruthless group whose only job is to find, capture or kill the contestants of The Running Man.  As we follow Richards across the country we find that not everyone is against him. Some people, those like Richards, are sympathetic to his situation.  We also watch the author develop Richards from a man with the sole purpose of caring for his family to a man with a cause. While being smuggled out of Boston by a young man named Bradley, whose younger sister is dying from lung cancer, Richards learns that the government is covering up the rising levels of toxicity from pollution. Thus causing severe illness among the impoverished like himself and, more importantly, his daughter. Richards takes his new found cause and tries to use the show to parade it in front of the masses that are watching him. In the end, after being the longest surviving contestant on the show, with McCone (leader of the hunters) in position to kill Richards, Killian offers him a job as McCones replacement. Then the bombshell that is the death of his wife and daughter is dropped on Richards. At this point we observe the destabilization of a man who has lost everything that mattered to him, everything he was literally in the process of dying for. Yet we find that there is still good in him. After all he shows mercy on his hostage by allowing her to parachute out of the plane before flying it into the Network headquarters building, subsequently killing Dan Killian (something Richards expressed wanting to do early on).<br /><br />To close up this review, I find the development ofBen Richards from family oriented, to cause oriented, to vengeful but still honorable to be entertaining and confusing. The plot flows well and as always Stephen King gives enough background to make you understand why the characters do the things they do but not so much as to bore you into not finishing the book.  Really a disturbed view of the future as Stephen King saw it the early 80's .<br />Bibliography<br />King, S. (1982). The Running Man.

I always seem to hit the snooze because of its large presence...LOL
B004P12SSW|3.0|I was never really sure what Burlesque was, as it is from an era gone by. I guess just another form of &#34;erotic art&#34; that leaves some things up to your imagination.  Anyway, the film and its plot reminded me very much of Coyote Ugly, which, I must admit I also enjoyed. So, overall, entertaining, and somewhat original. Nice to see Cher now and then, but not too much after her &#34;retirement&#34;!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This series is one of the Best series ever on TV, possibly the best.  If you enjoy action, drama, fantasy, great acting, great characters, or just good television watch Game of Thrones.  I remember buying this Blu-Ray set sitting down and getting sucked into Westeros.  I couldn't stop watching it and finished the first season in three days.  It is truly awesome!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a worthy successor to The Kite Runner. Different in scope, it takes the<br />reader through an incredible story spanning several decades and many lives.<br />It never falters. That it takes place against the politics  in Afghanistan makes it informative<br />and at times heart breaking. At the end when a &#34;family&#34; comes together, it makes<br />you want to pick up a phone and call your brother or sister or both. I love this<br />book.

B00947N6D8|3.0|We got this dvd for my daughter because she had been asking for it since she LOVES how to train a dragon, and they also made this movie. She loves it, and is 11, but my two sons who are 3 and 8 lost interest pretty fast. I think the screen shots are more dark, and it may be more story-based. It's not one that has been watched over and over.

B0056AP65I|5.0|This set of six 0.2 mechanical pencils with sharpener built in is excellent set. Kohinoor is a reputed company in drawing equipment business. It took a while to arrive from Czech republic. The set is in excellent shape and came with a metal case. The colored leads are great. I may not  use them immediately as I will be drawing using graphite leads(black and white). The mechanical pencils do not have clips. It would have been nice if they came with clips. Overall it is a useful set and if you are thinking of drawing using pencils it is a good substitute.

I had slipped it at first cause the description didn't draw me in.  But I was told to go back and read it.  I'm glad I did. It was a heart wrenching story. I can't wait to start the next one.

B008JFUPFI|4.0|With Zack Snyder's last few directorial efforts being a bit better than lukewarm at best, \\"Man of Steel\\" felt like Snyder's way of going all in. It is incredibly difficult to get excited about \\"Man of Steel\\" if you aren't a fan of the character and if you didn't like the last live action Superman film \\"Superman Returns\\" (spoiler: not many did). The teaser for the film didn't help matters. Clark hitchhiking and enlisting as an extra on \\"Deadliest Catch\\" seemed to hint at an incredibly painful and unbearably long wait until Kal-El finally donned the blue tights, red cape, and S-shield to transform into one of the most iconic comic book heroes in the history of the medium. While there are several hiccups in \\"Man of Steel,\\" Zack Snyder has unleashed a super heroic powerhouse of a film and has made someone who has ragged on Superman for years change his tune.<br /><br />You see the last days of Krypton as Kal-El's parents Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) send him to Earth to not only escape certain death, but also have the opportunity to choose his own destiny. You witness the threat that General Zod (Michael Shannon) has become. Most of the film is devoted to Kal-El (Henry Cavill), given the name Clark Kent on Earth, coming to terms with himself, gaining control of his powers, and learning where he comes from. There are flashbacks to his childhood and his adopted parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). Along the way, Clark crosses paths with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) where an investigation of the century slowly evolves into an incredible bond. After 33 years of peace since his arrival, Zod finally finds the Kryptonian that slipped through his grasp. Clark is now left with a choice to either turn himself in or see the planet he's grown to call home completely decimated.<br /><br />As you witness the jaw dropping opening sequence of the destruction of Krypton, you can't help but imagine how massive the budget of this film must be ($225 million). The Kryptonian technology is even more alien than you're expecting and the massive destruction left in the aftermath of alien titans battling each other on a fragile planet is overwhelming. This is one visually dazzling film. The sound is also marvelous. The world engine makes your insides quake as every punch and every blow during each battle practically rocks your movie theater seat. Hans Zimmer's score is just as impressive as you've come to expect from the award winning composer and may be even better than the score for \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\"<br /><br />One of the things people disliked about \\"Superman Returns\\" was its lack of action. \\"Man of Steel\\" begins with Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon beating the holy hell out of one another and then is mostly quiet on the action front for a big chunk of the film. Then the last hour just hammers you down into the dirt and repeatedly rubs your face in it until the credits roll. Your goose bumps will have goose bumps. It's extraordinary.<br /><br />Henry Cavill is an extremely solid Superman, but you don't get to see much of him as the nerdy Clark Kent that works at the Daily Planet. That seems to be what really makes or breaks the actor in the role. Brandon Routh was criticized for attempting to mimic Christopher Reeve too much in \\"Superman Returns.\\" So when the sequel comes around, it'll be interesting to see how Cavill handles dual identities. Michael Shannon is freaking outstanding as Zod. The man just has so much passion and anger. Shannon steals every scene he's in and continuously delivers impeccable performances in everything he's a part of.<br /><br />There's at least a good hour where you're shown nothing but Superman's past, the jobs he's taken on as an adult, and are stuck learning his origin from Krypton, so impatient individuals may get antsy in the middle of the film since there's a pretty long gap in between action sequences at first. The film clocks in at just undertwo and a half hours, but if it feels long just know that it pays off. The camera work may be the deal breaker for you, as well.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Just great!  The first season has some very funny episodes and sets up the dynamic.  Would recommend it.  The 2nd season is funnier
B0064MPXFA|5.0|You cannot wait to see how the story unfolds.  It is highly addicting.  While the legal arguments are stretched - the show is still good.
B003TTCURU|5.0|This darn show is so addicting. It's super funny, has great characters and you can't stop watching after only one episode!
B004LPLU4K|4.0|It was one of those movies that a started to watch only because my wife anted to see it.<br /><br />I found that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I had wanted to read this book for soooooooooo long, But waited to buy it because I didn't want to pay full price. It took a little bit of patience for me to get into it because there were so many boring details the first little bit, but eventually I was sucked in. I loved the story line but was a little disappointed that it included &#34;sex scenes&#34;, granted they weren't super, extremely descriptive, it still bugged me, from the aspect of being a parent. I definitely wouldn't let my teenager read the book, she would have to be an adult, but that's just my opinion. Very good story though!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After my second reading of this book I don't know how anyone can not love Gideon more. Yes, he is far from perfect, except on the outside, but even with all his flaws and his tortured past you can't help but feel something for this man. I didn't expect this but Eva has grown up and is actually starting to move on with her life leaving the past behind and along the way is helping Gideon do the same. I loved this book because we are finally able to see this two settle down a bit with out too much drama. They are finding each other again and trying really hard not to let outside influences come between them. Now, Corinne really needs to go, PLEASE!! Let go Girl! The book left many, many things unanswered and I'm really hoping that the next two books resolve them. My only negative is how the book ended, I'm not a fan a cliffhangers! Now Sylvia on tho next, let's get the next book released PLEASE!!!!!
B003K15IF8|5.0|So cleanly wrought the storytelling almost falls away. You never get the sense Williams is showboating, even when you come across passages so beautiful they stop you in your tracks. A beautiful, beautiful book.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|Got this for free from android so at least I didn't put anything into it. A good concept but poorly handled. You end up running very fast (hence the title I know) but you run so fast so quickly that there is almost no margin for error. You end up having to memorize sections just to get through it. Add in the fact there are no power ups in the game and it becomes a frustrating game very quickly. There is a slow power up that actually really helps but you still need to make the jumps and it costs 99 cents for 5. So naturally they made the jumps near impossible so you would have to buy the slow-downs. They even have the nerve to ask you if you want to use one (even if you don't have one) every 3 deaths. I'll be deleting from my phone soon as there are better games worth my time out there
B008RJFRTK|5.0|Anything to make my way easier. I am very directional challenged.<br />Still learning how to use it. Once I get it I know it will make my calls much easier to find
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book is both hilarious and touching with the quirks of the main character. Loved it, can't put it down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is soooo fun. I would really recommend playing this game. It's hard but really awsome!! :D One Direction is AMAZAYN!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game if you like fun and this game will become challenging once you progress through the game. So if you like fun challenging games then you will absoulutely love Subway Suffers.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know this is getting bad reviews but this book does not disappoint. This picks up right where the second booked ended and pulls you right in to there love story again. I sucks to wait again for a 4th when I really think this could have ended but I can't wait for more drama to come of this crazy couple.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really cool I like to play it everyday its fun. 101 games should have everyone playing it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Visually a beautiful game; however some of the HOS were very dark and the objects did not respond to being chosen. A bit frustrating but a decent game overall.
0316174483|5.0|I love to give this book as gifts with a multicolor ink pad.  There are so many ideas and its perfect for rainy or cold days.  So imaginative!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Hosseini is a master story teller, there is no doubt about that, but this book did not take my heart with it as the other books did. I expected to read this book in one sitting as I did with the others. I expected the story to stay with me, to mull over in my mind etc, but I could put this book down for a few days and pick it up again without feeling any 'loss'. For ease of reference I made a list of all the characters because there are many of them. A good read nevertheless.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|The twists and turns in this series keeps you engaged.  Just when you think you know where things are headed, you get stumped again.
0316247545|5.0|Fantastic book to go with the show. great read, behind the scenes stories, tales from teh writers, concept artwork, and more! so happy a friend recommended this to me
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was an overall awesome book. The only reason I gave it stars is because I wish there was an actual story line and not just the interviews. I'm very interested in how the World War Z movie will relate to this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the zombie or even post apocalypse genre.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Excellent author.  Very enjoyable and most educational.  I never realized there was a Guernsey Island.  I love how people react well during very difficult and sad times,
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Not very challenging for adults until the much later levels.  Good and fun time sink if you're waiting at a restaurant or taking a dump.<br /><br />Runs quick with no hangups on an old Moto Droid 3...
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|As a parent, I liked the movie, cute plot and easy for the young ones to follow. Kept my 3.5 year old interested for about 45minutes...pretty good.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|This movie kept me laughing.  When I started laughing out loud in the first minute I knew I was in for a fun ride.  The birthing scene gave me laughter that shook my body to the core- especially the part about the female baby.<br /><br />I loved his ability to ridicule people and perspectives.  If you don't like it, I wonder if it is related to your religious or cultural background (this is Jewish humor).  Laughing at the absurdities of existence is really fun for me.
1416550534|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book club selection. It takes a little extra concentration due to flashbacks and expansive cast of characters so get a glass of wine or cup of tea and settle down in a quiet spot.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the book and I learned about a part of USA history and it was a riveting story about the orphans.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one, good reading for readers of all ages from the young to the old
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, it always thrills me. They just don't make these kind of movies any more.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Watched it again to get primed for the new Movie! Great effects, great acting, the characters pay tribute to their predecessors.
B002V6RB1C|2.0|Nothing is as good as it seems the first time you watch it. This time, it seemed to drag on forever.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|THIS WAS AN OUTSTANDING READ THAT REALLY SHOW THE MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LINCOLN.  GOODWIN KEEPS THE READER INVOVED WITH GRAPHIC DISCRIPTIONS AND DETAILS.
B003HN7BYA|5.0|I like this so much I bought it twice. First for me then for a friend. Now neither of out neighbors likes us.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|It was a good plot......and the ending was different from any other cop drama I've ever watched where the cop is the hero who gets to go home.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who thinks that they may be interested. Though I do think that the first season was better personally, I know a lot of people that liked this one more. The series is filled with many story lines that prevents the show from ever seeming to slow down without entirely overwhelming you with characters and information. The actors are great at adding a lot of depth to their characters and seem to be entirely sincere. A lot happens in each episode so it is definitely a show that needs to be watched chronologically, but it is great!
B00BF123WG|4.0|I like that it didn't focus on Obama and even slights him I little! If it would have focused more on how Bush had more to do with it than Obama, I would have left 5 starts
B00003CWN3|5.0|Worth to watch. The movie show the love between two girls. But the end part is not a happy ending.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Excellent puzzle game. Very easy to use. Beautiful pictures to choose from. I highly recommend this game for any one that likes jigsaw puzzles and has limited space or playful cats around..
0979019710|5.0|I am just getting started on the audio book but so far I am very impressed and<br />feel that there is a lot of useful information to be taken away from reading this<br />book and I look forward to finishing it and implementing what I'm learning.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Great, great,plot. Entertaining.A truly great role, I think Cruise could own if there are more sequels to follow. Yes, I said it, I want to see a sequel to this movie. And Tom better bring it!
B00BR476TG|3.0|The &#34;extended preview&#34; was just the first eleven minutes of the movie, not really what I was expecting but it was a beautifully made film so I highly recommend the movie, although, I do believe that the book was better!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Any thing with a luger and a M1 garand in one place is in my book a great place. It also has a sturmgher the first assault rifle made.
B002MC9H8K|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, written by Betty Smith and published in 1943, portrays a classic tale of a young girl's struggles as she comes to age. The young girl, Francie, encounters hardships besides the poverty of her family that she must overcome, including the death of her father, the hardships of education, and the competitiveness of the working field. Smith's novel shows the reader the different point of view of how hard it truly was to overcome the hardships in the 20th century as a young girl, from the early 1910s to later 1920s and 1930s.<br /> Smith's writing style is complementary to many readers across the world. The story is told in third person and focuses on the main character, Francie. Since the book is long, Smith cannot linger on the smallest details and writes in a quick, explanatory manner, such as in the lines, \\"Francie got on to the filing system very easily,\\" or  \\"Yes, Francie was the faster reader in the Bureau--and the poorest paid.\\" The book is an easy read, but is slightly longer than most novels. The book is broken up into four smaller books with multiple chapters. However, as soon as you start to read, you will be hooked and many readers will agree-- this book is not one to be put down. It is honest, it cuts to the heart, and while the bitterness of death and struggles is present, it reminds us to hope in the better future that lies ahead.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|Like the other five, Stallone doesn't cease to give a touching story along with a great fight. I would definitely suggest it.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|No you may not borrow my Movie, what are you going to do? Take my computer? Four more words required.
0671646788|5.0|Book showed up in great shape and am super excited to read it!! Thank you so much for a prompt delivery and job well done!!
0307346617|5.0|GREAT BOOK! So creative and descriptive to the point where you can see exactly what Brooks was trying to show you. The only unexpected part for me was that, rather than it being a story itself, it is a description composed of &#34;interviews&#34; from &#34;survivors.&#34; The interview format really worked for me though and I loved it! I recommend it highly!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|drag and g Hz duh mold Sven can Haydn by tux herb chief from Oct dad I ping ethic Feb zed Brown's magic said funny :)
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Well written, well paced and directed.  The cast was great and the way the script handled the relationships between the characters was gentle and humorous without being slow or mollycoddling.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Feedback on item I received:<br /><br />This item is exactly what I expected<br /><br />I am very pleased<br /><br />Thanks for providing this item
1932100385|1.0|Honestly this is too much of crap in this book. Its biased and continues its retoric chapter after chapter. It has been written witjh one purpose & one purpose alone. People need to find Campbell;s clinic and pay him thousands and get treaded damn scam !
0060763280|5.0|Holy cow!! Super excited the book showed up in brand new shape n even had the original cd n 2 tickets to his intensive in it!! Very impressed!!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This is a great app except for one major problem. For some reason it keeps removing itself from my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;. I've installed it four different times because it just disappears, would've given it five stars if it wasn't for the disappearing act.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I got hooked on this series within the first sentence!!!!! Riordan writes with great deal and link to the past!!!! Can't wait to start the next book!!!!!! =3D
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a free to play game, which means this game is completely free but!...you can't play for a long period. You eventually run out of resources and have to wait to continue playing, OR you can spend real money and keep going. In the very beginning you get about 30 minutes or more of game play through leveling up but eventually you hit a point where you have to wait for resources, luckily by this point you kind of want to put this game down...but it won't be long...this game is crazy addicting.
B000LX00RY|5.0|Love the role of Meryl Streep as the nasty woman. Also Emily Blunt as her assistant long suffering in more ways than one it is so funny and Stanley Tucchi just makes me laugh walking on screen
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching this show when it came out in summer of 2011 but fell behind after the first 3 episodes, so when I saw seasons one and two on amazon prime video I decided to get back into it. I didn't realize I would watch the entire first two seasons in a day! This show is great, I love the characters, especially pope, but they writers keep introducing new elements to the mythos that help the show stay fresh. In my opinion this show is far greater that the over popular post-apocalypse s how the walking dead, although that too is a good show.  Falling Skies is set in a world where an alien force has invaded earth and defeated the earth military leaving only small resistance groups to continue the fight against the alien invaders. Behind the shows set up is the story of main character Tom Mason and his struggle to keep his family together and safe while trying to fight for their future.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love it!  It is very easy to use and the sound is great!<br />Very easy for older people to use!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I'm not the biggest zombie or horror movie fan so this movies was perfect for me. I loved the main actor, Nicholas Hoult, he was brilliant in this. Not only did I find myself laughing continuously but I literally felt for him. And to be honest I almost cried a little (I'm a little bit of sucker when it comes to zombie love I guess lol)<br /><br />This is definitely a unique story and if you're like me than you'll be rooting for the corpses halfway through the movie. They really are kind of adorable (once you get passed them eating people :)) Also a great soundtrack too. Major plus!!
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|A great Bruce Willis film.  Love the use of special effects that make him look so young as his surrogate.
B007MJSYF0|1.0|It looks like it was filmed as a soap opera, and the acting is worse. Perhaps the novel or manga is good, but this was a cheap slasher flick that thought it was high art -- pretentious and boring.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I found this so heart warming to see a family reunited. And the absolute devastation was heart breaking so much taken form people with so little
1781162646|5.0|Let's cut to the chase, I loved this book. This is not one of those big, sprawling epic Stephen King books with loads of gore and an epic mythos (although SK does an awesome job when he writes those). This is a smaller story, a surprisingly sweet tale of a 21 year old kid with a broken heart & a summer job at a rickety 3rd-tier amusement park called Joyland. It's a wonderful tale filled with characters whose dialog and motivations ring true, a dark mystery at the heart of the park and just enough of a supernatural edge to keep you guessing and turning pages.<br /><br />This is a book for anyone whose had a first job, a first love, a broken heart and a mind that wonders if all we see in life is all there really is. There is no joy without sorrow, but there is far more joy than sorrow packed into these 283 pages. Stephen King can take you back to 1973 and a place called Joyland. Go to your bookstore and buy a ticket, it's a wonderful ride.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It  a good game that is way better than the 99 cent one. ps I got the 1,000 review by the way :)
B0016OMFO8|5.0|I love this group. They're upbeat and light and perk me up in my car as I drive a lot in LA traffic.
B001NA2NM4|5.0|Love the authenticity of the characters...this was filmed way before CG or Photoshop. Great story from a time long ago.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The best talent, music, and costumes I have ever seen on a stage. A truly great production. The Phantom is better than Michael Crawford.
0385349947|5.0|This book has really inspired me to get going with where I want to go in my career instead of waiting for &#34;them&#34; to notice what a great asset I am.  While not everything is applicable to my life, my kids are already grown so I don't have to figure out that juggling act, I found much of her advice very insightful and inspiring.  I have recommended this book to many of my friends.  If you are looking for a book to inspire you to get out of that &#34;rut&#34; and start taking smart &#34;risks&#34;, read the book!
0684824906|5.0|I borrowed an edition from a daughter, and my wife and I read it, in turn, at bedtime.  After that, the book was no longer in the condition in which I had borrowed it, so I bought this new book to return to my daughter..  .
B003XU02QG|3.0|Overall the movie is amusing with a few good action sciences that make it worthwhile for a sword flick fan like myself to watch. However, the story line starts out intriguing but fails to really hold you attention. The movie starts to go in a band of brothers/male bonding buddy direction which would have been interesting, but that is quickly snuffed. This is a movie for those who like sword flicks, have amazon prime (can watch for free) on an off night, e.g. a Tuesday. It is not a must see, but it was amusing enough to watch all the way through.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  It's certainly not what die-hard Ozians expect but it's almost better for it.  I had read the books and was hoping for something similar, but this, while not meeting my expectations, was enjoyable because of that same reason.  It kept me guessing and by the point where Oz met Evanora I had to break out my phone and look up who was going to be evil, because I couldn't wait.  Fantastic!  Also, loved the throwbacks to the original movie, from the horses of a different color (in the field just after Oz fixes China Girl's leg) to the Tinkers (who in the books created Tin Man and Tick-Tok) and the scarecrows!<br /><br />For kids, this movie has everything, animals, dolls, pretty costumes, action and adventure, romance, and fireworks!  It's pretty epic, in this watcher's opinion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice to be able to get a weather forecast for my immediate area of residence. Very nice interface and easy to read the layout.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I can not stop playing this game. What great fun. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to play it,<br />and now I`m hooked.Try it there is nothing to lose.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's an awsome game for horse lovers also the game has realistic stuff like competitions and feed and all kinds of good and awsome stuff
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|the movie is ok, i liked the quest for the ring series move than this movie.<br />the 3d was ok, but, it did not have the effects as good as life of pi.<br />if you want to see the movie, go for it, but see it on dvd, or blu ray. the 3d not worth the extra bucks.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|This movie is such a gem. I still watch it today and enjoy the suspense and action. It's my favorite out of the four series of films.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love this show! It's creepy and dark, and Mads Mikkleson is the perfect Hannibal. The people eating is a bit gross, but sickly funny.
0446576220|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It's an honest account of an individual who has gone through life, made mistakes and continues to improve himself. Tony (the author) doesn't try to cast himself as this perfect person, though he has experienced a lot of success in a traditional sense. For those of you who are skimmers, the back of this book provides some really valuable information regarding the chase for happiness.
1449382673|5.0|I stumbled across this title several times before I decided to buy it as I have a huge collection of books I haven't finished reading.<br /><br />But this has been a different experience altogether.<br />It's actually hard to put down.  Like a great novel.<br /><br />The &#34;Head First&#34; approach is very conversational which I have found really engaging.<br />It does jump straight in, so would possibly be a big challenge for the first time programmer.<br />I'm coming to Python from several other scripting and web oriented languages.<br />I'm finding Python definitely meets my needs - being cross-platform, and extremely fast to get working code up and running.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and will look out for &#34;Head First&#34; in the future as I love the approach.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Haven't listened to Boz in many years. Played this CD and I feel at home. He's fabulous, as always! Great sound, great Boz!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome third book in the Cross saga, and I can't wait for the fourth book, please write fast Sylvia Day.
B008Y73940|3.0|Decent movie but tired of Matthew Mc's annoyingly arrogant character acting. Movie is suspenseful and does a pretty good  job keeping with the book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We stumbled on an episode of Downton Abbey on our local PBS station. It was so good we purchased the first and second seasons to get the whole story; then got season 3 when it came out. The house and furnishings are from an existing home in England and they depict a vastly different era both in economic and social rules. Between the Family and the Servants there are great plot-lines; Maggie Smith's character is especially quirky and so funny in her deadpan delivery. I highly recommend this series.
0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries has really turned in a masterpiece with a heavily refined process he calls the lean start up. To create a system for innovation is brilliant, and that's just what is done in this book. All theories have been tried and tested, mistakes have been made and aspiring entrepreneurs can fly off the mark at a head start. Practical, thought-provoking and useful. Go out and read this book!
B0006J28L4|5.0|I had watched this movie a few times before but I ordered it so I could watch it again whenever I wanted to.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|A great plot at a nice pace. A very satisfying ending that always keeps you excited about what comes next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ohhh it's a good no great game ohhh it's amazing ohhh I get addicted to this game ohhh  I recommend this game to anyone who wants ohhh if you want to play a fun game download this app ohhh ;)
B005PK57NU|5.0|they continue to put unexpected twist and turns in the seasons, that keep you coming back....would highly recommend this seris.
1401937519|5.0|I could not put this one down. Anita Moorjani gets right to part that I as reader want to know about right away. It was great that what she experience was not just in the last few chapters and how it had changed her life..
0321704452|5.0|Very useful read for anyone looking to make an impact public speaking. Useful tips on how to connect with the audience and practical methods to improve your speech from a-z.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Great love scenes, but the story was lacking....kept feeling like maybe something was building and then nothing would happen. Sad......
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Everyone should read it.  Really gives one food for thought and I might say change as well.  It actually happened.
006114665X|5.0|This was ordered for a friend of mine and he has started to read it.  He is really pleased.  We have been friends for many years and he would be and is very frank about his likes and dislikes.  I'll read it when he is finished.
0307352153|4.0|As an introvert, it's good to know that I'm as important as I always thought! Someone has to listen to the talkers or there'd be no point talking.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I would have rated it higher if they took the time and put out some Mac drivers. I have a 27&#34; Imac. If Logitech continues to ignore Macs I will have to go towards RAZER.... THEY HAVE MAC DRIVERS......
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis does such a fine acting job as Lincoln that I thought I was watching the real Abraham Lincoln.  The film is too long in my opinion.  Once a film gets beyond 1 1/2 hours I think we either have an editing problem or an ego problem at the production level.  This is why I only give the film a 4 star rating despite the spectacular performance of Day-Lewis.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Amazing movie especially knowing it was a true story; it pulled you right into it from the minute the Tsunami struck. Not overly acted. You will not be disappointed to add this to your collection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this little Calculator Plus. So user friendly. I am pretty electronics \\"challenged\\" but this is so easy to use, even I understand it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|i thought the book was very good. i did start to loose a little interest midway through the book. the interview style was pretty cool and the detail he went into was great. How they effected the different cultures and things you would not think about like zombies still on the bottom of the sea.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Classic Sci-fi.  Look around the set; Laptop? Tablet? Robot? Automatic doors? Things we take for granted today . As well as the entire discussion of ego and id controlling our actions and emotions. I seriously doubt though that an Earl Holliman's alcoholic cook in blue jeans would be part of an interplanetary crew. Leslie Neilsen was actually tolerable in his starring role. The daughter showing up in skimpy clothing was also a bit over the top in the believability factor. Overall, this is a film I want in my library. 5 stars for certain.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|We were surprised by how good Barbara Streisand was in this comedy role.  She and Seth Rogan were very funny together.  This is a film that will be especially appreciated by parents of grown children.  I noticed that my wife, a mother of three adult children, laughed the most and the hardest.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|In the Season 6 finale of DEXTER, it's clear that Dexter's world will never be the same. Deb witnessed Dexter's killing of Travis Marshall, the Doomsday Killer. His sister now knows she has to deal with his disturbing secret. She can arrest him or cover up his crimes. Her choices become the meat of Season 7.<br /><br />The writers dig deep into Dexter's psyche and what makes him tick. This season has many plot twists and a jaw-opening finale that will leave fans stunned. All rules of love, honesty and decency are broken in Season 7. Dexter is wavering from the clear \\"Code\\" that his adoptive father created for him...a code that lets a serial killer keep murdering but with his conscience intact. Harry is long dead but he appears at Dexter's side as his conscience and voice of reason. Now that Deb knows that her dear, sweet brother is a killer, nothing can be the same. How will they protect their secret?<br /><br />New and fascinating characters are added this season. Ray Stevenson guest stars as Isaac Sirko - the head of a Ukrainian mob running drugs out of a strip club in Miami.  Stevenson is perfect as the ruggedly handsome and diabolically ruthless Sirko. Soon Sirko is out to kill Dexter who is out to kill Sirko before Sirko and Dexter join forces. Sound confusing? Just follow along. Somehow the writers make it all work.  The writers turn murderous Sirko becomes almost a sympathetic and likeable character when the tables are turned and his life is in danger. Let's not forget to mention that sleazy Detective Quinn falls for one the Russian strippers working in the club.<br /><br />Added to the mix, is the gorgeous Yvonne Strahovski as Hannah McKay. As a teenager, she was involved with a serial killer, but she was just an innocent victim....or was she? Dexter is faced with a moral dilemma as he falls deeply in love with the only person who can truly understand him. Strahovski is an absolute knock-out in both looks and deception. What a perfect match for Dexter. He uncovers her secrets and she knows only Hannah will ever truly understand them. Two twisted minds are bound by some unseen force and both Dexter and Hannah know there can be no happily ever after to their story.<br /><br />Things are worse than ever at Miami Metro. Items disappear from the evidence room and killers go free. Investigations that are getting to close to the truth are quelched. Are there any honest cops in Miami Metro? Someone is going to pay a price for all these unsavory shenanigans. LaGuerta finally comes to bat as revealing evidence comes her way. She closes in on Dexter. She's sure the Bay Harbor Killer is still alive and that detective Doakes was framed all those years ago. The question that begs an answer is why does LaGuerta keep the evidence to herself and only tells Debra?<br /><br />Jennifer Carpenter as foul-mouthed Debra Morgan has plugged along through the years as the annoying police officer turned lieutenant who now has the power to quelch investigations that could jeopardize Dexter's secret. Her character has grown and expanded and is much more pivotal than ever before. She has to protect Dexter from the police and from his new love Hannah. Carpenter's emotional scene in the finale is heart-wrenching and so believable that there is no better acting on TV. Kudos to Jennifer Carpenter for finally being able to delve into her character.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Season 7 of DEXTER is like no other. Dexter seems to go deeper and deeper into his madness. His rigid code is going be broken. He is willing to plant evidence to frame innocent people. The code is expanded to allow for the killing of anyone, no matter how innocent, if they stand in the way of Dexter, Debra or Hannah's safety. Anyone is free game now. All of this leads to the most shocking and unnerving cliff-hanger finale. Dexter and Debra's worlds are spiraling out of control. Can the final Season 8 put all the pieces together?

B00170KA0C|3.0|I felt disappointed with the film.  I was disappointed in the Julia Roberts' character.  Shi got involved with the wrong guy.  Also, I think the film could have done a better job at its message or chose a different message.  See more at [...].
B008OOYALE|3.0|When I first started playing this game it was fun and entertaining. But it has quickly gotten boring as stuff cost too much and it's a pain to get more money.  Has standard controls for a farmville type game... glad it's a free app, which is why it got 3 stars and not 2.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The trailers for this film don't do it justice.  It is a wonderful, charming, magical film that should not be missed.
B007T99ENE|3.0|McEwan inhabits the skin of a 23 year-old female MI5 agent (well, at least a junior desk-bound officer) circa the 1970s, and the story is ostensibly about how Serena Frome becomes part of the covert intelligence operation targeting the literary arena for a propagandist agenda, and becomes emotionally embroiled with her assigned target, postgrad tutor cum budding writer Tom Haley, referred by the more (pretentious?) literary-sounding T.H. Haley. However, with a trademark sleight of hand that the author's readers have grown accustomed to, McEwan manages to lift his story above what could potentially have become a run-of-the-mill script about a beautiful spy who falls in love with the enemy. While not giving too much away, it is enough to say that McEwan embeds his story with metafiction which displaces the narrative, and the reader's interest in other literary works is stoked by the more-than-passing references to them, not least by Serena's voracious appetite for fiction.<br /><br />Larger issues of literature for propaganda are set against historical background and addressed alongside Serena's more personal struggles with young adulthood, family, and her budding sexuality and tempestuous relationships with men. Without a doubt, McEwan has a firm grasp of time and place, and he speaks with an authentic young female voice that betrays none of the awkwardness seen in some works by older authors who try to speak in a younger and/or contemporary voice. Perhaps setting the story in a decade that is close to the author's youth played a part (though he did equally well with Atonement and that was set in an earlier time).<br /><br />However, a few crucial elements in the novel failed to match the writing (McEwan's prose is always a joy to read, safe for some awkward intimate scenes). It was important to keep reminding the reader that Serena was pretty, because, I suspect, there was very little much else to attract the reader to the character. She felt colourless to me, perhaps a little frivolous, and the moments of self-deprecation she exhibited betrayed a vain self-centredness that another character observes of her, which undermined much of the sympathy for her when some surprising truths are uncovered about the way she was treated. Spongy details about her distant clergyman father and messed-up sister felt like hasty titbits assembled in a character sketch, and did little to shape Serena's character more. And finally, the denouement felt overly long yet contracted, which while delivering the punch one expects from a McEwan novel, came across a little too neat and tidy.
B00BT0ZS52|2.0|This 3 Hour movie I thought almost ended 3 times.  Alot of hopping around, it had a good story line but couldn't continue to hold my interest.  Tom Hanks was excellent in his many roles especially the beginning with the introduction of what the movie concept was.  It was just to long for me.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Simple but adaquate for my kindle,  would recommend to anyone that is look for a case for a kindle fire
B0002IQEHI|1.0|this movie did not work right  for me  ended up having to have it refunded to to the fact would only play partly for me
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I had a hard time getting into this book, definitely wasn't one of those I couldn't put down. It could have reached the point much earlier on and the ending wasn't the best. Okay read if you like listening to lawyer types.
B000U6BT40|5.0|It's a cute show with nice special effects. You'll like the characters. Similar type of show to warehouse 13 on you like that type of show.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|I was really having goose bumps with this movie.  It's hard to give a review without being a Spoiler Alert.  The little girls that were in the movie did a fantastic job, they really made you care for them and about them.  The special effects of the &#34;MaMa&#34; I thought ruined the movie's hole premise (Hollywood...) our own imagination could have done better than what was done.  I still really liked the movie, the little girls carried the movie and made you want to help them.  I would recommend to watch if you just love to spook shows.
0345529057|5.0|The TV show got me hooked on the books. This is a great starter set and the books are bound very nicely.

1451695195|4.0|A 'must read' if you are the slightest curious about near death or life after life.<br />Proof of Heaven is the true story of Neurosurgeon, Dr. Eben Alexander's  near death experience while in a coma from bacterial meningitis. Dr. Alexander writes his story to include scientific theory and facts as he tries to explain his journey. His new-found knowledge changes his life and belief system and adds to his gift as a healer.  After experiencing a NDE myself, I had no trouble understanding what the author tries so hard to convey. He uses very easy to understand analogies to paint pictures of exactly what he experienced. His use of medical and scientific terms is not a problem for the reader as he always defines those in layman's terms. Dr. Alexander's hope that his true story will help many to no longer fear death and understand \\"who\\" we each really are is refreshing. May many lives be affected by this book!

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great movie good to know how the saga began and besides that it was a awesome it had it all comedy action drama etc
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is awesome it's like a battlefield for your tablet. If you are a fan of first person shooters this game is for you.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I put off watching this show for a while because I am not usually a big fan of legal shows. I also thought it would be a bit slow in watching the drama of husband and wife. I absolutely love this show now!
0307476073|2.0|This book is an oddity -- a quick read but a long slog at the same time. At 7/8 of the way through, I'm still waiting for something  to happen -- but I fear it will just be more of Cheryl creating one minimalist fake drama after another as she hikes along -- all of them amounting to really not much more than a (largely solitary) walk in the woods. There's a bear! Blow your whistle & it runs away. There's a bull charging me. Blow your whistle & it runs away! There's no water on a blistering hot day but she is somehow able to down two+ bottles of filthy muck through her pump, pop in a few iodine tablets and quench her thirst completely with no consequences. Oh and then there is an elfin woman with her Red River Valley-singing five year old charge & lama in tow,  coming around the bend. After a while, the book becomes repetitive and forced -- the stories set up to create a narrative arc where there really isn't much of one. The author insists on hiking alone to deal with \\"all she's done and all that's been done to her,\\" but frankly, she seems to learn nothing at all in the process. I don't see her changing much as the trail winds on. She never explains why she leaves a husband whom she loves and who loves her. Perhaps the best (and maybe only) insight we really gain into Cheryl's motivation to hike the trail alone is her absolute and utter sense of detachment from genuine intimacy. I don't know about others, but early on I became annoyed with the author and read on only only because I too, was once, an avid backpacker along parts of the PCT and it was the trail that won my heart, not Cheryl.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I already knew a lot of what was shown,  but watching this movie sort of made me feel getter for the choices I make when feeding my family.<br />I only wish more people cared about what went into their food and how the animals were treated.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I will be honest, the story started kind of slow,  it dragged and the characters were hard to understand. But along the way the story kind of started to pick up, the characters started to get interesting and the story unfolded from there. The only downside is that the characters lack reality. What I mean is that they don't feel real. You have a hero who defends himself from a bad guy and the rest of the story. But the freshness of the story is well worth the little disappointments. Good Read!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|THE GAME IA LIKE CALL OF DUTY FOR THE KINDLE. ITS SO BOSS! GET IT GET IT GET IT. ITS AO AWESOME!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Anyone who remembers WWII this is a must read. To those who do not this book will take you back in time to a crucial time in world history, a great read !
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A completely messed up couple make it work for them.<br /><br />A little too involved in other people's problems (they have enough of their own!) but a great read.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Before I even read the book I read some of the reviews and I  was scared to read the book. So I read it anyways. I thought overall the book was awesome. I think both Eva and Gideon learned about each other and grew as a couple. They still got a lot to deal and learn to do. The only thing that killed the entire book was the plain ending. I wished she would of left some thrill to the story to keep me anxious and waiting for the next book
B00BC24NT4|5.0|On the cover of A Delicate Truth, Gibraltar looms like the vast bulk of reality weighing down on the idealism and sense of duty that preoccupy the novel's protagonist, as they do in so many of the works of John Le Carre. Gibraltar itself does play a key role here as the site of an incident that brings together a motley cast of hapless souls: the upstanding senior officer and the bent but bumbling junior Minister he answers to; the Minister's fast-track Private Secretary and his jaded mentor; the upper-crust opportunist, his right-wing American bedfellows, and the British Special Forces soldiers made pawns in their machinations. This unlikely assortment of 21st century humanity is thrown together in what can most fairly be described as one glorious clusterf***.<br /><br />The incident in question is a joint UK-US anti-terrorism operation in Gibraltar engineered under the tightest secrecy by the Minister and his shady partner-in-crime, financed by Texas-based evangelical Christian activists, and executed under cover of darkness by a combined force of handpicked British Special Forces and mercenaries in the employ of a mysterious American defense contractor. Our hero, Toby Bell, Private Secretary to the Minister but kept in the dark by him, learns that the whole thing went south. As the story slowly emerges when Toby is compelled to follow the breadcrumbs to the truth, he is thrown together with the now-retired diplomat who was attached to the mission and the diplomat's daughter, a comely physician ministering to the poor in London's East End. Toby's rush to the truth through the minefields of institutionalized compromise is fraught with mystery, terror, pain, suspense, and the inklings of romance. Yes, A Delicate Truth is, in fact, one glorious tale, proof that John Le Carre at 81 still writes with the extraordinary skill he treated us to in the 1960s.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is awesome. If you fully like online multiplayer games then you will like this game. I have played this game every day since I got it. I highly recommend this game. Good graphics, good controls, good everything!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Product was everything it said it would be but I prefer a case that my kindle can slide into instead of one that it just snaps into. Nothing wrong with it, I just wanted more.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|These are the Publishers Hardcover Editions, not a book club reprint. Beautiful quality, everything I had hoped to get. Now, the next mission is to go to Santa Fe and see if I can arrange through friends in the motion picture industry to have George R. R. Martin sign them for me. A great addition to my library.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This was a fun game to play for a while until it started crashing and hasn't worked since.  This app needs a lot of work to keep it from crashing.  All that time wasted.

B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|i rented this movie today because it had excellent review and it was horrible. i didn't like it. i would not recommend this to anyone
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|so for all the buyers, just make sure you understand this is a 3D and digital copy only.  For me I like the most for what I buy and to pay close to 40.00 for a 3d copy only is a terrible buy so make sure you have a 3d bluray player and 3d tv cause it wont play otherwsie.  I have a 5 year old and 2 year old who I typically hand over the standard copy to them for their movie collection in their bedroom.  p.s. I am still working on getting the digital copy to download which hasnt worked after 3 tries.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I reAlly enjoyed this gAme but if you r going to to play then make houses first as otherwise you will run out out of money. Also you can survive without buying anything
B00127RAJY|4.0|My friend got me started on this video. She gave me rave reviews of the program so I figured I would give it a shot. I'm on day 6 and I've already noticed an improvement in my stamina. I'm dreading going up to Level 2 because I know it's going to be difficult but I'm looking forward to the challenge. One negative I have for this video is that Jillian Michaels gets really annoying after a while and she's a bit snide at times. I can't really see a huge change yet but I'm only on day 6 and I'm hoping that I see results by day 20. I would recommend this video. Beginners can learn a lot, just pay attention and don't do the moves if you can't do them without being safe. It's super easy to screw up your knees with these workouts so be careful.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works with the north american 3ds XL! only game I have so far that uses it is KH3D, so yeah.
B00BBQXQFI|1.0|I rented this movie and wreck it walph and they where both boring. I amso glad I only paid 2.64 for both.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|Beautiful story of unyielding love and passion with the grim horror of fate. Slight deviations from the book but honors it tastefully.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I like the character... never watched it on prime time, but like that I can watch it when I want.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There is a reason this won Best Picture in 2013.  It's the best movie I've seen in years.  Nail biting and gripping from start to finish, even though you know how it will end.
B00AO7HN8Q|4.0|The vinyl looks awesome. Sounds awesome and if your into listening or collecting then I recommend you pick up this and as many of the Iron Maiden re-masters you can find and even some of the newer albums.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|Great reading. Could not put book down. Another great book by Sophie kinsella. It was very comical in a lot of parts of the book. Giggling material.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Came across this group on Songza and Pandora stations and love the energy to the music; great first album with lots of hit tracks.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great series. Wonderful saga of two different lifestyles.  Told with tenderness and caring. I highly recommend this show. I was sad to see it finished.
1594204217|5.0|This is my favorite Pollan book to date.  He explains what happens to food when we prepare and cook it, provides a history of various cooking methods and relates amusing anecdotes about the various characters and food artists who have devoted their lives to perfecting their crafts.  I am inspired to expand my repertoire and try out some of these techniques.  Anyone who has dabbled in cooking at all will enjoy this book.
B00AO7HMVO|4.0|I know a lot of American Maiden fans aren't really into this album but it is a classic, sounds great a must have. This is one of my favorite albums and it's a concept album. the Vinyl is a packaged awesome. I love the picture disc and the jacket. Takes me back to my youth.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I love Clapton, but this was by FAR and away the WORST collection of songs he has ever put into public.<br /><br />However, I got the best price around and I will be buying from this supplier again in the future. The shipping was fast and fair priced.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I usually love big sweeping historical fiction but somehow I just couldn't like any of the characters. Long passages of historical description of battles were not necessary and just seemed to be there to add bulk. I was looking forward to having three big books to get into but I'm not even going to get the second one.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Excellent new sci-fi with a wonderful follow on to some of the best old sci-fi.  What a great and unexpected story line.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It gives a much more accurate account of the battery condition than the normal Kindle icon.  It works and it's OK
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Lots of fun. Well worth the money!<br /> Lots of interesting twists and turns<br />Anxious for the next one<br />Bring on the fun
B00005QDW5|5.0|You have to love Pink Floyd, and if you don't, you don't have a pulse!. Great mix of older Pink over the years.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|It wasToo disjointed and disappointing. I was expecting much more with the quality stars involved. I would not recommend it to my friends.
B007REV4YI|5.0|As a long time Bond fan, I think this is one of the best.  Dark, real, intense.  Daniel Craig is doing a great job.
B00BZB1ME6|5.0|The Karate Kid is one of the all time classic 80s movies. Not only does it have a great story of a young man moving from the east coast to southern California, but it also teaches many important lessons about respect for yourself and others.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie was spectacular and so much fun to watch if you ask me. Just like the timeless classic The Wizard of Oz, you get lost in it. It's def a prequel to the wizard of oz, showing how the wizard came to be and they did it good and oh, that James Franco is marvelous. Perfect for the part and the rest of the cast was set wonderfully. There are def funny moments and it is a great family flick too. I just hope the children today see the first one bf seeing this. Oh and I loved that there aren't musical numbers through out the film. I'm not big on musicals except fr of course the original wizard of oz. definitely with renting and even buying.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We love the characters, and especially the fact that we don't feel like we need to scrub our souls after watching an episode.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|We love this dark, silly John Cusack comedy.  Whenever we want to listen to a great soundtrack and laugh hysterically, we pull this one out.  Our 14 year old boys watched it with us recently and also loved it...of course they would (if you have teenagers you will understand!).
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Although Jack Reacher  is 6' 5&#34; 240 lbs. in the book series, I believe that Tom pulled it off. Although the book went into more detail in places you get the feeling that this is the main crust of the book. Would like to see a series of these books. Good acting, script, direction and what can you find wrong with Rosemund Pike as the woman who wants more but..........
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I chose this ap because it is convenient, accurate, easy to access and extremely reliable. I have recommended it to my family and friends.

B000AP04FG|4.0|You can see why these two actors hooked up. The chemistry even on DVD is there. A little slow at times but when it kicks off......it really kicks into gear.
B008V8FVTI|4.0|A book, although is fiction, I know friends who have been incarcerated, and told be that these  sexual abuses go on in juvenile detention facilities.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's definitely a page turner. I couldn't put it down.... read for 8 hrs straight once! I just didn't want it to stop and I'd love to read Christian's version.
B008IZYWXU|4.0|Plenty of different versions to listen to. Excellent orchestral composition and good sound separation on two track. Would have been even better in a SACD version.
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|with the recent news of government  spying, Google, Facebook, Amazon  and all the tracking going on with computers on the internet, this will someday be true. How it is really used in the future will be the question. good acting, photography and script
0802473156|5.0|Insightful book.  My boyfriend and I read it and then read it together and took the quiz at the back together.  We discovered things about ourselves that we did not know.  We're engaged now - won't give the book total credit, but it's surely good to know where you stand and how to communicate with one another.  Gave my son and his new wife a copy - they loved it too!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great special effects; storyline; cast.  Every episode puts you on the egde of your seat and keeps you there.  Did I mention great special effects?
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I have never written a review before but I have to say that the 12th book in the series does not let you down!!<br /><br />I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this book for a year now and Nalini Singh certainly delivered. As a fan of the changelings, I was initially skeptical as to whether a book on Kaleb would keep me entertained. Boy was I wrong!! This may be one of the best yet and it seems as though it will only get better. You see a side of Kaleb that you would never have guessed existed, such a complex character with many faces. I love the direction of the series and can't wait to get my hands on the next one. If only they would be released faster!!<br /><br />If you haven't read the series, I know 12 books is a little daunting but it is certainly worth every penny. This has got to be one of the most intricate, well written series out there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Though not a real life story (as far as I know,) Downton Abbey's characters represent real life problems, relationships, challenges of a wonderful epoch. Your intelligence will not be insulted by surreal characters or Hollywood absurdity.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Like this movie very much. Will use it and the book it was based on as a teaching tool in college class this summer.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo blitz. I play it everyday. I don't like the instability I get sometimes but, I really love playing it. I also love the tournament..it's challenging when you play all four cards with no distractions.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app is very helpful, and very useful!!<br /><br />You should totally consider getting it if you use calculators on a daily basis, or if you just need a calculator every so often.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It really does do the book justice for the most part, yes there are a few things that are cut out but overall I love the film and the casting choices.

B008Q00BOQ|2.0|I was looking for an action-packed movie, but this ended up being a boring movie with many unrealistic events.  Every 5 minutes, someone would have on a mask pretending to be someone else.
B008XG1X18|5.0|GET THIS APP IF YOU LOVE LOOKING FOR RECIPES, FASHION, HEALTH, BEAUTY, ect.<br />BEST APP EVER IF YOU LOVE BEING CREATIVE AND WANT NEW STUFF TO TRY OUT!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A beautifully crafted book, every page was a pleasure and as well written as all the others.  After reading this book, it is difficult to focus on another book and it raises the benchmark so high, nothing seems to quite match up.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Even though it is extremely unrealistic, it's a very compelling and interesting presentation of characters.  The acting is convincing and I find the story line intriguing. What will the writers THINK up next???
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed the whole experience of watching Downton Abbey.  The  cinematography, the acting, the time period, and the story line.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this case for a year, and my phone has survived innumerable drops. And a toddler. Plus, I cut out scrapbook paper for the back to customize it when I want a new look.<br /><br />The edges of the case can catch on the screen protector, so just be careful when putting the case on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is the type of game that I could play all day. I play this game whenever I get bored. I LOVE it.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Too violent.  Could not finish the book.  Many people recommended this book, but it was not one that I would recommend to anyone.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Better than ever! No commercials. I remember these from TV! Columbo always gets his man, but always takes his man by surprise!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Didn't get to see it in theaters, but totally worth buying. Action packed and pretty funny. I like Jeremy Renner anyway, though, so I could be bias.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I love Black Sabbath.  Remember when the first album came out.  This is up there at the top of the list.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is clearly well made and has an amazing feel to it you get team fortress two feel for the game and just can`t put it down and the online and training are really well made.
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|Really cute kids game if it would come up on Kindle Fire Hd.  System won't let me pull it up.
B008220BLG|5.0|I really liked seeing this movie in theaters. Still a good movie the second time around. I think it ended up being perfect for my husband and I because he's into zombie things (video games, movies, books etc.) and I don't mind a little blood, guts, and gore every once in a while, but they kicked it back a little with the love story which was nice. First zombie movie I didn't mind watching that also didn't leave me with nightmares.
B008CRC506|5.0|I really do not watch much television but I got hooked on this series the first year.  The music is really good ( I bought the soundtrack too ).  The second season was just as good with the music and always the drama that was unexpected. Not sure there will be more to come but I sure did enjoy two seasons of this well put together tv production.  I will also get the DVD for the second season, they are worth watching and listening to.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has written another winner!  I have read all 3 of his books, and find this one every bit as absorbing as 'The Kite Runner&#34;.  I am amazed by  his talent of bringing his reader into the lives and emotions of his characters.  I can't wait for his next book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|fun but not exciting. card moves are not as smooth as they could be and it's hard to undo a move.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I think Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelson are perfect together. Problem is I am falling for Hannibal!!! Ha!! Both are extremely fascinating to watch. Hoping Alana and Will get together. Mikkelson has a way of making you very conflicted. I feel sorry for him, yet I know he is a horrible creature.  I have re-watched the entire season, so far 3 times!!!!! So happy it was renewed. Beautifully filmed!!! Well written.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|The Kindle is still not charging properly. I have to hold the connector in just the right way for the charge to begin. Sometimes I have to plug and unplug a number of times before the green charging bar appears on the screen. Just have to be very patient with the unit. I used to be able to just plug in and the charge would begin. That is not so anymore. Thanks for trying to help. Perhaps the connection inside the Kindle is faulty
B00BTHV05M|5.0|It's an amazing album. Every OneRepublic album is an amazing album though. I think each one of their albums has it's own personality, and this one gives me motivation.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I like this movie, but it sure does tell it like it is. Overall it was a sad movie. Denzel Washington was great, as usual. I would give it five stars, but I do not want to watch it again.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|This trilogy is keeping my attention. I am almost done with #3, I have enjoyed them all and recommend them.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|really enjoyed this book, i don't usually like these stories but I found myself not able to put it down & I will definately be reading more by this author
B005LAIGTG|5.0|The Vow was a truly remarkable film. Hidden just below the surface of The Vow is a hint of a woman (Paige) in conflict, conflict seemingly centered on her father's unfaithfullness & how that clashes with the perfect world she's always known. In truth, however, one can see that Paige's father's affair really had nothing to do with her growing steadily away from the world provided for for her. Paige's husband finds himself in both her before & after memory-loss realities. The fact that Paige & her husband find their emotional ways back to each other is a rare glimps of how proverbial chemistry plays such an influencilal role in love. Great movie!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx. Nevertheless, he performed well in this movie. Like many Tarantino movies, this movie did stretch believability a bit. A bit too much shooting blood, good acting, some decent action, a bit too pat at the end and the one character I really liked was killed...
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This was a JUST HAVE TO PURCHASE!! Just a wonderful set!! It was in perfect condition and I love it!!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This is one of those books for me that changed how I see the world. I have always been so careful, so afraid of change and my life has been constricted as a result. This book helped me understand the role votilaty has in the world. As all great books, this draws from lessons in the past and maybe the most antifragile being that we can learn from, Mother Nature. Read and learn how to gain from disorder.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia had me feeling what Major Lawrence was feeling as he endeavered to help Arabians battle both the Ottomon Empire & British colonization efforts. The film showcases the original Arab Rising as one where various tribes com together to fend off a probable hidden British agenda by running the Turks out of their lands, all while remaining friendly but firm with the English. Though the film is long (nearly 4 hours) with much time spent watching Lawrence & Arabs march through the dessert, one can't help but come away from the film feeling the struggles as Lawrence did.
B004YOEFG8|4.0|Amazing 3D!  Incredible pictures and a story that we all need to hear. To think that NASA almost let it die, shows us how lucky we were to have a champion spokeswoman who won!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been listening to this album for the past several weeks and feel that this is right up there with their best.  I have all 19 studio albums plus the first live album.  I have had several of these songs stuck in my head.  I have awoken in the morning with either the Anarchist, Carnies, Headlong Flight, Wreckers or Wish Them Well playing on the flash drive embedded in my brain.  The only way to stop it is to get in the car and \\"upload\\" something else during the drive to work.  Typically other Rush songs!  Gearing up to see them at Jones Beach on June 23rd and then at SPAC on June 25th!  I want to hear this collection LIVE!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had become hooked on this show when it first aired years ago. For whatever reason, it kept moving days and times and I lost track of it. Now, via Amazon, I can go back to the beginning and watch/enjoy it all over again. I am just finishing up with season 2, and it's only getting better and better. Fantastic writing and character development. Margolies is fabulous as the main character.<br /><br />Pamela Olson<br />Citrus Heights, Ca.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|These two movies are among my favorite of all time. Here Quentin Tarantino shows why is the master of masters. Would have loved to see a third movie in the series, perhaps 20 years after she kills Bill.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|Excellent movie! I was completely under Marilyn's spell like the characters in this film. I have watched it three times and smiled my way through
0393345084|1.0|Anyone giving this book more than one star needs to have their heads examined.  Don't waste your time and money reading anything in this book.  If you REALLY want to understand how to get out of this depression, go listen or read books by Peter Schiff.
B0073QNIH6|5.0|I bought several Schleich dinosaurs as a birthday gift.  I hid the dinosaurs in the bedroom area, and the grankids had a dinosaur safari, hunting for dinosaurs with a flashlight and a net.  I enjoyed playing with dinosaurs, (the toy type) when I was a kid.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This was a slow moving story line in my opinion. Unfortunately for me I couldn't stay awake through it and had to restart it a few times. I was not entertained.
1611761565|4.0|Enjoyed the story.  Tells some small details about life in the Seals.  Can't understand why the gov would be so worried.  Don't believe anything was revealed that would compromise the Special Forces program.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a game that makes you think and requires some good timing.<br />It is not timed but the object of the game is to get the candy into the critters mouth or he makes the most pitiful face at you.<br />Sometimes it requires strategy to obtain the goal for that level and other times it's all in the timing on when to cut the rope.<br />Very cute game, non-violent, kid friendly except for the idea of how much candy this critter eats(every level has the same piece of candy).
B00865P3AS|5.0|This is a fun album.  Lots of rock grit, special effects on the cellos and these 2Cellos have got technique to burn.  I love hearing really well trained musicians let loose and get creative.  My personal favorite though is Il Libro dell'amore with the Italian singer.  That is a sweet tune.  Check out the creative video too when you have a minute.<br /><br />My students love these guys.  Now they all want to play a stringed instrument.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This was a let down of a movie. I was not entertained. It was an unfortunate waste of money on my part
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is amazing especially since the update came out it has buckets-eggs-spawn eggs-milk-cake and more all they need is wolf's
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Amazing Classic!!!  Kids and dad liked it also.  Great family movie in a world of mostly junk.  Worth the cost.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great app. Provides simple and accurate info on your power status. Easy to use. A no brainer. Plus you can't beat the price.
B00BF11STU|3.0|It was somewhat slow but the anticipation of comeing to the climatic end kept me watching and for this I give it three stars.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Honestly I only read it because the transition of Mr. Grey is what interest me other than that all the sex stuff i skip reading because it boring and repetitive. Over all a decent book to read.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Great story but could have done without the F bomb every other word.  Would LOVE filter options on Amazon streaming.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|just as good as the others, just as addictive. If you like the others you will like this one. keep them coming and ill keep playing
B004SDEP38|4.0|It works as advertised.  I've used the Documents To Go app since it was used on the Palm TX (back around 2000 or so).  Just follow the instructions and it does what it says it will do.
B00340ESIS|4.0|I wouldn't follow this like a bible.  The advice will produce a great formula.  However, it does bring up lots of great food for thought when it comes to understanding structure and plotting.  You should probably still just read Joseph Campbell, however.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|As an ambient piece it works OK, but as far as a fully-developed score that can stand alone, it doesn't. Lots of atmospherics, but I get no sense of development or momentum (massed drums pounding in unison does not equal the latter). Little in the way of melody, and only one theme I could detect in my first four or five spins through the disc.<br /><br />And no heroic theme. Now, I know the fashion these days is to make our superheroes all angsty and what-not, but this is Superman, for cryin' out loud. He doesn't have doubts. He kicks it and takes names, and stands for truth, justice, and the American way. Avoiding a rehash of John Williams doesn't mean you can't give the big guy a fanfare of his own.<br /><br />Kind of wish they'd given this one to Desplat. He showed in the last two Harry Potter films that he could work in the wake of JW without being intimidated.<br /><br />PS the Z+ is pretty useless. Would rather they had included a link to a real 5.1 download for the computer, that could then be burned to a disc or played through a proper sound system. Lossless would be nice, though even a lossy DTS or DD would have made me happy. Faux surround to be played through earbuds on your phone? Gimmick. (took nearly an hour to DL as well).
B003YL4LYI|4.0|As usual Mr.Martin delivered.I am waiting patiently for the next book.The only thing that I don't like would be that book four and five had so many stories going that certain characters were either non existent or barely there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well Done!  More inclusive than the movie. and even with the remarkable actors in the movie considered, the author does a fantastic job with the story line and the problems of mental illness and the adjustments of those afflicted when returning to society.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Being a runner I just love to read this book. It motivates me and gets me up early in the morning to tackle any challenge. The only part of the book that I did not like was when it promotes barefoot running too much and also slams Nike . The book would have been even better without this part.
B006YC74E8|2.0|Not what I had in mind for a photo editing app.  I thought it was going to be easy to work with, but it turned out to be harder than I had expected.  I don't know if you would benefit from it or not, so take this review with a grain of salt.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Ok there seems to be a lot of fuss over this little App, so I'll just add my two cents worth...First, I'm using my Fire HD and this works well for me. Before I installed this app I just had ...and still have a little picture of a battery in the top corner, well I use my Kindle for more than reading and these things equal battery usage. So I like the fact that NOW, I know how much juice and hours I have throughout the day. And as I read and write reviews plus this-that-and the other ....this App is a joy to have. Now I know that many if you have your plus and minuses for having or installing it, but let's face it people...it is what it is. For some it was free and others for a fee, but remember you have options.Plus it always helps to read ahead...It's like the saying know before you go...read why before you buy!

B003XTKMBC|5.0|When I got the statue I  couldn't wait to set it up. The box was bent and a little damage which was disappointing but I didn't buy it for the box. Once put on display, this is by far my favorite statue in my collection. Awesome detail and the face detail is incredible. Looking forward to getting more Kotobukiya products in the future.

The sex is incredible and makes you root for them on every page just to see them connect again and again. I can't wait for number 4, hurry please!!!!!
B00BESCJII|1.0|We were really excited to watch this movie and then could barely get through it.  It was over acted and a cliche paradise.  Emma Watson was horrible.  From her facial expressions, body language, and just plain bad acting.  The only perk was the ending when something real happened.  Up until then, this movie was pathetic.  No where near The Breakfast Club, Reality Bites, Say Anything, etc...It tried to be.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a love story, a touching story of a friendship that awakens the spirit of a crippled man who &#34;has everything&#34;but didn't realize that he was not letting himself have what he really needs until he gives an impoverished but spirited young man the opportunity find his own dignity as a fellow human being.
B009EEOM7K|5.0|An amazing story of the human subconscious in its yearning to break free from confinements of how one identifies self.  So much to where the mind creates alternative egos or realities.  This is a true example of existential struggles against all that we are force fed to be and the failures of never learning to let go of the material.  Violent in its stages of resolution, the rebirth he experiences is best understood by the abrupt transition from his apartment to the abandoned house.  The concept behind the spacemonkeys is like an exaggeration of our own selves as we exist each day.  Brilliant film, brilliant book.
B00498XRPE|5.0|I love this movie. It's a close second to Aliens. I think practically anyone would enjoy watching this movie,  especially women. Considering the genre, it is refreshing that there is both a strong female lead and an adorable cat in the movie.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|surprisingly good governator action flick. I was pleasantly surprised. Arnold still has some life on his fastball, but he needs to choose scripts carefully. this one worked.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Vultures have been circling the lumbering mega-budget production of World War Z almost since the film went into pre-production. First, fans of Max Brook's highly-regarded novel were up in arms when it emerged that the book's multiplicity of survivors' tales was to be distilled into a star vehicle for Pitt. Then news leaked of multiple drafts from various writers being rejected (the film has writing credits for four different scribes). Early trailers were ill received. It emerged that the entire last act of the film (an epic battle sequence) had been junked and fanboy kryptonite Lindelof brought in to write an entirely new ending.<br /><br />With the mood on the blogosphere toxic, the trades and mainstream press piled in as the smell of blood in the water grew stronger. Paramount eventually stopped even pretending the film was not troubled, allowing Vanity Fair to publish an astonishing account of the difficult production - further increasing speculation that this was a $200 million dollar plus vanity project for Pitt and his production company, Plan B.<br /><br />Now World War Z has finally arrived,and if the narrative behind its making is as compelling as that of any of 2013's blockbusters, the unexpected twist ending is the year's most shocking. Spoiler... the movie is good. In fact, it's not just good - it's great.<br /><br />Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former investigator for the United Nations living with his family in cheerfully chaotic domestic bliss, economically sketched out in an opening breakfast scene that is almost the only moment of calm for the next 100-odd minutes - save that the TV in the kitchen is running disturbing news footage of social disorder breaking out in locations across the world. Driving his family into the city, Gerry gets stuck in traffic gridlock and BOOM! All hell breaks loose as the whole world goes to s***in what seems like five minutes flat and director Forster slams the pedal to the metal for the first of many stunning action sequences.<br /><br />The subsequent globe-trotting story has Lane is drafted back into service for the United Nations to search for the source of the \\"zombie\\" plague that within days has brought the world to the brink of apocalypse. The pace is blistering, honestly comparable to Gareth Evans' The Raid, and the scale is as epic as hundreds of millions of dollars can provide. What makes World War Z really work is humanity of its characters. Pitt himself is at the heart of this. To make a film like this commercially viable, it had to have a major star. But Lane is no superman (or Superman). He isn't James Bond, Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt - in fact, he spends most of the film running away from stuff. Pitt really sells the notion that Lane is a common man in extraordinarily uncommon circumstances, motivated by love of his family to put himself ridiculously in harm's way. I struggle to come up with another male star of his stature that could have pulled this part off.<br /><br />Pitt is in every scene, but around him are a rapidly-changing collection of characters who join only for sections of the narrative. However by canny international casting characters who often have mere minutes of screen time register memorably. Especially good are Enos (from TV's Big Love and the US version of The Killing) as Lane's wife, and Israeli actress Daniella Kertesz (in a nearly dialogue free role). Nowhere is it more clear that the film has been substantially shaped in the editing room, than from the fact that the highly-billed Fox is essentially a blink-and-you'll-miss-him featured extra. Before remarking on Forster's skills remember that when Terrence Malick does this, he's called a genius.<br /><br />Where the film really scores is that despite the fact that it is a \\"zombie\\" movie (and unusually one where the reason characters use that term is because they have seen zombie movies), the environments and human characters feel real and convincing. The action has a gritty verite feel while never being less than spectacular. While the threat is fantastical, like Romero's best zombie films World War Z takes place in a convincing world - in this case a distinctly post 9/11 one. One sequence in particular is sure to inspire debate over the presence or not of a geo-political subtext, but I'll leave that for you to discover.<br /><br />World War Z is also often very frightening; despite the lack of gore, this is an extremely intense film and one which parents should be very careful about bringing children to. At the time of writing no BBFC certificate had been announced, but it has received a PG-13 in the US - meaning a 12A is quite possible. This is absolutely not a movie for under-12s, and if you take them, prepare for sleepless nights.<br /><br />The breakneck pace and sheer shock-and-awe of the film's scale paper over a few cracks. What exactly makes Pitt's character the UN's go-to guy is never exactly made clear, and some of the plot mechanics that propel the story from one part of the globe to the next don't quite hold up to intense scrutiny. However, in my view, one would really have to be committed to not having a good time to find these elements overly troubling. This is widescreen filmmaking at its best.<br /><br />World War Z is a compelling reminder that for every troubled production that produces a Bonfire of the Vanities or Island of Dr. Moreau, there is Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, or Blade Runner. I'm not putting WWZ quite in that category - only time will tell - but against all the odds, this is the best blockbuster yet seen in the 2013.ver being less than spectacular.

159463176X|2.0|I sorely regret having recommended this book prematurely to my book club. Like so many other reviewers have said, the first half was enjoyable and had my full attention. I believed in the story, the characters and settled in for a great read. But by midway something tragic began happening in his writing. You know you're in trouble with a book when you dread having to pick it up again. Even so, a stickler for finishing what I start, I trudged on, trusting he would eventually bring it around and deliver a punch. Wrong! If I had to do it over again, stickler or no, I wouldn't finish it. Better yet, I wouldn't start it! Gives me a terrible headache just thinking about it.

B008JFUPK8|4.0|Everyone knows the Superman story, it's one that's seemingly burned into the subconscious from birth. So clearly and definitively rendered was this comic tale in Christopher Reeve's 1978 blockbuster that the last filmmaker to tackle the character (X-Men's Bryan Singer) lifted its iconography wholesale for 2006 misfire Superman Returns.<br /><br />That film was hamstrung by nostalgia and left audiences nonplussed, so the latest big-screen version is understandably a clean break from the past with Dark Knight duo Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer hatching a story to re-invent DC Comics' flagship hero.<br /><br />Man of Steel begins on Krypton as Lara (Ayelet Zurer) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) welcome the planet's first natural birth in centuries. Their people, once ambitious intergalactic explorers, genetically engineer newborns to serve in pre-determined roles. With the planet's natural resources exhausted and Krypton in its final days, Jor-El rockets his son to safety as military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) stages a last-minute coup with designs on purifying the race and starting over. He's banished to the Phantom Zone, but only after vowing to find Kal-El.<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder then makes a daring cut from Kal's plummeting rocket to a fishing trawler carrying a bearded Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), wandering the globe looking to help those in need. In a neat structural trick similar to the one employed in Batman Begins, we flash back to see a younger Clark struggling through adolescence due to his nascent superpowers. In the present day, a spaceship buried deep in the Arctic Circle points Clark in the direction of his destiny, while also putting him on a collision course with a Zod hellbent on resurrecting his obliterated homeworld.<br /><br />Whereas previous films have used Lois Lane (here gamely played by Amy Adams) as a key emotional crutch for Superman, here the emphasis is on fathers and sons, the push-pull between Kryptonian and human heritage and Clark's desire for belonging and acceptance.<br /><br />Screenwriter Goyer cleverly plays out this thematic thread between Clark, the Kents and Jor-El ('alive' as an echo of his preserved consciousness), while also keeping it a key component to Zod's masterplan (and thus a way to conjure up jaw-dropping spectacle).<br /><br />Snyder's instincts as an action director quickly come to the fore as he marshals skirmishes on Krypton, a huge-scale battle in Smallville and a Metropolis smack-about that sends Superman and Zod careening through skyscrapers. With the latest digital tools at its disposal, Man of Steel is easily the most exhilarating and arresting interpretation of Superman yet. When Cavill's predecessors took flight it all seemed so leisurely. Here, his lift-offs are positively supersonic.<br /><br />The Brit actor cuts an impressive figure both in and out of the red and blue. He tackles the role without a trace of irony,meaning he's in keeping with the straight-arrow seriousness of the film but perhaps lacking the immediate charm of Reeve's Superman. When it comes to sheer physicality, though, he's far more dynamic and intimidating than any of his predecessors. Snyder and co have gone to great lengths to ditch the boy scout label.<br /><br />Man of Steel's supporting players, a veritable who's who of A-list talent, are all excellent in their limited screen time. Daily Planet chief Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) acts as a nice counterweight to Lois's early eagerness to expose Clark's anonymous do-goodery, while Shannon is chilling in his dogged commitment to duty.<br /><br />Costner and Crowe both crucially find emotional poignancy as the guiding lights who help Clark on his way to greatness. They're helped in part by a great score by Hans Zimmer, who hits upon a motif that can be tinkled quietly on the piano or blasted out by an orchestra.<br /><br />Impressive as all this is, Man of Steel is not quite the perfect movie. Snyder's deployment of handheld camerawork works to create an intimacy between viewer and action, but this aesthetic jars horrendously with the 3D conversion (see in 2D if you can). Character loses focus in favor of action in the final third and there are also shades of Clark's character that go unexplored (for instance his split identity and deeper relationship with Lois). These threads are left tantalisingly open for a sequel, though. The foundations are firmly in place for what could be exciting further adventures of Superman.d camerawork works to create an intimacy between viewer and action, but this aesthetic jars horrendously with the 3D conversion (see in 2D if you can).

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|very good game. wonderful story that pulls u in and makes u want yo play. good cast of caraters<br /> loved it
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Made more so by Chris Kyle's death.  I recommend it,  might be a good read for your son or daughter thinking about enlisting
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal has serial crimes just like criminal minds. It also<br />adds an element of psychology that is very different than<br />any other show. Highly recommend this series.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like the game overall.If I had one wish it would be you would not have to  start over after every crash but it is still a fun game.
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun but gets boring after a while. took me a while to figure out how to tell pricing. but it is fun.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Characters are compelling, well thought out plots and subplots, and just enjoyable storyline.  Love it!  I love Maggie Smith.....great one liners!  Nice for the family to watch with a little history thrown in.
B005ETA5K2|3.0|06/13/13 I used this network adapter quite successfully for eight months, but then it crapped out. This is the second unit I've purchased with a similar result. It's great while it's working, but equipment life is limited, probably due to the heat it produces. These units might benefit from an internal fan much like a 12V power inverter has.<br /><br />08/12/13 I purchased this adaptor from DBROTH and contacted them through Amazon regarding my issues with the product. They immediately responded, sending me an RMA number. I sent the unit back in and today I received a replacement. The folks at DBROTH rock! Buy from DBROTH!
B001PP9ALY|5.0|I just a man. Yes, I will go to the gutter in this case...or maybe I'm just addicted to powerful self-assured women in film.
020530902X|5.0|This book is about style of writing. You won't find ANY inane lifeless nonsense rules like &#34;don't split infinitives&#34; (a red herring itself). That said, I suppose another flattering review is superfluous -- Strunk would disapprove -- but this book's rating is a half star below five! I have been writing in one capacity or another my entire life and cannot think of a single volume as fundamentally influential as Strunk. I have had a copy since high school, though I couldn't tell you where it is now; not that it matters, I've committed it to heart. By providing the table of contents, Amazon[.com] has essentially given you the book save its illustrative examples -- that's how tight it is, and yes the examples are worth having. Perhaps the somewhat militant author could have slipped &#34;please&#34; in here or there, but that would violate rule 13, &#34;Omit needless words.&#34; Strunk doesn't want you to write better to please him, he saying if you're serious about your work you'll allow your assumptions to be challenged; and if you look closely you will recognize a compassion between the words, a committment to teach not browbeat. This book is nearly a century old and will be relevant in a century more, barring some sort of natural calamity, nuclear war, or extraterrestrial invasion. If you like, preview an old edition in the public domain at Bartleby.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|As TBBT enters its golden years as a television series, it has grown and deepened in some lovely ways. The addition of Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik to the cast as regulars back in Season 4 was a stroke of genius -- a much-needed dose of estrogen and some girl-brains to offset Penny's dumb-as-dirt bit. The balancing act works in reverse, too: Kaley Cuoco's Penny has some of her best scenes when she's introducing her science-y besties to, say, the concept of an eyelash curler. Or shocking them with her sexual exploits (&#34;It's a joke! Based on real-life experiences...&#34;) and incipient alcoholism (drinking an entire bottle of alcohol during a girls' night get-together). Another reason to love The Girls of TBBT: Bernadette has done wonders for Howard, using her wit and wiles to teach him that being a man means much more than being in a constant amorous state. It means being responsible about money, showing up for friends, and running an orderly household.<br /><br />Which brings me to the &#34;but&#34; part of my review. I have three &#34;buts&#34;:<br /><br />1. Why is it that TBBT writers will always, always go for the gross and disgusting? My partner and I most often watch the show during dinner -- perhaps not the best choice considering that if one of Bernadette's experiments is going to have a side effect, you just know it's going to be icky. Listening to Sheldon describe to the dry cleaner just why his couch cushion needed cleaning after Howard sat on it naked (&#34;The Parking Lot Escalation&#34;) almost ruined a lovely spaghetti dinner. In fact, my partner and I have created a TBBT drinking game -- taking a drink every time one of the characters says something gross and/or gratuitous. If we drank actual alcohol we'd be Penny-wasted by the end of most episodes.<br /><br />2. We love Sheldon. But why do the writers turn him into SUCH a jerk far too often? Using Amy as a human shield (&#34;The Closet Reconfiguration&#34;) was way out of line, even for Sheldon. It's one thing for our Top Nerd to be a bad and clueless boyfriend, but when he crosses over into demeaning and humiliating behavior, he's edging into the land of the verbally abusive. Not cool. And not entertaining.<br /><br />3. Raj needs to stop needing alcohol to talk to women. I'm hoping that the addition of Kate Micucci to the cast in the form of Raj's equally-socially-awkward new girl friend (as in, friend who is a girl, as -- at least at this point in my Season 6 viewing -- they have not officially hooked up) will stop the need-a-flask gimmick once and for all. Kunal Nayyar is a talented comic actor but even he stopped making that &#34;joke&#34; fresh and new several seasons ago.<br /><br />So -- Three Buts and a Yay. I love this show. I always have and I always will. But my deep affection doesn't keep me from wincing and squirming through about 20% of the writers' choices. I honestly don't know who the show's target audience is. I'm sure I skew much older than the desired demographic but I don't think that's the problem. I like edgy, I can even appreciate a dose of outrageous here and there. But gratuitous gross-outs have never done much for me as entertainment fodder. We viewers, like Amy Farrah Fowler, deserve better.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|i am really not sure what else am i suppose to say... this is a classic movie and everybody should watch it... duh
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like not knowing what is going to happen next.  Will she and Will or maybe Kalinda?  What possibilities... Diane has the perfect storm...beautiful, smart, powerful, in charge of all she surveys, except her own love life.
B0084670FU|2.0|I could not get thru the first fifteen minutes of this movie. It was boring and the setting was not somewhere I would ever want to be. I just found it a total waste of my time despite the appearance of Brad Pitt. I might not have given it a chance since I turned it off after a very short time.It was just not my kind of entertainment.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Exciting, cried & wished for a different ending, but I still loved it … wish we could read more book about Sookie
B005PK57IK|5.0|Very believable actors/actresses.  I worked as a paralegal and law office administrator for 20 years.  I know that cases don't settle nearly as quickly as portrayed in this show, people don't hunt you down at private affairs to review evidence, and everybody isn't brilliant.  Even still, the cast does a phenomenal job with the script they've been given.  It astounds me how many of the women on this show wear 5 inch heels on a daily basis.  Their poor feet.  When I worked in the city we kept our nice heels under our desk for meetings, and changed into more comfortable shoes for simply walking around the office.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|It's official...bold, powerful, self-assured, independent just make a film.  I will also have to include Emma Thompson in &#34;Much Ado About Nothing&#34; in this mix.
193700788X|1.0|I know the author is tired of this series, but it deserved a proper triangle, angst, thoughtful choices and an ending reflective of Sookie's journey in life.  It would have been better if the last book was written years from now if the author could have written it with enthusiasm and creativity.<br /><br />Instead of some companion book that is coming out this fall THAT NO ONE WILL BUY, write another ending.  Make this book a dream  -- do something.  I will never purchase another Charlaine Harris book again otherwise. I urge anyone who has not already bought this book to not waste your time.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What can I say? loved the movie can't wait to see Despicable Me 2 when it comes out in theaters
B005PK57NU|5.0|It is a great show. Alicia is fantastic. I can't wait for the next season to be in prime, please hurry!
B0095P29EG|5.0|Such a great movie with great visual affects.  Crisp and clear.  Thoroughly enjoyed.  So much so that we have watched it repeatedly.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Continuing with the same cast of the previous 7 seasons, the funny story lines explore relationships & how they work.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Loved &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and expected more. Could have done without the poems.  The story never came together enough for me to care abot the characters. The first third of the book was was a chore and I only kept reading with the hopes it would get better.
0321525655|5.0|This book really helped me nail Down what is important when I deisng my presentations, and I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A little bit violent but a good and fast moving story line I would recommend this book for someone who likes action
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|This coming of age tale is truly inspired. I recommend EVERYONE watch it at least once...especially with an adolescent you care about.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This sitcom is bad ass! Its funny as hell! I will be getting all seasons! Plus it came extra quick and came in excellent condition!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Wether we are sitting next to each or across the country, I love playing this game with my family. We have always played Yahtzee so this was a familiar friend;)
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Great to see a 73 year old making it again.  Can you wear out a CD?  I'm certainly giving this one a workout.  I bought 2 CD's in error of the same CD and gave one to a friend who is now enjoying the music.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Never gave it a chance before, but a co-worker said he really liked it....so I gave the series an hour of my time.  Ended up watching the entire first season in one Sunday!  Spread the second season over the following week...just in time for season 3 to begin!  It really is an entertaining series.
B002361MLA|5.0|Everybody needs to read this book and put its teachings into practice.  The world would be a much more harmonious place for all human beings and animals alike.  I am going to read this book again and again!!  Highly recommend it and looking forward to reading Eckhart Tolle's other books.
1616551631|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moY94FPOJOBW8E]]Capcom and DONTNOD Entertainment have created quite a surreal dystopian world in the game Remember Me.<br /><br />That world comes in the form of 2084 Neo-Paris. Parts of the city are now populated with cool sleek skyscrapers. Elsewhere, the city feels more gritty and weary. The art direction for the game is wonderful. The sci-fi elements are nicely laid over a city that still retain the beautiful architecture. It's still Paris, it just looks and feels so different.<br /><br />The art book is 184 pages, hardcover. Publisher Dark Horse has used thick low gloss paper. The reproduction quality is terrific.<br /><br />About half of the book is filled with amazing environment art of the Neo-Paris. They explore the alleyways, streets, slums and interiors. The designs looks great, believable and moody. Many of these are painted to the level of detail that you typically get from photographs. It's astonishing. Every illustration wants you to spend time to study, to absorb what you've just seen. Most are printed at half page. Every one that's printed small will have you wishing it to be bigger.<br /><br />The other half is packed with character designs. Mainly humans. There are only a handful of sketches, the rest are all painted in detail. There's a good amount of writeup for every page with the exception when the art goes two pages.<br /><br />I've to list out the artists for their incredible work. They are Aleksi Briclot, Michel Koch, Frederic Augis, Gary Jamroz-Palma, Gregory Z. Szucs, Paul Chadeisson, Edouard Caplain, Alexis Smadja-Fellous, Bastien Ramisse, Regis Capotosto, Yan Le Gall and Cristian Buliarca.<br /><br />This is an excellent video game art book. And this is the first game for DONTNOD Entertainment. More please.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who likes art.<br /><br />Easily one of the best art books for 2013.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B009P0U7H2|4.0|The Particle at the End of the Universe is a good read for any well-informed layman interested in physics, and the &#34;fuzz about the Higgs boson&#34; in particular. The book explains in broad terms how the Higgs mechanism fits in the Standard Model, and how the Large Hydronic Collider is used to detect the signature Higgs boson.<br /><br />The start of the book - maybe the first half - seems very journalistic and at times assumes too little advance understanding by the reader. But just when this would start to irritate a little, Carroll dives into explaining symmetry braking and the history of the Electroweak force and the Higgs mechanism. And even when explained in lay men's terms, and explained by Carroll, this is tough stuff to grasp, and requires multiple reads and long walks-with-the-dogs to ponder.<br /><br />All in all a very good read, and a nice and important contribution to explaining that science is as poetry of the Universe, and thus defines who we are.
B004G6009U|5.0|This is a great movie. Its always a joy to watch animated films . Mandy Moore stars as Rapunzel and she does a great job. Then we have Zachary Levi as Flynn or Eugene Ryder, he did a fine job. Next we have Donna Murphy as Gothel the evil witch. The main cast and other supporting cast all were great. The story is similar in note to the fairy tale Rapunzel, but Disney did a noticeably impressive job adding musical numbers and their own elements to the story as a whole. To describe Tangled in a whole sentence, I would say: It has the Charm of The Little Mermaid and Anastasia, The freedom of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and even a little bit of the adventure of some of the Shrek movies. That alone should let you know that it IS a good movie.<br />Tangled is a well thought up, interesting take on the classic tale of Rapunzel. I consider it to be enjoyable for the whole family.<br /><br />5 stars
B008Y73940|5.0|This movie has a good story line and it touch on reality. I enjoyed watching it because it caused me to contemplate the next move of each character.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is so CUTE!! Love the scenery, love the characters, just love it. The money can take a while to earn, but it's worth it.
0316223239|4.0|Raw: the best description of my mental state after suffering through the most violent emotional roller-coaster of a story I've ever encountered. Room drags its reader through every conceivable emotion as young Jack narrates his and his mother's tale of captivity in a soundproof garden shed. Room is all Jack knows since his mother was kidnapped and held there for seven years and he was born there, right on Rug, five years ago.<br /><br />Such a serious story narrated by a five year old could have easily become silly and off-putting. But somehow Emma Donoghue not only makes it work but the already harrowing tale becomes even more disturbing when told in Jack's innocent voice.<br /><br />While every part of Room demands some emotion from its readers, it is not all dark and hopeless. Jack is smart, and well-adjusted, his relationship with his Ma is beautiful, and he and his mother's spirit and bravery are inspiring. This is an incredible tale for all readers, but prepare yourself for an intense emotional journey filled with the highest of highs and lowest of lows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Notch came up with the best idea ever!!! A world where you can do whatever you want is just plane AWESOME!!!!!! Though I do wish Apple will make more updates quicker. But anyway, THIS GAME IS PURE AWESOME YOU MUST GET IT NNNNNOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I haven't used it yet. When I attempted to do so I was stumped as to how it works. Games are something I have to play around with for a while until I become familiar with them. I will keep trying to figure this one out.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I thought this was a good app for the price being charged. It is basically what you get when you first boot up your computer. The only game it offers is Klondike. This is OK. You can while away many hours playing it but it isn't going to knock your socks off. Also you could probably find other solitaire games for free that offer a wider selection.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've gained a while new appreciation for the art of writing by reading this book. It most certainly lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest works of fiction. Sometimes tedious, but well worth your patience.
B0040JCJOC|5.0|Two Step, Crash Into Me, Tripp'in Billies, Proudest Monkey are awesome...the rest are just great and good.  Man this album is still great after almost 20 years  who woulda thought?
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album is perfect the rulers of the underworld are back. I am especially glad I bought the deluxe version (even more Sabbath to love) I can't say anything bad about the album, Tony's riffs are amazing and the whole band is too. 5 star album for sure.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Not as big into eBay as i used to be but it works like a charm hands down.  I probably should get on there more often...oh where does the time go lol
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great read - I couldn't put it down 'til the end, and despite its futuristic setting it's not an unfathomable possibility for our future. One thing that I couldn't shake off though was that the supposedly strongest relationship in the novel, that of Valentine and Ender, was, for me, not very well established in the beginning. I couldn't feel the depth of their relationship as much as it was implied. Regardless, I liked the book enough that I read every sequel Card's written, all which I thought were equally as engaging but pulls more at one's moral and philosophical quandaries.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|The GlobalSat BU-353 works as advertised. No hassle, easy installation, and it works perfectly with a variety of different applications that require a COM GPS port.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poor prose and poor characterization. Storyline is somewhat monotonous but the author puts effort in describing specific scenes. Overall it is a mediocre read.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|When I read the book as a child it sparked my imagination.  As an adult I was very surprised to find a whole new meaning hidden that I never seen before. As a child I remember a boy who began seeing things as we would. In his community people seen things in &#34;black and white&#34;. They also were assigned jobs instead of being able to choose what they wanted.  I recently found there are many schools that have banned this book from their libraries...what a shame.  I don't think any book should ever be banned. Maybe not required reading but never banned.  Anyways worth every penny time and time again!
B0035KGWR2|5.0|Fell in love with her music after a trip to Scotland last year.  Now she is my favorite artist.  Glad to be able to find this on Amazon.
B0027MJU00|3.0|then this one will be fine.  The author describes things well, giving the reader a good mental image, not only of visual things, but also feelings and atmosphere. Although Dark Places was not as good as Gone Girl, I would recommend it to people who enjoy her other books.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I love to read the Jack Reacher series, and the movie seemed to stay true to his character in the books.  Originally I thought Tom Cruise was a poor choice for this character.  Not strong enough or tall enough but he did a good job.  I liked the movie.
B006F8HZYK|1.0|Unless I mssied something, when I clicked on the 99 cent Kindle edition of \\"Strunk and White\\" I got sent to the original Strunk book. I really wanted Strunk and Whitel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The book is beautiful writing and always a good tale from the author.  Recommend for better than beach book reading.  If you have not read his prior books recommend them highly too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I coudnt get it on xbox so I got the lite one on my phone and I love it and I am 7years old
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|People say he didn't look like 007 because of his gruff exterior, but I liked it a lot and think he's great.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|Watch this just to see how good Christoph Waltz really is. He makes the movie. Without him it would not be nearly as good.
0385737955|5.0|I've said many times that I like to come late to the party. This will probably remain true forever, in that I like to wait until a series is finished (if at all possible) before starting it. Also I'm always afraid books won't live up to the hype and that makes me read them with an overly critical eye and then I'm just rude about it. So I wait, let the dust settle, let everyone else to forget about it while the movie is in production, and read it with no opinion.<br /><br />Usually, luckily, the books end up like this one and are way better than I anticipated.<br /><br />I mean, the fact that there is almost no romance in this book is enough to distinguish it from the tons of dystopian young adult books that have recently started flooding the market. So is the point of view being told from a boy unique.<br /><br />But I think the reason I liked it so much was the way the story unfolds slowly. From the very beginning, both the reader AND the character don't know what's going on. You're not getting bits and pieces of the shape the world is in like in say The Hunger Games. There's no point of reference, nothing except what is currently happening to the character in that moment.<br /><br />In my opinion, having no point of reference makes each moment infinitely more tense. There's no telling what will happen, you have no real way to make assumptions about how the story will go because you're given so little information. Every single page is a surprise, which in a world full of formulaic books is a breath of the freshest air.<br /><br />Ambiguity is another trait I wasn't expecting in this book. At first, the main character Thomas seems like the hero-type, brave but rash, naive yet quick on his feet. But by the end, your opinion of him is completely different. There's something in him that you know FROM THE BEGINNING that is wrong, that makes him kind of a bad guy, but HE doesn't know what it is, so you forget about it. When you DO learn what it is, it doesn't erase all the good he's done but it certainly changes your perspective. This happens several times, and I think it's so much more realistic to show characters who are both good and evil rather than just 100% hero.<br /><br />The ending is a crazy cliff hanger, but knowing I don't have to wait for the next book makes that ok.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I have played hours of this game it is so fun and its free I would pay 20 fillers for this game
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've been in a huge funk mood lately and this album is a throw back to those times, some of the songs caught me by surprise but all of them give you that old time feel when music was breaking into new forms. Great buy, another home run for the Daft Punk collection
B0043WDK2G|5.0|We love this show.  The writing is good and the characters are very likable.  Can't wait for Castle and Beckett to get together.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was so excited when I learned Hosseini's new book was being published.  But,it was not nearly as good as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.  New characters being introduced so frequently made it difficult to determine where they fit in the story.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game, awesome way to spend time. I recommend this to every one.if you get it send me an ally request.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Pretty fun to play and best of all it is free! Cannot see why anyone would not get this game.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Very dark.  I found the story dull and slow.  I would not recommend this to anyone,  the pain of watch was hard to take.
0802473156|5.0|This book really helped my fiance and I understand why we were going through a rough patch.  We had stopped speaking each others' Love Language!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It is amazing ! You can take a boring photo and make it to a amazing extraordinary photo u can share
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Albetit, disturbing and real at the same time.  As one that knows the issues with a mental disorder (PTSD & TBI) I know the struggles with family and friends...well done!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Worth the praise the movie received.  We watched it with our 12 year old his friend. The kid and adults were captivated and talked about it after viewing.  See it!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Just enough drama to keep the story going, unlike most of the other TV shows.  I personally am not into a high level of drama.<br /><br />Each episode had good volume of action and story highlights to keep me coming back to each episode.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really Fun game, recommend for anyone who loves horses or horse games. Only wish some of the activities would not take so long to complete
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The historical references accompanied with the classiest ways to assert one self (Grannie) and strategize for the family members well being, makes me long for a time where even the most uncomfortable feelings are eloquently communicated.<br />Beautiful imagery and tons of plot twists. I hope y you enjoy it as much as we did :)
B00B5HQL50|4.0|The movie is better than reviews indicated.  Watchable, entertaining, action-packed, forgettable.  Worth the price on Amazon, but probably not theater prices.
B00CRMWMZ0|1.0|Even the samples are unlistenable garbage. Auto-tuned, computer-generated, talentless garbage. Some of the money that went into marketing this pollution should have been used for voice lessons.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Ok...the movie is worth seeing but has none of the iconic sayings made famous by you know who. Still, it was worth watching and was entertaining.  Maybe the modern special effects compensate for the lack of memorable lines? You'll have to decide that for yourself.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its very very very fun qnd addicting  like dragon story  hate how slow it takes to gain the  money though  wish they would change
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The series is unnecessarily being drawn out. The story line is now sub-par. Book three should have been the end of the trilogy and instead we got a filler book. I feel I wasted my money on this purchase. I would not recommend purchasing this book. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|The Highlander is a novel set in the ancient Aztec world. It is about two young men from opposing tribes, Kuini and Coyotl, who accidentally meet and become friends. Coming from different backgrounds and social statuses, the two learn and share with each other. When Kuini finds himself in Coyotl's noble world, he finds danger at every corner, especially when Kuini meets his Coyotl's sister who is forced into an unwanted marriage as part of a deal struck with a rival leader.<br /><br />From pyramids, to temples, to palaces, this novel is rich in historical detail. Excellent, easy to read prose and an intriguing storyline kept me hooked to the very end. There were plenty of conflicts hampering the lives of all the well-drawn characters. It is a rich novel about Pre-Columbia South America that is sure to please.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Lot of thrills to read and very well paced of the action, all in all a very good book on my part
B0062O85IW|5.0|A really good Book to have on hand, lot of information and tips  I have the E book so no CD but you can download the CD from publisher website with proof of purchase.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game because of the graphics and because of simply the way it's made. EPIC is a very playful and safe game for younger kids that enjoy the outdoors and have a sense of adventure. The game is simple and adorable.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am not a game player, but when a friend introduced me to &#34;Spider&#34; I was hooked.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Worth reading if you are not familiar with the life of Tesla.  I was disappointed that this was such a short book & really didn't get into 'the meat' of his life.  Would like to have had more details & facts for what I thought was a biography.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I did not care for this book.  The characters will not very well defined.  The storyline was very typical.  Will not reread.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Truly a fantastic movie!  For non-french speakers there are english subtitles.  A must see which I highly encourage everyone to watch.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Well Written and not predictable.  He create a great new world with believable parameters and gets you to invest in the characters.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I have all the Ultimate Collection of the HP movies. It is fun to go back and watch the kids grow up plus you don't have to wait a year between watching them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was magnificent. It was disturbing on too many levels, but for some odd reason, I couldn't get myself to stop reading it!
B005D6O124|5.0|I saw them on another person and ask them where she got them and ask her if they were comforable and she said yes so I thought I would try them and they are really nice and look very nice on. SATISFIED
B004EF65QA|5.0|A bit of Dickens and Austen mixed in. Great show. Wished it kept goin. The book was not bad too.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|I have found that I enjoy the special features discs almost as much as the movie. It is entertaining and educational to see how all of these movies were put together; how much JK was involved with the productions, etc.; how they shot scenes out of sequence, etc. I highly recommend these movies and viewing all of the special features.
B005XLN77O|3.0|Product arrived on time in excellent condition. Nothing special but my 4 year old granddaughter loved them.<br />Would buy again for a young girl.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I don't know how so many people loved this book, well it is pretty good, but it makes me uncomfortable as hell. Rape, Rape, Messed up fetishes and incidents? I like to chill and get comfortable when I read, but this book made me uncomfortable, and grossed the F out.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|As Demi matures so does her voice....she is a very talented young lady and this is her best CD so far the music is jazzy and the lyrics are beautiful as this talented young woman is...hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do ..Bravo Demi Bravo
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so off the Chain. Yep I said it. This game is like my dream. It actually feels like I`m living my dream or dreams<br /> You should totally play this game because YOLO, you only live once. Peace out.
1419707671|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid Box of Books 4-6 arrived on time and in excellent conditions. My granddaughter and I enjoy reading together and these books are fun to read.
B00005RDRO|5.0|it is an interesting movie with all kinds of quiet humor throughout the entire film. it is worth having to see over again as there are many subtle funnies that can easily be missed the first time because you are laughing so hard.<br />a great cast who do justice to the roles they play.<br />well worth buying.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is by far my favorite holiday movie.  I have seen it at least 50 times, and each time I feel compelled to sing the songs out loud.  I can't help it, I wish that I could live in the Town of Halloween where every day of the year focuses on creating new fiendish delights for the big show at the end of October.  I also found that I could really relate to the ennui felt by the main character when he yearned for something new.  His delight at discovering the new sights and sounds of Christmas, and his subsequent effort to capture some Christmas magic for himself and his friends is both funny and touching.<br /><br />I highly recommend for children and grown people alike.
1451695195|1.0|He focused too much on his own physical condition all through the book and very little on the afterlife, which I had hoped he would tell more about.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have a love and hate for this book. I love reading this series,but I am deeply disappointed in this one. Love Eva and Gideon, you have not lost me yet. I will hang in there for more of there story. Mrs. Day you truly disappointed me. I'm going to read this next series I found which helps with the blow I got from your third book.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|A perfect movie for the deeply romantic!  It follows the lives of several couples, of all walks of life, and lets you bask in the glow that is their love--no matter how it manifests.
B004V71CYQ|5.0|I had to have the kids watch it so they would understand the new movie and new cartoons.  A little hokey given the new CGI but I still liked it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great game for holding kids interest.  Similar to Webkinz and Build-a-bear but more interactive and easier to earn coins and rewards.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|fun game,  great movie. We liked the cool features and fun ideas. It would be better if we could get more workers.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This little sharpener is good for the price. Very convenient for carrying in your pocket. Gets any knife sharp but if you want a good sharpener i would recommend spending the extra money to get a better one unless a mediocre but convenient sharpener is all you need.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun and addictive with great graphics. It does require some patience and can sometimes get bored with it, but in the end it is super fun thing to collect all the different Dragon types and leveling up to unlock new things.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The levels are a perfect mixture of easy to hard. This game was great. In HD the colors really pop!t
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my fav game.I don't know what I would do with out it. It makes me really happy. I like how it updates by its self
B004EPYZZI|5.0|this film is so heart touching and wonderful. a great family movie. teaches you anything is possible if you just believe
B005LAIIKI|4.0|A typically Tarantino vehicle. A homage to the Spaghetti western of the same name, with Franco Nero in the cast. A delicate subject, slavery, presented with no political correctness. Great acting all round, but a ridiculous amount of bloodletting marred what could have been a perfect western movie. Christoph Walz is truly amazing. And Walton Goggins of Justified fame is brilliant &#34;Oh, I'm gonna walk in the moonlight with you&#34; And you have to see it for Samual L Jackson's role of house boy Stephen, incredible.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|The book starts out slow and a bit tedious but becomes more interesting as she reveals the personality traits of the quiet ones versus their more outgoing friends.  My &#34;quiet daughter&#34; recommended it to me -- another quiet one.  By &#34;quiet&#34; I'm not indicating that we never laugh or talk loud -- It's just that we are OK with sitting back and enjoying the conversation until we have something of value to contribute.  I see that as a good thing, but of course, there's plenty of room in the world for our more outgoing friends!
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|It's a train wreck - you don't want to see it but you can't help but watch. Looking forward to more episodes...
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Drama deluxe.  Good cast who work very well together.  The writers of this show have done an excellent job.  Thanks for an enjoyable experience.  I can't wait for the new season to start.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed the proof, but wished that he had written more about,how she felt, etc. I went to his website, but it it seemed like all they  wanted was money
B009NY43NY|5.0|I won't give any spoilers but I'm peased with the ending and loved my Sookie journey! I can't waitt o see wha tthey do with the TV series now.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds raised the bar this season.  Every show was intriguing.  This season is a must-see for fans.  Watch all the episodes in order.  Don't miss out!
0425263991|5.0|*NO Spoilers!<br /><br />I am so blown away by what Nalini has been able to accomplish with Heart of Obsidian!<br /><br />I have been intrigued by Kaleb for a long time, but have always been afraid that I would have a hard time believing in him as a hero. I shouldn't have worried, because Nalini Singh once again has written an amazing addition to this awesome series, one that might even be her best work yet!<br /><br />Kaleb had everything to be the series biggest villain, but it's instead the series' most complicated character to date. He was taken at a young age, tortured and conditioned by a serial killer to continue his legacy. He has the potential to level the world and destroy the psynet and his race, but his love for a woman he met 16 years before is all that has kept him from this destructive path.<br /><br />7 years ago his best friend and owner of his heart was taken from him violently and his unstoppable pursuit of the girl he has always loved but had believed he didn't deserve, has finally paid off.<br /><br />I don't wanna ruin this book for you guys, but the Heroine of Heart of Obsidian is the best heroine of this series! She is so amazingly strong and steadfast even thought she had every reason to be simply the victim, that I dare you not to love her.<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is a fantastic addition to one of the best Paranormal Romance series in existence. Kaleb and the heroine's story had me in tears, the romance was beautiful, the smex was got as hell and the action nonstop.<br /><br />If you like Paranormal Romance you'll love this series and if you are a fan of the Psy-Changelings, Heart of Obsidian is a MUST read!<br /><br />Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa & Friends' Bookish Life {www.larissaslife.com}

B005MLOKXA|5.0|A good show to watch.  It keeps you on your toes wondering what is going to happen next.  A little raunchy at times but aren't they all these days.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It is an Honor to read this book. To read of the sacrifice and courage displayed by these great men. Words can not describe my appreciation. Thank you and may God bless all that serve.
0811879542|1.0|I am shocked that this book has received so much positive attention. This is a waste of paper. This is basically teaching children how to use touchscreens, pretending essentially that the book is a touch screen game. This \\"book\\" should not be receiving awards. An actual book with a story and pictures (that are art not dots) stimulate a child's imagination, creativity, and imagination. Stories with plots teach children good lessons as wells as word skill and vocabulary. This book does none of that. Children are already introduced to computers too early, this is NOT a book to put in their hands. Reading your cell phone manual to your child would be just as instructive and entertaining!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Better than watching nightly news n getting stressed out before bed. Relaxing my mind at tge same time. Really enjoy this game

B002WV5A9G|5.0|Pine and Quinto are better than the original casts,, although I've always liked Nimoy. And be sure to watch the sequel when it becomes available because it is great, too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was another great book!  I thought this was the last one of the series, pleasantly surprised that I get to wait for yet another book by this fabulous author!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I miss this series so much.  The 5 season opened up so many new ways to go. It is ashame the sci fi cancelled this show.  They were pulling good numbers in but I guess this is what happens when ur Chanel gets bought out by a network that does not understand science fiction.

B004GBIE3Y|3.0|The message is very real for today's teens, but it should not be listed under comedy.  It was more about a teen maturing in a culture  where everyone has some level of mental illness.  They do a decent job of showing him not only learning to cope, but make choices that help him thrive.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Maybe the next book can be titled &#34;criss-crossed with you,&#34; denoting the gazillion times and positions they had sex; or &#34;depraved with you.&#34;  What was the point?  Overall, the characters and book were just  were just Boring.  I'm glad there was marriage.  At least that was progress.  My regret, the 9.99 I spent.  Will not b buying the next book(s), and I don't care if and when they r released.  Too many other authors work to read.<br /><br />.

0316017930|4.0|Gladwell does it once again.  He provides links and correlations in modern society as to why common issues are the way they are.  You'll end up scratching your head as to how he will relate two topics and then he blows your mind with the common thread.  I don't read books but for some reason his topics and perspectives ALWAYS keep me interested in the next page.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Maybe the best of the Star Trek movies!  Blends storyline from TOS and the movies.  HD streaming is excellent for both video and audio.

B009XHAM8G|5.0|My mom used to read this to me and the other day before she passed away I read it to her.
B000002LMK|5.0|I will admit that this Neil Young album has taken considerable time for me to really love. Years later, I've realized what a masterpiece it really is. It contains some solid grungy guitar riffs, and seems to maintain a certain pace throughout the album. The songs are nothing fancy, but pack a punch and stay with me long after I listen to them. The best songs on this album are WHITE LINE, OVER AND OVER, LOVE TO BURN, and DAYS THAT USED TO BE. Actually, all of the songs are great, but these are my top four. Crazy Horse is the band for this one (you would've never guessed, right?), and this album simply does not lay the foundation for the diametrically different follow up album, Harvest Moon. This album is a must-have.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|On a solid DSL download signal (1.25 Mbps), this Amazon on-demand HD movie's image ($3.99 24-hour download) was quite poor.  Certainly not High Definition, with jagged edges and pixelated textures.  Paying the extra buck for the \\"HD\\" download certainly did not deliver with this movie. We allowed ample time for the download to buffer before viewing to increase picture density, with no improvement in definition.<br /><br />Regarding the movie; from what we could see with one eye squinted, family fun that adults can enjoy without the kids as well.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Can you keep a secret? This is a quick,adorable read. I laughed out loud. Great for the beach. I really like this author. If you want to escape for several hours read this. Enjoy.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|Coltrane is awesome!!! Mcoy Tyner superb! He really made Trane sound even greater! Elvin is raw power! Jimmy G is the man!! We listen to this daily. A real treasure.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is simple and complicated all at the same time...it keeps both of us occupied for great lengths of time and we have fun solving each level together. This is a great game
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Compared to the previous two books in the series this was boring to say the least<br />The story was lack lustier and went nowhere in particular<br />However the only saving grace for this book was the really raunchy sex scenes<br />Not high on my list of reccomentations I'm afraid
B0037NVM1I|5.0|One of my faves, love the follow up to one of the best si-fi movies of all time. Love Arnold as a good Terminator.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I wasn't sure about this case, but decided to try it since our diaper bag didn't come with a wipes case and I didn't want to buy travel size wipes just for the diaper bag.  It's a little bigger than I would like, but it does work well.  The slide top is easy to use and huggies wipes work perfectly in this container.  This is a great travel case especially for the price.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|Protects the Kindle, not bulky, and has a secure closing. Priced right, sturdy fabric, nice colors.  What's not to like?
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Ever since the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns I have anxiously awaited another book by this author! I set my sights too high, because nothing could compare to those two books. This one is still very good, but it goes back and forth between characters and time periods so it is a little hard to follow.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|Great movie on of the best of all times, great acting and a great story all combine for a great movie.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Those with a Britax B-Agile stroller will know there isn't a parent tray included.  I bought this to old keys, water, etc.  I am glad I did.  It fits perfectly on the handles and is very useful.  I can easily access my water, phone, and any thing else I need right away.  This definitely makes my B-Agile even more versatile than it already is.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like that this shows percentages of battery life remaining. Also helpful to know my battery's condition. Easy to use, crisp screens.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Well written action movie. Followed the story from the comic book  series. Second time to see this movie and enjoyed more the second time.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Not sure I would watch it again, but I did like it.  I thought it very interesting on what was happening leading up to Osama' death.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What do I choose to write about? The acting, the history, the scenery/sets, the clothing, the rich lovable characters? This series has all of that. I think my husband likes it even more than I do.even my teenage son likes it, though he won't admit it. You have to watch this series, and start from the beginning.
0061906220|5.0|because I call her Pete, and<br /><br />She really loves the lighthearted beatnik theme.<br /><br />Pete is such a happy and cool cat.
B00908DDZM|5.0|i love it it was a great cd he is an amazing artist<br /><br />i dont know what else to write sorry
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I have been addicted to this album ever since first listening to it.  As a notorious Queens fan it's safe to say this has tickled me as much as Songs for the Deaf did.  It's definitely a different album, a departure from the punk-like Era Vulgaris.  It's short, I really do wish it was longer but it's both experimental and very 1970′s like, which is of course a big plus for me.<br /><br />...Like Clockwork starts out with the slow dirty groove of \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\" which sounds both forlorn and powerful.  It speeds up with \\"I Sat By the Ocean\\" which is a good rocker about trying to forget an ex.  It is catchy in typical QOTSA fashion, with a breakdown you can't help but clap and dance to.  Then there is the trippy \\"Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" with swirling piano and keyboards and lyrics of loneliness and dejection.  This song has 1970′s written all over it.  \\"If I Had a Tail\\" is more up-tempo with some strange wording, such as \\"In the land of the free lobotomy\\" and \\"I wanna suck, I wanna lick, I wanna cry, I wanna spit.\\" I did enjoy bopping to this one.  Next up is the more radio-friendly \\"My God is the Sun\\" with lots of layered guitars and a repeating Nick Oliveri bassline.  \\"Kalopsia\\" is another strange one, a slow, dirgelike number with a more keyboard-driven sound, that is until it slams into drums and guitars.  \\"Fairweather Friends\\" is a good guitar-heavy number and is pretty self-explanatory.  We've all had those so-called `friends' who leave at the drop of a hat and can never be counted on.  \\"Smooth Sailing\\" is probably my favorite track on the album, full of guitars and funk and rather reminscent of Eagles of Death Metal, which Josh Homme does play in with his friend Jesse Hughes.  This song also has some Homme innuendoes such as \\"I'll make a mountain out of a molehill if the molehill is mine\\" and \\"I'll blow my load all over the status quo, here we go\\" and I honestly can't stop listening to this song.  \\"I Appear Missing\\" is a slower number with complex guitar work and keyboards.  It's laid back and has some good harmonies.  My least favorite song is \\"...Like Clockwork\\".  With mostly just piano and Homme's voice, with the rest of the band joining in later on, to me it ends the album on a downer.  I applaud him for trying something new but this one didn't grab me the way the others did.<br /><br />This album for me is what modern rock and roll is and should be, brash, adventurous, yet still rooted in big fat guitars and singable melodies.  I have been a massive QOTSA fan since Rated R and I don't see myself stopping in the foreseeable future.  The only problems I can find with this album was the weak last track and the feeling that they could've rocked out a bit more.  It sort of seemed they were holding back at times, but this is truly the album to get if you like rock music.<br /><br />It's like cocaine for the ears.

B00008CLOA|5.0|Not mentioned but this is the SACD version.<br />I got this to see if there really was a sonic difference compared to a regular CD.<br />The playing side is gold compared to silver on a regular CD.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The previews seemed funny so<br /><br />I really wanted to see it but<br /><br />The characters were so irritating.<br /><br />I didn't feel any empathy for them. In fact<br /><br />I didn't much care what happened to them.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I love the show sometimes it portrays cops as willing to go a little to far, don't get me wrong I love it but it does push the ethics and morality limits.<br />Dana
1935597760|5.0|This book is awesome. It certainly makes my top 25 list of all-time favorites. I wish Amazon provided a better summary.  The main character is sympathetic and likeable from the beginning. Set in 1970s Ireland it's a story about Jamie, a 40-something survivor of a Catholic orphanage. We discover his history through flashbacks of his childhood. It is a sad story told with humor. There are few, but well-developed characters. I love the mis-spellings and word choices. I don't know what they are but I think I would really enjoy a \\"rock bun\\" about now.
1781162646|4.0|this was a great story with great characters , but i find it just doesn't match up with some of his better books. it definitely isn't a &#34; scary book&#34; . it is a sweet coming of age story.
B0031ESIZQ|4.0|This game was fun before but now with zoo aspects and water park features it is the ultimate do it yourself theme park game! One thing, this is the European version!

It does not bother me, the game runs and plays fine, just a little FYI!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|The movie was a gift for my niece who was reading the book in high school.  She had seen the most recent movie released and did not like it.  I wanted her to see this one, which version I have always loved.  My niece loved it, too.

193700788X|1.0|I am just one of the many loyal fans of this series that has helped catapult the author to wealth and fame.  Knowing this was the final book, & having an inkling of where Ms. Harris was going with the story after the last book---I was prepared to be disappointed. But, this is more than disappointment.<br />I have waited before posting this review.  I thought it best to let my emotions settle before ranting.  If someone you've been in a relationship with for more than a decade suddenly screws you over, best to pause before going all Lorena Bobbit in response.  So, I waited.  Waited to see if time would allow me to forgive the author for the heinous piece of garbage she threw together as her finale to a beloved series...  And as it turns out, time isn't healing this wound.<br />First off this was the most poorly written out of all the books.  We all knew she was ending the series.  But instead of giving it a proper burial, it's like she hastily dug a small ditch and threw one quick shovel full of dirt over the stinking carcass.<br />Team Eric & Team Bill knew she was going to end it with Sam.  But, the way she suddenly, uncharacteristically ousted Eric was unforgivable.  I was even angry at the anticlimactic conversation with Bill.  Seriously, after all these books---THIS is what she delivers to loyal fans??!!!  And what do we get in trade?  Is it a happily ever after with Sam?  Some beautiful, romantic lines that is a balm to our wounded hearts?  NOPE.  A quick tryst with the shifter and then the literary equivalent to a shrug of the shoulders and a \\"maybe\\".<br />Charlaine Harris should be ashamed of her obese self!  Ashamed that this is what she delivered to those who lined her pockets.  Ashamed that her name is on that craptastic book.<br />It shouldn't be named DEAD EVER AFTER.  She should have named it Massacred---because that is what she gave us.

B001EC0OMM|3.0|This is a very good movie but I gave it three stars because I don't agree with the theme or message. The acting is great and it is a very entertaining movie. It's about getting married on impulse, getting divorced on impulse, etc.. The movie centers around a rich girl and her dysfunctional family and a gossip magazine attempting to capitalize on the missteps in her marriages. There are a lot of side amusements that make the movie entertaining, like the bride's own character flaws, the younger sister's inquisitive nature, etc... In my opinion, which I'm sure nobody cares, she should have married the executive, which the movie portrays as old-fashioned and out of touch, but he would have provided the stability she needed to live a more consistent life. In real life, after she married again, she would divorce in month and marry Jimmy Stewart's character.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is a lot of fun when you have nothing but time on your hands or you are trying to ignore your boss
B006TTC5JK|5.0|Jimmy Stewart was wonderful in this one.  A must have for movie collectors.  I was excited to get it in Blue Ray, DVD and digital.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|A real good read! Typical Jeffrey Archer, a great story with a few twists and turns. Loved it, he is a great author.
B005SH5K7I|4.0|Fun story and good use of characters for voices.  We had a blast naming the stars to the animals before the movie and then testing our accuracy as we watched the movie. Funny was way off on Sly, had him pegged as the monkey...:)<br />We have watched it twice and still finding the funny lines we missed.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Defending Jacob: A Novel.  had a good story line that held my interest; BUT....it could have been shorter!!!! It was a bit redundant.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|This is a very unique recording<br /><br />Interesting, powerful and amazing.<br /><br />All heavy metal maniacs must have it. I encourage you.
