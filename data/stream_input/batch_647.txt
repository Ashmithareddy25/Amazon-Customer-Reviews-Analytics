B0000AQS0F|5.0|missed all but one of the series when it was on the Sci-Fi channel, did catch the movie version Serenity, thought it was a great movie and got the DVD when it came out.  Saw that a box set was out, so ordered it.  Have not been disappointed, great series.  Can not believe this series got cancelled. <br />I enjoy watching these episodes as much as watching Battlestar Galaxtica series on the Sci-Fi channel..the box set is very well priced, love the dvd holders etc....glad I ordered this box set!!!
B0000542D2|5.0|Wow, I just fell in love with this movie! It's so good, I even made copies of it for my cousins and friends! So if you love The Beatles as much as I do, then buy this movie!

0142001104|5.0|\\"Giving an A\\" - what a simple, yet earth-shattering concept. If you connect with nothing but this (practice #3) GIVING AN A to everyone, especially family members and those you tend to judge daily, you will have added greater power and tolerance to your life. <br />A coaching associate recommended this book. I didn't know what to expect, yet when I realized it was written by a world-famous conductor AND his therapist wife, I knew there would be good value. <br />I have been telling everyone about this book. My women's group is reading it and we will use it as a workbook throughout the year. I've asked my business colleagues to read it in order that we may be utilizing the same practices with our mutual clients to everyone's benefit. <br />I have never believed any one book was suitable and indeed necessary for every reader, until now. <br />\\"The Fourth Practice: Being a Contribution\\" is my favorite. We all do this automatically to some extent, and I promise this chapter will envigorate you to value your generosity and expand it to generate new methods, offering greater value to your gifting experiences. <br />This book encapsulates all the tenets of an optimist, a kind-hearted wannabe and all of us who intentionally choose to live side-by-side with grace and humanity. <br />Ben & Roz combine their memorable, relevant life stories throughout the pages, peppering with anecdotes, letters and intimate perspectives of other notables. The writing is beautifully mingled, flowing, thoughtful, timely and applies to us all. <br />You will want to share this book with friends, associates and co-workers. Let's make this book a contagious gift to support our planet in greater well-being and LOVE. <br />Pie Dumas <br />Author & Life Coach <br />

Both little boys enjoy this book and often request it at bedtime.  It talks about how Big Brothers get to do different things than babies (like eating ice cream and pizza) and that Big Brothers are very special and are loved by mommy and daddy very much.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I have seen Diana in concert as an opening act for someone else, and I was bored to death with every song she sang, she has no ups and downs pure monotone.   Like Andrea Bocelli said let the song come from the pit of your stomach.  This CD is the same, she has a nice voice but does not know how to use it, I couldn't feel the song, but as always the music is great.
B000IMV4IW|4.0|I became an Oasis fan on the first listen of a \\"white label demo\\" of a song called Columbia in 1994. I didn't know then that this band would be the most influencial, important band of my lifetime. Growing up with Nirvana and the grunge scene in America brought me to be greatly effected by the sudden impact of the self-assured \\"Get Up Off The Floor And Believe In Life\\" idea of Oasis. American's didn't find out about Oasis until their second album, and their only exposure was the Wonderwall & Champagne Supernova videos where Liam Gallagher wore round \\"Lennon\\" sunglasses. With this, America missed the entire life-changing charisma of Definitely Maybe and the masterpieces found throughout the rest of every album and every single with b-sides to follow. <br /> <br />Anyone who says they dislike Oasis is only familiar with Wonderwall & Champagne Supernova and say they dislike the \\"attitudes\\". Nevermind that Oasis single-handedly changed the way an entire generation of listeners approached their own lives by writing astonishing songs that made you feel invincible. Forget \\"Rape Me\\" or \\"I Hate Myself & I Want To Die\\", Oasis are about making the most out of life and not wasting a single second. It's there in the lyrics, in the Marshall Stacks & Les Pauls, and in the melodys that will never grow tired. <br /> <br />I'd rate this album a 10 out of 10 were in not for one glaring ommision... not a single song from the 3rd album, Be Here Now. Noel Gallagher has become ashamed of this album over time due to the reviews recieved upon release as an overblown record with too many long songs. Well, having been there from the beginning, I'd say Be Here Now is my favorite Oasis record, primarily due to the fact that it's the sound of the summer of 1997. Big and exciting, and almost constantly rocking, Be Here Now warranted at least 1 track on Stop The Clocks and it could have featured 3 or 4. Don't Go Away is to me the single most beautiful Oasis song and should have been among the first3 or 4 Noel chose for Stop The Clocks. Meanwhile, D'You Know What I Mean? is the single most exhilirating Oasis song ever released and would have added to the track listing as the most interesting and self assured track on Stop The Clocks. With 9 songs on each disk, the inclusion of these two tracks would have made it my dream Oasis \\"Best Of\\" rounding it out at 10 tracks per disk and making for a more complete Oasis overview. Other than that, it's still a fantastic document of the most important rock & roll band of the last 30 years.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|When my daughter and nephews started Karate class last fall, I bought the children these movies. I loved these when I was younger and they love them now. Their instructor will even refer to the movie when teaching; \\"Do you remember in 'The Karate Kid' when he did this?\\" etc. The kids have a better idea of what he wants from having watched the movie. Also, my daughter likes 'The Next Karate Kid' because that story is about a girl.

0143036556|4.0|Diamond's premise is interesting: humanity's over-use of the Earth's resources leads to the collapse of civilization.  However, the author of \\"Collapse\\" uses unconvincing examples in his development of his idea and actually contradicts his points throughout the book.  Despite this, the book is an entertaining read and the author brings up some interesting points which should be considered by us citizens and consumers.<br /><br />Diamond describes how certain civilizations couldn't survive because they over-used their natural resources (Easter Islanders, Norse Greenlanders, and four others).  What he actually ended up revealing is that certain culture is hard to sustain itself in extreme climates.  Humans do survive despite the most inconceivable living conditions (both places above sustained some population), but the isolated nature of their location makes it difficult for better information to reach them in order to overcome climate change, human-induced or otherwise.<br /><br />As in his more recent book, Diamond fails to see that trade is the key to overcoming cultural ineptness.  His example for isolated communities that survived were very large (Japan, Papua New Guinea) or had ideal, stable climate.  He also contradicts himself when he mentioned that some societies dependence on trade made them easy fodder for collapse, yet wrote that trade would have helped the Norse Greenlanders.<br /><br />In addition, Diamond mentions that slavery was detrimental (in the case of Haiti) because of its increase in population, not because that population was prevented from being self-sufficient and thoughtful.  That Diamond's main points is that over-population causes collapse is not supported by some of the most densely populated countries thriving today.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks, the book is fascinating and enlightening.  The descriptions of each remote location and different cultures is extremely useful in itself despite the limited conclusions the author comes up with.omes up with.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This seller was VERY good in sending the movie in GREAT condition and it was FAST!  It was still in the wrapper and everything!

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I'm really not sure what else there is to say about this album. London Calling was my introduction to The Clash and it still remains my favorite of theirs. They try their hand at a lot of different styles, from reggae to rockabilly to funk to pop, and everything in between - yet it always works. It is impossible to single out favorite songs on here, every song is wonderful. While I'd be hesitant to call this a \\"punk\\" album, this is one CD that every punk fan should own. <br /> <br />If you can, save up and get the 25th anniversary edition with all the extras. The second disc (\\"The Vanilla Tapes\\") has some really great demos and outtakes, even if the sound quality is a little bad. The DVD alone is worth the extra money, with a very interesting behind the scenes feature and some videos. Whether you get the single disc edition or the expanded version, you really can't go wrong with London Calling.
0307237699|5.0|I think we all know Barack Obama as the charming, middle-of-the-road Illinois Senator now poised to make a run at the White House in 2008. <br /> <br />While I still believe it's unlikely America is ready for a non-white male Christian President, Obama's book at least gives a vision of what qualities I think the first non-white male Christian President of the United States will probably have to possess: appealing values & integrity. <br /> <br />I knew about as much as the average American about Obama prior to reading \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\" After completing the book, I can honestly say he is indeed a mild-mannered politician brimming with optimism who believes there's no reason why America's promise can't & shouldn't benefit all. <br /> <br />Obama tends to go the empathetic route (liberal views by some standards) when it comes to helping the poor, fighting poverty and improving the educational system in low-income areas across the country. <br /> <br />He also tends to lean slightly more conservative when it comes to his religious background and acknowledging how that shapes his worldview. <br /> <br />However, the real jackpot of this book and where I think Obama is starting to win fans over is promoting the notion that we all can find COMMON GROUND no matter what our background or personal political perspectives might be. <br /> <br />This isn't necessarily a new concept by any stretch of the imagination, but I think Obama succeeds where many politicians have failed because he still has that \\"I'll fight for what's best for the common man\\" approach that so many politicians on his level have lost. <br /> <br />\\"The Audacity of Hope\\" in Obama's concept is loosely based on overcoming differences of opinion, Congressional alliances and all of the idling bureaucracies that hinder any real progress to make positive changes Americans can see and touch. <br /> <br />It would take me another 1,000 or so words to break down the book chapter by chapter.  Obama, like all politicians, has an opinion on everything. <br /> <br />The only asset I'd add that perhaps hasn't been expressed by other reviewers here is that Obama comes across as very non-threatening, approachable and genuine. <br /> <br />At central focus of \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is Obama detailing how his childhood, racial background, education, religious faith and family values all contributed to shaping who his is today and how he sees the world. <br /> <br />All of these things helped form his opinions on race, politics, war, social welfare, Capitalism, Communism, freedom and matters that pertain to Church v. State. <br /> <br />Yet, his winning points are in understanding how his identity both enhances and in some ways limits his perspectives when it comes to trying to relate to others who come from the opposite end of the spectrum. <br /> <br />This is where putting into action the attempt to find common ground and making sure the good of all Americans truly being made top priority is soooo fundamental. <br /> <br />In other words, Obama knows he doesn't have all the answers and is the first Democrat to openly admit one must listen to the other side (Republicans) because one side doesn't have all the right answers. <br /> <br />As the title of my review states, if you \\"get this\\" about Obama's perspectives, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" will either be one of your better or worst reads. <br /> <br />I, for one, understand the value in understanding a point of view counter to my own and the impending necessity in life you'll find in having to work together to tackle a big problem. <br /> <br />Highly recommended read!
B00005JPKC|3.0|There's no denying that this is an extremely well made film, visually compelling and powerfully acted, with a strong anti-war message. Just having seen it, however, I am concerned that it continues a recent trend of revisionist history towards World War II, one of the few wars in history with objectively good/bad, right/wrong sides. The fact is that the Japanese military instigated the Pacific conflict and committed unspeakable atrocities against the enemy and violations of the rules of war throughout. Yet one finds no mention of this in Eastwood's film, which appears to suggest a moral equivalency between the Japanese and American forces. (Indeed, the most egregious act depicted in the movie -- the shooting of unarmed, surrendered soldiers -- is committed by the Americans.) I have no quarrel with the message that war is hell for soldiers on both sides and that they share a common bond in the families they leave behind.  But that message would be better suited to a more morally ambiguous conflict, of which the past and present provide far too many. I fear that young audiences seeing this film without an understanding of WWII history and with only the experience of modern American military imperialism will perceive the undersupported Japanese forces as heroic and honorable resistors of superior Western might, instead of the barbaric and ruthless invaders that they in fact were from 1941 to 1945. One has to wonder if the critics would fawn over the film as much if we were being asked instead to sympathize with the soldiers in Hitler's SS, who I'm sure also had mothers who wanted them to come home safely.  <br />
0618680004|5.0|Religious people are not accustomed to having their ideas subjected to harsh criticism. Scientists and rationalists are. <br /> <br />Thus, it is hardly surprising that Dawkins' uncompromising tone will offend believers, and possibly frighten moderate secularists, fearful of throwing down so stark a gauntlet to the religious among us (or, in the USA, to the religious who dominate the culture). <br /> <br />I personaly found this book refreshingly honest. Dawkins despises religion, he is quite up front and honest about that, and he treats it accordingly. The ins and outs of the arguments vary (some are stronger than others, but they're mostly strong), but throughout his tone is blunt (leading to charges of \\"fanaticism\\" and \\"arrogance\\" -- as if the religious weren't habitually arrogant, fanatical, condescending and bigoted in their tedious denunciations of secularism.) <br /> <br />After much thought, I agree with Dawkins that this uncompromising stance is necessary. For too long preposterous religious doctrines have been given a pass on the basis of \\"respecting other people's views\\" (though the religious rarely respect atheistic or secularist positions). We can no longer afford this luxury, in a world where religious fanaticism, nursed and nurtured by the silence or inaction of so-called \\"religious moderates,\\" may one day be combined with weapons of mass destruction to bring our entire species, and the planet, to destruction.  <br /> <br />It really is time to take a firm stand and demand that the religious justify their positions with evidence and logic and not appeals to books written thousands of years ago. We would not need to do this, unless the religious had forced their views on everyone else through the political process leading to such travesties as demands to teach creationism in science class, the stymying of stem-cell research, the blocking of AIDS-prevention through condom use, the promotion of \\"abstinence-only\\" sex education (for which, read \\"no sex education\\"), the assault on abortion rights, the simple-minded delusions that infuse the idiotic worldview of our highly religious president, the underminig of reason and science in the public forum, and so much more. <br /> <br />In fact, it's fair to say that the religious have thrown down the gauntlet and Dawkins and others like him are just reacting to their extremism. <br /> <br />All in all: a good read. It is particularly recommended for any who are hearing a voice of doubt about their religious faith and may be apalled at the (ab)uses religion is being put to in the contemporary public forum. This book may just open your eyes.
B00005JPAD|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.  The entire cast does an outstanding job and virtually all turn in oscar quality performances but DiCaprio stands out.  His performance can only be called \\"electrifying\\" because his dialog does not convey his inner struggle and he is left to convey these feelings by body language and expression.  He does a magnificent job of this -- gone is his pretty boy image and underneath that bland face we find a real actor.  Matt Damon does and equally fine job with similar challenges and he too turns in an oscar quality performance.  However, Jack Nicholson is evil personified and turns in his usual outstanding perfromance.  The surprise is Wahlberg who has a supporting role but demonstrates that he too can act.  Alec Baldwin plays the clueless detective and does this well.  Unfortunately he simply cannot act in any movie without dragging his political messages into it but fortunately this is kept to a minimum and doesn't spoil the film.  However, when it happens it is out of context and is like hitting a wrong note.  Nevertheless he and Martin Sheen do excellent jobs.  The screen play is one of the best written in a very long time.  While there is violence and profanity it is logical in context and does not seem gratuitous as it usually is.  The cinematography and set design are also well done.  The movie is spellbinding from start to finish and you are on the edge of your seat the full time.  The tension felt by DiCaprio and Damon is palpable.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is an Oscar Winner and would be a logical winner for Best Picture, Best Screen Play, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor.  I canot recommend this picture highly enough but it isn't for the squeamish and I wouldn't take children younger than about 16 to it.
B00068NVI4|5.0|For those of you who did not catch the tour, this is a must have item. For those of us who did catch Yes in concert, this is a great way to remember what it was like. The amazing thing is that these guys just keep getting better. Despite a review I read disrespecting Alan White's playing on this tour, I rebuke that statement as a percussion educator and reaffirm that Alan White is one of the greatest drummers of all time. The camera angles are excellent, and the videographers seem to be at ther right place at the right time. Highly reccommended for all Yes Fans.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Let me just start by saying that about a month ago I HATED My Chemical Romance.  Really hated them.  I wrote them off as unoriginal and generally untalented.  Then my friend played me the Black Parade.  I couldn't believe it.  I heard Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Queen, The White Stripes, Dream Theater, Thin Lizzy, but all in a way that was not simply ripping them off, but paying them homage in an exciting, beautiful way.  This album instantly went to my favorite albums of all time list.  For the past couple of years, it's been The White Stripe's \\"Elephant\\", Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\", and now My Chemical Romance's \\"The Black Parade\\".  It rocks...so hard.  So, so hard.  If you like to be rocked and/or rolled, I highly recommend you purchase The Black Parade immediately.

B0000AUHPG|2.0|I am a huge fan of The Good The Bad and The Ugly.  Once Upon A Time In The West was incredibly disappointing for me.  I wondered why I'd never seen it on TV.  After I saw it I knew why.  It's too slow too long the motive is weak, the characters have no chemistry and unlike the TGTB&TU the dialog is unmemorable.  I was equally attracted to the possibility of another fantastic score by Ennio Morricone and was equally disappointed.  I was really hoping for a treasure I'd somehow missed over the years however I wasn't missing anything.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I'm trying not to let some of the inexplicably negative reviews bother me, but it's truly incomprehensible to not appreciate the beautiful experimentation and remastering of these songs by George Martin and his son Giles. Of course nothing will replace the original recordings, but that was never the intention of this reworking. It really is just about the incredible creativity and versatility of the Beatles' songs. Mixing them up is just giving each song a new life and context, which is very interesting to me.<br /><br />This is exactly what the Beatles were about and who else would know except George Martin, and of course, the remaining Beatles Paul and Ringo, who both gave this their approval. Anyway, this cd rocks and the Beatles will always be ahead of their time and any other time it seems. Buy it, it was the best cd released in 2006, IMO and the freshness of this music is astonishing.<br /><br />My Favorites: Get Back, Glass Onion, Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing, Blackbird/Yesterday, Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You/Helter Skelter, Strawberry Fields Forever, Lady Madonna, While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Wow!

B000001FOL|4.0|With a voice like a slightly off harmonium (which she frequently played on her subsequent releases), Nico was a total original. After singing a few songs on the Velvet Underground's debut album as their Warhol-implanted chanteuse then getting ousted from the band, Nico recorded this, her debut solo album. The atmosphere throughout \\"Chelsea Girl\\" is haunting, mournful and a little mysterious, even when the lyrics of a given song are optimistic or hopeful. However, most of the material she works with here is quite morose. She covers one of Jackson Browne's saddest songs, \\"These Days\\", a truly depressive beauty. Stand-out tracks for me include the ode to Andy Warhol's Factory characters \\"Chelsea Girls\\" written by sometime lover Lou Reed and the ghostly \\"Eulogy to Lenny Bruce\\" by Tim Hardin. This song really gets to me as I know first-hand how the pain of drug addiction affects not just the user but also those close to the addict. The decision to include this song on the album is the very definition of 'ironic' since Nico's struggle with drugs is well documented.<br /><br />Nico's later releases sound very different from this record as she finds her own voice as a composer and musician. Are they better than this album? I don't really think so. I think that they're all of a piece. But where this album's main instrumentation is guitar, strings and the occasional woodwind, Nico's later, more personal CDs use synthesizers, the aforementioned harmoniums and the like to convey her unique solo compositions. So she started out folky with this one and gradually becomes more avant garde as her career progressed.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is truly a labor of love by George Martin and son Giles. The re-mixes are absolutely stunning. My only qualm with this CD is that not all of the songs are really re-mixed. Tracks like \\"Something\\", \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\" are pretty much left alone so what's the point of reissuing them yet again? But the combos of \\"Drive My Car\\"/\\"The Word\\"/\\"What You're Doing\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\"/\\"Within You Without You\\" and \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\"/\\"I Want You\\"/\\"Helter Skelter\\" are mind-blowing and worth the money.<br /><br />The only question now is when are the Rutles going to release \\"Money\\"?
1401308201|5.0|The creators of WICKED are pure geniuses!! <br />THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CREATING THIS SHOW! <br />I love my Grimmerie, considering how it somewhat resembles Elphaba's in the show. The pages look like they've been scrawled through by Elphaba herlself, which is a good thing. It has the withered apperence which I love. TONS of new pictures I've never seen. A lot of backstage info and how the show came to be one of Broadway's most successful. It's still the highest grossing show on Broadway and I couldnt be happier! <br />I LOVE WICKED!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A well presented argument with astonishing images showing the way we are rapidly making our planet difficult for humans and animals to live on.   The film of the presentation is of interest even if you do not agree with global warming.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Good CD -- only thing I didn't care for was \\"scat\\" on a couple of songs --
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Once again, along with all the overhyped blockbusters 2006 had to offer, we have Little Miss Sunshine, the sleeper hit of the year.  I will agree with people who complain that the trailers did not market the movie correctly, as it appears to be a family friendly feel good movie.  And that's not to say that it doesn't have it's heart felt moments, but there is a lot of dark and literally morbid humor to be found here.  I guess that's why I liked it so much. <br /> <br />Little Miss Sunshine surprised me with it's ability to be simple, yet brilliant in it's simplicity.  The highest point next to the balanced script was the great ensemble work from the actors.  The characters all have interesting relationships with each other as well as a lot of backstory to add to the overall plot.  A perfectly cast movie with each actor getting a chance to shine. <br /> <br />Most people by now at least know it's about a dysfunctional family making their way to California for the youngest memeber of the family, Olive, to compete in a beauty pageant.  I don't want to tell you anything else about the story because honestly it's best not knowing anything going in with this one, as it's essentially a road trip movie and you just have to experience it for yourself.  All I can say is if you're looking for a \\"family movie\\", steer clear.  It's rated R for a reason.  But if you enjoy offbeat humor and complex character driven movies, check it out.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Wonderful, creative mix of Beatle music.  Allows you to hear their works in a whole new way.
B0001FUHV6|5.0|I received \\"The Piano\\" promptly, and in pristine, excellent condition.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|My daughter enjoyed receiving this CD as a gift this past Christmas.
0618154248|5.0|This little collection is wonderful.  my 21 month old son carries the box wherever we go, and sits still while I read each one of the stories to him several times.  It's sturdy, it's colorful, and the stories are short enough that his active attention span doesn't expire.  I like that, although the words have been simplified, the illustrations and the storylines are original H.A. Ray.  If you're thinking of this for anyone between the ages of 1 and 3, buy it!
B00008OLYN|5.0|I am fairly new to Opeth. I got into them by \\"stalking\\" Steven Wilson, the front-man of Porcupine Tree. It appears that most of what he touches somehow turns to gold (even though Procupine Tree is quite different from Opeth in their style). He produced this record and some other Opeth albums. I checked out Porcupine Tree's friends on their My Space, and Opeth was one of them. One thing led to another...    Anyway, this album is a masterpiece. It is Opeth's most accessible work to casual fans. It is not even a heavy metal album. It is psychadelic to a degree, but not quite like early Porcupine Tree or Pink Floyd - it has its own very unique sound. In My Time of Need is my favorite, but this entire album is a masterpiece. Yes, it is only 42 minutes of music, but all 42 are awesome! It is easily one of the least known awesome albums out there.     Also, if you're new to Opeth, don't rush and buy everything else they have released based on this album, as the rest of it is much different. Their other work involves heavier guitars and very heavy vocals. Although I would much rather have Mikael sing clean vocals, I have come to appreciate their other work as well, because the musicianship on all of their albums is phenomenal. I just wish I could play them all at work. :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had friends who were rampant Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans, but it didn't seem to be my kind of thing. Maybe it wasn't. But because I didn't pay any attention to Joss Whedon's Buffy, I never even heard of his little show called Firefly before it was abruptly canceled by the faithless Fox network. I have atoned for my sins by spreading the gospel of Firefly as far and as wide as I can. My horizons have truly been expanded since I became acquainted with the Firefly universe.  <br /> <br />The show is brilliantly crafted; the dialogue tears at your heart one second and evokes a belly laugh the next, the intricate details of set and lighting and camera work unite the artistry of many masters under the cohesive vision of a genius. Joss Whedon is that genius and the cast and crew are the lucky (and incredibly talented) artists that make the show an addictive masterpiece. I don't just recommend this show, I IMPLORE you to watch it and share it with anyone and everyone that seems the tiniest bit likely to enjoy it. You'll be a Big D*mn Hero, in my book.
1401917186|5.0|This is an excellent book for people who are interested in spirituality and have a sense of being \\"different\\" in some way.  Dr. Doreen Virtue outlines different types of \\"earth angels,\\" as she did in her original \\"Earth Angels\\" book. The book also contains information on new groups of earth angels, which is helpful for those who did not relate to the groups outlined in the original book.  If you enjoyed reading Doreen's book \\"Healing with the Angels,\\" you are sure to enjoy this book as well. There are interesting anecdotes from people who relate to being an earth angel, as well as key physical characterisitics for recognizing other earth angels on our planet. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (as I did the original version)- it contains fascinating and helpful information for many people on a spiritual path. It is particularly helpful to people who may have a sense of not \\"fitting in,\\" as it explores why earth angels feel this way. If you feel drawn to this book, you will most likely learn something new about yourself in the course of reading it.  You may also want to read the original version, \\"Earth Angels,\\" if you would like information about \\"Walk-Ins.\\" <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|....Serenity would get several. The movie has a different voice and a different tone than the tragically short-lived series (Firefly), but the inner workings brought to life by cast and crew are just as fantastic. People like to talk about having \\"heart\\" - in sports, film, business, etc. - and Serenity has that, but what puts it in a higher class is its soul. Serenity has blood and sweat and bone and brains and heart in abundance (and yes, some of that is actual rather than metaphorical - it IS PG-13) but it also has a higher purpose. It doesn't preach and it doesn't push, but it questions. Religious questions, moral questions, political questions, all asked in such an unobtrusive way that it looks like pure entertainment. It isn't until you can't stop talking about it that you realize it has a deeper effect. Serenity is one of those movies I could watch over and over and never get tired of it. And I'm spreading the addiction to as many family and friends as I possibly can.

1581806574|5.0|This was one of the Christmas gifts I bought for my dragon-obsessed 10 year old daughter.  She uses it for hours (which is more than I can say for some of the pricier gifts she received).  I saw a huge leap in her drawing skills in just hours after she used the book.  She also loves the humorous aspect of the book. It's written well and is entertaining and informative.
B000FDECGA|5.0|I first saw this movie on cable many years ago and could never find a new copy. Finally they remastered it and this classic tale is available again. I used to tell my wife about this movie and now that she finally got to see it, she was just as impressed as I still am. Now she wants to share it with all our friends and relatives. <br />A must have for your collection of action flicks.
1577312082|5.0|I've done much reading over the past two years searching for a better understanding of how I fit into the Universe.  Eckhart Tolle's wonderful book has given me the understanding I've been seeking.  I purchased the CD version so I could listen repeatedly in my car.  Eckhart's message makes so much sense.  Take control of your mind!

B00005JM4Z|4.0|When I first seen 2 Fast 2 Furious, it wasn't all that to me.  I first watched this movie with my old tv so that can be called \\"480i\\" television. <br /> <br />  By the time I got an new HDTV from Wal-Mart, it an Sanyo model: DP26746 Integrated HDTV.. I had my Playstation 3 hook up to that HDTV with HDMI cable and play that movie in the slot and the quality looks so good, I had to adjust my brightness a little dark. Well  thats all I can say about this movie, it has the best picture and the story is just average but fun.  So, if u get the same device i have.. you will see what I am talking about.  My HDTV display resolution at 1366 x 768 WXGA screen, so you know it is above 720p and less than 1080i/1080p but great picture on screen.   <br /> <br />
B000JJRIN4|4.0|HOT.....Just HOT. Especially Breakin' Up, Don't Get It Twisted, and Wind It Up. This and last her album are huge departures from her alternative/Ska style with No Doubt--which is equally great. Maybe she should do this style in one album and then her old roots in another.  <br /> <br />I keep getting the early 80's Blondie vibe in the album cover.... <br />

B000BRBA8S|3.0|I'm so mad at the director for not using Maggie's scenes but in Aspberger fashion, one could say that the exclusion serves the point of the story.  The woman you want to see is not there and it sucks and is unsatisfying.  No one hits the mark and provides the poignancy, the sweetness, the age and of course, the tannin that would drive someone to seek solace at Angkor Wat.  <br /> <br />I'm still mad at him though.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is considered a \\"classic\\" for many reasons.  For one thing, it deals with themes that are still very relevant in our society today.  The ideas of pride and family relationships are both important factors in every day life today, and help bring the book to life.  Also, the characters in the novel have many character traits that are exhibited almost 175 years after the book was originally published.  Aloof, rich people, flirtations, young women, and social, eligible bachelors are common types of people even today.  By incorporating characters such as Mr. Darcy, Lydia, and Mr. Bingley into her story, Jane Austen has kept the book popular for hundreds of years.  The plot is very interesting and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish.  A family living in the British countryside that is almost continuously worried about marriage may not sound like an intriguing plot to many people, but in fact the plot is fascinating.<br /><br />Somebody who read the book might be a little bit disappointed by the fact that it was written 175 years ago.  This affects many aspect of the novel and radically changes how the book is written.  Although most of the vocabulary and style is easy to understand, every now and then there is a small section that is hard to understand.  In terms of themes, the obsession of young people with marriage is not as apparent in today's society as much as it used to be.  Finally, various decisions in grammar and punctuation may make the book more difficult for some people to read.  At some points in the novel, such as letters or other dialogues, the whole page may be filled without any paragraph breaks.  This makes for a more intimidating reading experience and may serve as a deterrent to people who are considering reading the book.

0679405666|5.0|Thackeray's \\"Vanity Fair\\" is at once a fascinating glimpse into the aristocratic Europe of the early 1800's while also serving as a masterful critique of the modern human drama.  While it takes some time for the story to really pull you in, you can expect a rather enjoyable ride once it does.  Thackeray does a good job of developing the characters and their personalities, and you will often find yourself thinking \\"I know people like this.\\"  In short, \\"Vanity Fair\\" is a 200-year-old story which, if anything, has only increased in relevance.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a timeless movie that has become one of our Christmas favorites.  The delivery of the DVD was right on time and in great shape. <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|2.0|I was displeased to receive this $20 DVD in nothing more than a thin, cardboard case, when I was giving it as a Christmas gift. The packaging boasts that the case can be recycled. However, no one plans to throw it out. I thought it was sneaky to be sold this in such cheap packaging and was embarrassed to give it as a gift. On a shelf of DVDs at home, one can't find it very easily in the midst of those DVDs with REAL cases.
B000J10ERO|3.0|its a superman movie, and im going to watch it. however, the actor and actress who played superman and lois, i didnt want to watch.<br /><br />superman lacked emotion and doesnt look he has ever ran in his life. for example, when clark ran to change into superman, it looked like<br /><br />he was pushed by his mother to try out for track and field. as for lois, i expected humor and tomboyish mannerisms from the part, didnt get any.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|I ordered this cd without any recommendation and without listening to it or her beforehand, but I lucked out because her voice is pristine and blows me away!

B000HCO840|3.0|what a great lineup, all the great actors all rolled up into one magical mutant film. ive watched every xmen because its xmen, but it doesnt<br /><br />mean i enjoyed them. i feel that every comic story made to film should be based on its original story. i dont understand what right any director<br /><br />has changing the story around? i felt that there were too many mutants to deal with by their hands, that each character seemed on the dull and<br /><br />tacky side, each time.
B000J6I0PM|2.0|I bought this as a gift for my 16 yr. old who enjoys the Foo Fighters, but regretted it when I saw even the 1st 10 minutes of the disk.  During the banter between songs, the F-word is repeatedly used.  This might be okay for older listeners, but in households with younger children, I wouldn't recommend it.  It was disappointing because the music itself is good.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|I saw this movie 40 years ago as a teenager, and it made a great impression on me.  The material, particualrly some of the social mores are dated, but provide a good time capsule for one to remember the way people thought and acted.  The cars look ridiculous by today's F1 standards, but the excitement remains for me. The cinematography is sitll unsurpassed by anything today, high tech or not. But for anyone born in the last 30 years, I suspect this film would not have the same appeal.
0375505091|5.0|This book came wrapped in plastic as if it was new.  The price of this book in the stores was double what I paid on Amazon.  Great purchase.
0618680004|3.0|In the beginning of the book, Dawkins explained that the target audience are those who are brought up in the Christian world, and therefore he spends most of the book refuting Chrisitianity, and the \\"god\\" as defined in that narrow world.  He struggles, he fights, mostly trying to convince himself of the non-existence of the Jewish-Christian-Muslim god, and a superior being in that definition almost exclusively.  One but can't help imagining the deep wounds inflicted on him by his upbringing. <br /> <br />For those who were not brought up in that tradition, or grew up in a non J-C-M society, e.g. the 2 billion East Asians, the book seems so pointless.  For me, the book serves as a good reference for the history of the arguments.
0689865384|5.0|I bought this book for a 15yr old - and she got attracted to it right when she got it - the plot is very interesting, and unique...allows for contemplation and personal debate on the sense and value of the words: \\"pretty\\" and \\"ugly\\" - so sensitive topics for all teenagers nowadays.<br /><br />Go for it - it's a good buy!
B000244FDW|2.0|It really wasn't that great... long, slow moving, low budget production.  It didn't even compare to the A&E version, nor the new feature film.  Probably not worth the money or the time.

0553573403|5.0|I have been a fantasy enthusiast since I was a child. Since I have worked in a bookstore for the past year I have seen that there are two fairly new fantasy series that everyone talks about like crazy. One is Robert Jordan's \\"The Wheel  of Time\\" series. The second is George R. R. Martin's \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\". Having the inclination to read one or the other, to see what the fuss is about I chose Martin... and I was thoroughly impressed with his first book In the series, \\"A game of thrones\\".<br /><br />The Story starts out simply enough. Lord Eddard Stark (oft called Ned by his family) is out on an excursion after witnessing a beheading of a traitorous man of the Night Watch with his sons in tow. Along the way they happen upon several direwolf pups that have recently been rendered orphans due to the fact that their mother has been slain. His sons ask to keep them since there are several pups, and they want to divvy them out between Robb (14), Sansa (11), Arya (9), Bran (7), and Rickon (3). At first Ned is reluctant, owing to the fact that dire wolves are vicious and hard to control, but his bastard son, Jon Snow (also 14), points out that since the dire wolf is on the sigil of the House of Stark it is fitting that all of the trueborn children get one, leaving him without. Ned consents and Jon is surprised to find another pup nearby who is not only the runt of the litter but is also an albino and he takes this pup as his own, giving him the name of Ghost.<br /><br />This is only a precursor to establish a great chain of events heavily rooted in political intrigue and machination. But allow me to attempt to simplify it.<br /><br />Ned Stark's closest friend, Robert Baratheon, is King of Westeros, a kingdom similar to Western Europe where the seasons can last for years and it has been Summer for nearly 7 years running now. Baratheon, at one point, had been engaged to Ned's sister, Lyanna, but when the current reigning Mad King Aerys Targaryen's son, Rhaegar,  kidnap and raped  her the Starks and the Baratheons went to war to get her back, acquiring the House of the Lannisters, Tullys, and Arryns as allies after King Aerys had Ned's father and older brother executed and threatened to kill Lyanna as well. In a battle Rhaegar was killed and the Lannisters went ahead to the king's capital, where Jaime Lannister executed the king, earning him the name of Kingslayer but because of the majority of the Houses having loyalty to Robert Baratheon he was placed on the throne instead of Jaime, which forever caused strife and tension between the two houses, especially as Robert decided to wed Jaime's twin sister, Cersei, to forever cement the alliance. During this war the Mad King's other heirs, Viserys and Daenerys, were stolen away to be hidden beyond the seas, where their hatred of the current reigning King has been left to fester. Ned also weds to Catelyn Tully, the former betrothed of his deceased brother Brandon.<br /><br />Well, after the incident in which Ned Stark finds the Direwolves with his sons he returns to his home, Winterfell,  in the northern territories of Westeros to discover a surprise. Robert is present with his entire court in tow, and he has come to ask that Ned take over the position as the hand of the king since the former occupant of the position, Lord Jon Arryn, has been mysteriously poisoned. An investigation into this matter is began by Ned Stark when he agrees to take over the position for his wife, Catelyn Stark, as her sister, Lysa Arryn, was Jon's wife before he passed. Ned prepares to depart for the south with Robert's party. During this visit other oddities come to light, as Ned's son Bran mysteriously falls from the heights of the rooftops, leaving his body forever broken and himself in a coma for some time to come. When Ned leaves for Court in the south Catelyn stays behind with Bran, as she is devastated by his convalescence, especially when she later thwarts an attempt on Bran's life that appears to bemade of the House of the Lannisters. Catelyn leaves Winterfell to the capital so that she may seek the council of her childhood friend Petyr \\"Littlefinger\\" Baelish and discover if the Lannister's are truly behind the attempt on her son's life.<br /><br />Another story playing out in tandem with all of these elements is that of Viserys and Daenerys, the children of the Mad King, who have been the wards of Magister Ilyrio Mopatis in the free city of Pentos in the East. Viserys and Ilyrion have made an agreement with the Detrain to sell 13 year old Daenerys in marriage to Khal Drogo, a warlord who commands 40,000 strong and Viserys wants to use them to help him reclaim his lost throne from the \\"Usurper\\", as he calls Robert. They set off to the Dothraki stronghold with a man named Jorah Mormont, formerly the son of the commander of the Night Watch who has since been exiled from Westeros for slave trading.  Viserys is cruel to his younger sister, using the idea that he is the last of the \\"dragons\\" to get his way with her. This is an idea previously used by his father and other ancestors that in their blood resides the last of the fire of the beast that explains for their contemptible rages and accounts of madness as well. Daenerys is very afraid of her brother and quails at his bouts of wrath until she is wed to Khal Drogo and discovers that Viserys rages are nothing more than childish whims, especially when Khal Drogo continues to make Viserys appear a fool in Daenerys' eyes. After she becomes pregnant with Drogo's child she becomes convinced that the Dragon of which Viserys speaks is growing in her womb, while the entirety of the Dothraki believe that the child is the saviour known as the \\"Stallion who Mounts the World\\".<br /><br />And of course there is also storylines following Ned's children who all have their part to play in this political drama, including Sansa, who only at 11 is playing at the idea of being betrothed to Prince Joffrey Baratheon (12); Arya who is a tomboy and learning to play at swords; Bran who comes out of his coma to learn of his paralysis and seems to recall something odd occurring the moment he fell from the eaves; Robb, who has to learn to be a man and a leader in his father's absence; and Jon, who decides to take the oaths of the Night Watch in the hopes that he will be like his uncle, Benjen. All of these characters are woven together like threads of a tapestry to form this amazingly complex drama that is actually quite simple. Who killed Jon Arryn? And who will take the throne if the killer is attempting to get at Baratheon as well?<br /><br />I haven't enjoyed a fantasy series in some time like I enjoyed this book. The plot is fabulous, and Martin's way of weaving together the characters and plotlines in this epic story are so deft it is unreal. I gobbled up this book and immediately have picked up the resulting sequels, of which I intend to start within the next half hour. What I loved about this book is that he used 8 different narrators to lend viewpoints to the story that truly make it that much more rich and grandiose. Within the story you have Ned, Catelyn, Arya, Sansa, Bran, Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion (a \\"half man\\" of the House of the Lannisters) all telling the events of Westeros from their own unique points of view. Sometimes Martin doesn't get back around to a certain storyline or narrator for over a hundred pages, and this only lends itself to make you want to read through the story at a breakneck pace, as he is so skilled at throwing in little plot points that make you want to get back to certain narrators, and then he does it again in the following chapter with someone totally different. While this is not a new literary device it is a very powerful one, as Martin is a master at complex storytelling. These characters seem to break down his aggrandizing narration to something simple and heartfelt. I have had people tell me that they read each characters own separate storyline in turn, skipping ahead several chapters until the find the narrators next chapter,  and then go on to another sub character... but honestly I think too much is revealed within chapter to chapter to do this. Some authors I would certainly use that tactic for, as overall I find this method of storytelling nebulous and annoying. However, Martin pulls it off with such grace that I can't help but be awed by him. I can't wait to see if he will do it again, or if he will change his narrators in the next book. Well, he would have to as one of them is no longer.. But I'm not going to tell you which one. Read \\"A game of thrones\\". It really is worth all of the hype.ratheon (12); Arya who is a tomboy and learning to play at swords; Bran who comes out of his coma to learn of his paralysis and seems to recall something odd occurring the moment he fell from the eaves; Robb, who has to learn to be a man and a leader in his father's absence; and Jon, who decides to take the oaths of the Night Watch in the hopes that he will be like his uncle, Benjen.

I have had people tell me that they read each characters own separate storyline in turn, skipping ahead several chapters until the find the narrators next chapter,  and then go on to another sub character... but honestly I think too much is revealed within chapter to chapter to do this. Some authors I would certainly use that tactic for, as overall I find this method of storytelling nebulous and annoying. However, Martin pulls it off with such grace that I can't help but be awed by him. I can't wait to see if he will do it again, or if he will change his narrators in the next book. Well, he would have to as one of them is no longer.. But I'm not going to tell you which one. Read \\"A game of thrones\\". It really is worth all of the hype.  <br /> <br />
B000J103PC|4.0|As always, Meryl Streep is excellent in \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" Although I am not a fashion guru and see the premise of the movie to be shallow, for pure entertainment, I do recommend the movie.  As an older adult I appreciate one of the subtle messages of doing what you have to do to get the job done according to the boss' wishes instead of whining and complaining!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|My son gave me the complete series DVD's of \\"The West Wing\\" and I could not have been happier.  It was probably one of the best written TV shows ever and to own all of the episodes means I don't have to serch all over the dial for reruns (which are never in any particular order); I can watch whenever I want and be thrilled all over again.  The added commentary by Aaron Sorkin and Tommy Schlamme and some of the cast give an added depth to the background of how the project got started and all of the nuances that I might have missed as the show prgressed.  The last two years of the series were not as inciteful to me as the first five; but I believe that coincided with the absence of Sorkin's writing.  Having said that, the last two seasons were still better than most of the pap on TV today.
B0006J28KU|5.0|My son has been looking for this DVD and was quite excited I was able to locate one for him for Christmas.  It arrived in just a few short days and it was just as described.  The price was better than a local movie store was giving me.

Although the trading styles may be different, there is similarity between the psychological behaviour of all the winning traders Jack Schwager interviews.  Its the responses of the winning traders and their advice that is priceless.
B000H5V8DG|4.0|I got this for my Husband for Christmas...and He loved it. We had already seen the whole series but it's fun watching it again and trying to pick up on all the things that we missed. It Also comes in a really neat box.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|My girls are 7 and 5 and love, love, love this movie.  They have watched it many times and never get tired of it.  As a parent, I think it is a great movie for kids to watch.  There is no sex, violence or language that needs to be monitored.  It is a great movie for girls.  The music is good too.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Puchased this because I love the movie. This Soundtrack is enjoyable, but did notice some of the songs on this were not in the movie or sounded different, I end up skipping through songs to ones I'm familiar with.. Not sure if I needed to buy both CDs to have all the songs? Think you have to. Overall worth it..
B000I5X81A|5.0|As others, Clapton is always great listening.  This is a good traveling CD.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie is among the top 10 of my favourite movies of all time!    It not only honours the life and achievments of the great Christian man Alvin York, it honours many truths of the Christian faith, God's power to to transform sinners, the virtue of forgiving your enemies, putting God before man, the virtue of earning an honest livelihood.    Though it does all this, it is not a \\"preachy\\" movie, it simply tells the amazing story of a simple farmer who becomes the greatest hero of WW1.    Other movies in my top 10 include: It's a Wonderful Life, Forrest gump, Shawshank Redemption, To End All Wars, Les Misérables.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Even though I purchased a Region 1 (USA) set it still worked on my DVD player when I am Region 4 (Australia). So don't panic if you have ordered this set and you live in Australia - most DVD players can play Region 1 DVDs, however check your product specifications on the DVD player. Some Players can be 'unlocked' to play them. That way you don't need to send it back or sell it without using it.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|C'mon Al let's get real and stop twisting the facts and only using extremists as your sources.  Fact 1: In the last 30 years the average annual temperature has gone up .6 degrees.  (6 tenths of one degree) That's not even one full degree in 30 years! The reason it looks so dramatic is the graphic is magnified to the point that makes it look like we are facing large temperature rises.  Anyone who doesn't these this as a political movie is just plain blind or incredibly naive.  Fact 2: The true scientific consensus is that even if the temperature rises as Al claims, the rise of sea level will be only 2 feet as compared with Al's claim of 20 feet.  The 20 feet claim is laughable mainstream scientists.  Fact 3: Scientists can prove that the earth has had many cooling and warming cycles for thousands of years, long before man could possibly contribute to it.  Funny how these cycles have never destroyed the earth before.  Fact 4: Mainstream scientists have been studying one such naturally occurring warming cycle that was a recent as the Middle Ages around 1200 to 1400 AD. (Again, this was during a time in which man had no industrial mean to pollute.) Fact 5: Scientists have proven that there are and always been natural variations in the ozone layer caused by atmospheric changes and natural disasters.  Fact 6: One volcanic eruption causes far more pollution and Co2 gases than the entire earth population in a year and there are far more volcanic eruptions every year than people realize.  Fact 7: Extremists (and AL) are attempting to get congress to label Co2 gases as a pollutant.  Folks, WE EXHALE Co2!  The extremists want to label our very lives as pollutants to \\"mother\\" earth as though we are an infestation to the very environment in which we were meant to live. How can anyone believe anything they say?  Once they label us pollutants they can further regulate and control our lives. (Think Euthanasia and Abortion)  Fact 8:  Less than 20% of scientists believe global warming is happening due to man's pollution if at all. The most honest ones claim not to know for certain.  Environmentalists enlist scientists sympathetic to their cause which are looking to support their claims. A true scientist seeks the truth, not a way to prove something he/she believes in by only looking at what supports their cause and ignoring everything else.  Which leads me to Fact 9: Even if we are in a warming cycle there is absolutely NO PROOF that man is causing it.  The forces of nature and the magnitude of the Earth are so vast that it is far too incomprehensible for our limited minds to grasp with a true understanding.  To think that we are capable of destroying it so easily is sheer arrogance on our part.  Fact 10:  According to the Carter administrations so-called research we were supposed to run out of oil before the year 2000. This is yet another false scare tactic.  Fact 11: Some of us are old enough to remember the scare tactic of the early 1970's when it was that we would be facing another Ice Age very soon. More Scare Tactics try Bird Flu.  Fact 12: Bird Flu has killed 38 people world wide and has not shown a tendency to be transferred to humans.  38 People!  That's your epidemic. <br />To conclude, this doesn't mean people shouldn't do their part in trying to keep the environment clean but we don't have to go to extremes to do so.  Nobody wants polluted drinking water and nobody wants to destroy the environment. Al Gore hugely over states his so-called results to sensationalize his material.  His film is a huge tribute to him being one of the early ones to discover this just like he invented the Internet.  Fact 13: We have more trees today than we did 30 years ago as part of our programs to keep renewing our resources.  How many more stories and scare tactics must we endure before we realize the falsehoods and agendas contained in their arguments. Everyone needs to look at the Chicken Little story and stop the panic. The sky is not falling. <br />
B000024O2Q|4.0|I have most of Maiden's music already, but this is nice CD to have if you are starting to get into the band.  I think 'Virus' might have been released as a single, but it doesn't appear on any album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of those things you either fall completely in love with or you can't stand. I am in category one, after purchasing the complete DVD-set. It kept impressing me; there are no bad episodes, great actors, a story you want to know more about, plenty of exciting extramaterials - I could go on for a long time. Too bad Fox Network didn't take better care of what fell in their lap. But still, one of the better shows out there - buy this and some snacks and you've got your weekend set! ;)
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have no doubt George Martin understands the danger of tampering with a catalog of music loved, cherished, and, most importantly, very well known by millions of fans.  Given his intimate knowledge of The Beatles' music as well as their creative vision as they crafted it, no one is better qualified to take on a project like this.  This engaging and diverse collection of material, presented in a thoughtful collage format, is an unqualified success.  Even purists must concede that every masterpiece is never more than a snapshot in time and perfection is ever a moving target.  Tackling an entire catalog of work after the fact, including outtakes and alternate versions, presents opportunities that simply aren't available during the course of its original creation.  Mr. Martin skillfully explores those opportunities with loving respect, reintroducing a timeless legacy to yet another generation of fans and reminding the rest of us that The Beatles' place in music history is not only secure but will be alive and well for countless years to come.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Elisir was Donizetti's most successful opera, and with a performance like this I can see why. Netrebko and Villazon were both outstanding in singing and acting and fit their roles perfectly. Although the remainder of the cast was not of their high standard, they were more than adequate. <br />The performers made it appear that they were thoroughly enjoying themselves. <br /> <br />The staging was traditional and appropriate (although one set was used for all the scenes).  <br /> <br />I don't understand Erik Moe's comment that he thought Netrebko was unprofessional in applauding Belcore and Nemorino, Her applause, which was for their actions as characters in the opera (not for their singing) was appropriate for the character of Adina. (Nemorino juggled fruit, not balls as Eric Moe said in his review.) <br /> <br />This is a performance I think even non opera lovers would enjoy. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Hey abazzio, I'd rather sit through having my wisdom teeth pulled (all four at once, try that) then sit through this piece of garbage again. <br /> <br />Anyway, this movie is not funny, it's flat out D-U-M-B. How anyone can find this funny is beyond me. Oh, and to be totally honest, I made it about halfway through before I turned it off. This movie is annoying, and lacks any humor whatsoever. It's like someone telling a joke, and you're practically dying to slit your wrists before he/she even comes close to the punch line. I'd rather sit through Ghandi again then have to suffer the entirety of this moronathon.
B0009VBTA0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Andreas Vollenweider, in fact I purchased \\"Caverna Magica\\" when it was first released on vinyl. I have several of his albums which I've recently purchased on cd. The sound of his harp is truly mesmerizing!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Very well done. This video explains the science behind global warming in a way that is easy to understand. It also shows a side of Al Gore we did not see much of in the presidential campaign - funny, passionate and human. Shows how we can no longer afford to ignore this issue and what we can do to slow and even reverse the effects of global warming. Get a copy and loan it to all your friends.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Very professional presentation of irrefutable data.  Limited political pandering.  Gore proves to be quite personable.  He relates to the audience in a way that encourages action for fear of severe consequences.  A must see.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|I got this album from a friend who told me that it was one of those albums that had really gotten under his skin, and that I had to listen to it a few times to give it a chance.  I liked some of the songs right off: worms, place aside, safe in your arms; I was definitely prone to skipping around a lot.  As I kept listening, though, I started to see new things in almost all of the songs and the album as a whole really started to get to me.  Her lyrics are incredible, phrasing things that I had felt but hadn't been able to articulate, and she has a particular way of emphasizing the important things with subtle vocal changes, like the repeated lines at the end of pieces of sky: \\"there's so many people who need to know that you're still with them even when they don't know\\" and her voice rises and almost cracks on the 'you're'.  In contrast to the sort of numb feel of the rest of the song, it highlights the desperate attempt to accept that it's over and time to move on.  I find myself doing that a lot with this album, analyzing little things...and I recommend it to pretty much anyone who likes that kind of thing, especially someone trying to come to terms with their own complicated relationship issues (which, really, is most people).

B000056HE9|5.0|Well really, who wouldn't want an angel who looked like Cary Grant?? This is a huge Christmas classic at my house. The re-make, \\"The Preachers Wife\\", was sort of an insult to those of us who love this movie. Cary Grant, as always, is absolutely impeccable AND a touch mischievious. David Niven is not at all loveable in this film but that's his problem so...he's forgiven. If you haven't ever seen this, you're missing a wonderful Christmas classic that reminds us of what is really important. FAMILY.
B00000IZOR|4.0|The phone is cute and reminds me of the phones when I was a kid. But, the cord to the reciever is way too short and the pull string is way to long. Be careful, I think I might make the pull string shorter.
B000JSI7BM|4.0|I purchased this for my wife for Christmas as a way to get her excited about the possibilities of the Blu-Ray format, and I was delighted to find that it is quite actually, a very solid film. Meryl Streep really lives up to the tag-line \\"Hell on heels\\". She made this movie as the tyrannical fashion magazine mogul Miranda Priestly. While I was pleased with Anne Hathaway's performance, unfortunately, this feels like it is another one of her \\"Dowdy ditz to intelligent knockout\\" roles. I fear that she's been type-cast, and she won't be able to shake that label throughout her career. It doesn't make or break this film, but it would be nice to see her expand her horizons a little more somewhat. Stanley Tucci also does an excellent job with his character Nigel, helping add comedic content whenever needed.   <br /> <br />This is a solid movie on it's own merits, but watching it on Blu-Ray really helps bring out the best the film has to offer. Unbelievable picture and sound quality really help immerse the viewer, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Considering going into this film I had to ask my wife what Prada was, in spite of myself I need to stress that this is a good movie for couples to enjoy together. It is highly enjoyable, and has just enough \\"oomph\\" mixed in (mostly provided by Streep's merciless character) to make any guy feel like he didn't just get suckered into watching a \\"chick flick\\".
0767903862|4.0|This is a hysterically entertainingg book. I laughed out loud more than once while reading it. It is also very informative.One note-Bryson's humor can tend to be sarcastic, and he does not hold anything sacred.

B000059H9E|5.0|British crime writer Ruth Rendell gets credit for the original story of this film. But it's hard to picture the kind of darkly original psychological study that director Pedro Almodovar started with because his stamp is all over this film - that unmistakable mix of melodrama, steamy scenes of passion, and quirky comedy. Beefy Javier Bardem comes on strong here as the Russell Crowe of Spanish cinema, graduating from smoothly suited cop to sweaty, muscular disabled basketball player in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his apparent nemesis is a young man who has served time for the shooting that crippled him and is now out of prison and settling old scores, which involves romancing two strategically selected married women. (Don't want to give too much away here.) This being an Almodovar film, the young man is handsome and sweetly charming. Even his schemes, when we learn them, are more poignant than ill-willed.<br /><br />This is Almodovar's spin on film noir. Not as brilliant as \\"Talk to Her\\" and \\"All About My Mother,\\" but definitely worth a watch.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I saw the new Pride & Prejudice last night, and just as I hoped it is soooooooooooo romantic! Somehow this movie also manages to be hilarious, but in an understated, un-American sort of way. <br />Keira Knightly did an outstanding job of being her usual independent, outspoken, beautiful self in the part of Lizzy, she certainly re-defined the role from the A&E version, a little less refined and more earthy. <br />Matthew MacFayden did a fantastic job of minimizing Mr. Darcy's flaws to simply being shy. He hardly ever seems really pompous or prideful and is altogether quite adorable. <br />Donald Southerland was Mr. Bennett and though I didn't like him quite as much as the father in the A&E version he still did an outstanding job. <br />One of the flaws in this movie is that everyone but Kiera Knightly is so plain! Even Jane (played by Rosamund Pike - isn't that a beautiful name?), who is my favorite character in the story, seemed like she was trying to look like the A&E Jane. She was very sweet but also silly.  <br />The costumes are extremely well done, each character's wardrobe helps to further define his or her character - for instance moody Lizzy wears earth tones and sweet Jane wears pastels, Caroline Bingly wears fancy dresses made of rich looking material in much brighter colors and sleeker styles whereas the Bennetts wear simple dresses of rougher material. <br />The cinematography is fantastic, there are several scenes that are just amazing, I'm thinking especially of the scenes after Lizzy has rejected Mr. Darcy, the mirror scene, the walking through the mist scene and the viewing the landscape scene. This movie was filmed at some wonderful locations and we are given a few moments here and there to enjoy it. <br />Of course when turning a novel into a movie there has to be an enormous amount of editing, paring the book down into a manageable 2 hour long movie, so one or two characters have been cut out (I especially noticed Mr. Bingly's other sister & husband were missing) and others marginalized (Mr. Wickham's character especially) or under-developed (as in Mr. & Miss Bingly) but one would expect that. On the other hand there were some wonderful interpretations of scenes, especially during Mr. Darcy's proposals. <br />There were also a couple of additional lines that were stuck in as sort of an explanation for modern viewers as to what's going on, like when Miss Lucas accepts Mr. Collins proposal or another time when Lizzy and Mrs. Bennett are together, talking about Lydia's upcoming marriage, Lizzy says \\"Is that (marriage) all you think about?\\" and Mrs. Bennett says to Lizzy \\"Wait until you have five daughters.\\" It was quite comical.  <br />Thankfully, the movie remains pure and honorable. The flirts get themselves into awful trouble, the passive father receives his cupful of due shame, the aggressive silly mother, as silly as ever and never justified. The state of marriage is honored and physical affection between couples are, amazingly, kept sacred - they don't even kiss until after they are married! Marriage and family are honored, rather than belittled, and portrayed frankly but beautifully. <br />On the whole, this movie is just lovely! My husnbad even watched it with me and enjoyed it. I am sure I will watch it over and over.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|<br />The Fog of war is without a doubt the most captivating  <br />and insightful documentary produced on the Vietnam war from any of the key decision makers within the administration's of JFK and LBJ. Robert McNamara offers a candid insiders view of the decision making process, the results and the lessons learned. He has been a witness to many of the events which shaped our foreign policy from the beginning of World War two through the war in southeast Asia.  McNamara articulates in great detail the the chain of events which made the war in Vietnam unavoidable in light of the geopolitics of the time. His knowledge of the facts surrounding the War in the pacific and its aftermath is as fascinating as it is compelling. Ultimately McNamara himself comes across as sympathetic character who did what he thought was right for the country but who ultimately is struggling with the results and his place in history. I highly recommend this film. <br />
B0001HAISG|5.0|Last night we had a lovely little \\"family night\\" we spread a cloth over our bed and ate hot dogs in the bedroom like a picnic. Then we watched Peter Pan and I was so pleased with it that I let the girls watch it again today. It was just great.  <br />First of all they did such a fantastic job casting. Jeremy Sumpter who plays Peter is just brilliant and Rachel Hurd Wood who plays Wendy is perfect - she is a lively story teller, intelligent, spunky, romantic, adventurous and beautiful - the perfect child-heroine. <br />Olivia Williams who plays Mrs. Darling (who I've also seen in the Emma Thompson/Hugh Grant \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" as Jane Fairfax) is just gorgeous and though her scenes are few they are priceless!  <br />Then, of course there is Jason Isaacs who is perfectly amazing playing both the timid and mumbling Mr. Darling and the cruel villain Capt. James Hook. He is mean, lying and ruthless, but not too scary - bravo!  <br />The various Pirates are varying degrees of scary (but nothing at all compared to \\"the Pirates of the Caribbean\\") and there are some scary mermaids which we only get to see for a minute, but which, in my opinion, was a minute too much, my girls were talking about the \\"bully ladies in the water\\" all evening! <br />Okay, back to the good parts of the movie, the story unfolds so naturally and whimsically, it has lots of romantic moments and lots of pirate-y sword-fights with dashes of humor sprinkled here and there, especially from the most sdoreable Lost Boys. It follows pretty faithfully the story of Peter Pan that I have always heard (from that musical Peter Pan with a Mary Martin playing Peter and they fly on strings - you remember that one?) except that they allow Hook to fly at the end, which worked wonderfully. I really loved how they showed that wanting to be a child and just play all of the time was not really worth pursuing, that it was good to grow up, that yes, it meant going to school and working hard and putting away some of one's dreams that it also offered things that children can not truly experience like womanly love and manly bravery, rather than childish attraction and a boyish spirit of adventure. <br />Everything about this movie is well balanced, not too scary, not too fantastic, not too dark, not too childish. It is definitely a true \\"family film\\" not just a children's movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

At first the book's illustrations appear confusing, but with a little study and cross referencing inside the book, you should see rapid improvement in your ability to grasp the author's solutions. If a certain variation still proves difficult, you can always go to a link on the web where some links provide color-coded versions for Ashley's knots.

B000JBWWQ0|1.0|I was expired with the book and bought the CD after encountered an add in Amazon. <br />But the movie is very week, it does not show any spiritual experience <br />It's not easy to show it in the movie but possible <br />Sorry
B00008G9JO|4.0|While the imagery is (for me) not as strong as it's predecessor, I can still strongly reccomend this album to all but Tull neophites.<br /><br />The music & performances are solid as any & Mr. Anderson is in fine form.<br /><br />I've seen \\"the boys\\" play a few times, though, and any recording (like those for say, Disco Biscuits, now) is pale beside a live setting. Nonetheless, I'd reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys Tull's brand of rock & art. Listen to it a couple of times right away. There are tracks here that definitely grow on you.<br /><br />Enjoy!
6301967992|1.0|Laughably awful... though, I suppose a success on some level. Purchased for my father, who got a kick out of it.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am enjoying the DVD series of \\"Friends\\" purchased through Amazon.  Purchasing the series was simple with no complications.  The product was delivered promptly.  I would use Amazon in any future product purchases.
B00013F38K|5.0|My husband and I grew up watching this series and now we are introducing it to our kids.  The teachings of Master Po to Grashopper during the flashbacks are great and can be applied to nowadays. <br />We are very happy with it and we are planning on buying Season 2! <br />Thanks, <br />mconn
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan has always been one of my favourite Disney films. This DVD edition did not disappoint either. It showcased the film at its best optimal colours and sound quality. I feel that it is a value-for-money purchase and it is definitely for keeps as I get to trawl through all the special add-ons within the menu.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Fantastic CD. Purchased two as gifts and the receivers are extremely pleased and happy with the CD. A must for any BABS fan!
B000ICLHIE|1.0|This 3 CD compilation is great. each cd has a 'theme' - you may tend to like one more than the other - but all 3 are Waits at his best.  VERY happy with this purchase.  Waits is just such a great poet!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ok now I agree with most posts who say that this album is a little more of an aquired taste. You really have to give it a couple of tries to really let it sink in. When I first listened to it i was a little dissatisfied. So I threw it in its case for the next couple of weeks. The next few times I listened to it it started to get better and better to where now its one of my favorite Tool CDs. It's unfair to compare it to lataralus especially given the progressive rock nature of the band. No 2 tool albums are going to sound the same. What I found with 10000 Days is a more matured and refined side of Tool. The dynamics of this album are right on. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the composition of the album which is why I can't understand why one would slam this album. If you don't like it, give it a couple more tries and I'm sure you'll learn to appreciate it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al is certainly a great speaker ! <br />His materials are exciting ! <br />What a good way to wake up everybody on this subject !
0740748475|5.0|I used to read these books when I was in middle school and high school, and can remember looking for them every Sunday in the papers also. <br /> <br />I purchased this collection when it came out, and I was thrilled when I received it.  The case is very sturdy and the books are all bound very well.  The foreword from Bill Watterson is fantastic. <br /> <br />Reading this collection transports me back to my childhood every time I pull a book out.  I had forgotten how much I love that little scamp Calvin until I picked this up. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall is amazing no matter whether she's live or in studio recording.  This is her first live album and is based on a lot of jazz standards.  What I like is this has the energy of a live album, but someone has engineered most of the audience sussurus out.
B000CPWDO4|5.0|I first heard Paladin Charge! in 1973/4. I always held fond memories of the album but lost touch with it completely as I only had a tape that disappeared.<br /><br />I am stunned, this album is fantastic! Hearing again after more than 30 years the wonderful 'Watching the world pass by' was a real treat. A fantastic rocking, headbanging track with an Irish jig interspersed and wailing mouth organ lulling you in. Then the outrageous guitar solo that goes on and on.<br /><br />With the general revived interst in the halcyon days of 'Heavy Rock' this album could bring so much pleasure to younger people. If only they knew!!!<br /><br />If you are not sure, just buy it. It is worth every penny.
1559408898|2.0|Don't get me wrong.I enjoyed watching Robo-Cop.I've seen it more than once,and if I had nothing better to do on a weekday night with friends,I would probably watch it again. That being said;this is not a timeless classic which deserves to be a Criterion Collection Standard. This movie should only last as long as popular,topical entertainment value films inevitably do. There is nothing ground-breaking here,nothing particularly interesting cinemagraphically,just a C+ to B average piece of entertainment. When held against the stature of Verhoeven's 4th Man,(Robert Englund's favorite horror movie),and Soldier of Orange,this film even takes a HUGE step down from entertaining,to a personal embarrassment for Paul!
B000JK8OYU|3.0|The Beatles are simply the best.  No group has come close to the creating music of the lasting quality and heart they did.  This album contains great songs, ruined by the Martins.  George Martin truly was the 5th Beatle, and when you listen to the Beatle anthologies and then their finished products, you can see the role in played in polishing and enhancing the raw originals.  But this time he should have stayed in retirement. <br />Remember when as a kid, you'd get a new album and run home to your room to listen to it, only to have you mom running the vacuum cleaner in the hall, making impossible to really hear the songs?  That is what the Martins have done - attached a constant interference in the background that makes this experience like trying to listen to music with a chainsaw droning on in the background.  My advice is to stick with the originals - these versions will disappoint. They grate on you and irritate your serenity.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Great movie, my 2-year old daughter loved it - that is the best barometer for success that I know, for these type films!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I have just discovered an appreciation for Celtic Music and this CD is the reason.  After seeing and hearing Celtic Women on PBS I had to have more.  Purity of voice, absolute delightful selections and a broadening of my musical appreciation to new vistas make this one of my favorites.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD every minustes. It takes aways you stress just like that. I recommended you to try it once and you will know what I'm talking about.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I am all up  to date now. I had missed some shows.
0140557741|5.0|I've seen this book in TV. They were saying that it was a fantastic book to show to our childrens that were starting to be interested in reading. <br />When the book arrived I realised that they were correct. <br />Just have a look and I'm sure all of you will think like me. <br />The Amazon service is perfect
B000IOM1RI|4.0|I loved the movie, and the music contained therein. Logically, I dig the soundtrack too. Although Tenacious D are somewhat of a joke band, they are making some of the best new music out there. They pay tribute to styles of the past and add their own unmistakable, pseudo-pompous attitude do it. The riffs are extremely tasty, in accordance with past D material, and the songwriting is still well above average. Also the lyrics remain quite humorous, although they aren't as clever as those found on their debut, and sometimes lose meaning outside the movie. \\"Kickapoo\\" kicks the album off to a good start. This mini epic features both Meat Loaf and Ronnie James Dio. \\"Classico\\" is pretty pointless, but features Kyle Gass playing a cool medley of some classical songs, as well as some impressive vocals by Jack Black. \\"History\\" is the D's immortal theme song. It has a cool melody, but seems like it ought to be longer. Unfortunately, except for the joke value, the next few songs are not really worth repeat listenings. The whole thing kicks into high gear again with \\"Beelzeboss,\\" which is their best song to date. At over 5 minutes, it's very long by Tenacious D standards, and contains several distinct sections which chronicle Jack and Kyle's climactic battle with Satan. After that, \\"Pod,\\" the theme song for the movie, keeps things moving at a good, catchy pace. I like the lyrics for \\"The Metal,\\" but I just don't like the song all that much. Overall, fans of Tenacious D will want to have this one around.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Purchased off my husband's wish list,but discovered he already had it. He is going to give it to a friend. He forgot to remove it from his list.
1401308201|5.0|Fantastic book! My cousin bought it for me about a year ago, and to this day I find myself reading it over and over again, every time finding something new and interesting about \\"Wicked\\".  I read the script provided in the book, and they even have the lyrics to the songs in green, so you know if the characters are singing or just talking.  I find myself singing the songs out loud, while going through the scenes in my head!  The colored pictures, are amazing and make me appreciate how much work goes into making such a successful musical and making it a truely unforgettable experience that will leave \\"a handprint on your heart\\".  Great book.....BUY IT!!
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This CD is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys easy listening or a romantic evening with your special someone.  I bought this is a gift for someone and decided to keep it for myself.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I love this movie as Fred Astaire is one of my favorite entertainers...excellent..I watch it each Xmas as my first holiday movie.
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie is a fun and entertaining animated film that makes you think about what is important in life.  The characters are engaging and the details of the animation along with the interesting story line make it interesting for adults and children.  My 2 year old says \\"Ka-chow!\\" every time he sees something related to \\"Cars\\" and with it's popularity, I am hearing a lot of them.
B000002KIE|5.0|I love this CD. I had the album in college in the early 80's and this takes me right back.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Campy and overwrought?  Maybe.  Great and fun?  Definitely.  There is a reason \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" remains popular to this day - it is packed full of well-written songs that the Loaf belts out with no shortage of passion and musical ability.  \\"Bat\\" is a real blast from the past for those of us of a certain age.  But its universal thematic and musical appeal is such that classic rock lovers of all ages are likely to enjoy it.  Interestingly, women seem to really love this album more than men do.<br /><br />One thing is certain: you will either love or hate this album.  Just read the reviews below to get a sense of that.  Consequently, this is probably not the right album to purchase blind.  Borrow it from a friend first, or just wait for \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" on your local or satellite rock radio station.<br /><br />As an aside, fans of the Loaf should not miss his standout performance in \\"Fight Club.\\"
B000088E6D|5.0|I ordered this CD from Amazon because I could not find it in any stores and I was very happy to find it here.  I ordered four of them for Christmas gifts and it was a last minute decision.  I received them in time and it is just a great CD.  A modern Frank Sinatra sound.  Great to listen to.
0743289412|2.0|First off I'm a big S.K. fan but for me this story ...well,it just didn't grab me like his stories usually do. I very rarely give up on a book, but this one was close. It seemed like there was no flow to the story and the characters weren't interesting. I think most KIng fans will be dissapointed.Still, I'll buy his next novel.
0763621803|5.0|These books are so great!  My 4 year old son loves them all and asks for them to be read to him over and over again.  Whenever he's introduced to new food he'll say \\"I never eat tomatos\\" as he puts the food in his mouth to try.  He totally gets this book! :)
B000HCO83Q|5.0|This movie IS without any doubt the best X Men movie. When I saw the first X Men, I thought it was Ok, not so outstanding but not good enough to say it was great. The second one has a great opening secuence, but unfourtunelly the rest of the movie lacks completely of that emotion or tension. But this third part got me at the edge of my seat, great secuences, a lot of action, great visual effects and of course, the last battle is amazing!!<br /><br />I actually have not the first and second movies, only this one, so if you are thinking about getting it, don't think it and get it!
6305907145|3.0|If you are the type of person who finds Jane Austen a bit too tame, you will enjoy this treatment of the most square of her novels.  If you like the Keira Knightley version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" chances are that you will be delighted with this \\"Mansfield Park.\\"  For the purist, for those who appreciate the plots and repartee of the Austen novels, this one is rather irritating - although it can be fun to keep track of two things: <br />omissions and additions.  There are plenty of both in this version, although many of the visual effects are quite stunning.
B000G75AE8|4.0|My favorite Slayer album is God Hates us all, and I'm a little disapointed because I usually think they are better each time around. This is (and I don't mean this as a negative) not one of their best, and I really don't like the production. It's mediocre. I think the guitar just don't punch in as much impact as they could, but overall it is good. Slayer is Slayer, and the best thing about them, is they never changed, you know what you are getting. <br /> <br />And what is it with some people and their reviews? One person said he's a Slayer fan and gave this 2 stars, saying it was their best since Season... <br />if you thing everything Slayer has done post 1990 is so bad, then you care more about nostolgia than the music, and there really isn't anything Slayer can do (except re-record Reign in Blood) that will satisfy you.
B000GYI32M|5.0|My daughter loves the OC...in fact, I've also purchased both the 1st and 2nd season so when she got the 3rd season, she had to start over from the beginning.
B00005JO9J|5.0|GREAT SERVICE. ITEM ARRIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED AND IN GREAT CONDITION. THANKS AMAZON!!!!1
0307237699|5.0|This is an open and direct expression of man about his political life and hopes.  I find it easy to read and inspirational.
B000022TSW|4.0|Great movie so funny i like the show a lot, it isn't fun  as seen the season episodes but if your are a true fan, you can't miss it
031236198X|3.0|There are six main characters in this story.  These six characters make up the leadership team charged with helping the penguins find a solution to their melting iceberg problem.  Why is only one of these team members a female?  The fable isn't bad, and the 8 steps are worth considering, but this 5-1 ratio turned me off from the get-go.  Tell me I'm not the only one bothered by this.
B000H305U0|5.0|This entire album is HOT!  I've listened to it everyday for 3 weeks!  He's come such a long way and grown up so much.  What a super talented (and sexy) guy!
B000J103PC|5.0|I bought The Devil Wears Prada as a holiday deversion and it did just that.  The movie is funny and the performances are wonderful.  Meryl Streep is amazing as a very hard woman who wants more out of life but can not give up her position in life.  Yes, this is a chic flic but as a man, I did enjoy it to.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Excellently done, down to earth, realistic if not too conservative in it's predictions. I would wish that more of our politicians, here in Switzerland as well as in the US of A would pay more attention to our environment and would finally dare to set and enforce limits on our highway robers in usually dark business suits.
0812550706|5.0|I had heard about this book from many different people who said they really enjoyed it.  I am usually a hardcore fantasy reader but thought I would give it a try.  I found this book so intriguing and well written that I could not put it down.  I read it in just two days.  The fact that it is written in the first person and you actually read Ender's thoughts in real time was the best.  I think this is the reason that both nights after reading this book I dreamt about being in the battle room and playing the game.  I recommend this book to anyone, not just science fiction readers.
B000G759LW|5.0|I have alwyas been a fan of Christina but never purchased any of her music until now. <br />This was a great start with a wide range of subjects for her tremendous voice. It has been very nice to see a young lady these days be sassy without being trashy AND have so much talent and use it wisely! <br />I hope she continues to thrive and maintain her integrity.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I bought the dancing Gizmo for my 1 year old daughter. She is completely fascinated by a vintage plastic Gizmo that she saw at an antique toy show I took her to. Since the Gremlins movie has a special place in my heart from childhood(I still have my lunchbox), you can imagine my surprise and joy when my daughter saw the Plastic Gizmo, picked it up and proceeded to cradle it like a baby! The dancing Gizmo is a great product - it's the perfect size to put on a desk, shelf, etc. It is sound activated and sings just like the mogwai did in the movie. Also, it's not obnoxciously loud like some sound toys can be. Excellent product!
1581806574|5.0|My nephew (9 yrs old) loves to draw - especially dragons. I think this was his favorite gift he got for xmas.  Forget about opening other gifts and playing with his cousins...he immediately got a pencil and paper and started drawing.  I would definitely recommend this book to other children or adults that like to draw dragons/fantasy creatures.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I don't rant and rave about much of anything, but I just had to share my thoughts on this beautiful and talented artist. I caught glimpses of Corinne Bailey Rae on the radio and her video \\"Put your records on\\" on tv, but never really noticed her. She finally got my attention with her performance of \\"Like A Star\\" on Saturday Night Live. It is such an amazing song. It inspired me to buy the CD, and Amazon had the right price. I put on her album one time...and I haven't stopped playing it since. I would describe her voice and her songs as soulful, innocent, passionate, truthful, one of a kind. She sings about young love with the voice and vocabulary of someone wise beyond her years. I'm positively hooked. Every day, I am entranced by a new track. \\"Breathless\\" is currently the first track I play. It is one of those rare CDs that you can just push play, listen from cover to cover and back again. I am so lucky to stumbled upon this gem. With the Grammy nominations and appearances on all the big TV shows, most recently Oprah, you should jump on the Corinne Bailey Rae bandwagon before you get left behind. Go. Buy. Now.
0307237699|5.0|This young man is perceptive and mature in his outlook, is self-revealing about his life, and writes beautifully.  I recommend this book to everyone who has not yet decided who they would like to see as our next president, as this charismatic, brilliant and gentle man is worthy of our consideration.  I hope to live long enough to see him in that office.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an excellent series and I am glad to finally own it.
B000JMK6LC|4.0|about the film one can argue, but the picture in hp DVD absolutely the hammer!
0316172324|4.0|After his earlier success with The Tipping Point, there must have been some pressure on this author to come up with another brilliant theory \\"on the cutting edge of neuroscience and  psychology\\" (the dust jacket proclaims).  Problem is, it isn't so easy to be so refreshing and revolutionary on schedule for publishing a new book every few years.  But then, relatively few authors have the resources of a staff writer for the NY Times.   <br /> <br />Malcolm Gladwell has compiled a lot of anecdotes together in a book about \\"the power of thinking without thinking\\", i.e. \\"thin-slicing\\".   Simply, the first two seconds of our decision-making process is largely subconscious and is when we filter the information we need to make snap judgements.  He enriches this premise by including a wealth of case studies from various fields; a military campaign, art historians at the Getty museum, political coups, relationship psychology, car salesman, police.  It makes for an entertaining read. <br /> <br />There are two problems with Blink as I see it.  First, thin-slicing is easily recognizable as a repackaged version of temperament theory described by Myers-Briggs as Intuition.  Everybody has some degree or another of Intuition, but some are born with greater natural tendencies to be Intuitive - and it's really not something that can be learned or honed. There seems to be a hint of purpose when Gladwell describes one psychologist's detailed method of analyzing videotapes of faces, but such a laborious process is the antithesis of intuition.  You really can't teach this instinct. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Blink really stretches points about how all its anecdotes connect to form this thin-slicing theory.  It fails to clearly define and investigate thin-slicing/intuition, barely scratching the surface of the phenomenon and even muddling the picture at times with examples of when thin-slicing fails us, without getting to the heart of why.  Interesting enough, but it doesn't hold together well. <br /> <br />I really gave Blink 3 stars based on its efforts to be new and original as a theory of psychology and/or sociology.  The long rambling stories interspersed throughout were absorbing and earned it an extra star for entertainment value.  Nice Effort. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />
B000JVT092|5.0|Again very well successful film, good story, Action and good actors! Thus knows the film groove further-recommend on Comic the films stands, and well to be maintained would like. The picture is clearly better correct, than on the DVD version. Greeting HD DVD
B000ICLHIE|5.0|This isn't a greatest hits collection, but it almost could be.  In some alternate universe, this could be all the high points from an artist's whole career - and a few spoken word pieces just to keep things weird.  So even though the real Tom Waits has a deep catalog of phenomenal compositions behind him, this stuff is pretty top-notch too.  For the most part.  But the best thing about it is that it functions as a fairly logical entry point into his world - arranged according to moods, each titled in such a way as to betray his allegiance to the people on the fringes of society.  When he half-raps about a seedy strip club, it's almost impossible to imagine that he DIDN'T just ramble into a voice recorder from two rows and three sheets back.  And when he describes being \\"lost at the bottom of the world,\\" it's hard to believe he DOESN'T ride the rails most of the time.  Speaking of which, that and about ten or more other songs on here make great lullabies, albeit dark ones.  But some of the best ones are pretty lyrically dark, if you think about it.   <br /> <br />If you're one of these people that simply can't stand his voice, this won't likely win you over, but if you love him for everything he is, this is a whole heap of it.  Intelligently arranged and presented, amazingly priced for what all comes with it, it's like a luxury for die-hard fans that even casual admirers can afford to splurge on.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|1 star is not a real reflection of how I rate this item. My review would not be eligible for submission if my real rating of - was submitted. -hopefully states the obvious i.e. I have abstained from rating this item at all.  <br />Why?  <br />Because I don't believe in the content? <br />Because it was filmed in a controversial manner? <br />No.  <br />I abstain because despite my best intentions the ordered DVD region is not compatible with my DVD player.  <br />Yes, I'd hoped that my mailing address, specifying my country, would also suggest the region I needed the DVD to be compatible with.  <br />Alas, when I attempted to play the DVD on opening \\"an inconvenient truth\\", in the form of the DVD player region and the DVD region incongruence, was revealed.  <br />Not sure what we can do about this as there isn't a place to specify your region with an Amazon order (no understanding that you mailing address is not enough). <br />Nonetheless do keep it in mind. <br />

B00011F5DK|5.0|This was a great family game we enjoyed over the holidays.  Shipper got it to us in time for Christmas.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you do nothing else this year, watch this film.  If you do only one other thing, buy several copies and give them to as many people as you can.  Ask only that they do the same if they are so moved.  Not only is the truth inconvenient, but it is inescapable.  We all have a part in the solution, and it is still within our grasp.  Watch this film, it is truly stunning.
B00005JOLI|3.0|Now I'm a book fanatic...and so what I write is my construtive criticism.And I know I'll get some mean remarks to this, but I need to say it! I saw Eragon(the movie) and then read the book. Well you know what? There are tons of differences! Big surprise right? But here is MY question...What movie based on a book doesn't have lots of differences? Look at the Harry Potter movies! And other movies for crying out loud! I'm sorry but some people are being VERY hypocritacle. I personally give this movie a 3 because of its differences and how the movie went too fast. But I still like it. And the book IS GREAT.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My family really enjoys this game. It's a nice break from the regulars. <br />Skill is what it takes.  FUN FUN FUN!
B00003CXAA|5.0|A must have for all the Godfather fans...your DVD collection is definitely incomplete without this
B000AM1TGC|5.0|Having only this album (are they still referred to as such?) and Defector (reviewed also) in the remastered editions, I must say that Voyage of the Acolyte sounds much better as such an edition.  Although I don't recall the exact words, I agree with a reviewer who characterizes some of the original tracks as sounding like recordings of LPs -- with all of their crackling, hissing flaws.  (My apologies to those who find such characteristics endearing.)  This is all corrected and enhanced in this new release.  The extra tracks, while nice, don't really offer that much new material.  The live version of the title track is okay (somewhat unique toward the end of the track), and the extended Shadow of the Hierophant really doesn't offer much that isn't heard in the shorter version; but for this album (and Defector) the remastering more than makes up for any shortcoming in the bonus material.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|The only downside on this soundtrack is that it is missing the Bay City Rollers song played at Sam's mother funeral.... Other than that it is superb...
0316066524|4.0|What can be said about this book that hasn't already been said? Wallace's giant masterpiece has already become a modern pop culture reference with people referring to it on television and other books as something to grapple over in terms of whether or not to read it or leave it on your bookshelf. I myself had left my copy on my shelf for over a year, wondering whether or not I wanted to brave the 1000 page book. I finally decided to read it after tackling Rushdie's \\"Satanic Verses,\\" a book that was sort of disappointing. Regardless, after hearing what everyone else had to say about this book, I knew I had to start my year crossing off one of the many books I had to read before I died. \\"Infinite Jest\\" did not disappoint. Wallace's prose is dazzling and is so detailed that this is not the kind of book you can skim through on the subway to have a full appreciation of the genius behind the sentences and the book as a whole. The levels and intricacies of the characters he has created is astounding - I know, I'm using quite a few superlatives, but there is nothing I can do - and this book is one of the best attempts at the \\"grand oeuvre\\" I have seen in a long time. The Incandenza family is a warped, post-modern collection of dysfunctional people whose lives once intersected, but have quickly diverged. My own favorite storyline, the one I found myself hoping to read between all of the different ones going on, was that of Hal, the gifted, drug-dependent tennis player trying to figure out his life. As a former junior tennis player, I must say that Wallace has provided a very clear picture of life as a tennis player, albeit one that involves a lot of drugs and weird occurences such as a kid who has his forehead stuck to a window and loses half his face trying to get it off.  <br /> <br />The main reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because trying to ingest everything that goes on and all of the minutiae that is present for no reason is hard to stomach for 1000 pages. It's just not necessary and not the kind of book that you enjoy in the same way as something more story-oriented. You don't get the same type of narrative satisfaction here that you would find in a Dickens or even McEwan novel. This novel is a stylistic gem, but beyond that, I'm not sure how to describe it. <br /> <br />Overall, a great work of literature that you should certainly tackle at some point in your life, but not something you should read on your commute to work.
B000J103OI|4.0|This film is many things at once - it is glib, succinct and fabulous - all at the same time! A great glimpse at the New York fashion world for real. Truly a Chick Flick and for enlightened others as well. Not unexpected, but very entertaining. Watch it, you'll like it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly and subsequently Serinity the follow up movie, will always stand as the bench mark for great TV and cinema.<br /><br />If you have never seen this series you have shorted your self real watching enjoyment.<br /><br />Every man wants to be Mal, the captain, and every man feels like Jane, hired gun.<br /><br />Stop wasting time reading reviews, get this today!!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Although it shows the behind the scenes activities leading up to 2 contests in the mid 70's there is more there if you look. It is actually more a look into the fragile psyches of men that on the surface are larger than life. It is almost painfull to see how they have masked their insecurities and damaged egos by overcompensating with their almost cartoon like proportions. A must view.
0670451495|5.0|This is a great story for children.  We bought the book for our daughter to use in the Speech and Hearing Clinic at OSU, and for her work with children at the public library story hour during the summer.
1582701709|5.0|If all your life you have been waiting for some information that puts things together, this book may be your answer. It is the glue that binds all spiritual teachings. The Secret cleared the clutter in my mind about how important our thought life is. I have recommended it to many and will continue to do so. <br />I haven't been this excited about any reading material ever! This is a \\"must read book\\" <br />Dee Harper
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is a very good movie of course, but Amazon holds the bag for pricing!
B000002C1W|5.0|If you are a Pink Floyd fan, this one is no disappointment.  Like Dark Side, this one delivers with great tunes, great lyrics, and smooth transitions from one cut to the next; something Pink Floyd has usually done very well.  It is my second favorite album from this band, not far behind Dark Side of the Moon.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Ray LaMontagne's music is hard to define.  It is soothing and mesmerizing and yet hold your attention to his perfect notes and words.  I love it.
B000FC2FVA|4.0|No one's making comparisons to the Strokes.  They should.  There are similarities in influences, phrasing, rhythm. <br /> <br />And if you've been disappointed in the Strokes recently, you'll be happy to know that Phoenix has no interest in emulating that downturn.  They can't.  They build better songs, they take more chances, they have a singer who can carry a tune.  They have made an album here that holds up very well to repeated listening.   <br /> <br />So, my point: \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" will go down well with fans of the Strokes.   <br /> <br />If you're not a fan, you'll like this Phoenix that much more.  It's great pop songs without the rumpled expensive suits.  The attitude is in the right place: in the songs.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Does this film really need another review?  If you haven't seen it, see it already.  I waited over ten years to finally get around to it, and I'm almost ashamed it took that long.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I have not yet received this item.  I am unable to provide my comments.  <br /> <br />Please let me know when the item can be expected.
1401201911|5.0|The notion of the infant Kal-El landing in the Soviet Union instead of the United States is enough to stir the imagination, and this book doesn't disappoint.  While true to the character of most of the personalities from the DC Comics universe, it manages to be neither formulaic nor predictable.  It's the sort of book that improves with re-reading, which is a rare pleasure in comics these days.   <br /> <br />WikiPedia has a pretty good entry if you're looking for a detailed synopsis (there are plenty of spoilers - be warned), but if the premise of the story interests you at all, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JOLI|2.0|I would first like to say that the books are SO much better.  As the title says, visually I thought the movie was done very well. Saphira(dragon) and Durza (shade) were done especially well.  Many other characters were also portrayed well from the describitions from the book.  Before the movie came out, i decided to read Eragon again, so it would be fresh in my mind.  As the movie progressed, quite fast in my opinion, I started to notice many events were out of order or completely cut out.  Four major character from the book that are needed for a sequel were cut out, Jeod (Brom's friend), Solembum (the werecat), a baby that Saphira blesses in the city of the drawves, and finally, the most important characters for a sequel the Twins (twin spellcasters).  If you read both books, you would also be dumbfounded on the movie not having these characters.  I could write a whole speel about what was supposed to happen and what did, but I don't want to ruin any surprises for people that haven't read the book yet. <br />Bottom line~Book=GREAT Movie=DISAPOINTING
0783219733|5.0|This movie is fun for viewers of all ages.  There are a couple of questionable scenes, but I would not have a problem with children watching this movie with me.  (I noted in other reviews that I believe parents should always watch movies or TV programs with their children.)<br /><br />I'm used to Dean Jones as the hero of countless Disney live action films.  Here, he plays the villain, and does a chilling job with it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this comedy, especially if you want something for the whole family.
0394873742|5.0|i bought this for my year and a half old niece and she immediately started playing with it by rolling on it and trying to hide inside it. it is the biggest book ever coming up to her chin. well worth the money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the biggest travesties in television history was when in their infinite wisdom, the Fox network decided to cancel 'Firefly'.  I, as I am sure is the case with many fans of original, interesting programmes (especially sci-fi) have a list a mile long of shows, that I grew to love, only to find them axed, far too soon, by TV execs who seem to think their viewing public wish it so. Clearly this is not the case however, otherwise there would not be so many reviews complaining about such decisions.  Out of all these shows, nothing disappointed me more than to see 'Firefly' cancelled, and I'll tell you why. Because it had so much potential, yet it never stood a chance.  I could go on to rant about how it was badly scheduled over in America but I'm sure everyone who is reading this write up knows about that so I'll start with the positives,that is to say, what do I love about 'Firefly'?<br /><br />Firstly, its an unlikely mixture: Cowboys, in space, that lapse into mandarin (especially when swearing, those censors never knew what hit 'em) but it works!  That's because of the very excellent Joss Whedon. His scripts brought warmth and depth to the characters as well as the subtle blend of action and humour,  which we have grown to know and love, see also 'Buffy' and 'Angel' for further reference to his writing abilities.  What Whedon does best is flesh out his leading protagonists so that they are actual people, with quirks and habits, not all of them good, but all of them things that we can relate to as human beings, so that they are more real.  It doesn't matter whether they are in a firefly class cargo vessel, or fighting vampires at some high school, Joss's people are simply that, people. They have heartaches and times in between the adventures that are just like you or I, where they sit and talk and laugh and cry.<br /><br />In the case of 'Firefly' its things like, rivalry in the crew, romantic entanglements (and sometimes the lack there of) and basically trying to survive out there in 'the black' far from what is considered to be civilisation.  They are little people living big lives on the edge, despite the inevitable interferance of the alliance (a vast governmental agency that often gets in the way, as governments have a tendency of doing).<br /><br />Another reason to watch, personally speaking is the rather lovely, Mr Nathan Fillion.  I have been a fan of his work for some time and he does wear those unbelievably, tight trousers (what can I say I'm only human), hence Kaylee's nickname of 'Cpt'n Tight Pants' (see Shindig).  Before I lose all credibility can I just say, he is also a talented actor who helps gel the cast together as indeed the crew in his capacity as Cpt. Malcolm Reynolds.  And what a crew, every character has their own specific traits that make them appealing, even Jayne (well maybe appealing isn't quite the right word in his particular case).  It's also worth mentioning that there is an actual married couple on board. They have arguements at times as couples often do but basically they are completely devoted to one another. If anything was set to sway me on the marriage vote it would be Wash and Zoe. They are solid and look set to remain so, barring any unforseen circumstances. I've seen 'Serenity' so I refuse to say more on that subject...sigh.<br /><br />Finally onto the feature film.  I was so glad to see that after such relentless campaigning, loyal 'browncoats' were able to get 'Serenity' another outing, hopefully not for the last time.  Though another series of 'Firefly' seems like nothing but a beautiful dream, lets hope movie execs will have seen the awesome response to the dvd release both in America and over here in England, and also the impact of the movie and give a much loved little show more time on the big screen.  Here's hoping.  In the mean time as the lyrics say so clearly 'You can't take the sky from me.'ing to survive out there in 'the black' far from what is considered to be civilisation.

B0000047D5|4.0|Fantastic work by Veurve to recreate this on CD <br /> <br />Sounds just great
B000ENWKN8|2.0|Rob Zombie has lost a few steps when it comes to good music. There are only two or three tracks on here worth listening to. At least he's making good movies. I guess he spread himself too thin.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Incredible!!!!   So much talent in one show!!!   Anyone who appreciates great guitar work must have this one.  I just wish I could have attended the live show!!
B000F0UUIM|5.0|John Wayne at his best.  The intensity of the character, the scenery, the story, all wonderfully blended together into a superb film.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I love Josh's voice, but this isn't my favorite CD of his.  Just doesn't seem to grab you like his earlier ones.
B000059LGC|5.0|What a great movie! I remember watching it as a kid and had to see it again! Just gets better with time! All star cast with such theatrical acting! If you've never seen the movie before, you'd never guess who dunn it! They just don't make movies like this today.  This stimulates the mind without all the gore.  Very comical, too.  Highly recommended.
0060531053|5.0|Though I have not yet read the entire book, this is a highly entertaining read that is also full of interesting and useful information. For anyone interested in starting to homebrew, I highly recommend this book. As others have stated; this truly is the bible of homebrewing.
0679809015|5.0|My 1-year-old loves this book! It is small so he can hold it himself and it fits in the diaper bag. He loves the animals and finding them hidden behind the flaps. I can't tell you how many times we've read it since Christmas. I would definitely recommend it.
B00003CXD0|5.0|This is Dustin Hoffman's best movie. This movie has been voted the one of the best comical films of all time! You will laugh and feel his pain as he becomes Dorthy Michaels to earn money as an actor! Brief nudiety so beware if you have children with you when you watch!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I really enjoy this different take on all the urban legends / ghost stories, etc.  I feel that the show really draws you in with both the characters, Sam and Dean, and the plot lines.  I have been scared more than once!  I hope to see Supernatural continue as there are many more ghost stories they haven't gotten to!
1569242739|5.0|Holy tofu, Batman! These are the BEST cupcakes I have ever had and I have friends who agree!  I love the fact that the batches bake 'only' 12 so I can make varying kinds if I need quite a few.  I'm very lucky to have friends to do my taste-testing for me - and they think they're lucky, too! As an avowed /confirmed/ commited vegan, I do agree - these will take over the world and bring PEACE to , well maybe not the Middle East, but hopefully to the billions of animals slaughtered each year for no better reason than human taste buds.  Ladies, thank you, keep cookin'  - and please join my friends and I at the very first (annual - we hope) NY's Capital Region Vegetarian Expo to be held 9/15/07 at the Saratoga Springs Civic Center in 'upstate' NY.  It's a mere drive up the Thruway - we'd love to see you there. [our website's not ready yet or I'd refer you to it  :-(  ]  If you're interested in either the Expo or maybe sponsoring/donating books for fundraisers, etc, please contact me.  We're a 501(c)(3).  You're fantastic!
0618680004|3.0|I think a radical atheist is just as bad as an evangelical/fundamentalist - just a different side of the spectrum. To say that if you believe in any kind of religion you must not be part of the educated elite is pompous. It's extremely difficult to prove both the existence of God and the non-existence unless you have died and returned (which as far as I know, Mr. Dawkins has not). As I have told people that have told me that I'm going to hell because I don't believe the way they do: \\"I'll let you know when I get there\\". Today's paper said Scientists and Evangelicals agree on Global Warming. Maybe there is hope yet.
0805017445|5.0|This book has lasting appeal for the toddler and preschool set.  My one year old has liked it for a long time and my two year old still finds it fascinating, reading it aloud from her memory.  This book is a great way to teach colors and animals.  Adults will like that they can change their voices to mimic each animal that is speaking.  Fun!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|How sex and love help us grow as individuals and add greater depth to our self-understanding. It's an exceptional film if you look at it as an exploration of how we break down our self-imposed limits, try new things, and - sometimes - discover whole new territories within ourselves.
B00000IQMT|5.0|Probably the greatest living contemporary American composer, John Williams brings life and emotion to all movie soundtracks.  I believe George Lucas animates Williams' scores, instead of the other way around;  otherwise, Star Wars would just be another science fiction series.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|true to fact as far as I know joaqin phoenix and reese witherspoon do a damn fine job!
B000J103PC|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife & we both loved the movie.  Meryl Streep is wicked as the evil boss.
B000J103YI|5.0|I was blown away by her performance, Simon Cowell, screwed up this one!! Fantasia and 782 others tried out for this part also and was beat out by Jennifer!!! Her vocals are phenomenal and all I can say is Beyonce Who, Whitney What!! Mariah When!! Diana How!! Truly anointed!! Jennifer we're rooten for you in the Oscars!! you deserve it!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an exciting new musical. It is filled with great songs that further the story along, good catchy music, and the singing is fabulous.  No wonder the show is immediately sold out everywhere it opens.  I predict a very long run.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|The very best!  Everyone who loves DM should add this to their collection.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD was purchased as a gift for my 12 yr. old granddaughter, who saw the play in Chicago.  Because she loved the play and enjoys singing along with the music, this was a very special gift.
B000GQY5O0|5.0|This book, first written in 1946, is incredible. It allows a \\"non-economics major\\" to understand basic priciples of economics as they relate to day to day life.  I've purchased many copies for gifts and was able recently, through the used book section, to acquire a 1948 paperback edition.  Reading the original text with the examples of that period (I was born in 1953!) is startling to say the least.  My reaction upon finishing my first read was \\"obviously, no politicians have read this book during my lifetime!\\" The current edition has updated examples that are no less true, just less dramatic if you are mis-lead to believe this is current/recent thought.  To realize these fundamental theories pre-date most of our lifetimes is amazing.   <br />I have recommended this be taught in high schools so the current and future generations can begin to think for themselves as they hear the rehashed misinformation presented by our media, our politicians and the 'activists' of the world. <br />The chapters on \\"Minimum Wages Laws\\" and \\"Do Unions Really Raise Wages?\\" are outstanding.  Whether you're \\"Red\\" or \\"Blue\\", you should read \\"The Truth\\" in this book!
B000002J6H|5.0|I remember playing this album many many times over the years since I was a teen - long ago.  I didn't like it when I first bought then it came to grow on me. It's a very intropsective album for me, I will tend to play it late at night sometimes.  Sit Yourself Down and Black Queen are the most memorable songs to me.
B000E41MS6|5.0|There isn't much to say about this collection other than if you haven't seen the new Dr. Who you definitely should give it a try. It's as good as the original series. My only beef with it is the fact that they return to earth too many times instead of going to different planets. The original series was more about travelling to distant planets but so far (even in the second season), it has all revolved around earth with a few exceptions of episodes taking place in space stations. Since we now have great CGI, it would be wonderful to see them travel to different places. This series is amazing and  again, if you enjoyed the orignal, I think you'll enjoy the new Dr. Who.
B000063V8T|5.0|Season 5 has the TNG cast at its best, with some of the most interesting, entertaining and challenging episodes of the entire Star Trek franchise. <br /> <br />However, we are all going to have to consider that \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" just may be becoming the best science fiction television series ever.  If you haven't checked it out yet, you should.  It is NOT like the 1979 version.
0064431789|5.0|My siste loved this, I loved this, Grimms' brothers would have loved it! Great pictures, simple words, frights and home for a warm bed!
B000I5X80G|4.0|This is classic Neil Young.  Excellent sound, lots of 70's music.  Just not enough to fill a CD.
B000IHY146|5.0|Well in the US of A you call them goosebumps, and that is what I listen to music for. This album is full of them for me - if you like say Tracy Chapman, Neil Young acoustic, Caruso, Lucinda Williams etc go out and buy this. Should you like electric violin and gypsy sounds then buy it for the track that Bobby Notkoff plays on alone - go on its worth every penny, sorry every cent! But then maybe you will have to buy Fred Neil albums, and Everybody Knows This is Nowhere by Neil Young and the Targets just to get more Bobby Notkoff! - by the way did you ever hear Fred Neil sing \\"Morning Dew\\" goosebumps on goosebumps?
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is the my first review on amazon, although I have been shoppng here for 4 years. When i went to see this in the theaters, I was a little wary because of some of the actors in it. After leaving the theater, I saw those actors in a new light. If your reading this review, then your thinking of buying it. Just do it. I cant relay how good this movie is through the phenomonal acting, directing, and story. 5 stars......anyone who says different, I WILL fight you!
B00005JLF5|4.0|I agree with another reviewer when they said that this series is perhaps the best of the Star Trek Genre. Watching the episodes again after so many years, it doesn't feel dated at all. Voyager was good at the time but now the dialogue and characters feel stale. TNG has Geordi's VISOR and other signs of time passing. DS9 has only Sisko's sudden change of hairstyle. The station is lovely; full of unexplained alien characters and shops. The best episodes deal with the postwar Bajoran/Cardassian baggage and the worst cover some annoying \\"new aliens\\" in a bit of show and tell episodes. The series opener demonstrates why there is no one but Avery Brooks for the job of Commander at that station. He is a new type of Captain, a father. Sure, Kirk was a father but you don't realize it until the movies. He has a sincere warmth about him, his New Orleans heritage, his relationship with Dax but he welds genuine authority when needed. Odo is also an interesting character, a little distrustful and insolent of people due to the outsider-like way he was regarded by the Cardassans and others. Quark is a marvel. I try to think he is annoying but he always makes me smile.The first season has some very great episodes, the best being the opener and Duet. Dax and Progress and even The Nagus have their interesting and informative point explaining a bit more about Trills, Bajorans and Ferengi. Babel, Move Along Home, Vortex, The Forsaken and most of the Passenger are forgettable and a bit annoying but worth seeing when you don't feel like thinking. Altogether the characters of Deep Space 9 and the atmosphere are just right. The special features disk also has a nice interview with Nana Visitor (Major Kira) as well as a great documentary on how the station was designed and the characters formed.
0694003611|5.0|This is the best bedtime story ever! It is so simple and familiar, that's why my daughter and neices loved this book so much. The board book is perfect for little hands to turn the pages. Hint: There is a tiny mouse on each page, and we always played a game where the kids had to find the mouse before turning the page. This book makes a great baby shower gift and is small enough to carry in the diaper bag.
1582701709|5.0|I thought it was well written and very surprised on how uplifting it was.
0399211667|4.0|Perfect for the preschool set. All five of my grandkids love this book.  Helps mitigate the \\"look, a spider...let's kill it\\" response to bugs.
6304712944|4.0|My parents asked for this DVD for Christmas and I gave it to them.  They love this movie and have enjoyed it for years now.  They were very happy to have received it and have watched it several times.  My sister borrowed it from them and is now watching too!
0448444216|2.0|My toddler loves the board book version of this book so I thought this book would be fun for her.  The flaps are awkward and frustrating for a 16 month old.  The flaps are so large it's just like turning regular pages, so why have the flaps?
B000J10EQU|5.0|My husband and I first rented this DVD and we were very happy with it so we purchased the DVD.  I was very happy with the attempts to make Superman look as much like Christopher Reeve as possible as well as sticking to the original plots and so forth.  I don't believe Lois Lane was a very good look alike, but I can't imagine there's someone out there who could fill that role quite the same.  Kudos to the producers.
B00009XITQ|5.0|My daughter had been wanting this movie for a while and we couldn't find it in any of the stores, she was very excited to finally get the movie.  She has enjoyed watching it over and over again.
B00006CXSS|4.0|My older son of two sons met the original men and the cast of actors in this dramatic series while he was stationed in Hawaii. He expressed awe over the amazing events these soldiers experienced and the sharp clarity with which these elderly men still expressed events all these years later. My younger son of 16 asked for the Band of Brothers DVD Set based on his brother's reaction, my young son's military interest, and the telecast of the series (on TV). <br />My teenage son was quite satisfied receiving this on Christmas morning. It so happened my soldier son was home for Christmas Break and in the following week the two could be found absorbed intently on the realism of this amazing drama. I would hear them in between episodes talking about specific details. It was conversation about the characters, the actors, the weapons, uniforms, combat strategies, etc. It was a remarkable history lesson and an entertaining drama for them to share.   <br />I have yet to sit down and watch this series, hence my 4 stars instead of 5.
B00005J79H|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic. Choice of songs and the performance - out of this world!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I receive this gift and really enjoyed it.  Have purchased it to send to others
B000I0QL82|5.0|Holiday Inn is a traditional Christmas holiday movie.  For those who love musicals, this movie has lots of music and dance.  Bing Crosby is at his best singing the great songs of the 40s.  No one can beat the rhythmic steps of Fred Astair and his dancing partner. This DVD version has great quality: the \\"darkness\\" of the negative has been brightened; the sound has improved.  <br /> <br />We use this movie to kick off our family holiday traditions that we have created. <br /> <br />Certainly fun to watch and hum along with the tunes too.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The movie was in perfect condition and arrived a day before it came out everywhere!!! Very impressesed! I have never been disapointed
B000F8O35U|4.0|Take _The Little Mermaid_, remaster it, encode it to a DVD, add a few special features that'll make you go, \\"... hmmm...\\", and you have the DVD release of Disney's final pure-celuloid feature-length almost-masterpiece. <br /> <br />Others have reviewed the film itself. For the sake of completeness, though, I enjoy revisiting this film every once and a while. <br /> <br />Technically, the re-release is much finer than its VHS counter-part. Additionally, even if you already own the VHS version of this film, you might want to pick up the DVD, too. Not only does the DVD have a few interesting bonuses, but DVDs have a much longer shelf life than VHSs, and more likely than not, your VHS version of this film is having some \\"tracking\\" problems. <br /> <br />It's the same _Little Mermaid_ -- just a little better.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|This recording is not the greatest Christmas CD you will ever find, but it does contain the best version of the song \\"River\\" that I have ever heard; even better than the original.
B000002QWD|3.0|This is just a reissue of the old MERRY CHRISTMAS album that was available since the mid-50s.  The title's been changed, but the playing order is the same and the incorrect versions of two of Bing's Christmas hits are the same.  \\"Silent Night\\" was a hit in 1935, yet its a much later recording that appears here.  \\"White Christmas\\" first charted in 1942, yet the version here is the 1947 re-recording.  \\"Faith of Our Fathers\\" isn't even a Christmas song!  There's a better, 44-track collection of Bing's Christmas recordings for Decca that includes the correct versions of the hits as well as the remakes and excludes \\"Faith of Our Fathers.\\"  It's called THE VOICE OF CHRISTMAS and is available here: [...]
B00009Y3L4|1.0|I went to a Community Center a few years ago and their rendition was great.   This not so much
0316172324|3.0|The book is interesting to read but it doesn't offer much (or anything) in the way of \\"lessons to be learned\\". It discusses how some people have developed a good intuition and why that intuition is sometimes wrong - but offers nothing in the way of improving your intuition / decision making ability.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is a strange movie.  But then I like strange movies.  Aliens looking like clowns from Space.  What more could you want to scare kids with?  Don't go looking for a deep plot, just sit back and enjoy the movie for pure laughs.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Yes, I'm serious.  It is the best album I have ever heard, ever.  I don't just mean by Nightwish--I mean ever.  Better than Carole King's Tapestry.  Better than Elton's Goodbye Yellowbrick Road.  Better than anything the Who has done (and they've done some amazing stuff).  Better than...you get the point.      If you like the best singer ever, coupled to amazingly-arranged orchestral compositions tinged with metal and darkness, you'll like this.  In fact, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, you'll like this.      Prepare yourself for a musical style that no one matches.  At first, you might feel like the music lacks organization, or jumps around too much.  As you listen, though, you'll realize that not only does Nightwish know what they're doing, they've created a musical style that is unique.    And if you want to hear the best line ever sung on popular music ever, check out Tarja's high note on \\"Planet Hell.\\"  It comes about 1:35 into the piece, as she sings \\"Behold this fair creation of God.\\"  Haunting, stunning, unbelievable.
B000EWBNMS|4.0|This is a new approach in criminal investigation tv shows.The main character is very human and nice and action is enriched with metaphysical aura.I strongly recommend it.Subtitles again missing from the menu and this is the only thing i hate in this production.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Gore gives solutions to the problems and that is why An Inconvenient Truth is so great.  He shows just enough of his personal side to explain why he is so dedicated to this cause.
0743289412|2.0|I have been an avid fan of Stephen King's books but this book was a disappointment. I was expecting intrigue and more but didn't get it. It seemed too sappy relating to the death of her husband. It was running on and on. I normally love his writing style of telling the story but not this time.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|It's great to hear the classic Beatles tracks again in a new package; like in the old days, it relived some of the excitement when a new Beatles album came out. But nostalgia aside, I expected a little more drastic 'rearrangements' of the track pieces and sound bits to really create a totally new song out of the originals. There are few that are commendable like the signature and brilliant bass drum beats of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" fitting in nicely with George's \\"Within You Without You\\". But most of the other tracks are pretty much the original songs with some innovative blend-ins at the start and the end of the tracks. There might also be some bass or other tracks from other songs blended in with some of these tracks but they did not stood out and I probably would discover them if I listened to them a little more carefully. But I'm still quite happy with my purchase of this CD. It's difficult to not feel good listening to anything that involves the timeless classics of the Fab Four.
B000G759LW|4.0|Back to Basic is just that. It not only provides the listener with sounds reminiscent of the pioneers of modern music, it also provides the listener with Christina's emotional energy. Christina sings about both serious and youthful topics with her usual flare. I have enjoyed listening to this CD enormously. I think you will too.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The CD is everything we had hoped it would be with a nice mix of songs. <br /> <br />We also enjoyed how the producers mixed lyrics from other songs and melodies from other songs in the beginning of each song, then lead you into the real song track listed on the back of the CD.
1932907009|5.0|Simply put, Blake Snyder's \\"Save the Cat\\" is sheer brilliance.  Everything a writer really needs to know about the craft of screenwriting is contained within the pages of this curiously entitled tome.   <br /> <br />I've read most of the best selling \\"how to\\" screenwriting books and found most of them to be full of esoteric theories that had little practical use when it was time to sit down and face a blank page.  But \\"Save the Cat\\" is different.  The brilliance of \\"Save the Cat\\" is in its deceiving simplicity.  This brilliance was made apparent in the very first chapter which focuses on streamlining and nailing your concept.  This vital first step is overlooked not only by every other book on screenwriting I've ever read, but also by nearly every WRITER I've ever met.  Five minutes into reading Blake's book and I already had an epiphany and figured out what was wrong with a very well written script that was inexplicably missing the mark with creative execs.  If only I had read this book six months ago!!! <br /> <br />And every other chapter in \\"Save the Cat\\" is full of the same, well-thought out nuts and bolts instruction on how to create a well-crafted, sellable screenplay.  The forms Blake includes in \\"Save the Cat\\" are especially helpful in organizing your screenplay's structure, no matter the genre.  Again, not just theories, but helpful tools to get the job done.   <br /> <br />Here's the real shocker.  Blake gives his email address in \\"Save the Cat\\" and asks readers to feel free to email him.  I did.  And the man wrote me back!!!  I challenge Robert McKee to be so responsive and available to the readers of his book.   <br /> <br />I've read the reviews that chose to criticize the professional work of Blake Snyder, but I don't care if this book was written by a gaggle of chimpanzees.  It's still brilliant.  Whether you like Blake's movies or not is irrelevant.  Blake Snyder is, without question, an incredibly gifted screenwriting coach.  And that's all anyonethinking about buying this book should care about. <br /> <br />Remember that Vince Lombardi guy?  Never even played in the NFL.  What the hell did he know about football... <br />
B000H7JD4K|5.0|There is a lot of people out there that believe \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" is just an ok album...good enough just because there isn't that much real heavy metal...People complain about the crunchy/dirty sounds of the guitars and the lack of power on the drums, but really I don't undertsand how someone that knows a little bit of music can say anything like that. <br />Although at the beggining it took me some time to digest the music, after  a couple of times I heard each song I started loving it! <br />This album for me is one of the greatest Iron Maiden albums ever! Not just the bets of the latest ones but I consider it to be in the top of the list of any IM album ever. You want to know why? <br />First of all, Bruce Dickinson's singing it's unbelieavable! He is still as good as he has ever been. <br />The guitars are just amazing, Janick, Adrian and Dave mix up for killer shreds and riffs and the old Iron Maiden dual solos...Yes, they are still there and they still rock! <br />Steve Harris sounds just like you would expect...but better... The maturity of the music in this album lets everyone in the band to put out there their totally best. Its complex at times, pure, slow, fast, deep, melodic, heavy,and very progressive..This mix couald lead to a total disaster for most bands, but the Irons are the masters and they knwo how to do it. <br />Finally, Nicko is just flawless in this album. I enjoy the sound of every cymbal, drum or snare that he plays.. its just amazing...listen carefully to all tracks...it has some complex tempos, but he always plays what it needs to be played..very nice Nicko! You can easily feel the power and the greatness of Maiden's music just by listening to the drums on this album...and altogether...this is an AMAZING ALBUM! GO AND BUY IT! <br />Personal Favorite Song in the album: \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" <br />But trust me...they're all great...Thank You Irons for Keeping real Heavy Metal alive!!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This is a great movie. Loved it. I cannot wait for the sequel. Hopefully this will be in the theater officially and not known only through bootleg. I hope they do not let corny, overacting Wyclef have a part in the sequel. <br />please, please.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Audrey is so cute in this movie. George Peppard surprises. The vieled \\"Call Girl\\" has class. The entire production is like a time machine. This team pulls it off. The censorship of the era doesn't hinder the pulse. The \\"W\\" word is never mentioned, but, the movie stays true to it's Capote roots.
B000J103PC|5.0|In perfect condition, watched it 12 times in the first week.  Happy!  It came fast too.
034537410X|5.0|This is a fabulous book for anyone who has ever suffered Sleep Paralysis, or visitations from (seemingly) other worldly demons during sleep - or for those who have enjoyed the wonders of gaining consciousness while in the dreamstate. <br /> <br />It explains all of these phenonema in very simple and logical terms. <br /> <br />It also explains how you can develop and enhance your ability to regain consciousness during dreaming - and thereby opens a whole new world of incredible experiences. <br /> <br />Fans of Carlos Castenada will love it.
B00005JOX6|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much. I just wish it wasn't a repeat of so many films in the past. It also has overtones of the Back to the Future films. If you liked those you'll definately enjoy this. I loved the idea of being able to take a remote and click whatever you want into your life. Like the character played by Adam Sandler I wouldn't anything negative brought into my life (of course). Sandler did an excellent acting job. The film is extremely visual. Sandler's humanity is brought out by the end of the film. It's nice to see him in something not COMPLETELY comedic. All in all I would definately see it again. I give it 4 and 1/2 stars. I expect we'll see Sandler in more dramatic roles in the future but who knows?
074356619X|1.0|Very upliftiing, leading to  self confidence, and expanding your thoughts  in a way to  enhance your life.   Easy listening and relaxing  .  I listen while walking, and take time to digest the information  and guidelines.  Good for teens to adults.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I loved this when I first saw it. I had told my Granddaughter about it and she wanted to see it, so when I found it on your site, of course I ordered it.  She loved it.  I am sure we will watch it many times over the years.  Thank You.
B00009NHC5|5.0|This movie is still quite fresh and very tense. Stands tall among the current slasher trend.
0345479092|5.0|This is hands down the BEST baby book out there. Particularly in the first few months. We found it so hard in the beginning to feel like we had any sense of order with the baby. We were sleep deprived, the baby was fussy and it felt like we just fed and held her around the clock. Baby Whisperer provide a very sensible approach to organizing your time and getting a semblance of a routine but without \\"scheduling\\" your baby. The EASY approach of Eat, Activity, Sleep, You - was one we stuck with for many months and also was a great method to use at daycare. Highly recommend it - I've bought several copies for friends.
B000I0QK74|4.0|If the wife is into JT then you can't go wrong here.
0316287059|4.0|Love this book. Love the techniques. Love the fact that Kevyn didn't push certain make-up brands. I love this book coupled with Making Faces.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I LOVE the show, and hence I had a friend to buy it from me, and deliver it across the ocean. However, there are a few things about this collection that disappointed me. <br /> <br />As what were pointed out by some other reviewers: <br /> <br />1. While the packaging looks great - it doesn't protect the DVD from being scratched. It's so bad, that I am afraid of taking the DVD out of the sleeve. I'm contemplating getting a separate case for the DVDs, but if that happens, what am I going to do with this fabulous box?! Just for showing off?! <br /> <br />2. No English subtitle! Why?! And I thought all DVDs from the US will at the very least, provide subtitle for the hearing-impaired folks!  <br /> <br />3. I am not sure if any of you noticed, but the Pilot Script book that I got in the package had a printing error. Page 15 of the book should be on section 12, but instead it printed section 33 which is repeated from page 47. I want my original page 15!! <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|An absolute amazing show that should never have been cancelled. The actors play their roles above and beyond amazing. The characters are also more relatable than other characters in it's genre. The story line is very addictive and shows alot of originality. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this show. Those of you who fall in love with the show should buy this magnificent First Season. The only way the other seasons will be released is if this First Season gets bought. We need to prove that this show has a strong and loyal fan base. Please buy this First Season.
1567184855|5.0|This book was given me as a gift.  I read it and it completely changed my life; to the point that I no longer even drive the way I used to.  I promptly ordered a copy for my sister, and a friend.  The friend who had sent me the original book was so impressed by my reception of the book that she said she should read it again, so I sent her copies of the three books by Dr. Newton.
B00005NNMJ|4.0|Accepts best album!  Classic 80's rock in the vain of the mighty AC/DC before the hair band craze hit the radio.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie is a must see for everyone on this planet. A great companion film, in my opinion is \\"Escape from  Suburbia\\", which outlines the issue of \\"Peak Oil\\", and the consequences which are in escapable for our planet.All of the issues articulated in these two films are critical for all of us to become aware of. If we do not awaken to the pending global crisis, it will be much more devistating than it has to be. <br /> <br />These two particular DVD's, are required watching if you care about the future and how it will unfold for all of us, \\"in our life time\\"!
0316286850|4.0|There is probably not much more I can add in praise of this book. This book was actually given to me by my boyfriend at the time about 9 years ago. Thus began my love affair with Kevyn Aucoin. This book taught me the basics and much more. If you are a makeup lover this is a must have.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|My daughters and I are all hooked on this show. Just creepy enough without being too scary. The actors do a really good job.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This is excellent.  A must have for all women!
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I personally think that the Celestine Prophecy is the most important book written in half a century at least.  The movie not only failed to carry the impact of the teachings, but gave little incentive for people to read and study the book.
B00000263T|3.0|If you liked Balls to the Wall, you'll like this one too.  Not as commercially accepted but just as much hard rocking.
0192802631|5.0|A wonderful book. Probably one of Jane Austen's better novels along with Pride and Prejudice. Very moving and delightful. I would recommend this book to any whose a Jane Austen fan.
0930289528|5.0|Violent, madcap meditation on politics and freedom. Borrows its window dressing from seminal dystopias like Orwell's 1984, Huxley's Brave New World, and Zamyatin's We. Here, the hero may actually have a chance to spark a revolution. Dark, grim, pensive, but ultimately hopeful. Far superior to the film in its ability to wed ideas with imagery.
B00023B1AS|5.0|Most music videos spend much of the time showing the performers doing their thing on stage which tends to be boring.  This video is not only full of great Top Tunes but has a well done story line involved with each one.  My family and I have watched this video many times and will continue to watch it.  If you like ZZ Top and action in your videos, this is a must have!
B0009RCPY8|4.0|I had not seen this movie in years.  But I had to buy it, because I was going to teach my little 2 years old guy to aim true into the toilet bowl.  He heard the term to cross beams all the time.  And I wanted to show him where the term came from.   <br />Anyway, very hilarious movie. You just don't see the talents of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, etc anymore.
0385495323|5.0|An extremely readable history about the science of cryptography.  Simon Singh transforms a daunting technology, designed to confuse, into a very understandable and highly interesting work about the underpinnings of some of the most crucial events in western history.
B000AP04OM|5.0|A classic that never fails to make you bond together as a family and be grateful for what is really important in life.
B000L43AN4|5.0|Tom Waits, I know, is not for everyone.  In this CD collection, he displays his unique talents in unbelievable ways.  Each CD has its own theme (Brawlers,Ballers, and Bastards) and he is true to each theme.  When you think that Tom cannot get any better, he does.  I have been listening to Tom Waits for more than 25 years.  He has evolved and remained true to himself.  If you have never seen this awesome muscian in concert you must.  No matter what the venue, he projects an intimacy that few are able to replicate.  I remember him from the clubs, seen him in huge forums, he is true to himself, his music and to those to whom he speacks to in his music.
6304806418|5.0|This is a superb performance by Madonna as Evita (both ultra egos). Acting and singing are superb. Goes to show Hollywood can still produce good stuff when they try, but this never got the recognition it deserved. <br /> <br />This is a must see!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is probably the greatest serial WW2 experience ever released. Many other reviewers have gone into great depth on this production so I'll keep mine short. <br />If you have any interest in WW2 history or the units involved, you have to see and most likely have to own this movie. <br />That said, I will make one critical comment and believe me this is a MINOR concern. The disc package should have started with Disc one at the top and Disc 6 at the bottom. I have constanly been having to expand the whole accordian just to get to the first disc. That's it. If this is the biggest worry they have, life is good. <br />Own this, enjoy and learn from it.
B000006ZDQ|5.0|This 2004 Remaster sounds better than the 1980's CD pressing.  <br />It has more low end warmth and punch.  The high end is the same. <br />It's more enjoyable to listen to with the more ballsy bass. <br /> <br />
B0000C8AVX|4.0|Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" is a CD filled with strange and dramatic and poetic images.  This is a transitional album before he bacame less acoustic and more electric in his music.  In that sense, it presages the wonderful and powerful \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" which marks his final break from the folk/protest period of his career.  But this is clearly a transitional album.<br /><br />There is a softer side to the work, including songs such as \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limits\\" and \\"It's All over Now, Baby Blue.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, there is the wild and crazy ride of the album's title song.  Lines burst forth with telling images; electric guitar is in the foreground.  Some lines that stand out:<br /><br />\\"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind's blowing\\"<br />\\"20 years of schooling and they put you on the day shift\\"<br />\\"Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters\\"<br /><br />On \\"Maggie's Farm,\\" the listener gets a dozen reasons why the singer doesn't want to work on Maggie's Farm anymore.<br /><br />\\"Bob Dylans's 115th Dream\\" is one of my favorites, as one gets a series of strange and weird images, as Captain Arab and his crew visit America.  The song starts with Dylan beginning the song and bursting into laughter--and then starting over again.  The images of this song are well worth attending to.  One line sticks out.  As the singer tries to find someone to help him get Captain Arab out of jail (a long story there), he says to someone \\"They refused Jesus.\\" To which the person responded \\"Well, you're not him.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" is a well known classic that does not diminish with time.  \\"Outlaw Blues\\" has one stumbling into a lagoon, at 3 below zero at 3 in the afternoon.  \\"On the Road Again\\" features, again, evocative images.  \\"Gates of Eden\\": \\"It's all right ma, I can make it.\\"  This song features images that stick with the listener as well.<br /><br />This is a strong album, and well worth listening to.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|An amazing DVD, Very well put together,the artists themselves are very open, including a lot of information on their second disc. The concert itself brought back memories of my concert experience and it was an incredible thing to have on dvd. I've played this concert DVD more times than any of the movies I currently own and am in love with the singers amazing high pitched opera style voice. <br /> <br />A powerful band, and an amazing disc. Very good stuff and lots of fun.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Classic - gets top rating. Long and very detailed, be prepared in advance, have plenty of popcorn, this is a real thriller and far surpasses anything Hollywood ever tried to make. <br /> <br />Best submarine movie ever made!!!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl. To watch it is to reaffirm the goodness of mankind!
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|I had seen this before.  It wasn't as good the second time around.  I do whoever like Tom Selleck.  The second time around seemed to move slow.
B000E1ZK3M|2.0|I was so disappointed in my expereince with this source. The very day the DVD I ordered cam I realized it was an HDDVD and that that wouldn't work for the person I intended to give this date.  I contacted the salesperson immediately asking about the return policy and explaining the situation as ell as the urgency in my plan to remedy this in time to give a sibling his Christmas gift.  <br /> <br />To my dismay, it's been more than three weeks and I have yet to hear a thing form them. That's the worst experience I've had yet as an internet shopper.
B000F8O35U|5.0|A Walt Disney Classic.  I could watch it over and over again.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I've loved watching the James Bond movies and reading the James Bond books for quite a while.  I've developed my own thoughts of 007 the more I've read.  I think Daniel Craig portrayed a very real, down and dirty Bond.  I will always love Sean Connery as Bond, but Daniel Craig is now right behind him.  I wasn't impressed with Pierce Brosnan's Bond, he was too ... prissy/weak to me.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching Casino Royale, it was a very quick, hard movie to me.  I did miss Q and the banter between Bond and Moneypenny, but it is early yet and I have a feeling they will be back.  At least I hope they will be back.  I do feel that the movie went by quickly.  I liked the action, but I feel I missed part of the story in the beginning.  Maybe I just sat too close at the movie theatre ... I'll revise my opinion once I watch the DVD in the comfort of my own home.
0880796863|5.0|I purchased these as a gift and he truly loved them. They arrived in mint condition. A great set of cards and nice gift also.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|It was so nice to watch a film starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves that doesn't have a speeding bus as part of the plot.  These two actors have great chemistry, which was shown in the movie Speed, and it was nice seeing them in a romantic film.  This is the story of Kate and Alex, two people who are perfect for each other.  There's one significant problem though -- they're in a long distance relationship.  Alex is in the year 2004 and Kate is in the year 2006.  They meet by way of the lake house, where Kate moves out of to work as a doctor in Chicago.  Alex owns the lake house, and his letter exchange with Kate begins after the former tenant (Kate) leaves a welcome letter to the new tenant (Alex)... except that Alex lives two years behind Kate.  Will they ever get to meet?<br /><br />The time anomalies make the film confusing at times, but the story of two star-crossed lovers who transcend time is wonderful.  Bullock and Reeves make film magic in their scenes together and when they write each other letters.  My favorite scene is the one where they slow dance during Kate's birthday party.  The song they play during that scene is great.  It's difficult to write a review without giving details away (though I'm sure some people have done that already), but all I can say is that this is a great romantic film, one of the best I've seen this year along with The Notebook and The Phantom of the Opera.  I highly recommend this DVD.
1594200823|5.0|Whilst I really enjoyed \\"The Botany of Desire\\", I absolutely loved this book, and devoured its 450 odd pages in almost one long sitting.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|The Lake House is a touching, moving and original story about `star-crossed-lovers', two strangers caught in an unexplained time rift, forced to communicate to each other only by written letters, whose relationship soon develops into true love, obsession and a battle against `fate'.<br /><br />The notion of changing historical events through time anomalies and accomplishing those changes has been explored in literature and film for many years.<br /><br />One of the most famous and currently almost forgotten tales of time-travel-love is H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. The entire purpose of the protagonist in the novel is to travel back in time to prevent the accidental death of his one and true love. Once creating his time machine, he travels back to the moment of his beloved's death only to come against `fate'; she was meant to die, and no matter what he does, the girl comes to her death despite the inventor's best efforts...fighting fate will always be a losing battle.<br /><br />In The lake House, this particular theme is a little less dramatic, however, is a modern love story about loneliness, falling in love with someone you have never actually met, the utter persistence of those in love to meet and finally be with them and the view that love, in its purest form, will overcome anything, including opposition, distance, and the passage of time.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock, though not sharing many scenes together, (mostly the dialogue between them in the form of their letters) managed to convey a certain emotional realism.<br /><br />In this film at least, Reeves appears to have matured as an actor: there is nothing forced or uncomfortable about this performance, he has grown in the craft and truly carried the character with believability and apparent ease.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock has shown time and time again that she is an \\"all rounder\\" in the profession. Her comedic roles are funny, sometimes hilarious, and her `serious' roles can and do stand up against the best actresses currently in vogue in Hollywood. There is an undefinable charm about Sandra Bullock, which, really, came through loud and clear in this film.<br /><br />The Lake House is entertaining for a `romance', as it places love against unusual circumstances, written, directed and edited with a simple idea in mind, and executed with skill and vision.<br /><br />4.5 stars.up against the best actresses currently in vogue in Hollywood.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso is the story of Marco, an aerial soldier-of-fortune in the Adriatic during the 1930s.  Because of his selfish nature, brought on by the loss of loved ones and friends, he is under an enchantment which has turned him into a pig.  Forced into an aerial dual with an American mercenary over a girl, Porco comes to realize that people love him in spite of himself and his desire to drive people away.<br /><br />This is like a European film done in Japanese animation and I love it.  It is witty, has adult level humor (not sexual but things kids wouldn't get), and it allows Hayao Miyazaki to indulge in more facinating aircraft.  First class voice talent including Michael Keaton as Marco/Porco, Brad Garrett, Bill Fagerbakke, Kimberly Williams and favorites of other Studio Ghibli/Disney releases - David Ogden Stiers, Susan Egan, and Cary Elwes - give added depth to the outstanding animation.<br /><br />Now for the, \\"Not one for the younger kids\\" disclaimer.  Since this is targeted at adults and has a European flavor with Japanese production, the film has characters smoking and drinking.  (Not that it bothers me but I don't have younger kids.)  Besides that, there is no cuteness as there is in Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service.<br /><br />I highly recommend this - just put the kids to bed first and kick-back and enjoy.
B000H4JGZY|5.0|This CD is simply terrific.  I'm impressed by the variety of sounds and the different beats.  Justin is coming into his own identity.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|You Don't have to be an Eric Claptan fan to enjoy this AMAZING DVD!!  I am still without words and I've had this DVD for 2 years now! If you enjoy the Blues, or Southern Rock or Top 40 or Country or Rock you'll enjoy this once in a lifetime DVD!!!  I still can't believe the range of musicians that turned out for this Guitar Fest ~ B.B. King, Joe Walsh, ZZ Top, John Mayer, Jimmy Vaughan, Robert Cray, Vince Gill, Carlos Santana and list goes on and on and on!!  In between all of the outstanding music are interviews not to miss.  I won't even let this one out of my house... Sorry friends ~ get your own!!!!

B000A0GYD2|4.0|I bought the set for my husband for Christmas and when I received it, the case was pretty beat up.  More beat up then I would have liked to given as a gift.  Luckily my husband LOVED the shows, so it all worked out in the end.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I purchased this for my 16 year old son for Christmas and he's spent many hours translating the main musical themes of the piece into garage band and listening to the music to identify the themes throughout the score. He has a great interest in music theory and this takes a contemorary piece that has a lot of meaning to him - he's a huge fan of the films - and gives him insight to the construction of many great historical symphonies. Thanks to Howard Shore for his musical genius! (Interestingly enough my son\\"s last name is Shore - unfortunately we're not related to Howard!)
B00004XQ83|5.0|This soundtrack is haunting - going from the childlike and innocent through to thought provoking and heart break.  A soundtrack of hard times, innocence and hope.
0440237688|5.0|The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a great book that is similar to the series of Hardy Boys books, by Franklin W. Dixon. One similarity is that both books are mysteries and full of adventure. Both authors use similar types and styles of writing. If you like the Hardy Boys series of books, odds are you will also enjoy the book The Giver.  <br /> In The Giver, the main character, Jonas, goes on an adventure to solve a mystery. In the Hardy Boys series, the main characters, Frank and Joe, also go on adventures to solve mysteries. Another similarity is that both of the main characters are young and follow in the footsteps of somebody older than them. Jonas is only 12 years old, and he follows in The Giver's footsteps. Frank and Joe are a bit older, but are still very young. Frank and Joe are 17 and 18 years old, and they follow in their Dad's footsteps. The Giver and Frank and Joe's father are both very famous within their community, and play an important role in the books.  <br /> Another similarity between these two books is the author's style of writing. Both Franklin W. Dixon and Lois Lowry use a lot of detail in their writing. An example of detail in Lowry's writing is when Jonas first experiences sledding. \\"Comprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him: The speed, the clear cold air, the total silence, the feeling of balance and excitement and peace. Then, as the angle of incline lessened, as the mound- the hill- flattened, nearing the bottom, the sled's forward motion slowed. The snow was piled now around it, and he pushed with his body, moving it forward, not wanting the exhilaration ride to end.\\" Page 82. In this section, Lois Lowry is using a lot of detail to describe the hill, the speed, and the snow.  <br /> In the Hardy Boys series, Franklin W. Dixon also uses a descriptive, suspenseful and detailed style of writing.  One example of this is seen in The Tower Treasure, when FranklinW. Dixon starts out his book by writing, \\"Frank and Joe Hardy clutched the grips of their motorcycles and started in horror at the oncoming car.  It was careening from side to side on the narrow road.  `He'll hit us!  We'd better climb this hillside- and fast!'  Frank exclaimed, as the boys brought their motorcycles to a screeching halt and leaped off.  `On the double!'  Joe cried out as they started up the steep embankment.  To their amazement, the reckless driver suddenly pulled his car hard to the right and turned into a side rode on two wheels.  The boys expected the car to turn over, but it held the dusty ground and sped off out of sight.\\"  Page 1 of The Tower Treasure. <br /> Although these two books have many similarities, they also have significant differences.  The Hardy Boys series does not have a deep philosophical meaning. The Hardy Boys series is a much lower level of reading.  The Giver, is written on a higher level with greater philosophical meaning, leaving you with concepts to think about.   <br /> The two books, The Giver, and the Hardy Boys series of books are similar in many ways.  The author's of these books use lots of description and detail in their writing.  These writers also use a very similar style.  The characters are similar, and the plots are similar.  If you like the Hardy Boy series of books, odds are you will like The Giver, and odds are that if you like The Giver, you will enjoy the Hardy Boys series books.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not an AVID Sci-Fi nut...but I do enjoy a good romp from time to time - and this show offers the greatest romp I've had in a Sci-Fi universe in QUITE some time!  If you haven't seen it - I highly recommend giving it a go.  It's one you can watch time and time again - and still discover new fun things each and every time!  :)
074356619X|5.0|I am a Christian....I have never heard of the book \\"The Secret\\"....a co-worker recommended to me, she saw I was frustrated with the way things were going in my life...I immediately went on line and purchased the book, it was the best decision I had made that day.  They may call it the secret, but I call it Gods way of doing things here on earth.  I found what they called the secret, the bible says, you have what you say. Our words are so powerful , they can be used to create or destroy.
0974153001|5.0|I found this book very helpful both in the detailed steps and images to match the steps. The author breaks down each section of the body and builds from muscle mass as well as proper proportions to scale.  She also shows examples on how to change the scale of the female and male figure.  I found this most helpful when transfering to a earthen clay medium instead of polymer.  The author also shows how to make custom tools, armatures and props to match the subject matter.  This book is great for the beginner as well as the professional artist.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to further their expertise in the figurative sculpting arena.
B00006L6YH|2.0|After seeing Diana Krall on a tv show and marvelling at her pianistic and improvisational abilities, I ordered this Album. Boy, what a mistake! Her undoubted talents are hardly evident in this collection of \\"love\\" songs which are almost all given wrist-slitting arrangements. If you enjoy ending up twice as depressed at the end of an album as you were beforehand, then this is for you. Otherwise, find something happier to listen to, like a funeral march.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sexy Christmas music...yeah.  Sarah's voice is beautiful, clear, alluring. The album features a great selection of music.
B00005JL0I|5.0|This has always been the funniest of the 007 movies.  It is great flick.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin, the Beatles' legendary producer, in conjunction with his son Giles, has created a miracle.  It should be stated, however, that if one is not already thoroughly familiar with the Beatles' material the wonder of this work might be less apparent.  That is not to say that non-fans cannot, or would not, greatly appreciate it.  But there is no doubt that \\"Love\\" is a gift to the fans.  Obviously that is a club with many, many members. <br /> <br />Many people might have the initial reaction to the project that I had: you don't tamper with perfection.  However, just as the recent pared-down remix of the \\"Let it Be\\" album demonstrated, it is possible to create something new from the Beatles recordings that is worthwhile while still honoring the original source material.  Any fears of rampaging revisionism on \\"Love\\" are instantly put to rest when the newly a cappella strains of the opening song, \\"Because\\", issue forth.  \\"Love\\" is not just a re-mix, it is a complete re-imagining, and it is a work of surpassing genius, completely loyal and true to the canonical material and yet at the same time startlingly, even shockingly, original.   <br /> <br />The following is not hyperbole: if you are at all a fan of the Beatles you must acquire this CD. <br />
B00003Q438|4.0|I've always known this film in the original theatrical version, which is well over 2 hours long. The Special Edition adds another 24 minutes of footage and adds an extra environmental sub-plot. I'm not entirely convinced by the longer version, which ends up being a little preachy, but it does add some extra interest and alien interaction. However, the original theatrical version is also included on the same DVD, with the classic solid-water tentacle effect, and deep-sea mini-sub battles, plus the superb performances of Ed Harris and especially Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who really should have appeared in more films.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Lovely...some old favorites and some newer things sung in JT's inimitable style. I played it and played it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I bought this CD because I like the main song on the radio and the DJ was gushing over how much she liked it. I usually expect to only really like a couple of songs on a CD - so have really stopped purchasing very many - i.e. iTunes. But I was pleasantly surprised, the music is good all the way through, some really great words, and a good mix of softer tunes with very upbeat stuff.
B00000DR52|5.0|Rather than this being a \\"word of mouth\\" review and purchase, it is a \\"word of another CD\\". First, I love Chinese traditional music and the Western approximation instruments, pipa [lute], gu-zheng [zither], erhu [violin] and diza [flute]. The deep spiritual, mystical sound is hypnotic and moving. I recently discovered the Asian music company, Pacific Moon and its range of artists. One artist is Jiang Xiao-Qing and her CD, \\"Breathing Spaces.\\" [Such a quiet joy] The last cut, # 11 is the Theme from the Last Emperor, and it is so haunting and beautiful, it led me to wonder about the actual soundtrack. In both CDs the magic of Ryuichi Sakamoto's writing and arranging will take your breath away with where it takes you. Both are to be played during a time you really want to simply think, drift and drop back into your own sense of self. Now that part of my Chinese music section is complete--If you like to close the door and simply relax, give yourself a real treat! It's worth the trip to the computer to buy this treasure from Amazon.com. Kathleen Rand Reed
0790733226|3.0|This is NEARLY a superb film. An extra-terrestrial communication is picked up and (eventually) Jodie Foster goes on a very surreal space trip while apparently not moving. Foster is excellent throughout, but the film is spoilt by a crass sub-plot concerning so-called religious right politicians who try to prevent her going on the misson because she doesn't believe in God. The over-coiffured Matthew McConaughey looks far too well groomed for a priest, and is unconvincing in his role. <br />There are some great moments though, and some excellent special effects, so there's enough here to interest the average sc-fi fan.
0684824906|5.0|Dear Sirs: I am unable to find a suitable means to reply to your request. With reference to the book Team of Rivals, I have read it, and found it to be highly praiseworthy in its treatment the coverage of  Abraham Lincoln. The author did a splendid  and comprehensive job in her account of  his life.

B000AGTPUA|4.0|This was a very fun movie to watch.  It is worth it just for the scene at the end with Stephen Tyler singing \\"Rockin' on Top of the World\\" on a unicycle (because he is an elf and can't reach the mike on the stand).    Great fun and excellent animation.
0689853637|5.0|The art in this book is far and away the most beautiful.  The movement that is allowed by pull tabs brings the artist's work to life.  The last page even lights up.  This is not for children this is an adult pop-up book.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out ! THe songs are great as are the actors. I bought this for my 3 month old grandson so that maybe his first word will be \\"ello ! It's like David Bowie does Fraggle Rock !

B00005K9QP|4.0|If you play electric blues guitar, this is a historic, must have recording. The sound is good, the choice of songs is pretty good, and you can see that Clapton was working up to his best work (IMHO) in Cream.
0679746323|4.0|I read this book, here in Brazil.This book is complete, true, correct about this \\"Big Monster\\" of XX century, called Mao.This man was the biggest massive-murder of human history.Mao killed more that the DOUBLE of Hitler and Mussolini together.And Mao killed with total power and respect.Even USA became a Mao's friend and allie. <br />Even recognizing the great work did in this book, I found this book too long.It tooks months to me, to read this book.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Though I have not yet listened to this CD, I have had no complaints from my daughter for whom it was bought (and believe me, if there were a problem, I would have).
0394716787|5.0|We all know the brilliance of Edgar Allan Poe. A dark genius- no surprise. The thing that might get those not familiar with his work is the short stories- they are absolutely top notch! There is not a page in this book I dislike.<br /><br />From what I've seen this is the most reliable compilation available. If you are looking for a big book to tote around to various cafe's (as I enjoy doing), this is a good choice. :P
B000H5U832|4.0|Our whole family really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and had a good story. I would recommend it to any family.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie. The four year olds watch it over and over. I don't mind watching it repeatedly because I always seem to see something I missed the first time around. Plus the story is pretty inspirational for the kids, keep trying for your dream and you can make it come true.
B000G759LW|5.0|This CD shows really off Christina's abilities, I bought it as a gift for my husband and we both love the CD.
B000007XUQ|5.0|This is my favorite christmas CD.  I like it so much I Bought it for everyone in my family for Christmas.
0375822070|3.0|when the young foxes fearfully ask their daddy, the fantastic mr fox, how will we die? will there be dogs? I decided it was not for my 3 year olds. he's clever allright but this is probably a tale best told ( edited by you) and not read.
B00008NRI8|5.0|This romantic comedy has the best of both worlds. It is really funny thanks to Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock. Plus, it is romantic without being sappy. Even my husband (a real guys guy) enjoys it.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I bought this serie for my wife (who loves it) but the episodes I have been forced to watch make me wish I would have just gone with diamonds for Christmas.  Just terrible.
B00063F8B2|4.0|My son is thoroughly enjoying this audio version of the music found in the movie.
0375505091|1.0|This book was given to me, via an Amazon.com gift certificate, by a friend. I enjoy photography and thought that this book would be an great addition to my collection of photography books. Annie Leibovitz... WOW!!! I couldn't wait until the book arrived. Unfortunately, I didn't take the title of this book literally. My mistake. The abundant collection of photographs did include beautiful and inspiring shots, but there were an overwhelming number of photos which depicted the deteriorating illness of her life partner and many photos of her aging parents.  The book also included photos of hospital beds, funeral shots, and grave sites.  All a bit much for me and a real downer. I should have previewed the book in a local book store before purchasing it online.
B000H7JCG4|4.0|This was my favorite show of all time... I was in high school the same time as the 90210 kids, and had the gang not had 2 junior years, we would have graduated at the same time... anyway, the reason I couldn't give this DVD set 5 stars was that I noticed the music I remembered was missing and replaced with bland, generic \\"rock\\"-- I am guessing they couldn't get clearances for all the songs they used, but in some instances it really makes a difference!  <br /> <br />90210 first caught my attention when they played a remix of \\"Star\\" by Erasure, one of my favorite bands, during the mother-daughter fashion show episode-- how cool and edgy was that?-- and hearing the song \\"Doin' The Do\\" by Betty Boo during the montage of Brenda getting ready for her big date with Dylan inspired me to get the Betty Boo album. I was really looking forward to both of those moments when I watched the episodes on the DVD set, and I was disappointed when neither song was used. Music played a key role in 90210, especially as the show progressed and the current pop acts would be the subject of or make an appearance on an episode (Flaming Lips, anyone?), and to not have the original music intact on the DVD set is really a shame. <br /> <br />I didn't think I would need to do this anymore, but I am going to have to start DVRing reruns when I can in order to capture the 90210 I remember.
B0000C8WYB|5.0|This is an excellent music collection. Bought it as a present and my wife just loves it. Would recommend to anyone who loves French music of the 70's and 80's.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|I feel sorry that this was the first album that I heard from this group, because now I don't feel like listening to anything else from them. Each and every song on this CD is just plain F-L-A-T. Geometrically, one could depict the music on this album as a straight line. There's hardly any melody in the music. This seems to be a bass-and-drum-happy group for there's nothing else to their music. Lead vocalist sings in a flat note throughout the album, prompting me to paste a you've-heard-one-you've-heard'em-all label on this CD. After listening to the CD fully, I was unable to recollect even a single tune, so noisy this album sounded to me. <br /> <br />Surely, there's plenty of following for this kind of noisy and \\"thrash\\" music in western part of the world, but how can one call this music when there's hardly any in it? Attribute it to my conditioning, since I was born and brought up in India where the music tends to be very melodious and is composed of catcy tunes, but I found this album to be absolutely worthless. A few people may have a notion that heavy metal music cannot be melodious, but they just need to listen to Metallica, Guns n Roses, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pearl Jam, Linkin Park, Lamb of God,.....to see how melody can be infused by skilful singing and proper lead-guitar playing. SKIP IT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MUSICAL EXPERIENCE! I highly recommend SAW 3 soundtrack that I am currently listening to in this album's place. It is ABSOLUTELY ROCKING!!!
B000J3OTTQ|3.0|If you're interested in following the career of Channing Tatum, then you won't want to be without this one.  He's made four films so far, and his last is the best so far, but this one isn't at the bottom of the list either.
1594200823|4.0|A provocative and readable book that challenges the reader to examine not only what foods make up their diet but also under what conditions these foods are produced.  While you may or may not change your eating habits after reading this book, you will certainly give consideration to the moral, ecological, and social consequences of the agricultural food chains involved.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|This is a very good movie, Kevin Costner is his usual self, with his very dry sense of humor and great acting talent, Whitney Houston was on top of the world at the time she starred in this movie. Great choice for just about anyone.
0312853238|5.0|OSC at his best.  Well worth a read for both SF and non-SF fans alike.
B00004XQ83|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed listening to the songs in their entirety from the movie.  The CD includes interesting facts about the time period the movie is set the characters involved.  The screen saver program is a \\"hoot\\" as it has interactive features highlighting objects from the movie (a sledge hammer, cowbell, etc.) floating across the screen in the flood.  You can point to an object to get an appropriate sound.  You can click and hold on the object and cause it to move. <br />The music is a most relaxing alternative to the high energy music of today's culture.  It brings me back to much simpler times when life was about people and relationships, unlike the \\"what's in it for me\\" attitude that is so prevalent now. <br />The two songs I don't have a great appreciation for are \\"O Death\\" and \\"Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby\\" as neither reflect healthy values and morals.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Josh never fails to deliver quality music-if only all young people could see the value of determination in doing something well done in using their talents for the good as Josh has.  This music spans all ages for interest and appreciation-if you truly love MUSIC and not the half-hearted, insincere, untalented junk that so many people listen to!
074356619X|5.0|The Secret DVD rocked but the CD rocked even more.  There are two more hours of content and it really explains more clearly the law of attraction. The author does a fantastic job of narrating. I highly recomend this version of The Secret.
B000FZERIG|4.0|This is a great album for the post beatle syndrome, yet that said, George Harrison is one the best musicians from this period, or any, in question.  <br /> <br />From ASWAD to TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS, to SNOOP and Celia Cruz, I like them all; and I still say this is a must have. <br /> <br />I also recommend \\"All THINGS MUST PASS\\" by the way. <br /> <br />Later
0201633612|5.0|Muy bueno, muy claro y tiene buenos ejemplos que permiten asimilar los conceptos y llevarlos a la práctica
B000LPLTVS|1.0|I don't know what happened here. Some of Steven Seagal's dialogue is mysteriously (and poorly) voiced over by some third party. The plot is all but missing, and SO IS THE ACTION. Is this an attempt to move into Sci-Fi/Horror by Mr. Seagal? This movie is as poor as his early movies were fantastic. I would NOT have allowed this movie to be released in this condition if I were the star. Claude Van Damme is somehere in Belgium laughing his @#& off.

0375413405|5.0|I am an amateur cook at best but this book makes me feel like a pro.  The recipes are well organized but I think the best feature is how the recipes have recommended side dishes which makes planning a meal very easy.  The instructions are easy to follow even if the recipe is more complicated than average.  So far everything I have tried from this book has turned out great, and I can't wait to try out even more.
B0000640VN|5.0|Speedy delivery and arived just as described online. DVD works wonderfully! Thanks!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I have been waiting for a soulful singer from England who could live up to the uniqueness of Sade and the musicality of Lewis Taylor. Corinne Bailey Rae definitely fits the bill. A refreshing album during a time when the genre is lacking artistry and originality.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this show live at the Hollywood House of Blues, and it was truly a magical experience. This is an incredibly talented band. I love the \\"grainy\\" effect they use throughout the video. <br /> <br />\\"Arriving somewhere\\" is my favorite cut.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Delightful mixture of action,adventure,suspence,drama,and comedy,that only Danny and Mel could achieve. Great entertainment!
0060589280|5.0|Paulo Coelho will go down in history as one of the greatest authors of all times.  I read 'The Alchemist' first and have become a huge fan of Paulo Coelho since.  He makes you feel that you personally know all of the characters in his stories.  He also writes in a style like no other author.  He makes a reference about a character and then explains it right away instead of making you wait sixty to seventy pages to find out what is going on with the character.  I love 'Eleven Minutes'!
B00065MDS6|5.0|I can't get enough of this cd. Every song is great it will take a few maybe more listens to relise that they are great, but it's worth it. <br /> <br />Track By Track <br /> <br />1.\\"Cirkus\\" (Robert Fripp, Peter Sinfield) - 6:27 5/5 <br />Amazing song one of there best. Great opener, the mellotron and just the unique vocal style of Gordon is outstanding. Should like this one first listen if you like there first album. <br /> <br />2.\\"Indoor Games\\" (Fripp, Sinfield) - 5:37 5/5 <br />This song is alot harder to get into. If your into the jazzy stuff you should like this track. The improv is great in the middle. And has a nice little ending to it.=) <br /> <br />3.\\"Happy Family\\" (Fripp, Sinfield) - 4:22 4.6/5 <br />Fast, \\"Different\\" and just sorda confusing but highly recommended. This song depends on how far your willing to branch out because this one is out there but it's very good. Plus it's about the Beatles. <br /> <br />4.\\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" (Fripp, Sinfield) - 2:47 5/5 <br />Great little song reminds me of some of there other ballads very good and is somewhat of a breather compared to Happy Family and what is next. And is about a lady obviously, a theme that would come up alot more in Islands. <br /> <br />5.\\"Lizard\\" (Fripp, Sinfield) - 23:15 6/5 <br />The first part \\"Prince Rupert Awakes\\" is probly my favorate song on the album Jon Andersons voice is out of this world. This is a pretty haunting track with some great jazzy playing. And the Mellotron can send chills down your spine if you are blasting this song. Pt.2 \\"Bolero: The Peacock's Tale\\" nice little part of the song. Has some great work from the band and Gordon gets the final words of the album \\"Forming lines of horse and steel By even yards march forward\\" and Pt.3The Battle of Glass Tears begins which is also outstanding lots of horns and amazing drumming and gets better by the minute. Then after some amazing horn work comes Fripp with not his greatest but some good ole haunting guitar at the end. And at the finale of the album is Bit Top which reminds me of spinning around in a room. It's ok but I wish the album ended with Fripps guitar. <br />Overall get this album if your into King Crimson and you are into some of the jazz fusion like stuff.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|After mid-twenties angst of his brilliant first album and the mom-friendly pop of his second, Mayer overlays a foundation of 70's R&B with solid guitar chops to provide us with an album that is dead-on for the times. His lyrics still ring personal and true-to-life with some songs reaching out to find a larger, more-political world to explore. This is a tight, well-written album which reaches the heights of Room for Squares. Overall, the man has a hit on his hands.
B00006FM77|5.0|This is a must have for any true Chicago fan.
6305433909|4.0|This is to show that with a little practice and help you can do anything.  This is a funny movie but it does have a good meaning behind it.  Just follow your dream and things can happen.   Thanks
0792839749|5.0|I am 67 years old and saw the movie when my children were growing up; I recently ordered it for my 7-y.o. grandson, and he LOVED IT.   I just think it's one of the all-time great kid [and grownup] movies!

B000I5X81K|5.0|Sirs; <br />   This, again is a great title.  Of all three, none is better than the other cause they each have individual tunes for their titles.  Josh should be proud of all his work and will continue, I'm sure.  Great.
B000J103N4|5.0|The orignal LP release of this recording was of audiophile quality. The recording engineers had done it right. Unfortunately when it was released on CD it was nowhere near as good. It lacked the dynamics of the original and the deep bass from Phil Lesh's bass guitar was lacking. <br /> <br />This version I just bought contains a standard CD that has been remastered and a High Definition DVD-Audio Disc. The Hi Def version is awesome. The remastering brought out detail not only in Crosby's voice but most noticably the background voices. The deep bass is not only restored it moves air in the room better than the LP.  <br /> <br />I urge all of you who have Universal Disc Players (The best on the market is the McCormack UDP-1 Deluxe CJ Version) to buy this disc and sit back and enjoy David Crosby's finest work!

0486440966|5.0|Although written in the 1860's, this timely novel will keep you captivated.  The narrative format is most interesting as the story is told from the viewpoint of different characters.  It is easy to read, moves right along and the language does not appear dated at all.  The characters are colorful but not unrealistic.
1401302378|4.0|If you're not marketing to the big middle then you're marketing to the long tail. This is useful wisdom for online sellers of \\"frictionless\\" products like search, music downloads, and e-books that tend to accrue many micro-audiences rather than a few large \\"hits\\". Everyone else is to some degree constrained by the realities of physical distribution. Author Chris Anderson expands on this straightforward theme with many examples drawn from the e-business realm, but his thesis may be harder to apply in the brick and mortar world. This book - like so many business books - is a very good magazine article expanded. But once the provocative core thesis is laid out in the first chapter, the rest seems fairly self-evident.

B000AY74OG|4.0|One of the cutest animated features to reach the big screen, get set to enjoy watching it in the comfort of your home.  It has everything:  Comedy, adventure, suspense, terror, and a fairly good story line.  And you'll love the characters.
B00005JPCA|1.0|Not only does this Bond suck.. They have officially destroyed the series with this movie. To begin with they chopped and killed the Bond formula which they should never back away from. Daniel Craig's poor acting also helped kill this movie. The absents of Q, and the fact the way the made Money Penny a bad guy was just stupid. This was a failed attempt at a love story. the plot was just abismal. Take teh Bond rights away from these people before they kill the series for good. Bring back Pierce, Bring back the Old Formula, and get rid of this tragedy.
B000056HE9|5.0|I checked out the movie from my local county library and really liked it. Then I tried to purchase it from Amazon and it was only available from Canada. The cost of the shipping was as much as the movie so I cancelled the order.

B00004TJKI|5.0|An excellent work by J Stewart.  His character displays more edge than Stewart does in so many other great works.  I love this movie.  The leading lady is VERY sexy in a non-typical way.  The story was very bold for its time.  It was produced prior to movies being stamped with a rating.  If you love Jimmy Stewart, and have not seen this one, I promise you will not be disappointed.
B0008ENICU|4.0|The constant verbal jousting in this 1939 classic has layers of vitriolic wit and honest insight thanks to the sharp script penned by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from Clare Booth Luce's legendary 1936 females-only Broadway hit. Crisply directed by George Cukor who is completely in his milieu here, the movie is really a mid-20th century survivor's guide for wealthy, insulated women seeking comfort and security in a world where they are defined solely by their husbands. While it is still an accomplished film in many respects, the 133-minute running time feels overly long as the mile-a-minute catty comments grow wearisome despite the deftness of their delivery by an estimable ensemble cast.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward. Socialite Mary Haines is a loving wife and mother whose decade-long marriage produces a wandering eye in her off-screen husband Stephen. Once he takes up with a predatory perfume salesgirl named Crystal Allen, Mary takes the train west to Reno for a divorce at which point Stephen and Crystal marry. But Mary is determined to win him back, as she knows full well that Crystal will eventually tire of Stephen and move on to greener pastures. It all ends in a bracing series of confrontations in what looks to be the world's largest powder room. What makes this story richer than the outline of events is the multi-voiced flow of gossip and advice pummeling Mary from her immediate social circle, in particular, her vituperative cousin and apparent best friend Sylvia Fowler.<br /><br />The three leads are impeccably cast. As the virtuous Mary, Norma Shearer is saddled with the dullest part since she has to react to the shenanigans circling her. However, she radiates her trademark class and a genuine sense of warmth. Joan Crawford was born to play the rapacious Crystal as she dynamically conveys the cynicism of her character's motives. Even though the main conflict is between Mary and Crystal, classic scene-stealer Rosalind Russell makes Sylvia a perfectly venal yet oddly endearing character with her wacky outfits and slapstick pratfalls. Over 130 women surround this trio, including a gallery of memorable characters embodied by an impressive bevy of studio-era actresses from Mary Boland's over-the-top Countess DeLave to a young pre-Hitchcock Joan Fontaine as irritatingly demure Peggy to Paulette Goddard's no-nonsense Miriam to Lucile Watson as Mary's worldly wise mother to Marjorie Main as the loud Reno dude ranch operator.<br /><br />Even with the inclusion of a knockdown catfight between Russell and Goddard, the film gets overly dramatic at times, highlighting Shearer's penchant for grand lady mannerisms, and there is a completely excisable ten-minute fashion show shot in early Technicolor to show off Adrian's extravagant costume designs. Special mention should be given to Cedric Gibbons' luxuriant art direction and Edwin Willis' set designs. The 2005 DVD has two vintage shorts of marginal interest - \\"Hollywood: Style Center of the World\\" about Adrian's fashion influence on everyday wear by American women, and \\"From the Ends of the Earth: Another Romance of Celluloid\\" about the use of textile imports in studio films. There is also a trailer for the film as well as one for the unnecessary 1956 musical remake, \\"The Opposite Sex\\". Completely disposable is an alternate black-and-white version of the fashion show and over forty minutes of original score and source music cues.endearing character with her wacky outfits and slapstick pratfalls.

B000J103OI|2.0|Anne Hathaway sheds (shreds?) her wholesome image in this movie.  Along the way, enough cliches were dredged up to fill a movie spoof based on this movie alone. <br /> <br />Her character, Andrea, has a visit from her father, and the only concerns he expresses are (1) whether she has enough money to pay the rent and (2) whether working as an office gofer is worthy of a young woman who turned down a chance to earn a law degree at an ivy league college.  Apparently, daddy is unconcerned about his little girl shacking up with a boyfriend with whom she shares an indefinite future. <br /> <br />There are the predictable effeminate male characters, one of whom guides her through her fashion transformation with all the typical catty comments.  There is the requisite post-makeover montage, followed by the requisite disapproval of her boyfriend & best friend.  I gagged when her boyfriend denied his disapproval of her job on the basis of its low status, explaining that he wouldn't mind if she was a pole dancer, as long as she was a pole dancer with integrity.  \\"Pole dancer with integrity\\" is apparently the \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\" for a new generation. <br /> <br />Andrea defends her boss with an absurd feminist rant about how if Amanda were a man, nobody would make such a big deal about her behavior.  I couldn't help but muse that if it was a man treating his employees that way, he'd be hit up with a sexual harassment lawsuit for \\"creating a hostile work environment.\\" <br /> <br />SPOILER WARNING <br />Other irritations include: <br />- Andrea burns her bridges at her first real job by abruptly quitting (she merely throws her cell phone into a fountain); <br />- Andrea & her boyfriend fight, leading to Andrea suggesting they \\"take a break\\" from each other (whatever that means), and then sleeping with another man whom she believes can help her career; <br />- Amanda Priestly's husband files for divorce, and she almost-but-doesn't-quite have a moment of regret realizing that her adolescent twin daughters might not adjust so well to Mom's disposable marriages; <br />- An all's-well-that-ends-well conclusion that includes reconcilliation between Andrea & her boyfriend, Andrea relinquishing her fashionista sensibilities in favor of sensible clothes (but not returning to the frumpy pre-makeover duds), and Andrea getting a great new job due to Amanda Priestly's glowing recommendation (the Devil apparently harbored a secret respect for Andrea). <br /> <br />In sum, I would have liked to see more fashion, more fairytale, and less of today's gritty social mores.
B000K7VHQ4|1.0|this movie is so bad i could hardly keep watching it-- reallly bad dialogue- lighting like the sepia setting on yer digital camera--- all these actors can barely act anyway--- over rated ed norton & giametti-- these are posers not actors--- when u put lousy actors in a bad movie the costumes mustaches accents all become ludicrous and laughable--everyone showed up-- all dressed up-- and its the emporers new clothes--- not one scene rings true -- the completely lame & idiotic tricks the deadly boring actor norton does are all just stupid camera tricks and absurd--- the scenes between these two phony actors mumbling in their idiotic accents saying stupid things in portentous tones----just incredible---the soundtrack which comes in every now and then is unbearable and seems unrelated half the time to the action--which is non existent anyway--  all the sound effects are very annoying & jarring -- how anyone can take this idiocy seriously --is beyond imagining - the director seems esp incompetent-- camera work  esp in the pathetic love scene --so sophomoric  --i`ve never seen worse in over fifty yeras of watching movies---no chemistry going on between any of the actors--- norton `s performance is the biggest illusion here tho-- nothing he says seems real or heartfelt---i truly cant believe anyone was able to sit thru this ----- just unbearable-----in fact it was very annoying to try and watch this !!!!!!

B000IFSDZQ|5.0|I agree with Jason's review, up to a point...I just dug this set out again, as I've been on a Per Gessle/Roxette kick lately, and haven't heard/watched this set in a while...I wrote a review but it never got published...hopefully this one will...after being away from this set for almost 3 years, now I have benefit of hindsight.<br /><br />First off, the set is nicely constructed...after being handled a lot, it never fell apart, so it is quite durable, and that sleeve for the DVD, it's not overly tight and the disc never got scratched or damaged...it's pretty-well protected.  The booklet is well-bounded and well-written, with lots of great photos and details about Roxette's releases...even solo material...however, no mention of Marie's English solo album or Per's \\"Mazarin\\" followup...but I realized that was in 2007, after the box and \\"Son Of A Plumber\\"...and no mention of \\"The Lonely Boys\\", Per's killer good side-project/book soundtrack.<br /><br />As for the tracklisting, I agree and disagree with Jason...I'm happy that it has certain single and album versions of songs over demos and live versions, as I view this box as the ULTIMATE hits collection...I want this box over the other assorted compilations like DBUGTTC, TPH, TBH, and \\"20 Greatest Hits\\"...so yeah, I want this to be the final statement of a hits collection of their first 20 years...I hate repetition in my collection...however, yeah, certain singles are despicably missing, like \\"Fingertips '93\\" and \\"Fireworks\\"...BUT I agree that Per SHOULD have final say, as he is the artist on the box...him and Marie...all artists should have full control over their own product, BUT he could have taken some suggestions from fans who are experts...he may have forgotten about a track or two...yet, Per seems to be well aversed in his own catalogue of tunes...he's a great archivist...many artists are not.<br /><br />I wonder when certain demos will see the light of day...I'm REALLY anxious to hear that hardrockier demo of \\"Stars\\"...if it's like the killer powerpoppy \\"7Twenty7\\" demo that's on the box, which is like prime Cheap Trick if you ask me, that will be music to my ears.<br /><br />However, certain B-sides that are missing, like \\"Crazy About You\\" and \\"Don't Believe In Accidents\\", and the now-rare single \\"Fingertips '93\\", they are coming out as bonus tracks on the new reissues of their 7 albums in mid-October...YAY!!  Not so yay is the too-slim \\"Pearl Of Passion\\" with 15 tracks instead of 20 like on the 1997 reissue...and no \\"Dance Passion\\" either...and the new \\"Have A Nice Day\\" doesn't have the 3 Spanish tracks either.  I wonder if they will be packaged in jewelcases or soft thin digipacks??  I get the feeling they will be digipacks the way the pictures of the back covers appear...all the same dark rusty red colour...I don't mind, I like digipacks, and they are thinner so they take up less space...I hope the liner notes are good, that there are rare pics and there's detailed info on the songs and rarities...actually, these reissues should have been 2CD sets, with all the related demos and unreleased tracks included, but being Per has full control...good and bad...we have to take what we can get, right??  And I'll take remasters of the Roxette catalogue...took long enough...and it's timely, 20 years since they broke internationally with \\"The Look\\"...so if not now, never.<br /><br />I also wonder if there will be a \\"More Rarities\\" multi-CD set coming out in the future??  And I'm thrilled about the new TWATG, expanded to 40 tracks, yowza!!!!  I now need the whole GT catalogue and Per's other Swedish-language solo records...and all of Marie's.<br /><br />All worth it for my personal Michael Jackson, my personal King Of Pop/Powerpop, Per Gessle/Roxette.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it is watchable...BUT it could have been better-produced, as you constantly see digital squares, due to all that compression, that it's quite distracting, shows more on some vidclips like \\"June Afternoon\\" and\\"She Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\", where at times it looks like worn-out videotape...at least it has all the vidclips, up thru \\"Opportunity Nox\\", but where's \\"One Wish??\\"...shoulda been included, but I wonder if it was done after the box was manufactured??  At least it has the full \\"MTV Unplugged\\" performance, aired and not aired, with interviews...delightful and the compression doesn't show too badly here!!like worn-out videotape...at least it has all the vidclips, up thru \\"Opportunity Nox\\", but where's \\"One Wish??\\"...shoulda been included, but I wonder if it was done after the box was manufactured??  At least it has the full \\"MTV Unplugged\\" performance, aired and not aired, with interviews...delightful and the compression doesn't show too badly here!!
B000JLTRJ0|5.0|World Trade Center showed the highs and lows of human emotion elicited by the terror attacks on our nation.  The images of the way the families dealt with the waiting and the confusion of the first horrible hours struck home. <br />As a 9/11 family member, it was hard to watch, but I know exactly how they felt! It is like holding your breath in anticipation of good news. Fortunately for those PAPD families, they were able to breathe again.  It was a good feeling to experience their joy after 5 long years of holding my breath! <br />This is a film for all to see.  It illustrates what really happened and what could happen again. I wasn't sure if I was ready to watch the film, but I am glad I did. Plus, it was nice to see my Firefighter brother in law in the film doing what he did on that day! <br />Thank you Oliver Stone! <br />
B000L43AN4|5.0|there is not a bad track on this album. <br />a must have for Waits fans and a good intro for those that dont know him.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|Excellent remake! My daughters (ages 3 & 6) love it an since they got the movie for Christmas its the only one they want to watch. Its funny and a very light movie for kids; very important in these days where violence is everywhere.
068485743X|5.0|This is the book I had been searching for.  Written by an editor who is also a writer; it is filled with practical information about how too submit something to an editor or an agent.  It points out the common errors that are usually found in early writings.  Also how to find an agent is lightly discussed. If you are just starting out or have a string of rejections, this book will help you.  Bon voyage! <br />
1594200823|5.0|I never thought I could sit down for an entire three days and devour a book about corn and grass farming.  Excellent read.  Extremely informative, yet wildly entertaining at the same time.  I can't stop talking to my friends and family about this book because it applies to just about every facet of life.  I will never think about boxed cereal, organic spring greens, or grass in the same way ever again.  I gifted it to several family members this Christmas and liberal and conservatives alike are currently enjoying it as much as I did.
0736063684|5.0|This is a great book destined to be a classic for those interested in weight training.  Highly recommended.  The second edition includes additional information on injury and injury prevention.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This CD is not available until Jan 30th 2007, but I have seen the total show on KPTV and it is one of the very best I have ever seen. It has a mix of everything you could call Celtic with an awesome rendition on the \\"Irish Fiddle\\" or violin to a mixture of beautiful songs from each of the artists. The CD's are available from each of the artists and I would recommend them also. Don't miss this one when it becomes available.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I do enjoy Ms. Krall's singing but for me it's the incredible interplay between the musicians (including Krall's piano) the merits the 5 stars. I acually have the DVD which I highly recommend. Anthony Wilson not only plays brillantly but gets the best guitar tone of any other live recording I've heard. Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton are tight and telepathic - pure genuis in rhythm. Both Claus Ogerman and Allan Broadbent offer great arrangements and work the Orchestra deftly. And Diana sings. The production is perfect. This could not be any better.
B000A6T262|5.0|This is it.  This is all the Star Trek you'll need for your weekend theme-party.  No Jar-Jar.  No Midi-chlorians.  Just good old Trek. <br /> <br />The movies are a bit uneven, but that's not the fault of this collection.  This is all about having them all, and lording it over your non-federation friends.  Chill your Tranya, import your Romulan Ale, and have some fun.

B00005N5S5|5.0|This is a great movie about two naked men from the future who chase a big-haired Linda Hamilton all over Los Angeles. <br /> <br />Seriously, have you not seen this film?  If you haven't, you're in for a treat.  It is funny, violent, and intense.  You can clearly see all the makings of director James Cameron's future epic Titanic in his work on this film.  It is practically a pre-quel.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie is a documentary of Al Gore's obsession with climate change since way before the rest of the world had heard of it.    He posits many challenging bits of evidence but does not leave you with the information you need to make a real change.   I feel that the data is well presented and most likely correct but he leaves out the big message, which I feel is about our absurd oil gluttony, and the concept that it will peak in the next few years (or already has) and demand will forevermore outstrip supply, and what that means for suburbia, and our food supply.     You should buy this film, and show it to everyone you know, just to start the conversation and keep it going throughout the country.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Every song is beautifully sung.  This is an awesome album.  She has such a beautiful voice.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Most of these tracks are excellent, and evoke memories of earlier R&B that contrast sharply with her youth. Songs such as \\"If I Aint Got You\\" are prime examples of her continued success and growth as a songwriter and performer.  In an era of the \\"one-hit\\" or \\"one-album\\" wonder, Alicia Keys is emerging as a consistent (yet, not stagnant) artiste.  I hope the trend continues.
B000J4QWNQ|1.0|What can I say? Its hard to believe how bad this movie actually is. I cant honestly think of anything good to say about it - the movie itself was lacking on all counts and seemed like it would never end, the picture quality varied between poor and average (for a HD DVD) and the sound was no better than an average DVD. Add the fact that being a \\"combo-disc\\" it cost US$30 and it really does become one to be avoided at all costs. Do yourself a favour and buy something else!
0670032506|1.0|\\"Ready for Anything\\" is a pointless book full of information and ideas that anyone who went through school should already know. I learned a long time ago to write things down instead of keeping them in my head and I also know that being organized gives me more flexibility and less stress so why would I want to read a book in which Allen writes about basic concepts in a philosophical way. Yeah this book might be good for someone who didn't pick up on these basic skills in Middle school but for me it was a waste of my time which I'm sure Allen would agree is not a good use of my skills.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this book because maybe then you will open yourself up to more time for \\"creativity\\" which is the point of the book in the first place.
B000E1ZK5A|4.0|Good movie, reasonably good acting, great sound and great picture quality (HDDVD version). The depth charge scenes really are a joy for those with a good quality surround sound system and sub in particular!! (although your neighbours may not agree). Some say the DTS track is better than the Dolby Digital+ track, so you may want to check out both.
0064410935|5.0|The book is, of course, a children's classic.  Great for a child who is moving away from \\"picture books\\" to \\"chapter books.\\"  I was most happy about the quick free delivery - ordered one week before Christmas, it arrived two days later!
0393327655|1.0|Mr. Harris' book is short (thankfully) and well-written, for which he receives the one star.  However, the premise of the book that religion, and especially western (Abrahamic) religions have been harmful to humanity is woefully ignorant of actual history. <br /> <br />What was the condition of the world before the Abrahamic religions?  Rather than the idyllic garden of paradise atheists make it seem, the pre-religious world was one of despotism, mass murder of the conquered, slavery, and belief in supernatural agents (gods/demons as causes of natural calamities) who needed to be appeased by various means such as human sacrifice. <br /> <br />What did western religion (especially Christianity) change? Most importantly, it introduced the concept that each person is an individual creation of God and therefore individually holy, worthwhile, and self-directed.  It also introduced the concept that creation operates according to certain rules which can be discovered (science!).  It provided a code of conduct: \\"thou shalt not kill\\" and all the rest of the commandments.  It introduced the concept of mercy, charity, and justice and responsibility for one's actions before a higher being.  Where do we think our modern civil society's bedrock notions of individuality, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, equality, fairness, etc. come from?  Remember \\"all men are created equal and are endowed by the creator with certain inalienable rights\\" ... without the creator, why shouldn't some men (of higher intellect, \\"superior race\\", etc.) be exalted above others? <br /> <br />Atheists seem to think the civil society is just a natural human condition and perfectly rational.  Was slavery, a concept that had existed around the world since time immemorial, irrational?  Who abolished the concept other than Christians?  Who developed bounds on the scourge of war (by developing concepts for \\"just war\\"), however poorly they have been applied?  Did Ginghis Khan or Julius Ceasar worry about disproportionality when they were invading foreign lands?  No doubts that Christians also committed atrocities by the bucketfull (the crusades, the inquisitions, the native American slavery and genocide); but the point is that, due to religion, there was room for growth and improvement with time, while the rest of humanity was forever stuck in the darkness. <br /> <br />To see the need for religion, just look at the past century.  Godless materialistic rationalism resulted in the twin births of Nazism and Communism, which were responsible for the death of more than 100 million and the enslavement (to the state) of billions. That is Mr. Harris' godless rationality written large.  I am not actually a very religious person myself, rather a rational deist in the tradition of Voltaire and Jefferson.  However, NO ONE should get away with disputing the undoubted civilizing influence of religion, especially western religions, in the development of modern sensibilities. <br />
0066620996|1.0|SINCE READING THIS BOOK, I'VE WANTED TO SEND A COPY TO 3 CEO'S OF COMPANIES I RECENTLY HAD BAD EXPERIENCES.  THE PROBLEM IS I (THE CUSTOMER) WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET THIS BOOK TO THEM!  THREE BAD EXPERIENCES WITH BIG COMPANIES AND IT IS NOW SO PLAIN TO ME THAT THE LEADER OF THESE COMPANIES NEED TO READ THIS BOOK.  I THINK ABOUT THIS BOOK OFTEN WHILE RUNNING MY OWN COMPANY.  IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS LEADER OR BUSINESS OWNER, I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK!
B000J103PC|2.0|We didn't like this movie at all.  While Meryle Streep did a good job (reason for 2 stars instead of 1) this movie must have been targeted to the 19 - 21 year old female market.  Even my son's girlfriend was bored by it.
B000HIVQK8|5.0|<br />The George Harrison disc (and dvd) 'Living in the Material World' is an excellent piece of art and musicianship.  It's best listening while  reading the accompanying literature and lyrics.  An excellent choice!
B000GYHVFC|5.0|This movie has to be one of my favorite sci-fi master pieces of all times. <br />The movie was very well produced and put together just as I said a master piece. <br />The plot was so Utopian and it helps bring the meaning of how people and there strong believes even if falsely lead can be changes in an instance.
6304362498|5.0|I loved the book in an oddly fascinating way, and the same with the film. Although the film is not a blow by blow account from the book, it serves to relay the darkness of the hour for humankind.It is one film that I watch at least annually. Orwells' vision of a future where public opinion and even personal thoughts are virtually controlled by \\"big brother\\" is at our doorstep. (Think in terms of the controlled media and political correctness, and the Patriot Act.)History is being rewritten as we speak. Orwell may have had insider information on the future that we are all rapidly seeing come into fuition. He was a member of several secret societies in London, notably the Fabian society, whose members advocate a socialist \\"big brother\\" control of the populace.<br /><br />The acting in the film is first rate, while the scenery conveys the hopelessness of the situation. It is a must see.
1400049628|5.0|I heard from several people that this book was excellent, and they were right. Never once got bored in reading it. If a Class 4 zombie outbreak does occur, I'm sure this guide will be somewhat helpful. There is also some parts in the book that made me believe that some of the events mentioned happened. Very convincing and entertaining.
B00005M91K|5.0|It is one of the most wonderfully shot documentaries. I would reccomend it to everyone.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|I've listened to quite a few Kraftwerk albums since college friends introduced me to this talented and innovative group back in the early '90's, but somehow I'd missed out on \\"Trans-Europe Express\\" until this last Christmas. This is really excellent electronic music, possibly one of Kraftwerk's best efforts. Sometimes it seems that their sense of musicality and melody and such gets just a bit swamped by their fascination with mechanical and computerized sound, and sometimes this makes some of their pieces seem to drag just a bit on the verge of monotony--never completely, but a tad too close for comfort. They have deftly dodged this minor glitch in this album, though, even with the wonderfully harsh, mechanistic \\"Metal on Metal\\" to say nothing of the beautifully transcendental \\"Endless Endless\\" or the disturbingly surreal \\"Hall of Mirrors.\\" On a humorous note, \\"Showroom Dummies\\" inevitably evoked for me the classic Doctor Who villains known as the Autons (aggressively colonizing beings who inhabit plastic mannequins and attack earth, starting with our shopping malls) but I suspect this was unintentional on Kraftwerk's part. In any case, I think this may well be the most approachable album for those newly wishing to explore Kraftwerk's work, but old explorers like myself will undoubtedly enjoy it as well.
B00005UE6T|5.0|This is a modern-day morality tale: because of their abuse of a mind-altering substance, fuelled by their yearning to escape the reality of their dreary lives, all the characters pay dearly. One loses her sanity, the other his health, another his freedom, and the last her dignity. As Mrs. Reagan once said, \\"Just say no\\".  <br />But obviously it's not that simple to jus say no, so the viewer is caught between watching a 2-hour car-crash, witnessing the disaster unfolding before their eyes, and simutaneously forced to consider their own attitude to drugs. Excellent, and very grown-up.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I can't give an opinion on the series itself except via what my roommate has said.  She loves this series and missed a few shows and was \\"lost\\" on Lost. :) but was totally thrilled to recieve this for christmas.  The bonus features are great to have. Shipping was great as it arrived just in time for christmas.  Word to the wise on the \\"free\\" super saver shipping.  If you in a hurry, don't use it.  I wanted to make sure i recv'd this in time and paying 3 dollars was worth it.
0441172717|5.0|This isn't just one of the greatest sci-fi novels written, but one of the greatest novels ever written, period.  The characters and believable, the situations intriguing and the science pretty much sound. <br /> <br />Frank Herbert based most of his books around power struggles and how humans operate when given exceeding harsh conditions to survive in.  Here you'll see parries within parries, fantastic interplays of action and diplomatic maneuvering that would make Machiavelli take some lessons. <br /> <br />Paul Atreides still is one of the most brilliant characters ever to grace any book.   He's brash, arrogant, and is going headlong into a situation that he knows will only end poorly for him in the end.  It's a compassion for the people, a want for revenge, and a primal struggle to survive that eventually leads him to embrace the beginnings of the golden path. <br /> <br />The Baron is a satisfying villain, and truly one of the most vile to be found in all literature.  A lot of the likeable characters get killed off,  as another positive point is that about everyone feels killable, which adds much to the suspense of the novel. <br /> <br />Any sci-fi fan owe's himself to read this.
B000I0QL82|5.0|No film library should be without this film.In every aspect this is a classic.Not only is this this great for Christmas but for any time of the year.With the work of Crosby and Astaire this film stands above many other musicals and the extras included in this set are great.Everyone knows the song White Christmas is from the film of the same name but this is the film where it debuted and it is the better setting for it.It carries with it more emotion and feeling this time.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I was expecting this movie to be hysterical (basing that on the review from a friend).  It was more sad yet touching yet slightly disturbing...I don't know, it wasn't what I was expecting and therefore I found it lacking.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This smooth singing lady has been an English secret for too long. She sings jazz, in the tradition of Lena Horne and Julie Christy. She sings of long nights and lonesome days; rainstorms and bright sunny days; she sings the blues like I haven't heard in a long, long time. I will be buying up her library of cds as soon as I can. <br /> <br />She is a wonderful singer.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|Yes, I was a MV fan back in the 90s, but many things have changed since then in the world and so have I. That's why I didn't have a problem that MV 2006 didn't look like MV 1987.  <br />So I couldn't wait to see Miami Vice the movie. And I liked it very much, watched it twice. And wanted that DVD asap. When I found out that the 'unrated' version includes the infamous boat race, I knew this was the one to have. Probabely only Michael Mann knows why this scene and others included in the 'unrated' version have been cut for the theater edition. Many things make a lot more sense now, it feels to me like the theater edition misses something, has holes in the storyline. This one feels like complete. So don't hesitate and go for UNRATED! <br /> <br />scenes not included in the theatrical version (AFAIR): <br />- boat race (~4 min.) <br />- Trudy receives roses from Montoya (~2-3 min.) <br />- Isabella grabs into steering wheel when all is over (~30 sec.)
B0000C1733|5.0|If you love the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you must add this to your collection
B00000K3CM|4.0|Thank you for sending this so quickly, i got it for a christmas present and it got here way before I thought! Thanks again!
0671449028|5.0|We discovered Sandra Boynton's board books when our daughter was quite young and loved them immediately, particularly this one. It's a very good \\"winding down\\" book, and the board book style is excellent for little ones who aren't ready for easily destroyed regular pages. Our daughter is now 17 and I can still recite this one word for word.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|...I liked this movie.  Although it follows the same formula as almost every other teen movie (opposites attract, they learn from each other, they fight, they learn lessons, they fall in love) it still offers something fresh with the chemistry between its characters.  I still don't understand why they can't make a movie about two poor kids or two spoiled rich kids...I mean at least they didn't go the obvious route and make this a bi-racial thing (ala `Save the Last Dance', which I love but needed need repeating).   <br /> <br />So, despite offering nothing new `Step Up' still delivers entertainment that is worth the time.  So we have tough-guy foster-kid Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum, a boy with a future) who rebels with his friend Mac (Damaine Radcliff) by stealing cars and breaking and entering.  His latest stunt though (trashing the auditorium of a local performing arts school) got him caught and sentenced to 200 hours of community service within the school walls.  That's where he meets aspiring dancer Nora (Jenna Dewan) who just lost her dance partner and is desperate for help with her senior showcase.  That's where Tyler comes in for little does she know, he can really dance. <br /> <br />Expect the usual boy likes girl, girl doesn't trust boy but is drawn to the danger he presents.  She's tempted to fall for him while still having a boyfriend, yet boyfriend is creep.  She also must contend with a mother who doesn't support her dream and continues to push her own aspirations on her daughter.  Boy must learn life lessons about change and sacrifice, and this may or may not manifest itself in the form of Skinny (De'Shawn Washington), Mac's younger brother, who gets himself in trouble after trying to hard to be like his older brother and his best friend (I saw that one coming from the very beginning). <br /> <br />There are some good performances by the two leads as well as Drew Sidora who plays Nora's best friend Lucy as well as singer Mario (who looks like a youngerChris Rock) who plays Miles, the school musician who secretly loves Lucy.  I liked it, and I'm sure the general public will too.  It has enough charm and chemistry to make it memorable, I just wish they would invest some extra time and effort to make a movie that's different and unique, not something rewashed and regurgitated.  Alas, it's still a lot of fun and the dancing is amazing!
B0000549B0|5.0|I'm presently working in Russia and my secretary is always talking to herself.  I would ask her if she was talking to Harvey and see would give me the 'Deer and the head lite look!' and say, \\"Who is Harvey?\\"  I told her that I would get her the movie for Christmas and she absolutely loved it.  I saw it many years ago and never forgot it and you can't go wrong with any James Stewart movies.
0743289412|1.0|I have read most of his books and this one one of the dullest. Dealing with a widow and her constant interceptions in her head from her dead husband gets to be quite a bore. Even down to the predictable big monster King like to end his books with, this book was dull and disjointed from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />Cell - that now was interesting, with his standard gore. This was really really ordinary and boring
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm really enjoying re-watching this series.  I think that anybody who likes Sci-Fi, Action or Joss Whedon will like this series.  Shipping on this item was super fast.
0743289412|1.0|I love Stephen King's books - I can usually plow through even his less interesting stories. Lisey's Story was different. Echoing the sentiments of other reviewers, the so-called 'secret language' between Lisey and Scott was annoying from the first introduction of the word 'smuck', and King's use of this language was unrelenting. It was annoying and incomprehensible. The story itself meandered along with no real purpose, and finally led to a vapid end. The only thing I felt by the end of the book was relief that the experience was finally over. King usually creates interesting characters, but that is not the case in this book. Scott came across as a complete idiot, Lisey came across as a two-dimensional character who behaved in unbelievable ways. Overall, this is probably King's worse effort to date.
0529064847|5.0|This is a great Bible to use for personal study, and we also use it daily in our school (homeschool) studies.  The print is clear and easy to read, and the actual passages are clearly \\"written\\" and are pleasant to read.  We would definately recommend this bible to friends and fellow homeschoolers.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|My 11 yr old daughter loves this so much! She plays it or the other one every single day! My husband and I love it too, so it is not a problem!!!
B000HEYVD6|5.0|The wonderfully odd characters who make up The Camel Club are so appealing that it hooked me.  They are goofy yet are involved in a deadly plot that they couldn't hope to foil - or could they?  There is apparently a lot of brain power in the group, and they manage also to be your friends.  This book is exciting and makes me want to read it again.

B000F9RB8A|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle on Blu-ray looks/sounds excellent.  I already own the DVD version of Kung Fu Hustle, but watching Kung Fu Hustle on Blu-ray is a vast improvement.  With its vibrant colors and incredible sound, Kung Fu Hustle is definitly one of the better Blu-ray releases I have seen so far.<br /><br />Just like the DVD, the Blu-ray version is also loaded with extras:<br /><br />-commentary with Stephen Chow, Lam Tze Chung, Tin Kai Man, and Chan Kwok Kwun<br /><br />-42 minute behind-the-scenes featurette (in Chinese with English subtitles)<br /><br />-2 deleted scenes<br /><br />-30 minute candid Ric Meyers interview with Stephen Chow (in English)<br /><br />-5 minutes of outtakes<br /><br />-trailers for Resident Evil 2, Underworld 2, and xXx
B000H5U832|5.0|We bought this for our 2 kids for Christmas, having already seen it in the theaters last summer.  Even though they are 4 years apart in age (5 year old boy, 9 year old girl), they both enjoy watching it and have seen it several more times since the holidays.  One of the reasons I like it is that there is no \\"bad guy\\" as you often find in other Disney/kids movies.  And for adults (who often have to sit there and watch the movie as well!), there are a lot of \\"cameo\\" appearances, via voice, of famous NASCAR-related characters which keep it interesting.  Overall, a good family movie.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I'll admit I did not \\"Love\\" this completely when I first bought it.  But being a true fan I listened to it again a couple more times and each time I would be attracted to more songs, NOW I love it completely!  I highly recommend you give it a chance.  You won't regret it.
6305907145|5.0|This is a very enjoyable DVD that has everyting in it necessary for a good \\"chick flick\\". Very worth while to sit down to.  It has a great storyline with a little suspense,humor and romance with a happy ending. The costumes and scenery are beautiful, and the acting is first class.
B000IZJ1KC|4.0|Superb Metal album!! At first I was put off by the commercial leanings of this album, expecting to hear IMMORTAL. But, after repeated listening, it grew on me in a big way. I should have given this 5 STARS!! So far it's the best Metal album I've heard from 2006.<br /><br />Some are saying it's not IMMORTAL. Those IMMORTAL ripsaw power chords are there. Only they sound more mainstream. And the growling dark winter vocals and lyrics are there. It sounds like IMMORTAL to me. But, with a more straight ahead feel to the Metal. I think maybe Abbath is looking for a more commercial appeal to his sound. Black Metal is basically a fringe audience. When you can play this good, who wouldn't want to appeal to a bigger audience? It works for me in a big way. I love IMMORTAL. They're my second favorite Black Metal band next to EMPEROR. But, I love the direction Abbath is taking with this music. This is the best solid straight up Metal album I've heard in a long time. And I hope there's going to be more.<br /><br />IMMORTAL lyrics and vocals, yes. BATHORY songs, yes.<br /><br />MOTORHEAD? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br /><br />I don't get the MOTORHEAD comparison. I love MOTORHEAD, but the only track that sounds even vaguely like MOTORHEAD is maybe THE STORM I RIDE. Maybe.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is another excellent movie in the tradition of the English Classics.  The acting is first class with beautiful scenery and costumes.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|This film, I must admit, was my first experience with \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\"  And because I didn't know the story line, everything was a pleasant surprise.  I was so incredibly moved by the touching romances and the simplicity of the time (when just the touch of a hand was so electric), and it was a film that truly made me believe in happiness ever after.  Watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop from disdain and contempt to unconditional love against all odds was emotional and inspiring and a journey I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing.  And now that I have the DVD and have watched it several times, I am still swept away every time.  I absolutely love Matthew MacFadyen's performance, especially in the climactic scene when he tells Elizabeth, \\"I love and love and love you,\\" getting choked up on the final \\"love you.\\"  Now who could resist that?  Although I enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance as well, I felt that she didn't appear quite as genuine as she should have in this same critical scene.  But that wasn't enough to take away from the powerful moment.   <br /> <br />Overall, I can't praise this movie enough.  Yes, it is very condensed compared to some other versions, but I love everything about this film, and I think they kept the best parts of the plot line in.  In fact, now having seen three other versions, this is still my favorite by far.  This film ranks as one of my top five all-time favorites, and I don't think it will ever get bumped!  Like another reviewer said, \\"It's the perfect movie\\" and \\"I will probably watch this film a million more times before I die.\\"  My sentiments exactly!  Another aspect I enjoyed, I might add, was the music -- I even bought the soundtrack.  It's beautiful and adds so perfectly to each scene. <br /> <br />If you fell in love with this film like I did, I highly recommend two other Jane Austen stories:  The Emma Thompson version of \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" and the Gwenyth Paltrow version of \\"Emma.\\"
B0000032LS|5.0|this cd is great! i received it in under a week. i payed less than half of what it cost elsewhere.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version is really done well.  I liked it even better the second time I watched it!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|What makes this quiet little gem of a movie work is the trust the screenplay writer and director afford to the audience. Rather than moralizing or beating us over the head with their views of what it means to be a success, the subtle failures we all embrace every day, or the filters we use to distort our picture of the world to match our view of ourselves, they encapsulate these ideas and many more in the snappy dialogue and comical situations. You don't even realize the movie has so much meat to it because it tastes so much like ice cream.<br /><br />Without spoiling where the action takes you, I'll just say that the acting is strong but it's the ensemble that really works here, not one specific actor's acumen. The climax is the inevitable but unexpected culmination of all of these forces at work and, even though at first it seems a bit disturbing or unnerving, it throws a mirror up to show us how disturbing a society (our society) becomes when beauty trumps character.<br /><br />Definitely worth checking out.
B000KP62MA|5.0|This album is simply perfect. You've got all the songs from ABL and a new version of The Kill, which is awesome! <br />On the DVD there are great interviews and awesome live songs. <br />It's a must have deluxe edition!!!!

0375836675|5.0|I have read a lot of books in my teen life but I can honestly say that I Am the Messenger is, by far, one of the greats. It had me captivated until the very last sentence. Throughout the book I kept getting the same vague, happy feeling from the events leading up to Ed's realization. They are all so touching and almost inspiring in a way. The new aces were always interesting, expecially the Ace of Hearts, and I loved how the names and places all had their own reasons on why they were there (for example: For the Ace of Spades, Ed had to \\"dig\\" for the truth, and in the Ace of Hearts, all matters were concering the heart).  <br /> <br />I think the book is a very exciting and infectious mystery that will hold your attention, should you choose to read it. Although there was an event that was a bit predictable, I was not disappointed with the ending at all.  <br /> <br />In fact, I think I closed the book with a smile on my face.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter and i wound up watching it with her. It had a spanish version which was a waste, because we do not speak it...but the quality of the movie was great!.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This is a fresh and delightful romp with one of the world's most idiosyncratic and disfunctional familes. Yet it never quite turns them into cartoons. Each family member fits with the others in a way that real families work together.  The laughs are genuine throughout the voyage of discovery they make which includes tragedy, slapstick, and pathos, and ends with a scene that will leave you gasping for breath between the laughs.  I haven't enjoyed a movie this much for years.  My best description of this movie: you won't sit there and know what is coming next.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The soundtrack to Brokeback Mountain is incredibly moving....Gustavo Santaolalla rightly deserves recognition for his original score, which seems to contain so many emotions with such simple musical lines... moving, sad, uplifting....The opening sequence that draws the viewer into the two main characters, to the closing sequence as Ennis buttons Jack's shirt, is simply amazing. <br /> <br />The other artists on this CD round out the movie score wonderfully, with my two favorites of Willie Nelson and Steve Earle. <br /> <br />It's a wonderful addition to anybody's CD collection.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks for listening.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this film. It's way more than just Gore giving a slide show about climate change. A friend pointed out that I was \\"morally obligated\\" to see the film and form opinions about the content. Strong words, but he was right. Likewise, I urge you to see this movie if you have not, and then to not ignore your thoughts and feelings afterwards via inaction.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Love Josh Groban's voice.  Play this CD every day, all day long at work.
B00004YZFR|5.0|i thought restoration of this excellent chronicle of the stones 69 tour and america at that time was superb.both visuals and sound.i'm 52 so i definitly remember the country at that time.when i watched the criterion collection i really caught the vibe of a mad bull lost it's way,both at altamont and in america in 69
B00000DQWT|5.0|This is an all-time favorite!  Timeless.  I wore out the first copy in cassette version.  Just purchased the CD, and I'm loving it all over again.  This is great \\"on-the-road\\"music - put it in the slot and start crusing.  The time just flies by...........
0783240287|1.0|When I try to watch this, I have to turn the sound on my TV all the way up to hear it and even then it's still too low. Some parts are better than others, but I was not pleased with the sound recording quality.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Buy it.  Rent it.  Give copies away with abandon.  Al Gore's presentation is second-to-none.  This may be our last chance to heed the call; and Mr. Vice President, Al Gore points the way.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah is always great, but she does an amazing job in this CD.  I love the spin she gives on some traditional Christmas songs.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This DVD set is a must have if you're into PF and if you are not sure, buy this and see what you have been missing. Simply Awesome. My 14 YO couldn't move, he was glued to the set and this never happens. Then, the next day, there he was again, this time with 4 of his friends. Nobody ever has, or will put on a better live show than PF. My son agrees. Of course he is of the persuation that the best music was before his time: Hendrix, The Who, PF, The Doors, Santana, Joe Walsh/James Gang, Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Janis, jerry and the boys, Led Zep, ABB, Little Feat, Rick Derringer, Uriah Heap, all the hair bands and/or heavy metal,etc, etc, you get the picture. Now if I can just get him to put the CD's back where he found them ,lol. Really cool though to share this DVD set with the younger genX. I missed this tour as my son was 2 and we had a daughter on the way, but with this DVD no matter. I must warn you, you will not want to leave the set once you start this up. Also check out the other parts of these DVD's, i.e. bootleg from the bootleggers and all the other extras. And after you get this playing, try going back and changing the sound under audio settings. Then, get a pint and settle in for some awesome entertainment.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|the cd is just awesome and i would buy another one. <br />this product is A+ with me. <br />thanks
B000ICL3KG|5.0|What surprised me about this film is how enjoyable, interesting and (yes) funny it and Al Gore are! Although it is perhaps the most important and effective film of all time - a must see for anyone who cares what the future holds and what we can do to salvage a future for our children - it is still a fun film to watch. Think how different the world would be today if Al Gore, and not George W Bush, had been in office for the last six years...
074356619X|5.0|Love this book for reminding me of truths that I know but have not acted on consistently. Moment by moment I am moving from one joy to the next. I recommend this read to all ages.
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt deservedly hit it big when they released Tragic Kingdom.  Their upbeat ska, punk, and rock influenced music stood out among the post-grunge crowd.  There are several radio hits here, and the album has a lot more to offer.  It's definitely a CD that is worth a spin if you like what you've heard of them before.  A classic 90s album!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The best film I've seen in years........so original, you will cry laughing from begining to end.
B00005NQCB|5.0|This cd is great. Icehouse is a good Australian band, and I like them as much as I did in the eighties. Songs that stand out are their hits - Crazy and Electric Blue, as well as Nothing too Serious ( a very catchy song), and the title track Man of Colours.  The whole cd is worth giving a listen to, and the bonus tracks of Crazy, are a great addition.
032147404X|5.0|I've read several \\"in depth\\" digital photography books before, but I always got too bogged down in the details and usually never finished the books in the past.  I bought this book mostly b/c of the rave reviews and it's popularity.  I wasn't really looking for a digital photography book.  The reviews were right on! <br /> <br />This book drops pearls of photo taking all over the place, and gives you the nitty gritty of how to do it.  I'm only half way thru the book, and already my photos have improved, and I don't even have one of those high powered SLR type cameras (yet).  Kelby's direct and humorous style set this book apart from other \\"how to\\" books.  It's a pleasure to read, and the pearls are in very short digestable chapters that are a quick read. <br /> <br />I'm now a big fan of Kelby, and I intend to purchase his book on Photoshop. Then I'll really get my photos looking good.
0307346609|5.0|This was a very gripping book & a fast read.  I liked the way the author told the story from so many different points of view & the way he covered the political angle of how countries would handle a zombie attack.  Very interesting & well thought out!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As something of an opposite to Star Trek (which I also love), Joss Whedon breathes life into the sci-fi genre, by making it rock. Since it's about real (well...) people, not necessarily doing the right thing, you are constantly surprised and entertained. The show certainly wasn't cancelled because of low quality.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Awesome...Reall good packaging...Arrived in very good condition and on time...It's bliss to enjoy this awesome series on DVD with back to back episodes
B000003S2M|5.0|Harold Budd and Brian Eno's Ambient 2 (or The Plateaux Of Mirror) is a time-lapse shoot of a flower, showing the impending doom of it's eventual death.  A compilation of withdrawn drama, an exploration of introverted narcissism in it's purest form.  \\"Above Chiangmai\\" is a clear example of this. \\"Failing Light\\" plays like your life flashing before your eyes, a long lost home movie.  The light and energy of that entity flickering away. Fading to nothingness.  Failing Light can give you a sense of how small you really are on this planet.  You're just a commoner that no one will remember after you expire. Failing to express, failing to inspire, failing to live up to everyones expectations. I wonder if entertainment celebrities feel that way?  When their star is flickering do they feel like Failing Light sounds?<br /><br />olofpalme63
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Hi this product was awesome. Much above expectations. Arrived on time and in good shape and in good packaging.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I like this watch because it is thin, thin, thin.  It doesn't have a bulkly weight or size.  The best part is that it looks sophisticated.  It can be casual in casual clothes or can be very dressy when I'm dressed up.
1400049628|5.0|I got this as a gift for my brother who is absolutley terrified of a zombie invasion (wish I was joking), but hey, who isn't.  Anyways, I took a peek myself, and it covers everything from how zombies originated to how you can get rid of them in teams (bring a buddy if are are hunting zombies!).  Along with hilarious illustrations, this book is a fun AND insightful read.
B000H5U832|5.0|DVD was in good condition, movie viewed great. Arrived on time. Very pleased however packaging could have been better.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|Given that it's still 5 days till this movie even hits the shelves, not only have I NOT seen Invincible Iron Man (I'm pre-ordering it), but frankly I highly doubt that any of these others reviewers so far have either. So to counter the premature nay-sayers I'm giving this movie five stars based on the commercials I've seen on it to date. Is this accurate or fair? Absolutely not! But in all likelihood neither are any of the other reviews do date.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We had not watched LOST on TV and were not even familiar with the show.  We were captivated by the shows and unfortunately we were couch potatoes much longer than we should have been.  We lent the DVDs to a friend and she also thoroughly enjoyed it and even hooked on the series.  Can't wait til the Third Season is released.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Thoroughly camp and lacking production quality, which is why I bought it. Plan 9 from Planet X is supposed to be the cheesiest film ever made and my all-time favorite, but this is close.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS DVD OF FUNNY GIRL FOR MY BEST FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE WAS STUNNED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT. ACCORDING TO HER IT WAS FANTASIC WATCHING IT IN THE COMFORT OF HER HOME AND HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT IN AUSTRALIA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. SO THANKS FOR GETTING IT TO ME ON TIME. I MADE HER DAY <br />REGARDS <br />LYN
B00000IUP4|2.0|The train does not autostop as advertised. My two year old forgets to turn it off (not that he could) and it just runs and runs until the battery dies.
0804106304|4.0|There was of course some stuff that was missing for the sake of editing the movie -- but the book is very good.  A very lyrical writer.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album may not be for you if all you want is to hear Beatles hits. If you are looking for slick #1 singles then look elsewhere. You do not deserve to listen to this. You will not appreciate the amazing quality of raw musical talent from 4 very different musicians that is brought together on this one album. If you want to impress your teeny-bopper friends go straight to some greatest hits collection. You don't have the musical sophistication to enjoy range of emotions or level of songwriting that went into this. <br />Many of these tunes are recorded by one or two of the Beatles. Each is given the space to be creative and yet competitive with the other guys at the same time. This probably hasn't happened among a group of similarly talented musicians anywhere in music history. The overproduction is totally left off. Maybe because these guys didn't want to spend so much time together, but you get a better insight to the souls of the individuals who made up the greatest group of all time. The Beatles may have begun to feel tension within the group at this time, but they obviously had a blast writing the songs and laid their talent bare at the peak of creativity. I've been listening to Beatles music since the late 60s. This album finds its way into my CD player more than any other of the Beatles albums.  People wil be enjoying this album for many decades into the future.
0060254920|4.0|Now I pass it on to my nieces and nephews who are learning to read.  A wonderful classic about a child and using your imagination.
0714834491|1.0|Based on the ravingly good reviews I bought this book as a present and was incredibly disappointed.  Makes me pledge to never buy a book based solely on on-line reviews ever again.  He politely flipped through the book, gave a polite thanks and then \\"forgot\\" to bring it home.  I found it mostly uninspired, making up for lack of quality with quantity that then only confirmed the toss-off that made up most of the pages.  Printing wasn't great.  Illustrations weren't great.  Writing wasn't great.  And what design? Waste of money. I expected it to have the looseness of \\"Speck\\" but this book brings none of the sense of wonder, play, reflection I found in that great book.
B0000640VO|4.0|The story of the traveling garden knome is shown here.<br /><br />Audrey's very cute in this movie and it introduced American audiences to her before the whole Da Vinci thing.  At least they got a french actress for the role - although I envisioned someone older and with red hair for that.
0618680004|3.0|A lot of Dawkins's arguments are very reasonable. His refutation of the supposed proofs of God's existence, as well as religious criticisms of evolution, atheism etc. are very good: concise, logical and worth a read. However, Dawkins loses it in terms of his attitude and his discussion of specific religions as well as \\"religion-bashing\\". Throughout the book Dawkins comes across as fairly arrogant, sometimes to the point of bigotry against any religious belief. This makes him remind me of the atheist version of Ann Coulter - and he's about as effective at talking to theists as Ann is to atheists. Finally he misrepresents a lot in his attacks on religions - and tends to be very selective in his evidence. I'll only give one example. His thesis is that most scientists were theists historically because they had no choice about proclaiming themselves as theists. Possible, but he completely loses it when he says \\"Newton claimed to be religious\\" - and leaves it at that. Now, Newton was the original religious nut, there was absolutely no doubt he was a \\"true\\" believer as opposed to a scientist who claims to believe because there's no choice. Dawkins's portrayal is disingenuous. <br /> <br />The book is very successful at polarising people, which I think was one of its purposes. If you're looking for an intelligent objective case for atheism, take about 40% of the book. But as a whole, the book is marred through what I can only see as fanaticism.
0307237699|4.0|This man inspires me since he was not handed everything in life on a silver platter and his story is very up front, honest and poignant.  The book was very well written and had some very memorable and often touching anecdotes.
B00070Q7VO|1.0|Really disappointed.  Bought this for my wife who listened once and won't play it again.  We'll probably just throw it away.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I have had this CD for a month.  I have found the collaboration between Clapton and Cale to be excellent.  They seem to share the center stage on the album without one dominating.  I would definitely purchase another product like this one.
0740748475|5.0|The books are absolutely beautiful and enjoyable! I bought this set for my 2 sons Michael & Riyle for Christmas, and they loved it! This is the best-set. book every made by man.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|And neither does the Bat Out Of Hell series.  When I first heard The Monster Is Loose, I thought of the theatrical grabbing songs of previous Bats.  I knew this wouldn't be as good, but was hoping it would at least be good.  After track one I can pretty much turn it off.  I'll stick with the first two Bats, and Welcome To The Neighborhood.
B000002KXV|5.0|Deep dark tales combined with the unique, haunting instrumentation that is the signature sound of Steely Dan. Everything still sounds super-fresh, and the hit \\"I.G.Y.\\" is still frequently included on the playlists of many jazz and soft-rock radio stations. Unofficially docked half a star because of that horrible cover photo.
B000GY729M|5.0|Although I have to say on this note he was correct. Mr. Flowers has a habit of being overly \\"enthusiastic\\" about his band and their music and he said this album would be the best of the year... and, as usual, he was right. Now, I'm not saying that other albums released in '06 weren't fablous, but this one takes the cake and smashes it in all their faces.<br /><br />Coming up behind Hot Fuss their second lp had to be something incrediable, and it was. The catchy first single, When You Were Young, not only went deeper emotionally and symbolicly than most other songs that have been around recently, but the beat also rocked socks. The second song released to single, Bones, holds a beat that has to be danced to. Other songs that have not hit the radio yet (my fav on the cd so far is Read My Mind) tie the whole of the LP together well. I got kind of a Sergent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club feel from this cd, and enjoyed it to the point that I think even my four year old son is tired of hearing it (his favorite song is still All These Things That I Have Done from Hot Fuss).<br /><br />All in all, good buy, better listen, you won't be disappointed.
B000002L9Y|5.0|Some of the purists who base Fleetwood Mac's brilliance on their mid/late 70s output do not like this album, but for me, someone who grew up in the 80s & 90s, this hit-heavy album is impossible not to like. Filled with catchy, well-produced songs that stay with the time without causing the members of the group to sound like shells of their former selves. \\"Everywhere\\", \\"Little Lies\\", \\"Seven Wonders\\" and \\"Big Love\\" were all justifiably huge hits, and the non-hit \\"Family Man\\" is very sonically similar and just as good.
0694003611|5.0|This has been revered book in the USA for a generation and rightly so. It has a simple text with lovely illustrations and the repetition will lull a child to sleep. I have given many copies to friends with small children to ease the end of the day.
B000002LCU|5.0|17 years after the dissolution of The Beatles, George Harrison made this album, which is still probably the best thing any former Beatle has ever made. From the smash hit \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" to the gorgeous guitar pop of \\"Fish On The Sand\\", George Harrison turns out an album that sounds as at home in the 80s as the Beatles did in the 60s.
B000J10EQU|3.0|This movie was fair, Kevin Spacey plays an interested Lex that always has some kind of saying to justify his action. Overall its ok. I'd recommend you rent it instead.
B000I0QL82|4.0|This is a very touching and moving film.  Even my husband, the battle hardened Marine Corp pilot, thought it was a good movie.  He was surprised that it did not come across as a \\"chick-flick\\".  It has humor, tender moments, and some twists and surprises along the way.  Great for family viewing.  The acting was very good.  This film addressed issues that many families and individuals face every day.  It was also believable!
B00005B36H|5.0|Great CD.  Lateralus, Disposition, reflection, Triad....  some of the best combo ever.  Listen to it, love it.  Must own for tool fans or I think even Alex Grey fans.
B000J103YI|5.0|This is a  g r e a t  sound track.  I just love it.
0393317552|5.0|This book explore the evolution of major ethnic and various world communities outside of the standard narrative available to most people from schools and historical documentaries.   These includes extinct ethnic groups or nations.  The book exposes human evolution in each regions or continents of the world and the migrations that explains current level of civilization or technological progress in some continents and the lack of in others.  A good book if you want to know history and human progress explained from an uncommon perspective.  I could not put the book down because it answered so many questions about how the world become what it is today in terms of the disparities among nations and peoples.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Always the best! Love them!
0375831002|5.0|Such a unique approach to a wonderful story.  The narrator is \\"death\\" and you begin to feel warmly toward \\"death\\".  Such a big job as WWII began and the souls are carried gently away.  The use of brief German sentences with translations makes it all so real. I was fascinated by the writing techniques used in this book.  They are not distracting but fully contribute to the atmosphere and characters.  The unfortunate thing is that this book was released in the teen category and thus did not get the front table publicity that lesser adult books receive.  It should become required reading in high school english classes for its style, history and character development.  Every adult friend who has read it on my recommendation has thoroughly enjoyed it and passed it on.  Don't miss it.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Wow it's about time they released 90210!! The first season was awesome, it brings back so many memories. This show is one of the best shows that aired in the 90's dealing with real life problems and giving real life solutions...great job Aaron Spelling for another one of his masterpieces...I can't wait for season two! If you were ever a fan of this show then don't think twice it's definatly a great buy.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|Greatest Christmas Album 5-stars gift <br />full of great christmas songs PLUS Videos
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best TV show ever made.  Period.  Buy it. <br /> <br />Joss Weadon is a master.  He's created a rich and interesting world of the future.  The characters are endearing and you get pulled in to their lives.  It breaks my heart that the show was ended before they had a chance to develop more fully.
B00008DDRX|4.0|iam a steve mcqueen fan... its worth watching 'once' ... frankly i watched this movie coz i wanted to take a look at the watch he was wearing in the movie... it is quite raved about... there isn't one close up shot of it... love the stunts and the whole sound of the cars... no great story line...
B000F8O35U|5.0|We are in the process of updating our VHS movies to CDs. My kids have already seen The Little Mermaid hundreds of times, but absolutely enjoyed the Two Disc Special Edition. Their favorite so far has been the Disney ride they take.  It looks and sounds like you are actually on a Disney attraction.  Very cool for the younger kids.
B00005JL2O|3.0|austin powers is my favorite secret agent... so i ought to have liked it... just that... you've seen one and you've seen them all... the product arrived in great condition... amazon service has been excellent...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If ya enjoyed the movie, see where it all started with the series.
0553565915|4.0|It is a comforting to read to give when dealing with the death of a dear friend or relative.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|Very bad experience.  Many of the DVDs did not work.  Why does Amazon continue to market this product when they are aware of the product flaws?
0743246616|5.0|Lots of easy, good recipes with good instructions, pictures, and easy to find ingredients
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I could talk about all the awards this series received, but instead I will pose a task.  At the next party you attend, slip in a comment about \\"Browncoats\\" and see what kind of a reaction you get.  Expect a blank stare from the uninitiated.  However, be prepared for the wildly enthusiastic response from those who have experienced life in Joss Whedon's future.  There could be several spin-off conversations about the Alliance with their \\"hands of blue\\" or cursing in Chinese or rooting for the underdog or Companions or any of a hundred other topics about this incredibly rich universe created by Joss.  It's a good way to meet interesting people.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|These guys have nothing to prove. They have risen to a higher place than many of their prog-rock influences, and have delivered 5 solid albums of dense, intelligent and inspired prog-metal. On this album, they decided to cut to the chase. No there aren't as many masturbatory time changes and complex runs up and down the scales, but the band has delivered 7 well put together metal songs that are distinctly Dream Theater without all the flash. Prog bands are often accused of being able to play anything except something memorable. DT proves that theory wrong with this disc. Imagine this stage of their career as Yes' 90215 - more commercial, more to the point. The difference here is that we know DT went back to the more traditional prog-metal vibe on Octavarium, so the alarmists who complain that DT has 'sold-out' are simply looking for a chink in the armor. This album is not one - it just proves what we've suspected all along - that DT can play pretty much anything they want and still be unique, tight, and interesting.<br /><br />To the naysayers: Let DT grow and breathe. Maybe you need to do that a bit yourselves.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Both my boys loved it and it was full of excitement.  I couldn't wait to buy it after I saw it in the theater!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of the sound, photography, and the venues chosen in this recording.  I have an HD TV and surround sound and it was like I was really there for $25.00 !!  It was well worth the price. <br /> <br />FYI, Amazon delivered it BEFORE the estimated delivery date, during the holidays too!! :)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an excellent recording, a wonderful broadway production.  I especially like the two main leads, Kristin Chenoweth & Idina Menzel.  These ladies really know how to sing!!!  They also capture their characters so well.  Props to everyone involved in this production!
0760316414|5.0|It was a gift for my son who loved it and was thrilled with the content.
0618680004|5.0|Surely a seminal work.  A masterpiece.  God is dead and Dawkins proves it.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|\\"Life and Death, Space and Time, Fate and Chance,\\" what is reality and what is illusion? With its sepia-toned cinematography and lush turn-of-the-century Vienna setting `The Illusionist' presents to the audience a mesmerizing period piece that truly bends natures laws as it transports the viewer to another time, another place.<br /><br />I was drawn into the landscape of this film in a way I haven't been in quite some time. Along with the magnificent setting, costumes and soundtrack there are some wonderful performances within. Edward Norton's intense, stoic persona and brooding passion for his childhood sweetheart is the heart and soul of this production, perfectly complimented by the lovely ethereal presence of Jessica Biel as his lifelong love, Sophie. The film also offers yet another amazing performance by Paul Giamatti as police inspector Uhl and a villainous and obsessive role perfectly delivered by Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />Now you see it, now you don't. My advice, SEE IT!
0060730552|5.0|I finished this book in about 3 days.  Great story, and told very well.  I've been telling everyone I know they have to read this book.
B000JVT092|5.0|Bought this for a friend who has the HD-A1 player from Toshiba - fantastic picture and sound, great price from Amazon!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|We enjoyed the Serenity film and as a result bought the Firefly series. It has been good to get further background on the characters. If you enjoyed the film buy the series.
0375505091|5.0|Leibovitz offers a rare and enticing perspective on her life between 1990 through 2005.  It's quite a page turner that shows a combination of celebrity shots as well as personal family photos.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This should be compulsory viewing for everyone and is a very good introduction to the causes and effects of global warming
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie is definitely a different kind of love story.  It really surprised me the first time I saw it.  It's a very honest movie that deals with issues that other movies rarely touch on like self mutilation and masochism.  I think that the actors were very convincing and that this movie is worth every penny.  I don't want to spoil it, but it's a must see.
B000026FOA|5.0|I understand that that's quite a bold claim I'm making, placing this little known songwriter ahead of the greatest folk singer songwriters of our era. Now I love all the aforementioned artists, so let me list my reasons. The lyrics can be read by themselves like poetry, they are less obtuse than Bob Dylan (they make sense), less sullen and artsy than Leonard Cohen (they are clearly song lyrics, but no less expressive), and no doubt more profound than Simon & Garfunkel. I really connect to his lyrics which are clearly borne out of deep despair, but because they are so beautiful and paired with such beautiful music they aren't sullen and melancholic. Rather, the music is cathartic in its despair and uplifting in its beauty. In fact, I think his lyrics are so universal that I can use the chorus from one of his most famous songs to describe him: <br /> <br />Time has told me <br />You're a rare rare find <br />A troubled cure <br />For a troubled mind. <br /> <br />How true. Now as far as my personal taste, I prefer Nick Drake and especially this album for my own reasons. I'm a sucker for virtuoso finger picking on acoustic guitar, achingly beautiful string arrangements, and cathartic singing. Nick Drake is virtuosic with all 3 on this album, so I'm really happy I found this, I actually wasn't crazy about him at first but I think he might now be one of my favorite artists. As far as where to start, go for this album or Pink Moon. This album has more musical depth instrumentally (lots more strings etc.), and Pink Moon is more tortured and much sparser, which in some ways makes it more powerful. Play this in the background while you work, then go to bed early and listen to this in the dark with some good headphones. The only con is that his music is not catchy like the 3 artists I compared him to. I think that's all that held him back. Enjoy!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Don't think for a minute that this is some kids movie because of the title.  It has all the witty adult humor you could ask for.  It's very well written and carefully though out (like calling it \\"sunshine\\" when it's actually kind of a dark movie).  Lots of details...I recommend it highly.
0060934913|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book.  I'd caught a couple of his shows on the Discovery channel (or was it the Travel channel?  one of them, anyway), and he didn't really appeal to me.  But my husband bought it for me and I was sick with the flu and needed something to read, so I picked it up.  And then - I couldn't put it down.  It was pretty sad.  There I was, throat hurt so bad it felt like I had glass in it, and I'm laughing so hard I'd have coughing fits and then I'd cry because my throat hurt! It was kind of funny in a way.  But - back to the book.  I laughed and laughed and read it straight through because it was that engaging.  And I have a new found respect and like for Anthony Bourdain, and have since read Nasty Bits (and enjoyed it) and now watch his shows with pleasure.  There is something about a person who can tear himself apart, not glorify his own mistakes and failings, and present his life in a blunt, unapologetic, \\"how did I manage to survive all this?\\" kind of way.  It's very appealing.  Plus - I LOVE his descriptions of food and the way it tastes, looks, smells and feels in the mouth.  It's like food porn. Great, fun book.
0783240287|4.0|I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. There were some scenes that I thought were very inappropriate for her from the costumes to the behavior. I assumed because it was a biblical story that it would be all right but I'd never seen the play and didn't know any better.
B00005225E|5.0|The setting for this movie is a dusty southern town in Alabama during the depression and is shot through the perspective of a child's eye. Mr. Gregory Peck does a superb job of playing a southern lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of rape by a white woman and her father. There is no question as you watch the movie of two things; the outcome of the trial and the fact the man is obviously innocent. <br /> <br />In this movie we have a great example of a man, Gregory Pecks character, setting a good example of a parent and of being a good member of a community. He instills good values in his children, shows tremendous courage and strength of character. He teaches that you cannot judge a person until you can see the world through their eyes. He is a peerless man, in that everyone is his peer. This is a film whole families should watch together. <br />
0740748475|5.0|Given as a gift for all of my eight grandchildren. They are loving every page.
0689878451|5.0|I bought this for our son that is not born yet - so I can't tell you how he likes it but I love this book!  It made me teary the first time I read it.  It's perfect for all families (our happens to be a two mom family).  It's a great true story with nice illustration.  Highly recommended.
6302878624|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It is not Christmas until I see this movie.  The colorized version is gorgeous.  It makes everything very real.
B000ESSTKG|2.0|Not able to tell from the packaging I regretfully<br /><br />purchased this pricey deluxe edition only to find<br /><br />the last four songs have been removed from the CD.<br /><br />Not ending with Pleasure Little Treasure makes the<br /><br />whole nostalgic vaunt all vapid and hollow.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains the catchier more enjoyable tracks<br /><br />from the singles along with what I call the missing<br /><br />tracks although some would argue.  Alas they can only<br /><br />be played on a DVD player not a car stereo.  Kind of a<br /><br />worthless novelty albeit deliberate.
B000H305U0|5.0|I didn't become a fan of Justin Timberlake's until this album. I was slow jumping on the bandwagen when I first heard \\"Sexyback\\" but it was his second single, \\"My Love\\" featuring T.I. that solified it for me. The album has a unique pop and R&B sound that isn't heard in recent music and it's fun to listen to. I can listen to the entire CD and not skip around. This is a great CD to dance to, make love to, and Track 12 is a great way to say you're sorry to someone. Another note, FutureSex/LoveSounds has some of the best interludes I've ever heard. I look at them as mini remixes of the songs they follow. (In the case of My Love, precede.) I like the interludes better than some of the songs on the album! <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks:    <br />4. My Love    <br />5. Love Stoned    <br />6. What Goes Around <br />10. Until The End Of Time <br />12. All Over Again (Another Song)  <br />13. Pose (Bonus Track)
0060899190|4.0|The 'postcards' in this book are all too obviously designed by professional graphic artists and ad copy writers. Still, the designs are no doubt based on the real postcards that were sent in, and they look fabulous. The thoughts contained are either inspiring or saddening, and show how much we all have in common. It's a great book to dip into to get an instant hit of humanity.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It doesn't matter if you don't like Mr. Gore. His research and facts are undeniable even for the hardcore head in the sand person. We are at a time of crisis, but one that can be averted.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself, and your children, and their children to watch this movie. Buy, borrow, rent... doesn't matter, just watch it.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Whenever you feel nothing can change or improve, remember what you watched on this film. There's a scene when the family members are described with words such as \\"crazy, bankruptcy, divorce, suicide\\", and you never expect what a 3-day family trip can do. It definitely mocks on things such as beauty contests, eating habits, death, current culture... plus, great performances from each and every character. I reckon you'll laugh and give life a second and happier thought.
1594200823|5.0|Engaging from first page to last. An interesting, even compelling, read about our food supply, full of surprising information. If you like this book, go back and read Pollan's previous book, too.
B000068FWC|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my husband. I had the real LP way back when. It's a truly great work by Supertramp.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|It has a higher dimensional view of what our energy can do.  It gives good visulization of things that are manifestiong on this planet right now.  The insights are about awareness and can be applied to life right now.  It has the power to move mountains!
0316287059|5.0|Its a fantastic book with loads of pics and a good explination. <br /> <br />I can certainly recommend this book for everyone that is into make up and fashion.

B000BB14YY|5.0|Tatsuya Nakadai's performance in Ran is as ratcheted-up as the cinematic beauty of this look at a world of blood, taking us to the very brink of madness. It is a film about loss, betrayal, filial impiety, war, hate, hungry ghosts.<br />When released, the West heaved a sigh of relief: Kurosawa back and as magnificent as ever!<br />Sweeping away all hype and hyperbole is hard to do. I see this as a very expressionist-realist film. But, forget what I said! And, don't compare it to Shakespeare! At least, not at first. This is cinema.<br /><br />Visually stunning, stylized acting producing a counter-point to the genuine emotions, a distanced camera giving us a long shot at a world hell-bent on self-destruction...changes of scale that intensify meaning: closeups of wildflowers, and a long shot of a burning castle.<br /><br />Kurosawa built the enormous castle and had it burned for mere moments on film. But, what moments!

0446528056|5.0|This novel continues Sparks' undoubted ability to pull at the reader's heart-strings.  It will make you sad, angry, and happy all at once; yet when you set it down it is obvious that this is the only ending there could be to a book of this nature.  Have read it three times already, and loved it.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|At first the only song from Muse I liked was \\"Starlight\\".  I listened to a few of the others on Napster and didn't really like them.  But after a Sam Goodie screw up I bite the bullet and bought the cd.  After about 2 listens I had added, \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", \\"Assassin\\", \\"Invincible\\", \\"Hoodoo\\", \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", \\"Map of the Problematique\\", and of course \\"Starlight\\" to my MP3 player.  This band grows on you.  I also love the Guitar playing.  Normally it seems like filler to me but the stuff on \\"Cydonia\\" and \\"Assassin\\" were great. <br /> <br />BUY NOW!

0345363132|2.0|I recently ordered Sunne in Splendour based on the strength of the many positive reviewer recommendations.  Apparently, the appeal of Ms. Penman's writing escapes me - I found the writing dry, the characters flat, and the sense of time and place poorly drawn.  It's not that this book is bad, it's just not good.  Of course this is only a personal impression, but if you are a fan of, say Patrick O'Brian, and looking for another historical fiction author to read, I suggest you look elsewhere.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I can't add to the much-deserved praise other reviewers have offered, except to say that a modern viewer cannot predict anything about this film except that the good guys will win, and irony is not the point of the script.  That much is true of all 1940s movies. <br /> <br />Contemporary movies can't manage a fraction of the suspense this one provides.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Pretty good movie ... if you're under 30. Some parts of the movie are a bit rediculous. Some of the acting is over done. I basically have a love it, hate it, relationship with this film.<br /><br />For someone that would never let go, she couldn't let go fast enough when help was in the vicinity ... FISH FOOD ... poor guy didn't even get a repectable funeral. Still, all in all ... one of the best movies ever made about the Titanic!

It was such a pleasure to have been turned on to Ray from my daughter. He is so poetic and his music so pure and it reaches my heart and mimics my life experiences. Be Here Now is a masterpiece. This is as good if not better than Trouble. I hope he writes many many more. He literally brings tears to my eyes. He makes the mundane transfixed. I feel like I am listening to E.E. Cummings sing his poetry.

B0002IQOZA|2.0|I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show.  There is no denying that the girl can sing.  Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing.  It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity.  I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get.

B000E1NWGY|5.0|This hybrid SACD release couples the Vieuxtemps No. 5 and Bruch Scottish Fantasy performances, originally released on one LP, with a recording of the Bruch No. 1 done with the same forces. Heifetz's blazing technique and intense vibrato often seemed best to serve what in other hands could be second-rate music; in the Bruch works especially he brings to urgent, passionate life passages that can easily sound slack and sentimental. The Scottish Fantasy was a signature work of the violinist, and Malcolm Sargent and the then-New Symphony Orchestra of London match him in intensity and accuracy of execution (though the finale is shortened substantially in accordance with Heifetz's preferred version). The Vieuxtemps seems marginally less involved emotionally, but if anything the execution is even more accurate--the thorniest passages have not one note out of place. This is a great way to introduce a new generation of listeners to the art of this ageless legend, especially at a bargain price.
B0002KQNL8|2.0|I'm a big fan of zombie movies, and the first return of the living dead was a very good zombie movie.  This one, however, fails to scare nor hold your attention, and tries harder in my opinion to be funny instead of scary.  The black humor is pathetic, espechialy compared to the first one.  Had its interesting moments, but the movie as a whole was definitly below average.
B00005JP9X|5.0|Children of Men is a science fiction story that could appeal easily to non-sci-fi fans. The movie is set in the year 2027 and portrays a very believable future. The twist is that by 2027, all humans have become infertile. The youngest person on Earth is 18 years old and when people stopped having babies, the world fell apart. Clive Owen delivers an incredibly realistic performance in bringing to life this book by British mystery maven, P.D. James. Owen stars as Theo Faron, the one-time activist who has lost his cause and seemingly his passion for life as well. An important part of his past catches up with him when he is confronted by an extremist organization asking for help. Does he help this woman find help, when it means risking her life and his? And does his decision become easier or harder when he learns she is pregnant!? <br /> <br />The movie has it all: action, humor, and a brilliant theme showcasing the relationship between faith and chance in our lives. The action was gripping and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. In Children of Men, they do not hold your hand through the story; things happen and they happen quickly. You will not get lost due to the speed, but be prepared. Things happen and you may not agree with them all, but by the end of the movie I hope you agree with me that everything that happened was necessary and well-timed.  <br /> <br />The laughs come at odd intervals, but seem to be just when you need them. The performances by Michael Caine (Jasper) and Peter Mullan (Syd) added the right about of levity to balance out the serious nature of the story. I could talk all day about Michael Caine alone and his iconic career in film, but I will leave it at this: he was fantastic yet again. Any elaboration I make on that would mean divulging a detail of the film that you should experience for yourself.  <br /> <br />Jasper even brings the theme (mentioned above) right to the audience. He tells a story about Theo's past and sets it up nicely. I love movies that can pull that off; I can't imagine it is easy. <br /> <br />I have never been in a war zone. I can only imagine what it would be like to be in such a hostile environment. From what I would imagine, Children of Men nailed it. I have seen movies with similar scenes, but they have never felt as real. Maybe it is the political environment currently that added to the feeling in the movie.  <br /> <br />I liked Children of Men for many reasons. I will admit that there were a few moments that I felt the time passed too slowly, but they were brief. Clive Owen did wonderfully. The language was rough and there is a lot of blood shed. If those do not deter you from seeing other movies, you should see Children of Men.  <br /> <br />For another Clive Owen movie you should see, check out Croupier. <br />

0743487583|5.0|When people think of horror, the image of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein can generally be expected to pop into their heads, usually within the first minute of the word \\"horror\\"s utterance.<br /><br />Yet Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is not horror. It is science-fiction - and, for that matter, one of the first works of science-fiction ever written, as well as one of the most brilliant. While many of the nineteenth-century authors who boldly dove into the realm of the unknown came back with fascinating baubels that are now horribly dated, \\"Frankenstein\\" maintains its power and prescience in three ways:<br /><br />1) Its foremost theme is that of life itself - what is it that separates inanimate tissue from its living counterpart, and what in turn can give sentience to what might otherwise be a mindless organism. The answers to these questions have not yet been discovered, and are indeed probably in greater controversy today than they were in Shelley's own time.<br /><br />2) Another aspect timeless aspect of this book is its exploration into the responsibilities of creation - not merely scientific creation, but of any sort of creation, of any situation in which a human being with an idea sees it through to the finish, only to find that unexpected consequences await him/her.<br /><br />3) The drama itself - of a man fleeing from a monster, and of a monster trying desperately to assert his manhood - is as poignant as it is profound, and the reader who isn't moved by the plights of both these characters lacks either the heart to care or the brain to understand.<br /><br />It is a shame that people today associate the word Frankenstein with cheap and formulaic horror films. Indeed, there is a fair amount of irony that Frankenstein is often thought of as a run-of-the-mill hideous monster, when indeed it was precisely that sort of knee-jerk superficiality and intolerance that Shelley herself was trying to combat. Either way, Frankenstein is one of those rare books that managed to create its own genre without later being dated by countless similar efforts. No matter how great future science fictions writers may become, they will always walk in the shadow of Frankenstein.without later being dated by countless similar efforts.

B0000C9ZBW|5.0|My son has severe reactions to the nickel used in most watches.  His flesh actually blisters in reaction.  Finding a watch for him has been difficult until we stumbled upon Skagen Titanium.  This is his second Skagen.  He wore the first for years until it was damaged in a basketball game.  (He refused to take it off!)  He's a junior in college now and I just purchased a second Skagen for him.  In addition to being a beautiful watch, it's an excellent time piece and we don't have to worry about any negative allergic reaction. <br />Thanks, Skagen

B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles first album \\"Please Please Me\\" is a gem of a first album with Lennon and MCcartney (or McCartney/Lennon on this album)penned songs such as I Saw Her Standing There, Misery, Ask Me Why, Please Please Me, Love Me Do (their firs Aussie hit) P.S. I Love You, Do You Want To Know A Secret and There's A Place. It also features the Carole King and Gerry Goffin song Chains and songs by other writers such as Anna, Baby It's You, A Taste of Honey and Twist and Shout. 14 great songs on a very well crafted album. Highly recommended for any Beatles fan. Great Rhythm and Blues from the Merseyside \\"Kings of EMI\\".

0783229526|5.0|I read in an interview sometime back about Hunter Thompson reminiscing about \\"how somebody was going to try and make a movie about 'Fear And Loathing.' and - BLEEP - they were going to have to nail animals to the ceiling.\\"  OK, that right there makes Monty Python member/illustrator about the only one with the right...\\"mind\\" to do Fear and Loathing.  Johnny Depp is superb as \\"Raoul Duke,\\" as is Benicio Del Toro as \\"Dr. Gonzo.\\"  Depp is amazing, capturing the very skittish paranoia that the late great HST brought upon himself, and forget all these negative other \\"reviews\\" here in Ammy-land - I mean, how would YOU have filmed the hallucinations?  My only gripe is the inclusion of Gary Busey as the cop who...well, get the movie, see for yourself, it certainly wasn't in the book.  This is a most wonderful interpretation of the book, and when I get the money, I'm going to buy the \\"Criterion\\" version of this (interiews, comments, voice-overs, etc), as well as Bill Murray's 1980 \\"Where The Buffalo Roam,\\" (\\"same cathedral, diffient pew,\\" you know...)

B00003CX8V|5.0|Today's business culture and legal system being what they are, many younger people today are totally unaware of the prevalence of sexual harassment/domination in the workplace as it used to be. Using that theme as a backdrop, \\"The Apartment\\" is one of those rare movies that makes you happy, sad, happy, sad ... it's an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish. A great storyline and awesome cast (besides headliners Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine you have great supporting actors such as Fred McMurray, Ray Walston and Edie Adams) make this a genuine period classic that snapshots an era in American culture.

B00006HAZG|4.0|David Copperfield is quite simply a phenonmenal book.  It shows Dickens at his best in creating characters and a plot that masterfully combines comedy, tragedy, intrigue and the joys and sorrows of life.  Like other reviewers, I approached this film adaptation concerned that it simply would not be able to maintain those high standards.   <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised.  The casting was very appropriate, I can't think of one character that was not well portrayed.  The filming and music were engaging and the sets very well chosen and designed.  And the film moved along at a good pace.  (Even my seven year old enjoyed it the whole way through.) To keep the film to 3 hours some characters and incidents were left out, but this was done sensitively so the story does not seem at all disjointed. <br /> <br />I have one criticism that prevented me giving 5 stars.  Author Russell Baker appeared giving quite a good introduction to the story.  But why, oh why did he have to pop up again just before the final music/credits?  Literally, just before the movie ends it fades out, he appears and talks about it for a few minutes, and then it fades back to the final music.  This was totally inappropriate and if we had not fast-forwarded him in disbelief, it would have stolen something from the atmosphere and sweet after-taste of an extremely engaging and heart-tugging production. <br /> <br />Go ahead and buy this version.  You will not regret it.

0345410025|4.0|Let me break it down.  For it's price, this book is quite the value.  However, like many have said, you cannot simply read it cover to cover and develop a great memory.  You have to implement the techniques.  Even 15 minutes a day will slowly help you to master the basic techniques here.  The next step once you have the techniques down is to use some common sense and creativity to apply them in real life, practical situations (not just memorize 50 digit numbers).  In the 3 weeks that I've had the book, I've noticed significant improvements in my memory with (a) names (b) shopping lists (c) directions (d) to do lists (e) numbers.  I can also impress people by looking at a 50 digit number for 5 minutes and reciting it backwards and forwards.  Buy the book but only if you're willing to put in some time and learn the techniques and then apply them in a practical way.  If anything, the party tricks you'll learn may improve your love life.  Just don't forget the girls' name.
0393320928|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable reading experience, this book expands on what Feynman wrote in \\"Adventures of a Curious Character\\" (ACC), although this book stands alone (you need not have read the first). Feynman, in his characteristic, modest and endearing style engages the reader page after page. He expands details mentioned in ACC as well as introducing new, and just as engaging, material. His light-hearted approach to serious matters and his expression of insatiable lust for knowledge in an enjoyable style makes this book a pleasure to read. I find it hard to fault this book and page after page it kept me wanting to read more. Reading the book makes you want to go out and satisfy all those childhood curiosities that, unfortunately, some of us lose in adult life. I read the book at night and found myself constantly wanting to go outside and look for frogs, insects and other wonders of the natural world. If I did have to find fault in the book, it would only be that it kept me up later at night than usual--a great book, by a great man.

B000002BBY|1.0|Halfway through the first song, you'll be banging your head against the wall. This has to be one of the most monotonous collections of songs ever recorded. There's no punch, no variation, and no talent in this band of Beatles wannabes. And not only is the music annoying on its own merit, the production techniques used on the album make it doubly dreadful.

0385486804|1.0|I had to read this book for one of my college classes and it's one of the worst books that I've ever read.  Who actually wants to read about a kid who takes a road trip by himself and ends up dead?  Poorly wriiten, quite boring, though it's a good source if one needs to fall asleep.  I actually thought about shredding it for fun...
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|Sorry if the title of this review seems frivolous. As a male of the species I will get flack for this review. I am adding my bit just in case others like me like characters that are supposed to be principled individuals. The lead female Knightley and the lead male are both written in such a way, even if only on a superficial level.  <br />Still I think two parts of these characters really stand out. The leading males (Mr Darcy) somber attitude rings true of a man with a conscience and drive for ethics. This was really displayed well in the scene were he delivers an explanatory note of his actions, of how he dealt with the luitenent character, to Elizebeth (Knightly). His grave demeanor and desire to make her understand that his actions were ethically based was compelling.  <br />Second is the strong willed nature of the lead female. Displayed well in several scenes by Knightley. One of the best was when she learned Mr Darcy had broken up his sister and the doctor. She leaves the gathering and is followed by Mr Darcy, who in awkward fashion, tells her of his feelings toward her. She confronts him with the knowledge of his actions (breaking up the doctor and her sister). I can't think of many scenes as compelling. Two exceptional actors, performing to near perfection. Later Knightley is confronted with Denches character (expertly portrayed). Another scene done to near perfection. The most important scene of all, at least to me, is when she is visiting darcy's mansion, under the mistaken information that he is not there. She and her companions are walking through an art gallery on the premises. They stop at a marble bust (a likeness of Mr Darcy). Her companions ask if it is a good likeness. The brilliant acting skill of this young actress is perfect in this scene. Just in case someone of Objectivist persuasion reads this: Her characters obvious worship and respect for the man, who has proven his character to her, is displayed perfectly by Knightley.  <br />Though not the greatest plot, the acting by most of this cast is as good as it gets. <br /> <br />Now I must watch some football.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a great family game - the hit of the year for us.  Simple enough for young(ish) children to grasp (and so attractive, with those brightly coloured plastic tiles!) and yet with enough strategic content to keep adults amused too.  We gave several away this Christmas, and everyone raves about it.

B00005JPAM|4.0|This film details Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) reaction to Princess Diana's death and her relationship with new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  As Elizabeth clearly distains the Princess and finds her death just one more in a series of irritations, she wants to keep the mourning and funeral of her former daughter-in-law private.  Blair, however, thinks that would harm the monarchy in the eyes of the people who loved Diana, and urges the queen to go to London to speak publicly, fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and be seen grieving.  Though she despises public displays of emotion, she reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />Mirren gives a flawless impersonation of Elizabeth and James Cromwell is equally fine as grumpy Prince Phillip.  Sheen gives a sympathetic performance as Tony Blair, a young man who hopes to bring the monarchy into the modern age.  The palatial sets are grand and the \\"behind the scenes\\" peek at the Queen's private life is certainly enjoyable, but, as a non-Brit, I found the plot rather inconsequential and pointless.  The movie is impressive but ultimately forgettable - excellent acting and production values but a narrow subject of limited appeal that lacks a satisfying conclusion.

B000HIVO64|5.0|Brilliant idea, getting to make your own album cover... I probably spent somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour with those stickers :) Plus the videos for every song (although I really don't care about music videos that much) is still a nice addition. Anyway, fantastic album, the majority of the songs I really enjoyed.  Elevator Music - 8/10  Think I'm In Love - 7/10  Cellphone's Dead - 8/10  Strange Apparition - 9/10  Soldier Jane - 9/10  Nausea - 7/10  New Round - 7/10  Dark Star - 8/10  We Dance Alone - 7/10  No Complaints - 6/10  1000BPM - 7/10  Motorcade - 6/10  The Information - 6/10  Movie Theme - 9/10  The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton - 8/10  Pick it up if you haven't already, if you're into Beck that is.

I had no idea of that when one of the singles first caught my ear and I tracked them down on Amazon. While the snippets from Amazon sealed the purchase deal, they really don't do this CD justice.

B000LC3ID8|4.0|It's hard to believe, after watching this third installment in the uber-gory Saw series, that a fourth is in the making.  This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition).  Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.<br /><br />But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving.  This lesson I believe.  The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.<br /><br />All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption.  This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui).  Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker.  Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them.  Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out.  If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.<br /><br />How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve.  Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet.  Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.<br /><br />Some might not be interested in questions like these, though.  Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam.  Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation.  The first movie was both inventive and focused.  The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets.  This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight.  Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.visceral Saw, yet.

0393061434|4.0|In the first few chapters, Steve recants his childhood love of Tom Swift, the adolescent genius inventor whose technological breakthroughs are the plotline for a long running series of \\"invention fiction\\" novels. As the story continues, you realize Wozniak has done two things, become a modern-day Tom Swift and written a book any budding engineer or inventor would love. At the same time, he sheds an honest light on his role in the creation of the first personal computer. The writing is simple and occasionally repetitive, but overall an excellent family read, especially for anyone who loves Apple.

B000AV2G3I|4.0|After the break-up, both McCartney and Lennon went on to do what everyone had more or less predicted: McCartney racked up the sales with catchy pop that often spent a bit too much time in the shallow end of the pool, while Lennon achieved lesser (but still quite acceptable) sales and greater expressivity.  That said, arguably Lennon had but two truly fabulous LPs in his catalogue post-Fab Four: 1971's Imagine, and one of the most direct, and brutally honest, artistic statements ever fashioned by any rock and roller, Plastic Ono Band from 1970.    This is the fourth major career overview for Lennon, after Shaved Fish, the John Lennon Collection, and the embarrassingly named Legend, a title which Lennon himself would have undoubtedly forbade.  With thirty-eight tracks on two discs, it surpasses the latter two in comprehensiveness, and benefits from better remastering detail to any of the earlier sets.    George Harrison has stated that he thought Lennon's writing went a bit off in his later years.  His melodic sense resurfaced by the Double Fantasy sessions, perhaps recharged by his five-year hiatus from recording.  Given the lackluster songs populating much of his album output from 1972 to 1975, however, Harrison's assessment is quite apt.  If Lennon's struggles to compose enough good material to fill up an entire record made his post-Imagine albums rather spotty, his singles certainly were not.  Having grown up and worked with the Beatles during a time when the single ruled rock and roll, like his colleagues Lennon always paid special attention to their quality.  Working Class Hero collects every non-Beatles 45 that Lennon issued in his lifetime for the first time since the 1970s singles compilation Shaved Fish.  Including five of the six posthumous singles (not counting reissues), this is welcome indeed.    \\"Greatest Hits\\" packages often get short shrift from some quarters.  In what was for a long time one of the main alternatives to [...] for on-line pop music album review sites, Wilson & Alroy refuse to even consider reviewing compilations, greatest hits or otherwise.  Trapped in an album-oriented classic rock mentality, this only displays the depth of their ignorance regarding the history of the music about which they issue authoritative pronouncements.  Many greatest hits comps might indeed be superfluous, but singles packages are another story altogether.  Some of the greatest work by many artists, such as those affiliated with the Motown or Stax labels in the 1960s for instance, came in the form of singles.  You'd be far better off with a good Supremes hits collection than any one of their albums issued during the group's operational life.    Similarly, Lennon's singles are the best items in his solo catalogue, Plastic Ono Band and Imagine aside.  This package includes them generously, making up about half of the total number of tracks.  For instance, it's good to see \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" return to an official Lennon comp, a jarringly effective feminist anthem of which the title alone probably gives most people hives, which is precisely the point.  Lennon wasn't driven solely by a need to make his audience comfortable, the desire to make a statement politically or socially often a main source of his vitality as an artist.    Interestingly, the Wingspan compilation by his ex-partner from five years earlier, also a double-disc overview with an equivalent number of tracks, covers roughly the same period of time.  They make an intriguing comparison of the duo's accomplishments from the 1970s while both were still very much in the commercial spotlight.  Whether this set is an answer to that one is known only to EMI, Yoko, and the Apple front office.    Of the flaws in Working Class Hero, one is presented in contrast to Wingspan.  It would have been better had the producers echoed the format from the McCartney comp, placing the hit singles on one disc, and the assembled album cuts and lesser hits on the second.Also, some non-singles cuts were poorly selected: while still a good balladeer, Lennon's solo strengths were often in other areas.  We don't necessarily need \\"Love\\", and \\"Oh My Love,\\" *and* \\"Oh Yoko!\\" here, as all are from the two must-have albums.  Better cuts from the Lennon Anthology, such as the superior \\"I'm Losing You\\" backed up by Cheap Trick that *is* included, the non-album b-side \\"Move Over Ms. L,\\" and excerpts from the live material with Frank Zappa no longer available on the Some Time in New York City reissue would have been preferable to \\"Intuition,\\" \\"Out the Blue,\\" and \\"You Are Here.\\"    These minor caveats aside, this is the best career retrospective for one of the best rock and roll artists of any era.  The assembly of all those great Lennon singles is easily worth the purchase price.  Thank you, John.

Why did such a terrible thing have to happen to such a gifted and gentle young lady. It's a good book cause of Anne's gifted skill in writing and painting a picture in the mind of what she is saying; it is a sad book cause we all know the outcome of what eventually happens to her and her family and the others who were in hiding in the Annex. I feel this book can be an educational tool for us all. I could go on but I will stop here and say get the book it is well worth it cause there was only one Anne Frank and she does have a story to be told and it is in the Definitive version.

1400032717|4.0|Planet of the Blind by Stephen Kuusisto <br /> <br />Although Planet of the Blind is a memoir and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is a mystery, many situations arise similarly in both books. Primarily these books relate due to the disability of the main characters in both books; Kuusisto is blind and Christopher is autistic. These books touch most upon what both of them have to face daily with their disabilities. In The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, one of the main topic's is Christopher's dealing with his problems and learning to live his life even though many people doubt him, as does Stephen Kuusisto, who has to get over the denial of being blind and accept life the way it was dealt to him. In addition to the disabilities of both main characters, both books are written in first person very informally. This enables readers to be interested and feel more comfortable taking in the information. This is also possible because all of the writing is from this one character's point of view, so everything said is a thought from the character's head. Lastly, both books teach readers that living with these two setbacks are possible, and readers learn a lot about how both characters live their own lives. <br /> <br />A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket <br /> <br />A Series of Unfortunate Events is a thirteen book series, but the ideas portrayed in all of the books relate to the curious incident of the dog in the night time. The plots of the books are alike; Christopher and the main characters in the series all are trying to solve a mystery, while they really learn a lot about themselves while doing so. For both books, the mystery is pertaining to family. In A Series of Unfortunate Events the characters meet all different people from their childhood and end up in sticky situations, as does Christopher when he tries to solve the murder of a dog but ends up solving much more, relating to personal discovery. If a reader enjoys A Series of Unfortunate Events then this book may be a good read, but the mystery being solved isn't as interesting, but the plot line in Christopher's fictional autobiography is much more unpredictable.
0439813786|5.0|This is a terrific book, and there's going to be plenty of talk about it, at least in the children's book world. The funny thing is, it's over 500 pages long, and the writing isn't what's going to get the attention. The pictures, though, they're something else. I'm blathering, yet somehow not saying much at all. Let me attempt to make sense....<br /><br />This is a story about an orphan living in a Paris train station during the 1930's, a magician, and the movies. It also involves a broken clockwork man (aka: the automaton) that just might be able to write, and just might ocntain a message from Hugo's dead father. The film buffs among you will be intrigued to know that Geroges Melies figures into the plot as well. It's a bit of a mystery, a bit of a fantasy, and also bit of a picture book/graphic novel, which is what makes it really interesting.<br /><br />Brian Selznick's art in this book just knocks me out. The book is fat and heavy, and all the pages are bordered in black. At least 1/3 of it is artwork. But the thing is, the pictures aren't just for decoration. They meld with the story, and make it move. From time to time, the text just stops, and when you turn the page, the plot continues in these fabulous double-page black & white pencil drawings. The drawings function like a cinematic zoom lens, carrying you right into the vital part of the art/story, sometimes carrying on for ten or twelve pages at a time, almost like a sophisticated flip book. If you skip the pictures, you skip a slice of the story.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br /><br />\\"Hugo reached in and pulled out a large, heavy object. He untied the frayed ropes and unwrapped the fabric that covered it.\\"<br /><br />And then you turn the page and see Hugo looking at \\"it\\". And you turn the next page and get a closeup of \\"it\\". And no, I'm not going to tell you what \\"it\\" is. Read the book.<br /><br />If that's not enough, the art isn't simply functional, it's also really pretty. As in When Marian Sang, Selznick is very clever about using light and dark to direct your eye exactly where it needs to go, even in a crowded train station scene. And he's fantastic with faces, particularly in closeup. They simply glow. In various places, the characters talk about old movies, and when they do, you get a double-page spread of a still frame from the real film. It's just plain cool. I hope-hope-hope Amazon does that \\"Search inside this book\\" feature with Hugo Cabret so you can really see what on earth I'm talking about.<br /><br />Put this book on your list of things to do this spring. I don't think you'll be sorry, and you just might be dazzled.Selznick is very clever about using light and dark to direct your eye exactly where it needs to go, even in a crowded train station scene.

0738702994|4.0|If you are looking for a deck to add to your collection that has wonderful art, beautiful accessories and a wealth of mythical lore and legend behind it: This deck is a grand investment for any collector of such. You won't be disappointed- by either the art or the effort put into trying to bring the legends of Wales and celtic legend in general to life. <br /> <br />On a purely technical and divinatory side however... I'm sad to say the deck is not up to par. Though beautiful, it is easy to tell the main concentration was on the art and lore rather than on the meanings of the cards. The stock is delicate and the cards wider than normal- this indicates that shuffling and laying were not what this deck was intended for.  Their awkward width and frail stock could easily lead to unintentional damage to the cards if frequently used. <br /> <br />A good investment for collectors, but if you are looking for a divining deck- you may wish to look elsewhere. Beautiful; very beautiful- but hollow.

I've played it multiple times now hoping that my disinterest was mood based, but no, this CD fades into the background never to emerge.  On \\"Careless Love\\" I thought her phrasing added interest, on this CD I find it gimicky and ultimately annoying.  When every phrase ends with the fall off, it loses interest fast.  I'm not convinced, but if it is an attempt to imitate Billie Holiday, enough is enough.    Or it just might be the songs: only \\"Blue Alert\\" and the title track have me returning for more.  The rest is just aural wallpaper or worse; as with the soporific \\"Everybody's Talking At Me\\".    Sadly, I need to be more circumspect with Ms. Peyroux, previews will be required for future purchases.
0440419514|5.0|Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy is a must-read for anyone who loves fantasy or fairy tales. They're the sort of books that move quickly with an engaging plot, but have substance to back up the excitement. I often find Lyra, the main character, a bit too bold to be entirely believable, but her character is consistent through out the books and grows as events change her. These are books which provide as much enjoyment from a 3rd or 5th read as they do the 1st time through.
0689829590|5.0|My 16-month-old daughter loves the moon. If you notice, the moon is actually in a lot of children's books, especially Goodnight Moon, but also The Going To Bed Book and lots of other board books. She always looks up to the sky to try to find the moon (or \\"MOOeen\\" as she calls it), so this was the perfect book for her. This is by the same author who wrote Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See?, so it has the same awesome artwork. The story is great, too. It's about a little girl who wants to play with the moon and so asks her father to go and get it for her. So, it's great for a daddy to read to his daughter. There are lots of fun flaps to pull down and open, so the book is very interactive. It also introduces the concept of the moon growing and shrinking. It also covers the opposites of \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" (also a favorite of my daughter). The only drawback is that the pages are very delicate and could be easily ripped by a rambunxious reader. So, we put this one in our \\"Special Collections Archive\\" out of my daughter's reach. Left to her own devices she would probably rip the fun interactive pages, but we keep it in pretty much mint condition by just keeping it in the \\"archive.\\" I HIGHLY recommend this book for all those little moon lovers out there. (Also good for \\"kitty\\" lovers.)

1400032717|4.0|The book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a coming of age fiction novel by Mark Haddon. It takes place in present day England, where the main character, an autistic teenager named Christopher Boone discovers that his neighbor's dog, Wellington was killed with a garden fork. He decides that he is going to solve the mystery of whom the killer of Wellington is. In doing so, he meets lots of people who don't necessarily give him information regarding his goal of solving the mystery, rather he learns a lot about his family life that he never knew before. This information changes his entire outlook on life and all of the sudden getting an \\"A\\" in an advanced math class isn't as important as it used to be. As the adventure unfolds, you travel along with Christopher as he works to improve his life by joining the family he never knew that he had.  <br /> <br />The author has a very basic word choice, and when words that aren't very basic appear, they are defined, right in the text (example: \\"singularity\\" from above), in a very informal manner, as if you are in the head of the character. The words are also written very simply together, almost as if an elementary school student was writing it, not an adult, which further allows you to have depth into the autistic character. <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I brought the movie for my son as a Christmas gift. He wanted me to see it, I wasn't sure,because it didn't look like much to me. I must say I was surprise. It was one for the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time. I told all of my friends to watch it for themselves. I am 58 years old and I still like to resee it again.
B000L43AN4|5.0|Superb collection of songs, particularly Bawlers and Brawlers. Strongly recommend.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I first saw the Big Lebowski when it came out in the cinema back in 98. At the time, my only experience with the Coens was the Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo. I could never work out why everyone loves Fargo so much - it's a well-made, fairly entertaining film to be sure, but apart from the one time I saw it in the cinema I've never felt compelled to watch it again. The Big Lebowski, however, is a film that I'm happy to watch over and over. <br /> <br />For me, the reasons for this are many and varied. Firstly, the film makes me laugh my head off. Sure, the central character is a stoner so instantly people will paint this as a stoner film but there's so much more to it than that. The dialogue and the way it's used is so much fun. Take, for instance, the many offhand comments that a uttered by one character and then picked up and used later on by other characters, like Maude's 'in the parlance of our times', which the Dude pulls out later on in a conversation with the Big Lebowksi. Or, the whole 'johnson' joke running through the film. Also, the hilariously convoluted conversations between the Dude, Walter, and the perpetually slow-witted Donny. <br /> <br />Secondly, after watching the movie a couple of times I really started to appreciate the classic film noir aspect of the plot. Ok, so the mystery isn't really that important, but it does at least make sense and rewatching it again does reveal clues here and there that tie into the mystery. And without the meandering plot, we'd never be introduced to so many entertaining characters. <br /> <br />Which brings me to the third reason I love the film: the characters. I haven't seen that many films where every character, whether they're important to the plot or just minor roles, is just so much fun to watch. There are the main characters of course, like Jeff Bridges' definitive portrayal of uber-slacker 'el duderino', John Goodman's classic turn as vietnam-obsessed Walter, Julianne Moore's oddly sexy artist(e), Donny, the character Steve Buscemi plays, who has more trouble following the course of a conversation than the pot smoking Dude, and of course the rich and ridiculously pompous Big Lebowski. However, even tiny roles are far more entertaining than they have any right to be, eg. Phillip Syemour Hoffman's smarmy offsider, the two cops who interview the Dude about his missing car, Jackie Treehorn the porn mogul (amusingly, the classiest character in the film), the Dude's weedy ballet dancing landlord, even the cop who shows the Dude to his recovered car ('they probably just used it as a toilet and moved on'). Even the car itself is entertaining, progressively becoming the victim of greater and greater misfortune until it finally bites the dust right near the end of the film. <br /> <br />Humour is a personal thing, so I can understand that not everyone will get into this film. However, if you can appreciate that sometimes plot can be  secondary to character and dialogue and still produce an entertaining film, then you should almost certainly get something out of this film.
B00003CXSP|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I watch a lot of movies. My brother in law actually threw up while watching this movie. I don't understand the fascination with an evil serial killer, and I really don't understand how anyone could portray him as a sympathetic character, much less the savior of Clarice Starling.
B000HLDFKE|5.0|Everything that an HD-DVD should be picture wise and a surprisingly good plot and acting. My wife and I both loved this movie and couldn't recommend it more!
B0006IIKS0|4.0|As a fan of movies, I was entertained and enjoyed the movie. Definitely rentable. <br /> <br />I normally don't enjoy documentaries due to them being a catalyst in promoting a false persona, or the written 'real' dialog for the characters.   <br /> <br />However, I didn't sense this with this movie.  The personalities came through for everyone, and because the truthfulness was allowed to remain after editing, the movie is that much more enjoyable.  Thus these people are not actors, but characters(?). <br /> <br />Do not expect this to be 'reality TV,': an arguement-fest, or witty dialog off of a cue card.  It was real, and not 'reality.'  The main characters, Lars, James, and Kirk, are human, and thus you can make your opinions about them honestly.  And because all the characters are being themselves and not acting, you can see their logic (or lack of it) for their actions, though you may not always agree. <br /> <br />But the end is tied-up nicely in a bow, with a record and a concert tour(that my Hubby saw and said was incredible!) <br />Yes, definitely rentable, but adults only due to language and adult-themes.

B000JVT092|5.0|A great movie that really reflects well on the Christopher Reeves legacy as Superman. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane lacks the gusto of Margot Kidder but brandon Routh's portrayal of Superman/Clark Kent was spot on! Routh does a wonderful job of making you forget that is someone other than Reeves playing the role. Audio and Video are top of then line, amongst the best that I have ever seen and heard.
0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama's second book, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" contains what he defines as his thoughts on reclaiming the American Dream.  The book is part memoir, part philosophy, part politics and part sermon.  Written from his perspective as a Senator of the Democratic Party, it discusses several issues as they impact the American people as a whole.  The central premise of the book is Obama's belief that, despite racial, religious and cultural differences, Americans are less different from one another than conventional wisdom would have us believe.<br /><br /> The book is divided into nine chapters, each dealing with what Obama sees as an important aspect of American life.  The chapters include family, values, politics and faith, among other things.  Each aspect is discussed from his perspective which, more often than not, is consistent with what most regular Americans believe, and his interpretation of the United States Constitution.  What is unique, or at least refreshingly rare, about Obama's perspective is that it is not parochial.  In fact, it is much more cosmopolitan than that of the average American politician.  Having lived for several years in Indonesia, and having maintained his close ties to his father's Kenyan family, he is able to bring a global perspective to his thoughts which holds the reader's interest.<br /><br /> Although it is not a novel, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is a very interesting and entertaining book which provides much insight in the character of the author.  It is interspersed with numerous anecdotes about his friends and family, and several instances of self deprecating humor showing that Obama's ego is probably less inflated than that of your average politician.  What I liked best about the book was the fact that it was so well written.  Somehow Obama manages to convey his thoughts in a manner that is easy to follow and very cohesive.  I understood what he was saying without having to read each paragraph two or three times, as so frequently happens with books of this genre. This is a book which should generate lively discussion.  You should read it.ooks of this genre. This is a book which should generate lively discussion.  You should read it. <br />
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grandchildren and it turned out to be an excellent choice and their favorite movie.  They watch the movie at least 2x a week and would watch it every day if I allowed it. The story and the music is captivating for young folks.  I have to admit that I can sing along with the songs. A great addition to our movie collection
B000A6T1KE|5.0|I just don't get it.  Why are some people bashing this film?  Now I will be the first to admit that The Wrath of Khan is my favorite but Nemisis comes in a close second to The Undiscovered Contry.  Star Trek was born the year I was 1966 and ever since I watched my first episode I have been hooked. <br /> <br />Anyway I will be the first to admit that this film isn't without it's holes.  Like why did Shinzon hate the Federation so much?  He was cloned by the Romulans the Federation had nothing to do with his creation or putting him in the mines.  Why were the Warbirds dispatched so easily? just to mention a few.  But their is so much more to be happy about. <br /> <br />The acting was great and the director wasn't bad either.  The battle scenes were great, casue we all know that Paramount is known to be cheap.  Take for instance the battle scene in The undiscovered Country when the Klingon Bird of Prey explodes.....well this explosion scenes is put into Generations when the Klingon bird of Prey explodes.  Did you notice?  Anyway in most Star Trek movies when a explosion happens on the ship the actors just move around and shake thier chairs like they are being pushed around, in Nemesis they actually put the bridge on hydrolics so the bridge is moved around making the battle scenes look more realistic giving the actors one less thing to have to remember.  Some people take offence to Riker taking another ship to command when he said he wanted to command the Enterprise.  Well, when was the last time you changed your mind?  People change in life and this reflects that.  We may not know the reasons why but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of things so don't be so critical, take it for what it is....A movie with 40 years of history to keep in mind when they create a movie, this has to be a daunting task. <br /> <br />Anyway the movie is great and in my mind still holds true to the addage that, \\"Even numbered Trek films don't suck\\"  This movie has so much, it sheds light on the main characters in the movie and it has action, the  Starship battle, a love story, the marriage of Troy and Riker, loss, the death of Data, Humor, Worf with a hang over.  If people were this critical over Generations I think it would be justified and I liked Generations.  But not this movie if you haven't purchased it, do it you will like it.  It really is a great movie.
0307237699|1.0|Well written, but it feels like there is nothing new presented about politics.  If you are from the left side of the spectrum, you will find yourself nodding in agreement with Senator Obama's views, and if you hail from the right side, you will likely be shaking your head throughout most of the book.      There is a lot of apparent chastisement of political parties in general, but the author specifically cites examples from the republican party.  Though I hail from the left, I got frustrated that he would present an argument that would seem like common sense, talk about how we need to centralize our political system, and then rip the republican side apart... doing just the opposite of what he says we need to stop doing!    By the end of the book, it felt more like a political stunt to discredit republicans and get ready for the White House than a book about changing the country.  Ironically, I felt more sympathy towards republicans than I felt at the beginning of the book.  A nice subtitle to the book would have been \\"The Audacity of Hope: Why the Republican Party Is Supremely Evil and Powerhungry\\".    A little less ripping on the republicans and following his own advice to politicians would have netted 4 or 5 stars.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Now I am a die hard Trek fan.  I mean I have had debates over whether a Starship could take on a Star Destroyer.  And just for the record Yes it could and beat it every time. LOL.  Anyway that is just to give some back ground on how passionate I am about Star Trek. <br /> <br />This is the worst movie out of all the Star Trek Movies.  Paramount must have gone brain dead on this one.  The only reason it came to be is because Shatner has a clause in his contract that he gets to do anything that Nimoy does.  Nimoy directed Star Trek the Voyage Home so now Shatner got to direct The Final frontier.  Oh my is this movie bad.  A renegade Vulcan who is looking for God and steals a Star Ship to take him to the great barrier.  Kirk and Spock are the only ones with minds strong enough to resist this maniac, oh let me guress you saw that one coming huh.  Not only is this story bad but they got REALLY REALLY CHEESY with the special effects.  They wanted Lucas division, ILM to do the effects but they were busy with some other projects, I think Star Wars but I'm not certain, anyway they couldn't do it.  They could have gotten Sony backed Digital Domain but they didn't want to give work to a rival studio.  So they went with some no name company that really messed this movie up.   <br /> <br />What can you say.  Kirk, spock and Bones around a camp fire singing Row Row Row your Boat.  Oh man, no they didn't.  And this is a good point to this movie.  Did the scene work?  Heck No!!!!  but it was one of the only bright spots in this disaster.  Anyway save yourself the heart ache if you aren't a big Trek fan steer away from this movie.  But if you are a Trekker like I am, \\"yes I have this movie\\" Even after I saw it in the theaters.  Get it as a remeinder about how bad things can be when you want to bash a Trek series or movie.

B000ADWDF2|4.0|Even with glasses my eyesight isn't the best, and I don't do very well at reading subtitles on a foreign movie, unless I stand right in front of the television screen while the movie is playing.  Because of this, I seldom buy foreign films for my collection.  I made a rare exception with Brothers, starring the lovely Connie Nielsen, Ulrich Thomsen, and Nikolaj Lie Kaas.  I'd read a nice review of the film by an Amazon customer, and it triggered my interest in seeing the movie.  Plus, I've enjoyed Ms. Nielsen in other movies.<br /><br />The story deals with two brothers who seem to be the opposite of each other.  One brother, Michael (played by Thomsen), is a Major in the Danish army, and he's a good-natured person who loves his family and always tries to do the right thing.  The other brother, Jannik (played by Kaas), has just spent time in jail for a bank robbery and an assault on one of the bank's female employees.  He likes to drink and fight, which doesn't leave a very good impression on those around him, especially his parents.  Michael has always been the one who succeeded and got all of the positive attention, while Jannik remained the black sheep of the family.  When Michael's unit is sent to Afghanistan to fight, he's in a helicopter crash and presumed dead.  Jannik begins to help Michael's wife, Sarah (played by Connie Nielsen), and her two daughters as a way for all of them to deal with the tragic grief.  Eventually, Jannik and Sarah fall in love with each other, only to have Michael return from the grave, which creates a rather unique situation for everybody.<br /><br />There's going to be some plot spoilers so don't read on if it bothers you.  First, let me say that the performers in the movie are all excellent.  The actors give life and breath to their characters, and the audience certainly begins to care about them as human beings.  You can clearly see the emotional struggle that both brothers endure with each other as well as with their parents.  Connie Nielsen captures Sarah perfectly as a strong and loving woman who finds herself unexpectedly caught between her husband and his brother, both of whom have seemingly changed their personalities during the last half of the film.  Second, the movie is a sad one with no resolution at the end.  It's about life and tragedy and the ability to keep moving forward no matter how bad things get.  This leads me to the two problems that I had with the film.  While Michael is held prisoner in Afghanistan, he's forced to do something horrible in order to stay alive.  It goes against his very nature as a human being.  I found it extremely difficult to believe that he'd allow himself to be forced into doing what he did.  He appeared to be too good of a man for something like this to happen, plus he's a Major in the army with the added strength and discipline to sustain him.  If someone held a gun to my head and ordered me to hurt another human being, I'm don't know what my reaction would be.  Would I tell my captors to go f*** themselves, or would I want to live so badly that I'd do as ordered?  I don't know.  No matter how much Michael wanted to live for his family, it just didn't ring true to me that he would do what his captors wanted.  Add to that the fact that when he finally gets home, rather than keeping his guilt to himself and dealing with it stoically, he takes it out on everybody around him and comes close to destroying his own family.  He certainly scares the daylights out of his wife and his children by threatening to kill them all.  Michael turns out to be not as good or as strong as we first thought.  The second problem with the movie is the time factor.  We never really know how long Michael is held prisoner.  It's never mentioned.  I had to go by the length of his beard, which implied to me that he was gone between six and eight weeks.  Even though he was reported dead, that seemed to me to be a relatively short amount of time for Sarah to go through the grieving process and then to develop strong feelings for the brother.  If Michael had been gone for a year or longer, then I could understand what happened, but six weeks left me wondering just how much Sarah actually loved her husband.  Now that I've ruined the ending for everyone, let me just reiterate that this is a good film and with excellent acting by the entire cast.  The two little girls that play the daughters do a magnificent job portraying the confused feelings that they have for their father and with what's going on in the household.  I do wish the ending of the movie hadn't left us hanging with no visible resolution.  After having invested two hours of my time with this family, I wanted to have a clearer view of how things finally worked out.  As another reviewer wrote, this film isn't for everybody, but if you like small, well-made films about life and sadness, then this is one you'll probably enjoy.grieving process and then to develop strong feelings for the brother.

The only thing about this album that I don't care for is...just as you're getting into a tune you love...BOOM...it fades to another song.  There's just not enough of each tune!  Martin does a wonderful job of transitioning here, unusual but smooth and a production marvel.  The album just whets one's appetite and then changes the course.  A little bothersome, but for what it is, a 'collage', it's great!

B000001FYZ|5.0|There are unfortunate, and fortunate, things about this album. The unfortunate part is that once you're at the top, like Scorpions were through the mid to late '80s, there is no where to go but down. Fortunately with 'Crazy World', they don't drop very far. Their first album of the 90's still brings some hard rockers, plus the ubiquitous ballads that have become synonymous with the success of Scorpions. \\"Don't Believe Her\\", \\"Kick Between The Eyes\\" and \\"Kicks After Six\\" prove that the band can still rock as hard as ever, while the ballads \\"Winds Of Change\\" and \\"Send Me An Angel\\" went to the top of the charts. It's obvious that perestroika and the end of the Cold War had a profound effect on the songwriting, much more so because of their geographical proximity to the Eastern Bloc.

How many mixes can there be of the same songs?  This whole thing just screams \\"Minimal amount of work for maximum profit.\\"  There's just nothing to this except trying to further capitalize on The Beatles' name (and I don't get the hype about Cirque du Soleil, either).<br /><br />I have to disagree with Amazon's featured review on this page: I don't need this CD for \\"inspiration\\" to go to the studio albums.  I listen to them everyday regardless.<br /><br />Truth be told, I really don't care what the casual and fly-by-night fans think.  From a die-hard, I don't \\"Love\\" this at all!  - Donna Di Giacomo
0060763280|5.0|Great book - and a strong concept that really helped me see why I've made many of the financial decisions I've made throughout my life.  I highly recommend the book, especially the book-on-tape version where Eker reads his own material with passion, humor and insight.  \\"Don't tell me, you're broke!\\" he says to people who tell him money isn't imnportant.  Ain't it the truth?  NOTE:  The book is easier to use for the affirmations.   <br /> <br />Although I'm still working hard to get rich, I believe the book has helped me overcome many of the hidden bug-a-boos inside me that have sabotaged my efforts in the past.  Get it.  Today. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I thought this DVD was great.  I was glad to see that they not only included the facts, but what you can do about the facts (there is a paper list included). I plan on circulating it to family and friends.
B0000027D5|5.0|Neither those who know Santana from the original band's early rock LPs, nor those most familiar with Carlos' and Company's recent all-star pop outings, will be in any way prepared for the astonishing two hours of music which is LOTUS. Recorded at a pair of Japanese concerts in 1973, this set is certainly the most singular item in one of rock music's most singular careers. <br />   Having fallen under the spell of early-seventies fusion as epitomized by Miles Davis, Chick Corea and other groundbreaking jazzmen, guitarist Carlos Santana made this third version of his eponymous ensemble by far the best, concentrating on lengthy instrumental explorations which were kept nailed in place by a phenomenal three-to-four-man percussion section. While inevitable hits (and rare vocals) like \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Oye Como Va\\" are here, and wonderfully handled, they sound almost trivial next to the driving and exotic sounds which surround them. \\"A-1 Funk,\\" \\"Gypsy Queen,\\" \\"Samba de Sausalito\\" and \\"Incident at Neshabur\\" rank among my personal favorites; but it seems ludicrous to pinpoint specific tracks as the show is essentially one long and very remarkable suite, uninterrupted and unflagging. Guitar quotes from Miles, Stravinsky, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles add moments of relative levity - and a reminder of just how far afield this band drew its inspiration from - before the ultratight octet tears into its next workout, leaving the listener to marvel at how they possibly could've kept it up. LOTUS is a stunning album, a marvelous experience and one of the peak moments from the heyday of jazz/rock fusion. Indispensable!

0307237699|3.0|Although this book was not what I had expected it to be, it none the less was very thought provoking.  I believe Senator Obama gave some good insights of government and offered some interesting ideas for possible solutions to the many problems afflicting this country's government.

B000G0O5N2|3.0|First off, I want to state that I am format neutral, so please don't accuse me of being a HD fanboy when I offer up criticism of MPEG-2.  Black hawk down is a great movie, and one of the few HD titles I purchased after already owning the SD release.  However, with the exception of my comcast HD, I have never seen content that is this poor.  Previous benchmarks for poor quality were the HD DVD releases of The Fugitive, Goodfellas, and the Italian Job.  The visual quality of this movie set that bar even lower, and I fully fault MPEG-2 for this.  Compression artifacts were evident in black areas, and grain was apparent as well. <br />My reference system is a Westinghouse LVM-37w3 (1080p) with a PS3 via HDMI for blu ray, and an HD-A1 via HDMI for HD DVD.  Audio is through an Onkyo receiver with Cambridge SoundWorks speakers.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This movie is more art than movie. It takes you into a twisted world where bleakness rules. I have watched it numerous times and it never ceases to amaze.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Some have criticised this new rendition of the legend as being a bit too 'Metro'. I believe this is the betters any other version of the classic hero yet. <br />It succeeds in fulfilling every boys dream by making you feel like you're flying with him. While seeming a little fantastic, they try to keep as much of Superman's powers as real as possible. Basing all his of strengths upon some loose scientific theory makes it a touch more believable, which allows even the biggest kids to get immersed into another world of ultimate good verse evil. We all like seeing him in action, doing the heroic feats that most men can only dream of. He even looks like he enjoys his work...wouldn't you? <br />His morals and standards that he lives by can be a model for anyone to follow. In spite of being super in comparison to the rest of humanity, he acts more human than most by allowing his heart to make selfless decisions. After seeing someone who seems completely invincible come so close to defeat, but still manages to hang onto all that he believes in, is essential the essence of the life's continuous struggle. He fulfils a purpose that goes beyond his own desires to make the world a better place. He comes to the point where he has died to himself, thinking of only one thing - to save humanity from itself. With everyone essentially evil at heart, how can one man be so good? <br />
1400032717|5.0|Christopher loves math, his pet rat Toby; he loves to read detective novels and can play minesweeper on his computer for hours on end; he knows every prime number up to 7,057; he hates the color yellow and cannot stand to be touched.  When he discovers his neighbor's slain dog one night, Christopher embarks upon a journey of discovery that leads him halfway across London.    Written in the first-person narrative of a fifteen year old autistic boy, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is easily one of the most fascinating and moving novels of recent memory.  Part detective yarn, part journey of self-discovery, the novel is not one to be missed.       As the brother of an autstic sibling, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was almost an invitation into my brother's own thoughts.  Much of Christopher's \\"quirks\\" I saw in him, instantly endearing the novel and its author to me.  A must read for anyone, but particularly anyone with an autistic family member.
B000AP04OM|5.0|it took me 37 years to see the sound of music for the first time, but it was worth it. i went to the hollywood bowl sing along and became an instant fan. this movie is without a doubt a classic, great for the whole family and to view with friends. <br />
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|If your taste in music is such that you like something a little different, you'll like this album.  There's also some nice traditional pieces to satisfy the 'non-musician' in the family.  I set up our CD player on Christmas Eve to randomly select between 4 albums.  Whenever a 'Tull' song played, someone eventually asked me 'Who is this?'. <br /> <br />I'll admit I hadn't bought a new Tull album since the 70's until this one.  I'd forgotten how good Ian actually is.  He surrounds himself (again) with excellent musicians.  I don't believe Ian will ever be 'To Old to Rock & Roll'. <br /> <br />I bought this album mostly because I heard 'Jack Frost & the Hooded Crow' on a local radio station and decided I had to have it.  I'm glad I did.  If you liked Tull in the 70's, you'll like this.
B000021Y7X|5.0|What a fun show! We saw this when it was first released and had such a good time rocking away. We always loved the artistry and staging. But it is the music that sells the project. So thrilled to find it on Amazon in DVD format! After so many years, it's still a great show!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Everyone here seems to be unbelievably pretentious. All this music snobbery about the \\"great era\\" of music. Come on.  <br /> <br />This is a profoundly good album. I don't say that because I like Incubus...it's because it's true.   <br /> <br />The best tracks would have to be Quicksand, Dig, Diamonds and Coal, and finally Rogues.   <br /> <br />The songs are performed with power and gusto. Brandon has really come into his own with his lyrical and vocal ability. <br /> <br />As a huge music fan myself (including Radiohead, The Shins, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Sigur Ros, and others) I rate Incubus right up there. <br /> <br />Sure they still have the old reputation as a radio-friendly band, but who cares? It's the music that matters not the \\"reputation\\" or all of that other white noise (or b.s.) <br /> <br />Back to the songs though... <br /> <br />Quicksand (the first track) is beautiful. Brandon's voice kills all your anxiety, your fears, the things bothering you. As I drove down the freeway I just melted at the sound of this song. And then it ends....All of a sudden. This song clocks it at under 2 min. Tragedy. It could very well be the best song on the CD if not for its brevity. <br /> <br />Dig is brilliant as well. This song is mellow and sad. I'm not really a ballad man myself, but this song is damn good. Incubus had a song awhile back called \\"Miss You,\\" or \\"I Miss You.\\" A lot of people like it. Terrible song. This song though, is the ballad of ballads. It's lovely. It's a Radiohead song. Not as dark though. <br /> <br />Diamonds and Coal is another mellow number. I like the fluidity of the song and where it takes me. Think about either driving or writing while listening to this one. See where your mind goes.  <br /> <br />Rouges is the best song for sure. It's a rocking track that illustrates everything good about this band. Brandon has a lot of power in that voice and he demonstrates it on this track. I can't imagine how many times I've listened to this song. It's a booming, thundering shock.  <br /> <br />Please listen to this album before writing the band off as \\"radio-friendly\\" or whatever other cliche is used today by lazy music listeners.  <br /> <br />
0618680004|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this book.  I am atheist leaning but more importantly, I am anti organized religion.  I think this distinction is important.  Dawkins points out the many fallacies in theologies, the inconsistencies in various scriptures and the harm that organized religion has done to mankind.  I agree that the harm far exceeds any perceived value.  Everytime I see a big church or cathedral, I wonder what Christ would have thought about the money spent.  By true Christian teaching, all that money should have gone to the poor.  <br /> <br />But I digress. Many books have been written (including this one) that point out all the problems with the various organized religious tenets.  It is an easy task to argue the illogic of organized religion - it proves its own illogic in every chapter and section, whether it is the Koran or the Bible. <br /> <br />But this is where I think Dawkins fails.  He cannot prove or disprove the existance of a supreme being.  He has done a good job of debunking religion and a pretty poor job of disproving God.  His \\"who created the creator\\" simply doesn't hold logical water.  Just as he would maintain that there has always been a \\"universe\\", theists would maintain that God has always been.  If there must be a creator, who created the universe? <br /> <br />I don't believe in a supreme being.  But that is just my belief based on pretty much nothing.  And despite his attempts to prove otherwise, Dawkins is in the same boat.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Listen i am not an expert as are most of us out here listening to music. But I am big on 60's-80's real rock! <br /> <br />we lost that in the 90's due to the Grunge stuff! <br /> <br />Well this is pretty darn good. <br /> <br />Everyone on here who does slam Wolfmother siting no originality, blah blah blah <br /> <br />Hey it sound pretty good to me! <br /> <br />One song actually reminds me of a great little band from the mid to late 90's Toadies its called \\"Where the Eagles have been\\" <br /> <br />listen to it and listen to some Toadies.......... <br /> <br />go figure <br /> <br />Rock on! rock on! <br /> <br />BTW the only band that would get a 5 star from me is if SRV himself came back from the dead with an album with Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Albert King and BB King!!!!!! <br /> <br />Kinda set in my ways!
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This \\"Ultimate\\" DVD came in a rounded-corner container made of very HEAVY Tin.  However, due to the poor packing by Amazon the corner was severly dented!!!  ...or it was already dented and they sent it to me damaged, either way it was a unexcusable by Amazon.  Really sloppy!!!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I just got the album and I have to say the album is nothing but perfection on the scale of rock.  The emotional vocals of Jared Leto has a range of unbelievable quality; \\"From Yesterday\\" is quiet powerful.  <br />       Jared Leto has edge and sings with emotion. I emphasize on the emotion because that is one word that really can only describe this album. The combo of rock and some background keyboard action is fitting. This is what rock should be meant to sound.  To endure the soul and free the fury from within. Never should it sound the same at all and it doesn't on this album!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved it!  The entire series, in the proper order (it was shown out of sequence on TV initially).  Great background music, good filming, great interaction between characters.  The show was cancelled after one year by the network, unfairly.   <br /> <br />There's a really nice thread of humor running through the entire show, though for the most part it's done seriously.  Every crewman on the space ship has a character study done on them for at least an episode, you really get to know them well.  The Hospital episode is the best!   <br /> <br />Joss Whedon did the film movie sequentially with the story off the TV series, so it continues the plot for the characters, but with or without the movie, I highly recommend this show for anyone into SF, anyone who liked Babylon 5, anyone who likes Stargate.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Loreena McKennit is a wonderful singer and provides a unique look into a modern day version of music of the past.  This CD is good but an awful lot like many of her earlier CDs.  Since it was the first done in 10 years, I was expecting more.
B000021Y77|4.0|It's like an episode from the Twilight Zone.  Three days, lived over sequentially (same day) and this lady has to RUN across the city looking for a way to keep her boyfriend from being killed by the mob.  Each time it ends in his death, then the last time she dies and he's the one who 'saves' her.  Their next day completely shifts their life for the better & they're out of the perpetual loop. <br /> <br />This actress literally RUNS for about half the movie, she's in great shape!  Interesting premise.  Fun watching the same people in the background in certain scenes where THEIR lives evidentally are very different each time around. <br /> <br />I'd recommend it.
1594200440|3.0|My wife was laughing hysterically during her read of this book.  I was expected much the same but I found the book, while well written, sad.  There were a few cute moments but in my view, the book disappointed as an opportunity for a good belly laugh.
0553573403|5.0|This is the best book i have read in a really long time.  It breaks the typical fantasy mold and really goes where other literature dares not go.  It has given me an indepth look into GRRM world of fantasy and heroes.  I fell in love with this book almost immediately with the descriptive writing style.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, and Tolkien.
0743243315|5.0|There are two striking qualities to be found in Monica Ali's debut novel. First, although the book's pace is measured and at times even slow, I never found it boring. The second feat is that all her characters are far from perfect, and their actions are often blameworthy, but--with the exception of a a nosy and malevolent neighbor, who figures late in the plot--they are nevertheless endearing. It's rare to find a writer who strikes such a delicate balance between the ordinariness and the uniqueness of the lives of everyday people.<br /><br />The heroine, Nazneen, is far from a saint, and she could even be called simple (both deferential to her husband and meek in her expectations), but she commands the sympathies of her husband, her neighbors, and the reader. She comes to England from Bangladesh, to enter into an arranged marriage and raise two children and to live as a stranger in her both her new country and the neighborhood around Brick Lane. The bubble in which she lives bursts when her children become teenagers and when Nazneen begins an affair with a young activist. Gradually, she matures beyond her deference and her low expectations--and she begins to love her new home.<br /><br />The men in Nazneen's life are equally conflicted. Her husband is oafish, pompous, and even delusional--one daughter finds him utterly embarassing, the other is anxiously eager to please--but he's basically a good, caring man. Constantly seeing the mirage of success on the horizon of his flailing employment prospects, he plans to return to Bangladesh--intentions thwarted by the economic realities of his life in London. Nazneen's lover, in contrast, is idealistic, arrogant, and passionate; he fills her life with excitement, but he encloses her with a trap of a different sort. A reasonable request for information or a calm appeal for respect can be greeted by rigid certainty: \\"He looked at her up and down, as if she might be an impostor. 'Because,' he said with quiet emphasis, 'it is.'\\"<br /><br />Until the unexpected, frantic climatic chapters that close the book, \\"Brick Lane\\" is composed of scenes from a marriage, scenes from an affair. She understands she can't have both, but she is confronted yet by another choice: her native country against her adopted one. The ghost of her mother tells her, \\"It's easy. You just have to endure,\\" while her best friend in London asserts, \\"You can do whatever you like.\\" Yet none of her decisions are \\"easy.\\"is.'\\" <br /> <br />Until the unexpected, frantic climatic chapters that close the book, \\"Brick Lane\\" is composed of scenes from a marriage, scenes from an affair.

B000002UAF|5.0|Going on 43 years, this album still sends a jangly chill up and down my spine. From the rip-roaring opening chord of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" to the plaintive \\"I'll Be Back,\\" this is the first truly awesome Beatles' recording. In one year, 1964, the group moved from a simple \\"Love Me Do\\" to an exuberant \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\" Everything to love about the Beatles is here. Not the sophisticated pop to come later, but still heady stuff indeed. At their heart, the Beatles were a great rock and roll band, and this record stands as testimony. Yes, they saved the best for the movie. The first seven songs almost dance off the disc. This is why everyone was screaming. George's jangly 12-string, John's pop harmonica, Paul's bouncing bass, Ringo's \\"beat,\\" and some pretty amazing vocals, this is what it was all about. And the last six song include some gems. \\"I'll Cry Instead,\\" \\"Things We Said Today,\\" and \\"I'll Be Back\\" all point to the future, music that was going to jump outside the box. All this, and \\"You Can't Do That.\\" Yeah, yeah, yeah! They could.

0446679089|4.0|After reading Nelson DeMille's newest John Corey novel, \\"Wild Fire\\", I decided to go back and revisit John Corey from his debut in Plum Island.<br /><br />  Plum Island presents the reader with the frightening premise of what could happen if deadly viruses were to be sold for money to evildoers.<br /><br />  When a couple that John Corey knows, Tom and Judy Gordon, scientists who work at the Plum Island animal disease research lab, are found murdered, John is called upon to investigate.<br /><br />  What follows is a fast moving story that presents some of your worst fears. As Corey unravels the mystery behind the Gordon's murder, he falls in love... and then falls in love again.<br /><br />  The story moves rapidly as a boulder down the side of a mountain for the first four hundred pages, then drops precipitously in the last hundred pages for DeMille's best closing since 'The Charm School.'<br /><br />  Always funny, and poignant, John Corey's first novel is a great read!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I HAD to buy this DVD after seeing the movie at the theatre.  It was so funny I wanted all my friends to see it.  It's been lent out ever since I got it.  Everyone I loan it to loves it.  The characters put the FUN back in dysfunctional.  There will be at least one character everyone can relate to.  Awesome ensemble cast, it would be hard to pick a favorite.  If your on the fence about whether or not to get this movie, my advice is an absolute yes.  You won't regret it!
B000063DHK|5.0|not just the best Maiden live cd, or the best live metal performance, it's literally the best live cd ever made.  it makes for an incredible greatest hits-type collection(from the time when Iron Maiden was creating the amazing legacy that made them who they are), the sound quality is perfect, there's a LOT of music on it, and it even has great artwork and a lot of tour information, including pictures, and equipment used.  the only thing that would have made it better would be to have had Paul sing on songs from the first two albums.
0740714651|5.0|This book was originally published and a best seller when I was too young to be interested in a book like this.  I happened upon the 25th Anniversary Edition while on vacation and could only skim through this before having to return it to the library on our cruise ship.  I was excited to order my personal copy of the book and reread the book.  Since then my husband and mother-in-law have read the book with my encouragement.  This book is life changing and yet simple.  It has helped me to understand myself and others much better, and has put into words beautifully my spiritual beliefs.  I have never been to a psychiatrist or taken part in any form of therapy but after reading the book I have a much greater appreciation of the process that takes place in good therapy.   I will use this book for the rest of my life.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums I have heard in a while. Rapper Cee-lo(?) and Danger Mouse(Or MF doom? Idk, I'm confused) have made musical GOLD here. I personally do not like hip hop or rap, but this is one of my favourite albums. It has undertones of psychological themes under a Rollercoaster of sound, and music and amazing lyrics. At the first you hear an old projector starting up, and you can hear how that affects the music till the end of the album when it shuts off. I think every song on this album is astounding, though Feng Shui took some settling into. A surprisingly good album, and this band needs to make more of their weird hip hop. 5/5.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A surprisingly feel-good road journey about a dysfunctional but loving family that helps make you appreciate your own. Centering around child pageants, this comedy engages immediately, despite the inherently obscene nature of the subject, which it embarrassingly and hysterically highlights in the last discomforting scene.  Perfectly acted by all.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Quirky, soulful and hilarious - this movie has beat all others as my all-time favorite. The vegetarian scene alone was enough to make me put nose to knees laughing. It will be thoroughly appreciated by sensitive, spiritual types and despised by the football and Labatt's crowd. Probably not a good date movie ladies ... unless you want to conduct a sensitivity check:-)
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I saw this movie in theathers and it was definately the best movie I have seen lately....I can not wait till the DVD comes out! The cast is great! It is definately a great movie, because for one the men will love the action of the movie, and us girls love the hot guys in it! It is a must buy if you haven't seen it yet, and even if you have it is a great one to keep!
B00005MP58|2.0|I realize fans of the series will probably vote \\"no\\" for helpful out of spite (upon editing I see I'm quite right, I'm even being insulted in the comments...), but I just plain did not like it.  I tried going back and watching it a second time, but I still felt the same as I did the first time.  I really feel that Lizzy was miscast, she just didn't give off that fiery spirit that makes Lizzy so loveable and endearing.  She was nothing like the Lizzy I imagined.  Jane, the beauty of the Bennet family, was extremely plain.  Lydia and Mrs. Bennet were terrible actresses, grating at my nerves every minute they were on-screen, and even Colin Firth (who I usually like) was practically a robot.  In many places the dialogue was over-simplified and dumbed-down.  Many little details (which have major meaning) from the book were left out.  While this version is extremely close to the events in the book, I felt that the passion and chemistry between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy just wasn't there (and this was a MAJOR point for me... they just ooze passion and chemistry in the book), and I also think the same goes for the Jane/Bingley relationship.<br /><br />Both the scenery and the costumes are beautiful, but I much prefer the 2005 and 1940 versions (even with all of their inaccuracies, I feel the acting was much better.  Knightly and MacFadyen, to me, had great chemistry, as did Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier. I feel that these films covered events in the book pretty decently for having only 2 hours in which to do it).
B000F3T3CS|5.0|As has been rightly pointed out, the singing of all the principals in this production is first-rate, while as opera performers Villazon and Netrebko are also that great rarity, a stunning couple to look at. Along with just about everyone else on stage or in the audience at this performance, they too appear to be having a whale of a time. Such widespread delight pretty quickly becomes impossible to resist.    If there is a flaw in the performance, however, I'd say it's in the tendency of Villazon once again to overact, a characteristic less seriously distracting here, though, than in his earlier Don Carlo or Alfredo. Amusingly dressed as an ebony mop-haired Raggedy Andy, his Nemorino certainly has enormous charm and largely employs successful comedic stage movement and business, including some unexpected, but marvelous, juggling with real pieces of fruit, but I'd say Villazon finally falls victim to playing the \\"cute\\" card to excess, even \\"mugging\\" shamelessly. His perpetually raised, then lowered, bushy eyebrows and his repeatedly furled lower lip decline into mannerisms; he, in turn, threatens to become less a comic actor here than an act.  Now since many opera performers still provide little in the way of acting, I suppose we should be grateful for what he does provide, even if he finally crosses the line into excess. And in any event the flaw is a small one when taken in conjunction with his glorious singing and mostly persuasive acting throughout this role.    At the same time, just because he is potentially such a talented actor as well as an already wonderful singer, a shrewder stage director might have reminded him of Hamlet's famous speech to overly ambitious comic players advising them that in great acting less is usually more.
0740748475|5.0|I purchased this boxed set as a Christmas gift for my husband, who has loved Calvin and Hobbes since he was little.  This set is awesome!  The books are beautifully crafted, and chock-full of everything that makes Calvin & Hobbes the charming, endearing cartoon that it is.  The color comics are vividly done, and the display box is a very nice quality.  Its well worth the money!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Talk about beating the odds.  Twenty-one films and some forty-four years into cinema's longest-running franchise, the Bond filmmakers have managed to redefine the character with resounding success.  In fact, as of this writing, Casino Royale is the highest-grossing 007 adventure ever.<br /><br />I've seen them all, and I've always held onto the belief that Connery IS and ALWAYS WILL BE James Bond.  But Daniel Craig almost made me forget Connery completely!  Oh sure, the early Connery films are still great fun, and the sheer nostalgia of his era can't really be ignored.  But THIS is Ian Fleming's James Bond the way he was meant to be: Cold as ice, infused with lethal cunning and nerves of steel.<br /><br />The real fun (and the real payoff for longtime fans) is watching how the writers, and Craig, slowly \\"create\\" Bond for the audience.  [SPOILERS AHEAD] There's no Q branch, no Miss Moneypenny, almost no gadgets and precious few glib one-liners.  But all the things that fans would come to love about the character are subtely laid out in the course of nearly 2 1/2 hours.  And if that sounds like a long time, you obviously haven't seen the movie yet.  Second-time director Martin Campbell (of Goldeneye, in which Bond was recreated in the person of Pierce Brosnan) piles on the action from the outset.  The construction-scene chase alone packs in more mind-blowing action in 10 minutes most movies manage in two hours.  And the scene that could have, in lesser hands, brought the action to a grinding halt (the poker game) actually provides some of the film's greatest thrills.<br /><br />Two minor quibbles that probably won't matter to casual fans: Considering this is a 2-disc set with many extras, why is there no trailer for the film?  We get trailers for Spider-man 3, Rocky Balboa, The Pursuit of Happyness and others, but not Casino Royale?  And I wish MGM/Columbia would have maintained the same package design as the previous Bond films, just so this one won't look kinda odd on the shelf next to my 20 other 007 adventures.  But again, minor complaints.<br /><br />Even if you're not a James Bond fan, give this one a try.  It's easily the best action film of 2006.  And [looks around to make sure no one is listening]. . .Daniel Craig IS Bond!20 other 007 adventures.  But again, minor complaints.    Even if you're not a James Bond fan, give this one a try.

B00000ADG2|5.0|Yes, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the best hip hop album of all time! I am aware that the production of the album incorporates R&B, reggae, and other musical genres that many believe remove this album from the hip hop category, but let me pose this question: isn't real hip hop just that? Didn't hip hop emerge as the musical genre and cultural lifestyle that appropriated former ones to create a new one? This is forward thinking hip hop, hip hop immune from the \\"copycat\\" disease that many hip hop artists perform after the success of a given formula. Gone are the exaggerated rhymes of self-grandeur, and instead we are given a thoughtful commentary on life. Finally somebody was able to capture the trials and tribulations of being not only a woman in this society, but also a human being struggling with external and internal problems. Beautiful, profound, honest, innovative are just some words that best describe this masterpiece. Listening to this album is like taking part on a much needed journey. I strongly hold that this album rejuvenated, if not saved, hip hop at a time when it was trying to recuperate from the Tupac and Biggie deaths. This is the second CD that I ever bought--back in 1998--and each time I listen to it I find something new and connect to it on a different level. An album that you listen to in its entirety, you will not be disappointed. For great lyrics and flow listen to \\"Lost Ones\\" while \\"Ex Factor\\" is the best song.  <br /> <br />Let's remember that this was the first hip hop album to win a Grammy for Album of the Year!
0064471837|4.0|This is what I would consider `high fantasy' - it's not just magic, it's Charter magic. The emphasis on the terms like that made me feel somewhat detached from the story. It felt like he was kind of ramming the world at me, overpowering me with the specifics of the world versus just using more `normal' terms and telling the story. This is when I realized that while I have a great deal of respect for people that can build entire worlds and universes different than our own (I do so love Discworld!), I'm not the sort who particularly enjoys reading about it when they use terms and phrases that seem... campy and corny, in my mind. But then, it is a juvenile book!<br /><br />Worlds aside, the storyline was quite good. The journeys into death were well-written and interesting, the characters were likable, and the plot was fast paced enough to keep me entertained and reading. I didn't like it as much as I enjoyed his other series, though I will probably continue to read both.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys high fantasy and, well, zombies!
B0000X61VE|5.0|This was purchased as a gift, so I can't personally comment on it; however, the person who received the gift said it was \\"wonderful.\\"
B00005JPKC|4.0|Austere, reverent, documentary-like in its depiction of the Japanese attempt to defend Iwo Jima at the end of WW2, Clint Eastwood's \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" never quite achieves the greatness that his earlier companion WW2 piece. \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" attains though its pleasures are many.<br />This film stars the great Japanese star, Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi sent by the powers-that-be to Iwo Jima to take charge of a mission that is doomed in that, at this point in the war, the Japanese fleet has been destroyed and no help is available to Kuribayashi and his meager, barely trained troops. General Kuribayashi is in Iwo Jima then to serve Japan and to die with honor. Watanabe's Kuribayashi goes about his desperate project with the zeal and fervor of a man, though he is well aware of the inevitable outcome, who cares nothing about saving his own hide but only that of his soldiers: he is caring, loving, intelligent and exceedingly world weary. This is a nuanced and emotionally available performance by Watanabe.<br />\\"LFIJ\\" is filmed in Japanese and told from the Japanese point of view and frankly it feels a little strange rooting for this rag-tag group of officers and soldiers particularly since the USA is the \\"enemy.\\"  Eastwood's point of view then is finely tuned with a deep sense of respect for the Japanese yet I can't help feeling that Eastwood is stacking the deck here by not mentioning and/or ignoring the many atrocities that the Japanese perpetrated on China and others during this same period.<br />Filmed in sepia tones with splashes of color, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is beautifully filmed by Tom Stern and ultimately it is a deeply affecting and thoughtful depiction of men at war: some filled with duty and honored to be there and others merely fulfilling their conscriptions.
B000EGDB10|5.0|Great action and story line; it really keeps you guessing...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Because of this film, I see Al Gore as a caring, intelligent, compassionate and humble man.  For personal, political reasons I was happy he lost the election, and I was wrong about him. I would vote for him today, but I am still happy he lost.  Were he President he would not have produced this film to awaken us to the transformational opportunity and imperative we have before us: the quality of our childrens' lives and the survival of our species and this planet. Don't watch this because you are a Democrat, and don't not watch it because you are a Republican.  Watch it becuase you care.  Watch it to learn how man can undo what man has wrought.
B00006G8HX|5.0|In my review of \\"The Wrath Of Kahn\\", I commented that it seemed like a movie, while \\"Star Trek:  The Motion Picture\\" seemed like an overlong episode.  This movie also came across to me as an overlong episode, but in this case, it was a long version of one of the better episodes.<br /><br />I won't give away much of the story, except to say that this was a continuation of the story started in \\"Wrath Of Kahn\\".  Robin Curtis took over from Kirstie Alley as Savic, and I actually liked Curtis better.  I think she's cuter as well, but I don't think you're reading a review to see who I think is cute.  Also featured is a return of Merrit Buttrick as David, Captain Kirk's son, as well as sitcom actors Christopher Lloyd (Taxi) and John Laroquette (Night Court) as Klingons (though Lloyd was much more menacing then funny).
B000005JA8|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album while wearing my best tuxedo T-shirt, ski boots, and my trusty tinfoil helmet.  Of course, one should only listen to Trout Mask Replica after making 100% sure you are not made of tuna fish.  If you are made of tuna fish, then for the love of God, do NOT read any further!!     Here are some litmus tests, ladies and gentlemen:    If you ever sat in school passing a notebook back-and-forth with your mates scribbling nonsensical gibberish to create spectacular impromptu Mad-Lib stories of adventure for your own amusement, then Trout Mask Replica is for you!!      If you have ever sat alone, very stoned, sputtering word-salad speeches, or holding a do-it-yourself DJ party in your bedroom, then Trout Mask is for you!!      If you ever sat on the kitchen floor banging on pots and pans with wooden spoons (or playing Crossbows and Catapults on the linoleum), then Trout Mask is certainly for you!!    If you have ever tired of the crappy music you are hearing before you have finished hearing it, well then, Trout Mask just might find a place in your heart.    Now then, if you really want an intense experience, try popping in the movie Zabriskie Point with the sound off, then start your Trout Mask album right when the lion in the opening credits roars for the THIRD time.  Be very careful, my friends, because if you start Trout Mask at only the second lion roar, you will be sorry.  Go ahead, try it at the second roar and see what happens!!    This monumental record has received a lot of negative criticism over the years.  I find this to be simply ridiculous!!  There is no conclusive evidence that the album Trout Mask Replica was ever involved in our beloved Colts leaving Baltimore in the middle of the night those many years ago.  However, the Captain was spotted eating a tuna fish sandwich in the back of the Mayflower.  Stupid tuna are often mistaken for trout.  They are a trout REPLICA, if you will.  AH HA!!!  Now we're getting somewhere!!You see, those jerk Pilgrims always thought the Captain was a little strange.  They would ridicule Beefheart, and make him clean the grimy barnacles off of the bottom of the Mayflower.  The Captain was no idiot, so he soon was able to devise a mask that gave him supernatural powers with the sea creatures.  BEHOLD, THE TROUT MASK REPLICA WAS BORN!!!      With his new Trout Mask, our hero was able to fool those dumb tuna into eating all the barnacles off the bottom of the Mayflower BEFORE they could collect.  This made the Pilgrims oh so happy, and landed Captain Beefheart with a top Government position when they reached the mainland of North America.      Centuries later, with all those pesky Indians taken care of, our Captain finds himself as a top advisor to our Commander and Chief George W. Bush.  For the record, it should be noted that the Captain recommends a change to Queen Hillary Clinton in the near future.  After all, whom else but our Captain Beefheart could we trust to ensure that the BUSH-CLINTON-BUSH-CLINTON American Monarchy lives on for eternity???    FAST AND BULBOUS!!
B000F3T7RE|5.0|I heard this set of discs elsewhere. I tried to send them to my niece twice as a Christmas present in Paris, France. The delivery by U.P.S. was never accomplished owing to U.P.S. retuning the items to your warehouse too rapidly for my niece to arrainge delivery. I was nonetheless charged for one of these deliveries and just don't want to exhaust the energy to contest this charge, having tried that already. Be very sure that amazon won't spring back to life for my pocketbook.

B000A0GP4K|4.0|\\"Not as represented\\" is the phrase used when rating a seller on Amazon. <br /> <br />\\"No Direction Home\\" could be validly advertised as concentrating only on the earliest part of Dylan's long career.  If it is to be part of a continuing series on the artist, it would be fantastic.  But: <br /> <br />The first disk is fascinating.  The controversy with the folk purists takes up quite a bit of time. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the second disk deals with nothing but an old and unimportant controversy.  Fewer whining fans and more of Dylan's recent career would have been welcome.  Dylan's final impatience at the constant requests for his viewpoints on the whole silly business was very understandable.  It ends up being an older fan's documentary about music politics. <br /> <br />The man has moved on.  If this documentary was truly about a whole career, why, as my husband said, was there no \\"Blood on The Tracks\\"? <br /> <br />When Scorsese finishes the documentary he could just keep Dylan's performances on the second disk and flip the rest.  Considering the length of Dylan's career, he's probably going to need the disk space. <br /> <br />The first disk is a treasure -- probably the reason the second disk was such a disappointment.
B00005N5S5|5.0|For those who have read other reviews by yours truly, this will be review, but I divide science fiction into three categories:  true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.  Often, science horror could be called true science fiction, because it is based on what could happen.  However, true science fiction is focused more on the possibilities and human reaction, while the purpose of a science horror movie is to terrify you.  This movie will terrify you.<br /><br />This movie does an excellent job with its twists and turns in the plot; you will jump at least once by the time the movie is over.  Schwarzenegger is excellent as the villain, and Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn turn in good performances.  It also has a small role by Beth Motta, who I remember as being an exercise instructor for 20 Minute workout, an exercise program.<br /><br />One challenge in science fiction is dealing with time travel into the past.  This successfully achieves that goal.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.
0307237699|5.0|This is a food for thought masterpiece!The author's idea and vision for America and the world's politics is articulated broadly,and I hope it never stops with this book!I wish his idea could be translated into the audacity of hope and redemption!

Although it primarily focuses on real estate investments, the concepts presented can be applied to other areas as well.  I've purchased FOUR of these books (in addition to the one I purchased for myself) and have given them to many of my friends.<br /><br />Definitely a good read.  Bounds of helpful information.  Don't wait any longer and buy this book NOW!.
B00009RAJI|5.0|There's not much I can say about this album that hasn't already been said. It deserves every accolade it has gotten. It is truly a landmark album, and it has stood the test of time. <br /> <br />On the double CD, the original songs are carefully remastered and maintain the integrity of the original release. The addition of Silver Spring, the \\"B\\" side for the \\"Go Your Own Way\\" single, to the CD is a true revelation. It fits in perfectly. How in the world did this track not make the cut? <br /> <br />The bonus CD has some interesting stuff, but nothing essential. The remastering of the original album is the selling point here. If all you have is the CD that came out in the late 80's, you need to get this.
0618551050|4.0|This is a reasonably engaging book presenting a perspective on theoretical physics that has been rather under-represented in popular works. If you've read popular books advocating string theory and found them convincing, this book will give you a more balanced understanding of the theory's achievements and its limitations. Smolin argues that string theory is failing because it's an extension of the practical particle physics that has led to successes such as the Standard Model--an approach that has done so well, he says, that it's drowned out other avenues of research right at the moment when it has ground to a halt itself--and that what is needed now is more emphasis on re-examination of fundamental problems like spacetime and quantum mechanics. My views are almost opposite in a way (i.e. that the problem with string theory is that it isn't nearly practical enough), but Smolin is an expert whose opinion is worth reading. One point of irritation for me in the text is that I don't trust the analogies. Although I don't know the technical details of most of what he discussed, an analogy he made for something I do understand (fine tuning and the Higgs mechanism) appears to have nothing to do with the actual physics. The others could be better, but I can't tell. His discussion of the specifics of string theory is more balanced than in other books I've read, and that's what makes the book most useful in my view. The rest of his views are kind of out there, but interesting.

0767817648|3.0|I found it fitting that \\"Firefox\\" is recommended to accompany this film.  But there are differences.  An equally fitting choice to go along with this would be \\"War Games\\", which came out the same year and shared John Badham as the director.  What this and \\"War Games\\" have in common and don't have in common with \\"Firefox\\" or this reviewer is a distrust of our government.<br /><br />There are other things I didn't like about \\"Blue Thunder\\".  It had unnecessary R-rated language.  It had some sensuality that may entertain some, but it did not help me relate to or root for the characters.<br /><br />I will say that it did include Roy Sheider, who has always been one of my favorite actors.  Additionally, it introduced me to Daniel Stern, who I liked better in the \\"Home Alone\\" movies.  Furthermore, it was an exciting thriller, with good (though sometimes improbable) action.<br /><br />I'll close by commenting that it may be Badham saw or read \\"Firefox\\", and liked the concept of a super flying machine, but not liking the Russians being the bad guys, and remade the story to be more sleazy and to make the U.S. the villains.  Too bad.
1582701709|3.0|I was delighted to see the book at last and was very interested in being re-introduced to the law of attraction. It did answer the old conundrum as to why only some people profitted and others did not. However it could have said all that in a small tract. The repetition became boring.
B000050FEN|5.0|Two homicide detectives are on a desperate hunt for a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) whose crimes are based on the Seven Deadly Sins. The dark and haunting film takes viewers from the tortured remains of one victim to the next. The seasoned Det. Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to get inside the killer's mind, while his novice hotshot partner, Mills (Brad Pitt), scoffs at his efforts to unravel the case.David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet. Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor. You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective. David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul. We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.  <br />

B000K7VHQE|5.0|A thouroughly enjoyable movie.  My teenage children loved it too.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see a sneak preview of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" prior to its release in theatres & bought the dvd on the first day of its release. I've now bought several copies for all my fellow therapists at our mental health center.This family is the most loving, neurotic, wacky crew, and little Abigail Breslin has this true to life child presence that makes the urgency for the roadtrip from hell all the more credible. I haven't laughed this much since I first saw Robert Altman's \\"Nashville.\\" And this film is the pinnacle of intelligent comedy--their struggles to define their own and society's family values are truly thought-provoking and hilarious. Do not miss this one.
B000065V42|5.0|This movie has a cartoon proceeding it.  Actually, the part of the film that is not suitable for children happens to be the cartoon (Roger Rabbit).<br /><br />This was an excellent science fiction story.  It was thrilling, and well written.  There was one scene early in the movie that was forgotten, until a later scene, and then it sent chills down my spine knowing what was next.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Director Oliver Stone's stark satire of media and murder still generates controversy.Natural Born Killers looks at how America and the media become fascinated by the tabloids and serial killers. Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play a couple that goes on a three week killing spree. Every time they go on a rampage, they leave one person to tell the story of how things went down so that they could tell the media, and the media could immortalize them. Robert Downey Jr. plays an over the top reporter (perhaps because they are making fun of reporters) who only cares about covering the story. Tom Sizemore plays a crazy cop who's devoted himself to capturing the couple and Tommy Lee Jones plays the warden of a prison warden who wants to get some TV exposure not matter what. The acting was very good by Juliette Lewis and Woody Harrelson. However, Downey, Jones, and Sizemore's characters all seem to be way over the top, almost comical. This is probably due to the fact that Stone is satirizing the media and the police. I think they could have tone it down just a bit and still kept the over the top characters. The directing was great. The movie seamlessly moves from shots in film to shots with a camera to old video and back and forth. I don't know if anybody noticed this but it seemed that most of the shots of the actors, especially shots of Harrelson and Lewis, seemed to be slanted. I thought that was pretty cool. The visuals were perhaps my favorite part of the movie. The lighting was great. They changed colors of the lighting for different moods and atmospheres. The cuts of TV, old video, and all the madness was just haunting. The visuals for this movie will leave you stunned. This movie is definitely not for the squeamish.Quentin Tarantino script
B0002CHIJW|5.0|This is an awesome movie. It is the ultimate in drama. What those men did to that lady , humiliating her the way that they did. They got what they deserved. JUSTICE.

B00008973A|4.0|I purchased this a gift for a special friend as I know that she loves musicals and had this movie but only on video tape. When she first opened the gift she could nothing but squeal with delight and run around the office showing everyone with much excitment. She has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience. I myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre. Would only recommend for people who like Broadway shows and musicals. I'm glad I got this movie as a gift for her as I will now be remembered for many years to come.
0634049011|5.0|I am an intermediate level guitarist, and I think that the book is very good.

It is a different aproach to conventional learning, but for me it has faster results.<br /><br />If you want to learn the fretboard quickly and know how to build scales/chords and modes on the fly, I recommend this book!

I purposely didn't buy any individual seasons because I knew they would come out with something like this amazing package.  Buying it here on Amazon saves you a lot of money, rather than buying it from a store.  It's too bad they cancelled this show - I can think of a dozen directions they could have continued on and it makes me sad seeing John Spencer again, but he lives on through this compilation.

B000ICLHIE|3.0|It's got to be pretty clear to anyone with objectivity that amazon reviews are largely written by the choir.  I don't care whether it's trash from the likes of J. Timberlake or genius from an artist like Tom Waits.  As for this latest offering, I can only say that it could have been a classic 1 disc set (containing only the best songs, of course) or a pretty good 2 disc set.  The disc entitled \\"Bastards\\" is on the lean and forgettable side, with the other two having their moments in the sun.  Given the price, I'm hard pressed to think that it's really worth it.  As Frank Zappa once said, \\"all an artist has to do is fart and drop a drumstick and the audience will go wild\\"....or something close to that.

B000IU3XTM|4.0|Misery. It's an international language. So while the lyrics to \\"The Animals Were Gone\\" are delivered up in Damien Rice's soft Dublin tones, the plangent strings, hesitant melody and descending chords could just as easily accompany some French chanson in which the message is \\"je regrette\\".  <br />Melancholy is smeared liberally over this follow-up to Rice's spectacularly successful album \\"O\\".  <br />You would think that we would have had our fill of down-in-the-dumps singer-songwriters making semi-orchestral productions out of songs which would once have been strummed in the back rooms of pubs, but Rice has done pretty much what David Gray did with \\"Life In Slow Motion\\" - he has produced a work of such sincerity and quality that it transcends its genre.  <br />Best moment here is \\"Elephant\\", which begins with quiet voice and almost inaudible guitar, building in intensity to heartfelt keening and a rush of orchestra and percussion before dying back to a mumbling conclusion.  <br />Emotionally, it is as if Rice has climbed a mountain and fallen down the other side.  <br /> <br />

B00009V7T2|5.0|This is one of those truly mind-blowing albums that many people will need time to appreciate and understand.  It's quite epic, in the vein of Rush's 2112 album.  There's clearly a 70's prog-rock influence here, and it takes me back to some of Yes's 1970's work with a bit of King Crimson thrown in.  It's a well thought-out, sometimes manic, always tense, never resolved masterwork. <br /> <br />To those who listened to the first two tracks and gave up, come back and try another listen in a few months.  It took me almost three months before I could sit down and listen to the album the entire way through.  Now that I can, it's become one of my favorite albums of all time.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I love this movie and so does my cousin who I bought it for.

0740748475|5.0|What makes a comic great isn't the gags and the one-liners; it's the fact that you can empathize with the characters.  Almost everybody knows \\"Calvin\\" from somewhere, whether it's their own kid or someone else's (or, as in my case, I was pretty much Calvin).  Reading these comic strips is not only funny, but it's also nostalgic.  Watterson touches you in the same way that talking to an old friend or family member does.  His comic strips transport you back to your own childhood.  The only warning I have, is that you may want to work out before you order this set.  The volumes are a bit on the heavy side.

Don't believe me? Take a listen.

B000FVGMC4|3.0|\\"These Streets\\" is a collection of catchy songs that will immediately entertain, but quickly leave the listener unsatisfied. Nutini's raspy voice is one of his greatest assets, and yet it is the albums achille's heel. While this distinctive sound sets his music apart from the mass of pop singers, it also evokes a comparison to folksingers whose textured vocals indicate simple profundities. This comparison only highlights the musical and lyrical immaturity of the young Nutini.
B00001OH1S|5.0|The CD was brand new, and I love the songs, it came in the mail extremley fast, even though it was a week before Christmas.
1401308201|4.0|If you are looking for a book with extras about \\"Wicked: The Musical,\\" then this is the book for you.  The images that accompany the text are crisp and colorful and, for Joey Mac fans, there's even a Fiyero centerfold.  Composition clippings, quotes, and even a how-to section on Elphie's dance are included, along with information from/about the various performers who portrayed each character.  This volume really gives the reader a sense of the show from inception to production.  <br /> <br />That being said, the book has one shortcoming: no libretto (script).  The main songs and moments are included; however, the full libretto does not appear in the book.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), is an artist who loves to draw, is a nice man, and he is also a poor man that wins two tickets to the Titanic, \\"This was a ship that was unsinkable.\\" Everyone wanted to go on because it was like a dream come true. Rose (Kate Winslet), her mother Ruth (Frances Fishers), and Caledon (Billy Zane), Rose's fiancé, are first class passengers on the ship. Rose is a lady that lets her mother torture her by telling her what to do and her fiancé Caledon is a very jealous man. When Jack took this experience of going into this ship he found love. When Rose and Jack meet each other in this ship, they immediately start to like each other. Not only do you see love and romance, but there are also other things that are going to happen in this movie, including violence. <br />The Titanic is a grabbing and sad movie. If you get to see this movie you better bring some tissues, because the dialogue will bring you to tears, \\"Whatever happens to me Rose, I want you to safe yourself, and I want you to get married, and have lots and lots of kids,\\" and Rose says, \\"Jack, don't say that I'll never let go of you, you are the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to me, I love you Jack.\\" <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch sad movies and to anyone who is interested in the history behind to the Titanic and the suffering people had to endure. <br /> <br />
B00005V3Z4|1.0|This Movie Sucks. I don't recommend this movie to nobody. Only watch this movie if your having trouble sleeping. Donnie Darko should of been called Donnie boring cause that's what it is. The critics said it was nail biting, well they're right, I was biting my nails to keep myself entertained. Is It me or did this movie have 30 endings. Donnie Darko sounds like a SUPERHERO, but It was far from a SUPERMOVIE. Don't Rent It, Don't Buy It, Don't Try It.
0393327655|5.0|In this book Sam Harris makes the single most important contribution to western religious thought so far. If the world has to survive a religion-inspired, human-engineered apocalyptic catastrophe then it must heed the message of this book. An alarmingly large section of humanity is today being driven under the intoxicating influence of two \\"great\\" religions, Christianity and Islam. Both of these share the same \\"great\\" flaw, the insistence on the uncritical acceptance of unverifiable belief by everyone without exception, to the exclusion of all other contrary or non-conforming ways of thought and life. Both are ruthlessly dedicated to self-preservation and relentlessly committed to self-expansion at the cost of every other religion, culture and civilization. This drive, this zeal, this all-consuming blind \\"faith\\" is exactly that... all-consuming. Hatred, intolerance and violence are the offspring of these religions. In the name of harmony they breed disharmony, in the name of unity they impose homogeneity, and in the name of righteousness they oppress their own believers as well as other non-believers. There is only one antidote to this disease of aggressive monotheistic fanaticism, which is to cure the human organ that it infects: the mind. Harris' book can be a potent and necessary antidote to this self-destructive poison that is flowing through the veins of humanity, at a stage when it seems capable of pointing the carbon-fuel greased, nuclear-powered barrel at it's own head and pulling the trigger, either in a paroxysm of impotent Islamic rage at imagined persecution by those it considers to be undeservingly more powerful than the pious faithful, or in the ecstatic throes of a coming Armageddon heralding the approach of a world-destroying savior.
B00005N915|4.0|Here's a movie that combines suspense, creepiness, and violence. It's shortly after World War II. A New York detective goes in search of a missing person, on behalf of a mysterious client who claims that this person owes him a huge debt.  The detective makes his way to New Orleans, visiting a world that is now mostly gone.  Like Chinatown, this movie takes you to places that you never imagined at the beginning.  The end is unforgettable.  And the music is not only good, but enhances the peculiar, atmospheric quality of this strange film.
068981528X|5.0|clever and unexpected --- a brilliant book. I wish there were more children's books like this.
B0000009TK|5.0|This is by far the most ambitious and amazing iconoclastic brilliance any and every living functional human and non-human could possibly ingest/digest... or be lucky enough to have been exposed to...even the roots of trees have heard this masterpiece and have died in awe of such ridiculous mastery. Not a person on this planet with 3/4 of a brain (anything less could not fathom what on earth this is about) would/could possibly give this anything but 5 stars. Flawless in every respect/aspect, from Thunes' amazing deep thunder, to Wackerman's insatiable rhythm/chops, Ike Willis' genius........... possibly the cure of cancer itself...
6305079811|5.0|This is not a film that can be made any more, at least I don't think it can. It was a style of filmmaking that is dead. The secret is the filmmakers did not know it was campy, they thought it was cutting edge. They thought this was a Star Wars type film back when it was made. The secret to true campy films are the ignorance of the filmmakers and the tacky styles, odd juxtaposition of actors, crazy dialogue, nutty stories, bizarre landscapes. Peter Wyngared as klytus is the crowning jewel of this film.<br /><br />I could go one forever about this brilliant film. I am glad I have the DVD. it's crazy it is not available on DVD any more. Criterion should put this film out on HD DVD or BLU RAY.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Love the CD.  It is wonderful to hear the Carpenter's again.  Karen's beautiful voice brings tears, but also much enjoyment.  I am approximately her age, so it takes me back decades.  Thanks for carrying this product.  I will enjoy it every Christmas.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I thought this movie was very well done. The scientific evidence definitely points in the direction of global warming; however, industry does not want to take any responsibility for adding to the problem.  What ever may be a \\"cycle\\" of warming, the pressures of man definitely are adding to the mix. If industry does not wake up and start working for some sort of relief from these pressures the CEO's and politicians can just sit back and count their millions as the waters and temperatures rise.
B000K6NZPG|4.0|This book recounts an amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and the will to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson, and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, attempted to ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit, tragedy struck when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, fell and hit a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and shattering his right heel. Beneath him was a seemingly endless fall to the bottom.<br /><br />When Simon reached him, they both knew that the chances for getting Joe off the mountain were virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashioned a daring plan to do just that. For the next few hours, they worked in tandem through a snowstorm, and managed a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain.<br /><br />About three thousand feet down, Joe, who was still roped to Simon, dropped off an edge and found himself now free hanging in space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge was over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a crevasse lay about a hundred feet directly below him.<br /><br />Joe could not get up, and Simon could not get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles. This is an absorbing read and one of the great stories in mountaineering literature.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This could be a wonderful product but the rechargable battery is a very big problem. Like so many others who have written reviews, I have had problems with the battery not holding a charge in a sweeper that is less than six months old. Calling the company does absolutely no good so don't even bother.Both the rep and her supervisor told me that because they are not the manufacturer,they cannot offer any guarantee at all for the battery - BUT that they will replace it,if I pay for it. In other words, I have to buy a new one!! This is definitely a fly-by-night outfit so save your money by not buying a product that the company won't even stand behind.
0307237699|5.0|Excellent read. There's an undeniable humility in Mr. Obama too often absent from most public figures.  I found this particular piece to be a good read, and a thoughtful effort.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Stellar presentation of one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. Period. When it was originally released I paid more than $50 at a big-box store but I only paid $30 through Amazon for a gift box set for a friend this past holiday season. A truly awesome price.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary is a must have product that you should show your family and friends. It's also a great gift. The film is very educational and explains global warming scientifically but in a very easy way to understand. I strongly recomend!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie is one that has never grown old to me, and I watch it faithfully every year.  I was so pleased to see that it is offered in DVD format now.  I would recommend \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" to everyone.

B000062XGF|4.0|Bought the DVD after watching The Thomas Crown Affair, I happened to find out that Entrapment belongs to an higher and different rank. Connery and Zeta Jones are amazing in their roles, they give a very believable performance as thieves, of course helped by a sophisticated and well written plot and a perfect choice of music. The capers are very inventive and suggest an accurate research by the writers, even the romantic part is handled with such a grace that almost you don't see the huge age gap between the characters. If you have not seen the movie yet, as it happened to me, you will be pleased and entertained by both the movie itself and the extras, which as usual are always too few for a movie like this.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The price of the DVD is worth it just for \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" (at Knebworth). In my opinion, THE best performance of the two discs. You'll never see something that intense again. Watching Jimmy Page is the main highlight - his playing is intense, sexy, and SO freaking good. He's having the time of his life up there. During the solo, you start to wonder if him and his guitar should get a room and just get it over with already.  <br /> <br />This is what passion for music is all about. They have some sort of telepathy on stage. Greatest concert footage ever, of any band, of all time. It helps that they were also the greatest band ever.
B00005LC1H|4.0|It was a delight, the price was right, the DVD was top quality and it arrived a few days after the purchase order went in. I watch the sit-coms every other day. Its always fresh. <br /> <br />I would recommend this DVD set to all who like comedy.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|I must confess, I bought Pet Sounds out of curiosity, since it has been ranked as one of the best albums in history, behind the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper.    In addition, I also confess that before Pet Sounds I had very limited knowledge of the Beach Boys and/or Brian Wilson's music and after playing it once I sincerely say:  PET SOUNDS IS INDEED A MASTERPIECE CRAFTED BY A GIFTED ARTIST !!!. <br /> <br />The 40th Anniversary edition comes with a wonderful DVD that documents the making of this album through interviews and original footage, plus a video showing a visit Sir George Martin made to Brian Wilson's home.  <br /> <br />This album is a MUST-HAVE for music fans, and I totally agree with Sir Paul McCartney's views on this album (printed on the CD's booklet), expressing that \\"NOBODY IS TRULY MUSICALLY EDUCATED WITHOUT LISTENING TO PET SOUNDS\\"
B000CNFC76|4.0|This is one of the most inspiring movies! It is a true story that transends all ages. A rare movie, with no foul language or sexual overtones. I recommend it highly for everyone, especially, for young folk who need to learn that that the difficulties of life can be overcome.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is easily my favorite Christmas CD, and I've collected many over the years.  I bought this for myself, and then received it as a gift so I gave it to my sister too, who also loves it.

0802130208|5.0|Here it is: <br /> <br />A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES <br /> <br /> Now, I bet none of you chirrin ever known a person so useless as my son Ignatius.  He's a very smart boy, ya know, but he doesn't do nothin' for his poor mamma, an' he's already thirty years by now! <br /> Well, anyway, I'm Irene Reilly, one of them stars in A Confederacy of Dunces.  The nice man who written it is John Kennedy Toole.  Now, this book is all about poor Ignatius and me, and it starts when we go off to the doctor to check my darn arthuritis elbow.  I go in there alone an after buyin' us some food, I see my poor son is bein harrassed by some po-lice man for no good reason!  Well after we get outta there an have a couple a brandys at the Night of Joy, I accidently hit a building with that darn car!  An we did a thousand twenty dollars of damage!  So then I tells Ignatius he gotta get hisself a job because there is NO way we is gonna be able to pay that off.  All he does is sit in his ol' bedroom writin' things, so I'm thinkin' he oughta use his time good, ya know?   <br /> So my baby goes an gets hisself a job as one of them office people at Levi Pants.  I like him havin' a real job an' all, but he shoulda gotten a better one, given all the college he been through.  He meeted a real nice ol' lady called Miss Trixie there, an' all she wanted is to retire!  There's a lil' bit of her story in that book, too. <br /> So, Ignatius somehow gets hisself fired from that place, somethin' about gettin' the factory workers to revolt an' writin' a mean letter to a custermer.  Then he gets hisself a position sellin' hotdogs!  An' for this darn job, he wore hisself a pirate costume!  Can you chirrin imagine how embarrasin that was for his poor mamma? <br /> Now, bout this time, my friend Santa hooked me up with a nice man called Claude, an' he's way rich enough to get us a thousand twenty real easy.  I like him okay, but I jus dunno.  Ignatius have a girlfriend once called Myrna, an' them two send letters still.  I hoped they get together sometime.   <br /> Now, this ain't all that happenin' in that book.  Poor Ignatius gets in real trouble with Levi Pants, an' they try an' track him down!  An' then he gets hisself mixed up with an orphan carryin' mystery packages!  There's also parts in that story about them people workin' at that Night of Joy bar, that po-lice officer that tried to arrest my boy, Mr. an' Mrs. Levi, an' o'course, all them other troubles Ignatius gets hisself into!  Now, I can' go round tellin' you chirrin the whole story!  But I will tell you that near that end, my friend Santa is tryin' to get me to marry Claude an' send my Ignatius to that Charity Hospital.  An, my poor boy gets hisself attacked by a canary at the bar!  You is gonna have to read that book to find it out about all that excitin stuff! <br /> Anyways, I like that book jus' because it seem so funny to people, how Ignatius get hisself in so many troubles.  There is a lot a differen' people stories in there, an' that keeps it real interestin'.  The real challengin' bit of that book was understandin' poor Ignatius's journal, because he uses all sorts a big words, ya know. <br /> Well, anyway, I gonna read ya jus the beginning of that book, an I love that part because it describes my poor Ignatius so well.  Here we go... (in book) <br />  Anyway, if I got to give that book a ratin' from one to ten, I would give it a nine.  I like this one a lot jus because its so funny.  I recommend it to all you, but you oughta be warned there are some things in that book that you maybe shouldn't be readin as such young chirrin.   <br /> This story takes place in New Orleans in a part of the city where not many people have a lot of money.  The Reillys are poor, just like the rest of their community.  Mrs. Reilly is not very educated, but she saved up all of her money to put Ignatius in college.  He is one of the most educated people in his city.  Due to the fact that not many of the citizens have gone to school much, there are not very good jobs around.  Ignatius cannot find a high paying job, so he has to work with people who do not really know what they are doing. <br /> This book is set in the early sixties time period, so there is a lot of racism going on.  One of the characters, named Jones, is a victim of this prejudice.  He is a black man who keeps getting wrongly accused of crimes by the police.  He has a job at a bar, where his pay is below minimum wage.  He only keeps the job because his boss threatens to get the police to arrest him.  His character represents the black population of New Orleans and shows how badly they were treated. <br />There ain't a real sequel to this here book, since that poor author commited suicide, but I'll read you what I think them liner notes would look like if there was one. <br /> This novel, a continuation of A Confederacy of Dunces, is a must read for fans of the huge Ignatius J. Reilly.  Ignatius and his girlfriend Myrna Minkoff are on the run from the Charity Hospital officials and trying to make some money.  They meet some extremely strange characters throughout their travels and get quite a few people wanting them in jail.  Mrs. Reilly is worried sick about Ignatius and busy is making preparations for her wedding.  All she wants is to have her boy back for her special day.  Her fiancé, Claude, is being very nice, but she can't help but notice how reluctant he now seems about getting married.  This book is just as hilarious as it's prequel.  You will be astounded by the wild imagination of the brilliant John Kennedy Toole, and the uproarious antics of Ignatius and Myrna.  This book is too to ingeniously funny to pass up. <br /> <br /> <br />Source Citation: <br /> Toole, John Kennedy.  A Confederacy of Dunces.

B000GY729M|4.0|First of all it's a 3.5 stars rating and sorry for my english. <br />It's certainly not the best record of the last 20 years as the  singer claims and it's not so different from their previous effort but it's enjoyable from start to finish. My highlights are songs 3,4,5,6,10,11 with special mention to \\"Read my mind\\" (it's the perfect commercial pop song you don't have to feel ashamed for liking it cause it's damn great) and to the occasional off key singing ( in an era that praises over the top, glass-shattering voices it's always refreshing to find someone who seems to be singing and having some fun too).  <br />So it's not that original but it's good, especially when you drive to go to work.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|On my recent trip to my in-laws for Christmas, I got the opportunity to see quite a few movies with my nieces and nephews. Chicken Little was on the DVD player, so I had the opportunity to watch it.<br /><br />Chicken Little is Disney's first fully rendered computer graphics animation, throwing in its hat to compete with the Pixar folks (who once worked with Disney, but no longer).  Now that these kinds of movies have become ubiquitous--see any movies about talking fuzzy animals lately?--there's actually a standard to compare these films.  Unfortunately for the competition, Pixar has set the bar very high.<br /><br />We all know the story: the eponymous Chicken Little (Zach Braff, he of Scrubs fame) is outside playing when a piece of the sky hits him on the head. Freaking out in grand fashion, Chicken Little proceeds to tell everyone that the sky is falling.  Only it isn't, and Little kind of looks like a fool, because he overreacted.  It wasn't actually a piece of the sky falling, you see. And thus we have a simple fairy tale similar to the boy crying wolf: Don't overreact to potentially bad news, or people won't believe you when there IS bad news.<br /><br />That's the first five minutes of Chicken Little.<br /><br />Moving forward in time, we see that Chicken Little has it rough.  His mom is nowhere to be found, and his exasperated dad, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall), tries to keep up with his son's eccentricities.  A huge geek, Chicken Little suffers a host of indignities that life throws at him (nearly getting run over, getting pummeled in dodgeball, losing his pants, the list goes on and on) but Little overcomes them with cheerful ingenuity.  Facing the thousand cuts of school along with Little are his friends Abby Mallard AKA the Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusak), the very fat pig known as Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and the weird Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina). Their arch nemesis is Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris).<br /><br />All Chicken Little really wants to do is make his dad proud. So he joins a baseball team and, like a typical feel-good coming-of-age sports parable, makes the winning play and earns the love of friends, family, and the community.  It's like a film within a film.<br /><br />Then the sky falls again. Finally, Chicken Little switches to the actual plot: a War of the Worlds-style invasion by aliens.  Of course.<br /><br />So what exactly is wrong with an underdog character overcoming an alien invasion, the prejudices of the community, poor past judgment, and did I mention an alien invasion?<br /><br />TOO ADULT.  Whereas the Pixar films speak to both adults and kids, Chicken Little talks down to kids and throws in stupid slapstick that feels pointless, just to keep the little ones entertained.  Then it adds in awkward adult scenes in parts where it doesn't make sense. Do we really need a romance (and a kiss!) between Abby and Little? Or Runt singing, \\"If You Wanna Be My Lover\\"? Worse, many of the in-jokes are very dated.<br /><br />TOO UGLY.  Pixar characters are undeniably cute, be it a fish, a car, an ant, or a toy.  Chicken Little is an ugly little toad; his feathers look like spines, his eyes are beady, and he has a tiny beak for his massive head.  Runt is grossly overweight, Abby is literally an ugly duckling, Fish Out of Water is completely nuts...these are not characters you readily connect with.  Braff's voice acting goes a long way in making Little a likable character, but it takes awhile.<br /><br />TOO SCI-FI.  I actually liked this movie a lot, once I realized it was a riff on War of the Worlds.  How often do CGI cartoon characters run screaming from aliens?  Okay, they did it in Jimmy Neutron too. The problem is that Chicken Little switches abruptly from a cute morality play to terrifying invasion scenario that involves characters getting zapped out of existence.  They all turn out to be okay later, of course, but it sure as heck looks like the aliens killed the cute characters.<br /><br />That said,my niece and nephews watched it twice.  All three of them (my twelve-year-old nephew, seven-year-old niece, and my three-year-old godson) loved it. So perhaps where Chicken Little fails in its pseudo-appeal to adults, it succeeds with the kids.  Or maybe they just like to see a fat pig run from alien tripods.rs.  <br /> <br />That said, my niece and nephews watched it twice.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|Visually, I was amazed at what they did with this film. I thought theatrically it was extremely well thought out and put together. It was truly an enjoyment to watch.  <br />Musically, I must admit, there was much left to be desired. I had to keep in mind throughout, that these were actors, and not necessarily accomplished musicians, and it well shows. There was not one role that was decently cast in the entirity of the production. Christine's vocals are sub-standard at best, and the Phantom had best stick to non musical roles. The only tolerable singer was Raoul, and marginally at that.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|I bought this for someone (who is a fan of UFO)as a gift. They handed back to me and told me to listen to it- since for some reason, I'd never  paid any attention to any of their music before.  I was always a fan of  <br />Led Zepplin, music like that, but after hearing Michael Schenker, What can I say, clear, pure clean notes that just punch a hole right into your soul and blow you away. If youre shopping for, or are a Deep Purple or Ritchie Blackmore fan, this is a must. I would pay more than this CD costs just to hear - Rock Bottom. And Phil Moggs awesom vocals.. He actually has a beautiful voice. You wont be diasapointed!
B000002UCE|5.0|I'm so glad to have purchased this CD.  It's been long enough since I've heard it to serve as a great reminder of what a talented man John Lennon was.  His music is beautiful yet raw, simple yet sophisticated.  This album has stood the test of time very well.
0553278398|5.0|I am dubious of prequels, mainly because I have found them to be less than entertaining, mainly thanks to the Star Wars films; however I must admit Prelude to Foundation was my favorite of the Foundation series. Part of this may be because I endeavored to read the books in chronological order as opposed to their order of publication. I found the book to be the most exciting of the entire series, abandoning the often-used collection of short stories format in favor of a continuous ongoing tale. <br />Prelude to Foundation takes place, of course, well before Foundation, and some time before Forward the Foundation, and finds The Galactic Empire at the Height of its power and Hari Seldon trying to perfect his theory of Psychohistory -- a way of predicting future events through mathematical calculation. This is a theory that Seldon's peers of course find ludicrous, but which gains the attention of the Emperor (Psychohistory would, of course, be valuable to an Empire that wished to retain its power). But there are apparently other forces that do not wish for Seldon's theory ever to ess fruition, and so begins a chase accross worlds with a twist ending that reveals the return of a recurring character from some of Asimov's previous works. <br />I actually liked this book better than the original Foundation. I understand they will be doing a movie based on Foundation some time in the near future. If so, this is the model I would like to see them use. This was by far my favorite of the series.
0307277887|1.0|I fell in love with the Showtime series \\"Dexter\\" from the first episode. I was so impressed by the basic concept and Hall's brilliant portrayal of a CSU blood splatter expert being a serial killer - and perhaps the only one with a conscience. I was very happy to learn that the series was adapted from a book rather than directly screen story to screenplay. I rushed out to buy \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" and settled in with anticipation of a great read. I was shocked to find the book devoid of the depth and characterizations found on the program, and that about 90% of the show's plot was the invention of Showtme's screenwriters.  This book was so shallow, devoid of action with a plodding empty plot, lacked anything that could grab the reader's imagination - or interest, and had  virtually no appeal.  SticK with the Showtime series \\"Dexter\\" and forget the books in the 'DDD' titled Dexter series. A major disappointment.

0451191153|5.0|In \\"The Fountainhead,\\" Ayn Rand discusses the philosophy which was most important to her and should be most important to you.  The power of the inividual and the independent nature of him, she argues, is the base of all subsequent motions one will make in life.<br /><br />She argues very eloquently, through characters that entice you, disgust you, and enamour you, that reason is the only thing that man can rely on.  Often, she says, men are just a shell containing the opinions of others.<br /><br />More to the point than \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this novel is the foundation for Rand's other theories and is a masterpiece in its own right.

0618680004|3.0|The book makes points that are allready obvious to anyone that has done any independent thinking and is not brought up in a religious enviornment.<br /><br />Dawkin's is not very objective here either, though his arguments are logically presented, he is simply too close to the subject. He is much too emotionally involved too simply state his argumnets more simply and without his constant personal diggresions from the point at hand.<br /><br />He has a very personal axe to grind against religion and it pours off of every page. This tends to obscure and dilute what could have been a better book and a better more concise argument for atheism.<br /><br />Personally, I do not refer to myself as an athesist as I am not a deist.<br /><br />Of course being a man of science myself I do not believe in any traditional God (long white beard, a judger of individuals etc) but Dawkins is a partial theist in that he is a very devote atheist. He seems to miss or over look this point though.<br /><br />However, this is a good book to someone new to these ideas and to having a rational attitude towards religions. It's greatest flaws flow directly from Dawkin's personal zealotry that clouds his mind and judgement on occasion.<br /><br />But, on balance, it is worth the read anyway. First as an example of how an articulate and very well educated scientist can let his own emotional \\"world view\\" twist even the best arguments into something \\"personal\\" and thus distort the scientifc method for his own purposes and (2) For someone who is not familar with the arguments presented and the true nature of the fallacy and mythology of man's dogmatic religions.

1881273156|5.0|I really appreciated this book's perspective that to get your message of love across, you have to be speaking the right language. It's not about just doing your same old thing harder, it's about understanding how your partner takes in things and communicating how they need to hear it. This book helped me see that my partner needed more Words of Affirmation. If yours does too, I strongly recommend you get a new little book called WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU (by Kate and David Marshall) and give it to him/her as a gift. It will make him/her very, very happy.

I would BEG that these guys, George and Giles Martin, make it their life-long obsession to re-master all of the great recordings of yesteryear.  The combination of today's technology,  the Martin's ears and hearts, and great music from years gone by, has produced a recording that stands ALONE as THE standard for ALL future recordings, be they originals or re-masterings of past artists.

B000000IUK|5.0|Note: this is a review of the MFSL Gold CD version of The Joshua Tree.<br /><br />Since many other reviewers have amply debated the artistic merits of this album (the phrase, \\"beating a dead horse,\\" comes to mind), I'll direct my review solely to those people considering purchasing the MFSL version, who might be wondering if it offers any sonic improvement over the standard CD version of the album, and, if so, if those improvements are worth the price of purchase.<br /><br />There is no question that the sound on this MFSL release is an improvement over that on the Island Records CD, still featuring the original 1987 mastering, done when the album was first released.  However, the improvements on the MFSL disc are subtle.  The most noticeable difference between the two discs upon first listen is the difference in volume; the MFSL disc is decidedly louder.  I decided to rip a few tracks from both CDs into waveform and then compare them in a wave editor to see just how much louder the MFSL disc is.  The MFSL's signal gain is roughly 50% greater than that of the original CD.  If one were to compare the two discs without compensating for the difference in volume, that difference would contribute to the perception of improved sound quality in the Gold version.  This perception is not entirely inaccurate, however; the signal-to-noise ratio on the original version is lower, and by increasing the volume of the original version to match that of the Gold version, one is also increasing the base noise level.  There is noticeably less background noise on the Gold version, even when played at higher volume levels.  This helps present a cleaner sound picture.  That aside, once I compensated for the volume difference, I really had to focus closely to hear the differences in sound between the two discs.  The MFSL disc has consistently cleaner, more focused, more dynamic sound than the original, and generally sounds like a higher quality mastering, but those differences presented themselves to my ears only upon close listening on good equipment.  In many \\"real world\\" listening situations, the differences will be subtle, to say the least, and quite possibly unnoticeable.<br /><br />The MFSL mastering does not improve the basic quality of the recording or the mix, which is still dense with atmospherics and highly ambient.  Reviewers who complain about the sound quality of the original disc and blame it on old mastering techniques may have missed the mark: U2 specifically asked engineer Flood for this kind of sound (as he explained in the \\"making of\\" DVD), and as such, I suspect a lot of what is considered poor mastering is actually intrinsic to the original recording.  The MFSL version does not alter that.  It just presents a slightly cleaner, more accurate version of a rather murky soundscape.<br /><br />So, is it worth getting?  Cost and availability notwithstanding, this is definitely the better CD version of the album to have.  However, those expecting miraculous improvements might find themselves disappointed.  The diminishing returns theory applies here: you will spend a lot for incrementally slight improvements.  Moreover, Island Records can't hold out forever; one of these days, they'll likely issue a remastered version of The Joshua Tree, one which most likely will improve on MFSL's nearly two-decades old mastering, for a much lower purchase price.  Until that time comes, the MFSL version is the best one out, but given the cost, I suspect only collectors or those whose ears are extremely particular would find it to be a worthy investment.emselves to my ears only upon close listening on good equipment.

B000EGDAI4|1.0|Wait until this album is reissued again.  It would be a shame for anyone to buy this and get the wrong impression.  The masters for this reissue are apparently poor on the 4th track Moritat.  Returning it to Amazon won't help, the disk is fine, the master is bad.  Concord (or perhaps some other company with a little more attention to quality control) should recall these, remaster it and try again.

B00005JPDP|5.0|Mesmermerizing, often perplexing, and surreal, 'Pefume: The Story of a Murderer' is more than a keen study in the sense of smell.  It methodically wraps a story around key players that both transcend and embrace class and sensual experience.  What strikes me throughout this film is how different it is from other movie outings.   <br /> <br />We start with a French baby who is born in Paris in the greatest of squalor.  His mother abandons him and lives him to rot on the streets.  She is caught and sent to the gallows, but his fate is to be sent to an orphanage where the children almost make a second attempt at the death penalty.  He's Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), and he soon discovers coming of age that he is different.  Not only is he a pariah, but he harbors a strong sense of smell that is only associated with animals.  It becomes clear that not only does it become his main sensory operandi to detect things and people, but, it is his last piece of dignity, so he lives his whole life wanting to preserve every smell he comes across on the planet.  Director Tom Tykwer makes every image stand out, so we can see, hear, and, well, almost smell, everything Jean-Baptiste does.  I felt my mind's filing cabinet filling in the blanks.  What they don't provide, we easily fill in the gaps, but what they do provide is an especially sensual visual and listening experience.  Much of 'Perfume...' is exquisite.  So if it is smell, like himself, he wishes to preserve, his highest pursuit will be for \\"the scent of a woman\\".  He can't rise above that in 18th century France until he comes upon a famed Italian perfumer living in Paris, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman).  Delivering hides from a tannery not known for health benefits, Jean-Baptiste begs Baldini for a chance to work for him.  Here he can work on extra-curricular projects that will attempt to satisfy his olfactory palette for preserving every scent.  It's a tempestuous relationship at times, but it is Jean's portal to encountering wealthy women who wear the scents, like the one's Guiseppe is perveyor for.  In a tragic scene Jean-Baptiste encounters a woman, and, frightening her, he restrains her, so she won't cry out.  He is overly zealous and kills her inadvertently.  <br /> <br />After that the lingering fragrance of the movie is to trace and bottle the scent of a woman.  There's a scene where a red-haired woman is cutting apricots in two.  It is hallmark.  I was expecting an overflow of sexuality, but what I got was sensuality that was effective like few films are.  The rest of the movie takes many turns; many of which I didn't expect.  I am still pondering the repurcussions of this film.  The only film I can think of that remotely reminds me of 'Perfume' is 'Chocolat'.  It is an odd and unique bird.  While I am satisfied with the lingering effects of 'Perfume,' it isn't all neat and tidy.  Perhaps that's what makes it so rare and special...The film I mean.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I must admit I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie, but when it was over I was very impressed with what I saw. This is one movie that will make you question just what is really a trick, and what has happened in the story itself.<br /><br />The Illusionist tells the story about a young man simply named Eisenheim [Edward Norton] who leaves audiences of his shows in total amazement and awe at his spellbinding tricks and illusions in many shows in Vienna. His shows are so well acclaimed that he sparks the interest of the crown prince, Leopold [Rufus Sewell] and his fiance. [Jessica Biel]<br /><br />At first the crown prince believes that Eisenhiem is no threat, but after his fiance and Eisenheim realize that they were once childhood friends [maybe even more] Leopold believes his marriage is in danger. Paul Giamatti costars as the city's chief inspector who at first believes Eisenheim is a great magician who is there just to entertain, but starts to question his own judgement on the magician, especially after a terrible crime is committed and he has to judge between what the facts are and what he truly believes is the truth.<br /><br />This is a dark film through most of the 109 minutes of this film, in more ways than one. Not only do the characters talk in hushed and toned down voices through most of this movie, but a lot of the magic acts take place in a darkly lit theater, with candlelight and hushed voices adding to the dramatic effect of one of Eisenheim's acts. There are also a few clues to the past of Eisenheim as a boy, which are just as interesting and curious as one of his fantastic acts, such as how he really became a magician in the first place.<br /><br />As for the ending, I will not give it away, but I will say I was absolutely caught off guard with how it ended. Perhaps you will be able to see what I did not, but maybe thats because i absolutely suck at predicting endings of movies, its a big weakness for me!<br /><br />There are also a couple of reviews below mine that rip into this movie and how the characters cannot act with one another...I disagree with that 100%. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are great as always, I dont think there is anyone who can deny Norton as a great actor [just look at Fight Club and American History X] as for Paul Giamatti, Cinderella Man anyone? Jessica Biel also passes with her performance, and Leopold was good too, although I found his outbursts of anger a little laughable [just my opinion]<br /><br />Extras on this DVD include:<br /><br />Feature Audio Commentary by the director Neil Burger<br /><br />The Making of the Illusionist<br /><br />and a segment with Jessica Biel who talks about the movie herself.<br /><br />This is a great movie to see at least once, it has drama, even humor, a great cast of actors and actresses, and an ending that will show you as it says on the DVD cover...Nothing is what it seems.are also a couple of reviews below mine that rip into this movie and how the characters cannot act with one another...I disagree with that 100%.

0743487486|4.0|I am an educator and have read several of Mr. Kohn's books geared for educators so I was intrigued at the prospect of a book on parenting. I find his idea's quite interesting as I always enjoy having my beliefs challenged. In fact, despite some of the negative reviews posted here, much of what he discusses in the book has merit and has changed the way my wife and I talk to our 2.5 year old. It does make sense that constant praise for every little thing can, in the long run, be just as damaging as the effects of some of the consequences and punishments parents use.  While we may not agree 100% with everything he writes, if you are willing to question why we discipline the way we do and how our kids perceive that discipline, this book is definitely worth a read.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Why this movie got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture is beyond me. On the positive side a number of reviewers have picked up on what I have been saying all along, Little Miss Sunshine is little more than a reworking of National Lampoon's Vacation. On the negative side, many people who claim to never patronize \\"mainstream\\" movies (like Vacation), love Little Miss Sunshine, after all it's an \\"art house flick\\", one must like it.<br /><br />The end result being a VERY dark comedy, with little social redemption.<br /><br />PS If you want to see a great \\"indie/art house\\" movie about a family at a crossroads, check out, Brooklyn Lobster, a great movie that did not become \\"the movie one must see to be in\\" (see my review).<br />Ken

B0001VTPWM|5.0|The rating is for the overall package you get here. Now I don't need to go into details, as you already know what Robocop is all about. You get all three Robocop movies with excellent picture and sound in one nicely put package.  The first one is the unrated cut.  A lot of people don't really care for the sequals, but I think they are ok.  I liked part three, two was ok. The thing I like about this trilogy is the continuity.  The other one picks up where the previous one left off,a nd you still see the characters from the old ones.Excellent trilogy.  Great presentation, great price.  Get it now before it becomes rare.

B0008ENHUI|5.0|I've been a fan of this film since it came out in theaters, and PAPILLON continues to impress and inspire with each subsequent viewing.  In my opinion, this is Steve McQueen's absolute best role as Henri Charriere, a man wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life at Devil's Island in brutal French Guiana, South America.  Henri, also known as \\"Papillon\\" (due to the tattoo of a butterfly on his chest), is determined to escape--even though the consequences of getting caught entail solitary confinement under the harshest conditions.  Papillon escapes, and is caught and punished, escapes again, is caught and punished even more severely, and once he is banished to Devil's Island--an impenetrable rock amidst a fierce sea--his yearning for freedom is still not diminished.<br /><br />McQueen shows some impressive range; stoic and rather one-dimensional in most of his other roles, the actor delivers a considerable variety  of emotions.  Dustin Hoffman is equally exceptional as Dega, Papillon's humble and unassuming friend.  Based on a true story, director Franklin J. Schaffner has made a masterpiece about the indomitable will of the human spirit.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON

B0007M22TI|5.0|I had fallen in love with these songs while listening to the CD for awhile, but watching these songs being performed on DVD adds a whole new dimension to the music. These ladies are each fantastic musicians, and the production and orchestration of the actual live concert was top notch. If you like this type of music, BUY THIS DVD.<br /><br />Now, I have read other comments here complaining about the music being lip-sync'd on the DVD, and find that I must comment on this. I have done audio/visual production work at live concerts, and now specialize in recording live events as they take place. In my professional opinion, what you are seeing on this DVD is NOT lip-sync (where the performers act like they are singing while listening to their voices which have been previously recorded). The video images you are watching on the DVD were taken from the live performance, where the ladies were really singing to the live music (not recorded earlier). I'm sure the live front-of-house audio mix was very challenging for the audio engineers to re-create a nicely-mixed live sound for the folks who attended this concert.<br />However, in my opinion, most of the audio on the DVD did not actually come from the audio recorded with the video at the concert. Remember, audio and video are recorded separately, not like a camcorder which records them together.  If you noticed, the music on the CD was recorded in several studios (except for the 2 live numbers on the CD which came from the concert). The same orchestra, drummers, choir, etc were used to record the CD. In my professional opinion, the music recorded in the studios for the CD was used to make the DVD, in order to provide a much cleaner and noise-free audio for the DVD. So, the task of matching the singers' mouth movements with the audio being heard on the DVD belongs to the folks who edited all of the video footage taken at the live concert to match the recorded music for the CD. The audio is edited onto the DVD timeline first, and then the video is pieced on top of the audio to match it.  Non-linear editing software can \\"stretch\\" or \\"smoosh\\" the video to match the audio track, and it takes some talent for the video editor to get this exactly matched. To prove this to myself, I played a track from both the DVD and the CD on my professional equipment at the same time, and found that the timing marks (called \\"frames\\") match.<br />If you didn't understand anything I just said, let me summarize.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is an absolute must see video.  You need to watch it a few times and then pass it onto your friends, relatives and neighbors.  It starts a little slow and maybe boring but stick with it for some real eye-opening truths that we all need to get involved in.  Whether you like Al Gore or not, you need to listen to his message and wonder why others in a position to make changes don't.

Pollan presents some unfamiliar and challenging topics, such as the details of government financial support for agriculture.  However, since he has such a clear voice, this book is always easy to read.  This is a book that every American should read and discuss.
B00005JPCD|4.0|For sheer entertainment, HAPPY FEET is well worth your time and money. Borrowing from several recent films and incorporating old and new musical numbers, Happy Feet will most likely get your own toes a-tappin' as well as crack a few smiles.<br /><br />The story is also politically intriguing (although most of this will go over younger viewers' heads), commenting on neo-conservatism, differing lifestyle choices (the gay lifestyle can easily be surmised here), and how difficult change and acceptance can be.<br /><br />The film takes on the initial look and feel of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, an excellent Oscar winning documentary. But this is animated and the story much lighter (at least on the surface). We are quickly whisked into anthropomorphic-land as these emperor penguins talk, sing and eventually dance. The animation is first-rate, being both very colorful and detailed. Later in the story there's also the added bonus of real-life humans (not animated) that show up in the film.<br /><br />The story surrounds the birth of a penguin named Mumble (Elijah Wood, LORD OF THE RINGS). During his early egg-hood (prior to hatching) his father, Memphis (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN) accidentally dropped the egg during a blizzard and later blames himself for the \\"differences\\" his son exhibits. Penguins sing beautiful melancholy songs to one another to both appease their spirits (i.e., to bring back the fish stocks that've been diminishing year by year), as well as to attract a mate. But Mumble can't sing and instead moves his feet in true tap-dance style. This is very un-penguin-like and he is shunned by all except the beautiful Gloria (Brittany Murphy, GIRL, INTERRUPTED) who finds his singing horrific but his demeanor and differences intriguing. It is these differences that will ultimately alienate Mumble from his family, friends, and own kind ...and eventually save his entire species. Every penguin will have to learn to dance in order to save themselves.<br /><br />Added to the fun of the movie is the incorporation of old and new songs with changing and interlinking tempos, very similar to MOULIN ROUGE. In fact, one of the main singing characters is named Norma Jean who's voiced by none other than Nicole Kidman (one of the stars of Moulin Rouge).<br /><br />The neo-conservatism can be witnessed as the older penguins who are in charge of the emperor's refuse to change or accept Mumble's differences, wanting to stick to old ways even when faced with possible starvation from the absent fish in the surrounding oceans.<br /><br />That the gay lifestyle can be inserted is easily seen. Mumble is different. Very different. He walks,  talks and acts in ways that disturb the older penguins and they immediately shun him and attempt to keep him away from the flock. This is obviously severe alienation due to someone who'll never have a mate (or so they suspect). When Mumble ventures off on his own, he finds friends who don't mind his differences and care for him all the same (San Francisco anyone?)<br /><br />But most kids won't catch these smackingly obvious statements and instead will simply enjoy the catchy tunes, dancing scenes, and eye-popping animation. Adults will most likely enjoy it on several different levels.ded to the fun of the movie is the incorporation of old and new songs with changing and interlinking tempos, very similar to MOULIN ROUGE.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|I'm tired of reading reviews comparing her work now to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.  Fumbling was more than a decade ago.  A lot has happened in her life since then.  For one thing, she's a whole lot richer than she was back then.  From what I can tell, she has a great relationship with her husband, Ashwin Sood.  They've recently had a baby girl.   As much as I love FTE, which was of great comfort to me in my teenage angst years, we're all supposed to be different now--older, wiser, calmer.  I don't expect and most certainly don't want Sarah to be putting records out with content such as that found in FTE in this chapter in her life.
0765315246|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It has a very interesting premise and follows through on it (although it is somewhat incorrectly named).  The dialog is often humorous, if not perfectly believable.  The later part of the book becomes more serious, but in a good way.  I recommend it highly.

1592401791|5.0|This book is so close to actually being there that you almost feel claustrophobic from the hours (or years) spent in the captivity of the studio. At first I thought his opinions of the Beatles personalities were a little tedious, but as the book goes on and he gets to know them and even understand them...it makes more sense than just having a favorite (Paul). <br />I loved this book and as a musician and Beatles fan for my whole life, I found it's insight and technical explainations of recording on seriously limited 1960's equipment facinating! I now hear things in their music that I might never have noticed and it helps the music seem more \\"magical\\" somehow. <br />Thanks be to Geoff, <br />Good book, great story telling.

B00000ILDE|5.0|If you liked Alien, you will like this one better. Definitely more action packed if you like lots of gunplay. Sigourney does her usually great job of playing Ripley who was found drifting in space and decides to return to the planet where the Alien was found to investigate lack of communication from colonists.Accompanied by the Colonial Marines, they meet more than they bargain for. The wise cracks by Bill Paxton are priceless and Michael Bien does another great job of playing the strong silent type who helps Sigourney out of a few tight spots. This is another excellent movie and the Special Edition brings back some addition scenes like the classic gun sentry episode when the Aliens mass their final attack. Aliens 3 was pretty weak, but I also recommend Alien Resurrection.

B000N4SHPS|4.0|One of the biggest surprises in recent cinema, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" recaptures the heart and spirit of the 1976 Oscar winner. The 16-year hiatus adds graceful poignancy to the aging Philly underdog - a quality lacking in the previous sequels. Sylvester Stallone delivers an affecting performance as the iconic boxer who defies skepticism by taking on the current heavyweight champion (Antonio Tarver) in a Vegas exhibition match. As writer-director, Stallone bounces back from the pitfalls of sequelitis by making a detailed character study that gives his famous creation a stirring finale. Against all odds, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" emerges as a minor triumph.

0385512104|5.0|There is a fundamental premise in this book which is patently wrong that people with autism or asperger's syndrome have savant abilities in a variety of ways , particularly mathematical. Although this may occur in a small percentage of cases most children need lifelong intervention to develop their full potential.  <br /> <br />Having said that the journey is not without rewards and humour that my son brings to me each and every day but he also frustrates me and can bring me to the verge of tears.  <br /> <br />As my title to this review suggests the reader should have two goes at this book read it once for the pleasure of the story and read it again casting a more critical eye on it and the role of the parents in the narrative. <br /> <br />A 4.5 star book none the less because it does raise the issue.
0743454537|4.0|First, let me say that, for the most part, Picoult tackles this emotional, controversial subject with remarkable poise, and she sucessfully highlights each character's thoughts and motivaitons (Even those of Jesse, the angry, angst-riddled teenage boy) wihout seeming forced.  The novel is moving and compelling, both intellectually and emotionally.  That said, the ending (which I will not spoil for those of you yet to read this) is dissapointing. Not because it is sad (for you know, picking up a book such as this, that it can only end sadly) but for the cliched way in which it ends.  You know, picking up this book, that there are (or should be) two ways for the book to end: either Anna contiunes to die a little, so that Kate can continue to live a little, or the reverse.  The hard decisions that drive the book never come to fruition though. Picoult ultimately gives both girls a 'get out of deciding free' card, and the driving force of the story, and the potential for either character's wilful, nobel sacrifice, is lost.   <br /> <br />Another minor flaw is Sara, the mother, perpaps the least real and least sympathetic character in tbe book.  She is wholly undynamic.  The experience changes nothing; teaches her nothing. As one reviewer pointed out, while Sara's fear for Kate is understandable, her utter coldness and lack of insight/sympathy for Anna is not.   <br /> <br />All in all, of course, the novel is wonderful, and few, I doubt, could tackle these moral dilema with the poise with which Picoult has. I just would have loved, for this hard story with a hard ending, for that ending to have lived up to its potential.
1932907009|5.0|I found the tone of the book to be a tad \\"too cool for school\\" for my tastes.  However, there is absolutely no doubt that what the guy is talking about is true -- at least when it comes to the spec-script market.  Yes, there are always exceptions, but if you haven't sold anything before, and your goal is to write a spec that has potential to sell and get made, then the advice here is invaluable. <br /> <br />\\"Commercial\\" doesn't mean \\"personality-less.\\" <br /> <br />I also got vicarious pleasure out of his slamming \\"Signs\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" -- both of which I found had structure problems.  But when it comes to \\"Memento\\"... lay off! <br /> <br />If you're serious about your writing, this book is definitely worth your time.

0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama's book is a breath of fresh air. He argues that history is important in the making of current decisions. I haven't heard or read that opinion in a long time.  His writing is very readable and he talks about the latter half of the 20th century, to which many of us can identify. He makes a good case for governments in our global world to work together, to give help instead of so called security in Iran, to use diplomacy instead of bombs and guns.  I would recommend this book to both Denmocrats and Republicans.  It is the most \\"common sense\\" message the public has been given in many a year.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|I absolutely love this album, it hasn't left my mp3 player since I bought it!  Several of the tracks (Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing, Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter, Here Comes The Sun/The Inner Light) are so good, it almost makes the inner Beatles fan want to giggle :)  The transitions are so much fun (often very trippy but somehow still clean) and I love spotting which bits have been put where..  that said, I wish there were more of this in the album.  Some of the songs have been very nicely paired down to create a cleaner overall experience, but some of the tracks sound basically exactly the same as the original.  If George Martin had just taken a little bit more of a step out of the original tracks, this would have jumped to the top of my favorite Beatles albums!  Still great though, definitely worth the buy..

B00005JLT5|5.0|Is there such thing as an uplifting tragedy? How contradictory would that be? Well to me Roman Polanski managed to do just that with his unparalleled account of the Poland occupation by the Nazis in this magnificent movie, \\"The Pianist\\". No wonder it has gotten all the attention and awards it has. After watching this incredibly moving and shocking and sad and at the same time uplifting story onscreen, you would say that the most appealing part of it is that it is based in actual real events, endured by a polish musician (the real Wladislaw Spilzman) during the occupation of Poland, and written down in a book by himself after the end of the war. But then you find out that the director (Roman Polanski himself) also survived the horrors of the Nazi occupation of Poland. Being just a kid, Polanski lived in the Warsaw ghetto and lost all of his family, killed by the Nazis. He was actually separated from his mother and father, and her was eventually sent to Auschwitz to finally die in the concentration camp. To this day he admits that from all the horrors he had to endure, to long for his parents and eventually finding out that they were dead, was the most painful one.     ..And just then the real message of this movie reaches you, loud and clear. The capacity of the human being of surviving the most horrific and painful situations, hanging out firmly to willpower, inner strength and love. In the case of Wladislaw Spilzman, the love for music. A love that was also a way to redemption for the German officer Wilm Hosenfeld. Right there below the most sordid and dark depths of all horrors, lies a light of hope and faith. Adrien Brody's performance was one of the most powerful and genuine renditions I have ever seen onscreen. And Thomas Kretschmann in his role of the German officer Wilm Hosenfeld left me just speechless. This is simply put one of the greatest account of the events surrounding the occupation of Poland, ever.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|This is a remake of so many films, novels and historical events that we just wonder if it hasn't invented a new concept, that of the salad-bowl remake. Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always - today - in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer. He is a real friend that we may meet at any street corner of our mind or imagination. Have a firecracker for him and give a penny for the Guy.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
