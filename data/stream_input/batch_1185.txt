B001DRF84W|4.0|I just bought the Hulk on blue ray and I gotta say this movie still rocks. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and the bad reviews this movie received is pretty comical even til this day. Its depressing knowing that majority of world's vision of the Hulk is  Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno and is the reason this movie got such ridiculous reviews. I can't stop laughing when I read people's comments about the Hulk's jumping ability and how big he is because they didn't see that in the 80's tv series. This movie here is what the Hulk is really like in the comics. The 2008 Hulk was ok and people enjoyed that one more cause it resembled the 80's tv series but in no way was that better than Ang Lee's Hulk.
B005CKPQHA|4.0|Great Show, but the flashbacks of story holes is getting a little bit too much, this smells like prolonging the series to sell product to me a la LOST. Something's got to give here, a major character needs to go or it risks going on and on with the impossible/improbable savior scenarios. Tighten this up writers.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Bon Iver's Bon Iver is truly one of a kind. I've listened to this CD perhaps 50 times I'm still listing. It is worth very penny.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Love love love this CD. Thank you Boss! I remember when I was a kid I was a bootleg album junkie. Got my hands on the Hammersmith Odeon record (with Tamborine playing Monkey cover) and the Winterland concert. Scratchy bad quality but I played the heck out of those records. Years later I finally get what I was searching for all those years ago. Some red-hot pre-Born-In-The_USA Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.     Ain't Good Enough for You for me is just what the Doctor Ordered. Gave me that concert feeling, and of course Talk to Me and Fire. Southside I love your version buddy but the Bruce version kicks some major tail. And Fire puts the Pointer Sisters rendition to shame.     All I can say is I'm glad I own it, and it will be a while before I switch CD's in the car.
0553801473|1.0|This is rubbish. Its like a really long Feast of Crows. What I mean is that it meanders, as one previous reviewer mentioned, its marching marching marching, food stores, commanding men, and more marching.<br />I was so disapointed as I was hoping that Feast of Crows was a blip. But this book, jeez, you read whole chapters that don't expand the story at all. Without spoilers, he seems to spend a great deal of time on some characters with a poor resolution, it leaves you thinking, what the hell was the point of that ! Why did I need to know about this person? How is this progressing the story at all.<br />Also, Dany who seemed to evolving into a strong female character without being a total b**ch turned wishy washy. I really liked her and her story didn't develop at all.<br />Wasn't impressed and will not be getting the next book without seeing reviews first. It may be cheating but I sure as hell am not wasting my money without confirmation its worth it. 6 years !! 6 years waiting !!!!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I thought the movie while good, was a little on the slow side. I hope that the last one will have much more action and move a bit more.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|I really like this - it's probably the most \\"Yes\\" album the band has done since Drama, with the exception of the brilliant \\"Keys To Ascension\\" studio tracks from the late 90s.  It's certainly more Yes than any of the Trevor Rabin stuff or Open Your Eyes.  If new vocalist Benoit David doesn't sound exactly like Jon Anderson, he's certainly similar enough to give it that Yes sound.  And, Jon was in the band for almost a decade after the last album, with no followup, so I'll take this version of Yes over no Yes at all!        When I think of Yes, I think of lush, somewhat ethereal music, and this gives me that distinctive Yes feeling, even if it's not Fragile or Relayer.  If you like Drama, Tormato, and The Ladder, you should certainly enjoy this.        Plus, I'm always happy when they have Roger Dean do the cover - his art is a perfect visual match to their music.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|I haven't played much of it yet, but so far I like it a lot.  The game play is good and the graphics are really nice.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was reluctant to even give this a try since I was so happy already with my Swype type keyboard.. I'm glad I did as this is now my keyboard of choice.. Easy to use and much less chance of mistakes.. Well worth the money, and even more so that I got it when it was free.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I purchased this item to give me more options in what I could carry when I go out shooting. I find that adjusting the size of the compartments easy and that when adjusted they hold the lens and camera bodies snugly in place. I have not had the chance to really travel with it jet so I cannot say how it would feel on a long hike or trip but for the short trips I have taken it on I found it to be comfortable to wear.    The drawback though is that it's opening is easily accessible to anyone that might be standing behind you, so if you know you will be traveling in an area that has a high pickpocket rate or theft from tourist it might not be the best bag for you.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Completely Awesome.     Not for wussies.     Acting, Atmosphere, Writing, Sport, Violence, Sex, humor, period costumes and details; all done well here. I bought the DVDs asap.

0553801473|5.0|A masterpiece that gets an undeserved number of ridiculously bad reviews by disaffected fans (\\"GRRuMblers\\"). To understand the number of bad reviews, one must know that (former) \\"fans\\" have formed a renegade movement in the internet and have been criticising the author for years, because they are of the opinion that it took Mr. Martin too long to finish the book (they wanted their candy here and now).<br /><br />Do not take those negative reviews too seriously. I guess if one dedicates years of his or her life to \\"anti-fandom\\", one cannot let the opportunity pass to express one's biased view here on amazon once more, hoping to damage the author that dared \\"not to deliver in time\\". But if some of those reviews suggest that \\"nothing is happening\\" in a Dance with Dragons, that is just beyond ridiculous. Seriously, I do not even understand on what planet some of those reviewers are living on.<br /><br />Mr. Martin's Dance with Dragons is highly, highly entertaining, a great, richly told story (actually, several stories cleverly interwoven). It held me in its grip from the first to the last page. Of course, this fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series does not conclude the series (there will be two more books), but here and now I am glad that more is to come and even when it will take some more years, with a fine book such as A Dance with Dragons, the journey is the reward.<br /><br />To the interested reader, I also suggest to read the very positive reviews by critics in the Los Angeles Times, Time Magazine, New York Times, Washington Post etc. etc.
B004289ZW0|1.0|Got this unit yesterday... had some trouble getting it to pair with ipad2.  Had to reset all networkd settings on ipad which was annoying.  Not sure which side the error was on but eventually got it to link up.  Haven't flown with it, but it shows position/altitude/heading accurately with 10m of accuracy just walking around out front and looks good in \\"foreflight\\".  Power switch is cool, but can see how it will get annoying in time.  five months after purchase it will no longer turn on, and will not charge... a total waste of money.  I got 5 total flights out of it.  NOT WORTH IT!!!
0385340540|5.0|Many of the negative reviews revolve around the idea that this book isn't as quick a tempo as the Partner or Runaway Jury. While that is true, a book can be just as entertaining if it creates a compelling (even suspenseful) story is more deliberate manner.    The Broker does exactly that and is my favorite Grisham story. Balancing the suspense of having Backman (the lead character) try to escape from numerous deadly organizations (Saudis, Chinese, ..) while almost seamlessly integrating into a different culture in Italy added an extra boost to the story. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this genre of storytelling!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|\\"It Might Get Loud\\" is awesome.  I wish they'd turn this into a series, with a bunch of different artists.  The concept of pulling guitarists from several different bands into a room together to discuss their equipment, techniques, styles, strings... it's just an awesome little voyeuristic adventure that fans eat up, and fellow musicians understand.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  As a musician, it's totally understood.  I played in a rehearsal studio for several years where a dozen or more bands were in and out all the time.  When we finished our practice, I would wander down the hall and listen to what other bands were playing.  If I liked it, I'd knock on the door, and if allowed in, I'd hang out and talk 'shop' with the other musicians.  Everyone always comes out enriched from such experiences.  It is a stroke of genius that someone orchestrated this and filmed it.  Carry on, carry on!  We need more of this!  Make a sequel!  Make several!
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Top-down view, Tower Defense game. Enemies are variations of the un-dead, weapons are upgradable ground and or air based bullet/missile/area-effect type weapons. Layout is static location points that you place your weapons on.<br /><br />A decent Tower Defense game, but tends to get tedious and monotonous. Other options in the genre; Robo Defense and Tower Raiders 2.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|It was a delightful experience to read this book, about business and life.  Tony Hsieh stamps his personality onto Zappos' corporate culture, and created broader impact on people's thinking about the purpose of business and life.     I was a big fan of Zappos.com. I purchased and returned so many pairs of shoes that I felt guilty that they might be losing money on me...
0307454541|3.0|There are plenty of reviews already showing you what the book is about. Instead, as someone who lived in Scandinavia for a few years, I will try to tell you my opinion about what this book means, where it comes from and why the hype about it.<br /><br />While many readers from the US commented on the weird characters, this book accurately depicts the world as seen through the eyes of a significant share of Scandinavians. Remember, the original title is \\"Men that hate women\\". In detail, that world-view is the following:<br /><br />1) The only differences between men and women are the negative male traits<br />2) A superior/civilized man is one that has no masculine traits whatsoever and accepts the superiority of women<br />3) Despite the female superiority, due to the remaining uncivilized evil men and the still patriarchic society, women are victims of men<br />4) Right-wing white men are the epitome of evilness<br />5) Left-wing feminist women are the epitome of goodness<br /><br />To understand the power of this book and why it became a best-seller, you have to understand its cathartic role:<br />In Sweden, women are told every day how much they suffer in the hands of men and men are told every day how evil they are. That breeds resentment and guilt.<br /><br />Suddenly, unlike the books you get to read from foreign authors (Dan Brown does not get even close to Stieg Larsson), a book comes along that depicts the world as you were told it the world is like: The rich are evil; women are all sexual victims of men; women are all dominant, wise, energetic, confident and strong; cherry on the cake, women finally have the justification to express their anger through physical violence towards men.<br /><br />Women in Scandinavia read through the pages of this book totally absorbed and finish the book feeling avenged and understood.<br /><br />This book became a hit neither because it is a good thriller nor because it was better in the Swedish version. No; it became a hit because it is a manifesto for the version of feminism that is mainstream in Scandinavia.<br />For readers unaware of the ideology, the characters will seem awkward and unbelievable.<br />For readers grown into that ideology, the book is just logical.<br />For readers wanting to learn the ideology and the Swedish culture of today, the book is an open window.<br /><br />Despite its major shortcomings as a novel, I nevertheless recommend reading this book if you are interested in seeing the world through leftist-feminist glasses. If you are not into that, you better skip it altogether.<br /><br />Rod Govea, author of [[ASIN:8564329026 Here She Comes!

B00005N6KG|3.0|I got these a while ago and I only use them at home while webcaming. It hangs loosely and the noise is not that great. I can't hear my friend on the other end sometimes. I haven't used them for running or anything so I don't know if they're good for that or not. it's not particularly comfortable either. Won't be buying these again
B003Y5H542|5.0|4.8 stars<br /><br />Rango is no kids' flick, but it is a mature masterpiece in a whole bunch of ways that will soon make it a major cult favorite, guaranteed. It takes a certain sense of humor to dig this one, but if you've got it, you're in for a big big treat. Rango also has one of the best-looking, most detailed blu-ray transfers I've yet seen.<br /><br />A partial remake of Chinatown with existential overtones and psychedelic undercurrent with nods to dozens of cinematic classics, this \\"cartoon\\" Western satire has a lot more in common with Bugs Bunny and his anarchic freakiness than with any of the new crop of Pixar etc family animation works, great as they can be (Up, Incredibles). It also has Roger Rabbit's tantalizing self-reflexivity in spades and glittering diamonds. Rango salutes HST in its first scene and then goes waaaay off into left field, climbs into the bleachers, gets a beer, watches the relievers warm up, and finally scampers back down into right field and is kicked out of the ball park.<br /><br />For me it was a major treat, as I love Thompson, Chinatown, Warner Bros cartoons, and intelligent insanity in general. Rango piles on so many genres and ideas and spoofed cliches and wowza that your head is spinning most of the time, even if just from the truly amazing animation quality and endless wild concepts. Logan's script is so much brighter and sharper than almost anything being made lately that it seems an anachronism; its levels of thought will take your brain to many literate, self-aware clouds floating by your mind's eye.<br /><br />Verbinski directs the proceedings with similar aplomb, and Depp shows more voice and character range than in almost anything he's ever done. Ned Beatty is another standout, but everyone is excellent. And the various little conspiracy nods are all too accurate; there's a lot going on in Rango, and multiple viewings will show many layers of crisp detail, visually and intellectually. One might even call this a kaleidoscopic environmentalist's lament, a world-weary nod to how close to the brink we really are and a reminder that there are many other worlds out there and in here, so let's watch it Buddha-like with as much compassionate detachment as is musterable. Whatevar that means!<br /><br />And eye candy? Man, this is the handmade organic 75% cacao chocogasm of eye candy. Soooo much detail in some of the animals' hair and eyes that it sets a new standard (can't wait to see it in 3D). This will show off your flat screen in ways you'd never imagined. It's so good I unplugged my PS3 and took it to a friend's place just so he could see how good his flat screen can look. I wouldn't go to that trouble for just any film.<br /><br />Nor would I watch it twice in two days. I haven't done that in years, in fact. But I just had to check to see if Rango was as beguilingly weird and wonderful by daylight as it was late at night, and indeed it is.<br /><br />Rango is bound to be hailed as one of the great toon films of all time, methinks, and I'd rank it with Roger Rabbit, the best Bugs (high praise, bub!), Up and a very few other animated masterpieces. Is it for kids? Not really, unless you'd like to raise them to be smarter and more self-aware than the average little texting robots these days, so, you know, be careful! I think many kids are much brighter much earlier than we think, but then again I watched a lot of Bugs as a kid, so I may be biased.<br /><br />If you've got a blu-ray player, at least rent this just to see how good your screen can look. And if you happen to get your mind blown in the process, well, lucky you!

B004IQMXD4|4.0|Upon my first listen of IN YOUR DREAMS, Stevie Nicks' first new studio effort in a decade, I was really concerned...the disc just left me cold. Nothing jumped out at me. Even the two albums that I've long considered her weakest ~ 1985's ROCK A LITTLE and STREET ANGEL from 1994 ~ each had three or four cuts that I instantly loved. With so many people saying this was a \\"masterpiece\\" and a \\"career-defining\\" release, could I be missing something?!?<br /> Then I remembered....more and more, it seems like you just can't judge an album by it's album cover...in other words, give it a few spins! Case in point...I hated the new Bob Schneider after my first listen, while I loved the new one from The Cars. Now, the Bob Schneider is one of my favorite albums of the year, while the Cars...not so much!<br /> But back to Stevie. After a few more listens, it hit me...this isn't the same Bella Donna/Gypsy/Rhiannon that we've come to know, love and respect over the last 35+ years. No, this is a more grounded, mature 63 year old woman who's seeing life through a vastly different crystal ball (Hey, she hasn't TOTALLY changed!!). And I like it!<br /> Oh, I still have some issues, mainly with the production...I think Dave Stewart and (especially!) Glen Ballard are SO wrong for Nicks (I hope this is a one time teaming, and GOD FORBID Stewart helms the next Fleetwood Mac effort!)....she needs someone a little more...dangerous, with a little more edge and freshness. Someone like Rick Rubin, or Matt Serlatic. (Or, based on the one cut that he co-produced here, Mike Campbell). That said, though, I'm happy to say that, overall, I am now loving this disc.<br /> The album opens with it's first single, the relaxed, slinky mid-tempo \\"Secret Love.\\" The arrangement lopes along at a nice pace , while Nicks' voice has aged like a fine wine, with her lower register in particular coming across more powerful than ever. Mark my word, twenty-five years ago, this would have been a HUGE hit for Nicks.<br /> \\"For What It's Worth\\" is one of the disc's major surprises for me. Initially dismissing the track, I now absolutely love it. Heartfelt, deeply sincere lyrics and a gorgeous, country-tinged arrangement all come together to brilliant effect. However, the true star here is actually Nicks' vocal(s)....her lead is lovely, and when she starts to harmonize with herself on backing vocals....WOW!! Simply amazing! In a just world this track, which was just chosen as the second single, will be an across the board hit for her.<br /> On the flip side, the album's frantic title track does nothing for me. It's almost as if, knowing what a huge hit Tom Petty's \\"I Need To Know\\" has been for Nicks in concert, Stewart tried to recapture that classic's energy and drive. Not even close, Dave...not even close!<br /> \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" also fails to ignite...it's more like a tabloid article set to music...who's she singing about (Rupert Hine)? Were they really that in love (Guess so)? And DID he ever forget \\"that kiss\\" (We'll never know!)? Nicks' vocal is somewhat flat, but I do like the almost tribal vibe that the track wraps up on. Not a total disaster, but a miss none the less.<br /> Far stronger is the evocative \\"New Orleans.\\" The Crescent City really is becoming quite the star...Steve Earle also sings about her on his excellent new I'LL NEVER GET OUT OF THIS WORLD ALIVE. Here, Nicks' atmospheric, thoughtful lyrics dance over a beautiful arrangement, all muted instrumentation and full-blown feeling. Add a lead vocal full of wonder and amazement and the aforementioned insightful lyrics (\\"Where the good and the righteous walk/And the wicked as well\\"), and you have a lovely little gem. (And those closing chords...!).<br /> \\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\" is another one of the tracks that just doesn't...gel. Nicks has been here before, and to much better effect (\\"Beauty & The Beast\\"). O.K......but not great.<br /> A lot of people have been less than thrilled about \\"Annabel Lee\\", but I digit. What's not to love?!? The arrangement chugs along beautifully, the lead vocal soars, and how can you go wrong with lyrics adapted from the works of Edgar Allen Poe??? This is everything \\"Moonlight\\" isn't. Love it!<br /> Knowing how much \\"Soldier's Angel\\" means to Nicks, I REALLY hate what I'm about to say, but...this song's a disaster. Yes, the lyrics are honest and real, but everything else is a mess, from the vocals (Nicks' are nasally and robotic, while Lindsey Buckingham's are sharp and shrill) to the arrangement (cold and dissonant). A song this tender and raw needs the acoustic warmth of, say, \\"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You\\" or \\"I Sing For The Things\\". Instead, we get a stark, militaristic...roll call. A major, MAJOR misstep.<br /> \\"Everybody Loves You\\" is a nice mid-tempo album cut, featuring a crisp duet between Nicks and Stewart. The lyrics are a little heavy handed ~ almost a case of trying too hard ~ but, overall, this is an O.K. cut.<br /> And then there's \\"Ghosts Are Gone.\\" Without a doubt my favorite track on IN YOUR DREAMS, I love this cut not because it's probably the closest thing there is to a classic Stevie Nicks rocker, but because of it's attitude and edge, it's overall SASS! Toss in lyrics that conjure up visions of a sequel to \\"Angel\\" (probably my favorite Nicks song of all time!), and you have an absolute winner!<br /> At this point in time, I never thought I would ever be shocked by Stevie Nicks again...I was pretty sure she had played all her cards. Well, \\"shocked\\" is the only way I can describe my reaction to \\"You May Be The One.\\" All bluesy and torchy, this song is a vocal triumph...I have NEVER heard Nicks sound like this! Between this beaut and her cover of Etta James' \\"At Last\\" a decade or so ago, I would LOVE to see that album of standards that Nicks has been talking about for years come to fruition. The disc's true masterpiece (Plus, the lyrics are really fun..which member of Fleetwood Mac is she talking about in which verse?!?)!<br /> The only word that be used to describe \\"Italian Summer\\" is \\"epic\\" ~ this track is like a mini movie musical. All strings and passion and stormy weather, the cut is just gorgeous, anchored by a lead vocal that swoops and shimmers. Breathtakingly beautiful, this stunner should have been the disc's power house closer.<br /> Instead, that task unfortunately falls upon the limp \\"Cheaper Than Free.\\" Weak vocals, weak lyrics, weak everything, the track's all around inferiority is just made more evident following on the heels of the vastly superior \\"Italian Summer.\\"<br /> That said, what are my overall thoughts on IN YOUR DREAMS? Well, while I don't think it's one of Stevie Nicks' BEST albums to date, I do think it's one of her most IMPORTANT. I think she's crossed over to a land where gypsies and Welch witches still dance, but where she can also now do ANYTHING....that aforementioned standards album...or that country one....or that Christmas one...or that one of duets...or that one of covers with songs all written by guys!! Whatever the choice may be, I don't think that, from this point on, Nicks will be contemplating it solely in her dreams.

0062060554|4.0|This book really requires a commitment from the reader as the main character, Christine, cycles through her past, present, confabulations, flashbacks as well as an attempt to link up with her past past via her journal. You have to really stay with it. I'd suggest reading it over a few days with no lapses. I applaud the author for taking on such a difficult plot structure and subject matter.  There are parts of it that did drag due to the repetition inherent due to this victim's unusual case of amnesia but also parts where you wanted to scram: \\"Get on with it.\\" The ending became predictable starting with \\"Ben\\" losing it over the broken dinner plate one evening. The ending seemed rushed and an obvious attempt to explain away the myriad of inconsistencies present throughout the novel. But all and all, as a summer read and first novel, I have to applaud the writer.
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is probably the least 'epic' of the books so far; it is far more inclined to be intimate with characters and their relationships. And I loved it.<br /><br />George is a top notch character writer. Every one of his characters is multifaceted and realistic; having goals, wants, needs, and lusts that befit a real human being. This novel shows that off with all burners on high. You can definitely tell that this is more the end of one novel and the beginning of another; there is no real big climax, though there are definitely a series of major events that could be said to be the climax of the book.<br /><br />I think a lot of the negative reviews has to do with the wait more than anything- people are mad at the time it took, and are looking at the book through those eyes. It doesn't matter to me, really. It's an awesome book, and is worthy of placing on the shelf next to the other ones. It also opened at #1 on the New York Times lists, so I doubt Martin'll be too hung up about some bad Amazon reviews.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|This movie must have been written by someone who has the attention span of snail. It was like they filmed a bunch of unrelated scenes, and then decided how they could cram them all into a long, strange, mindless arrow shooting party.<br /><br />One strange scene, has the King of Locksley asking Russel Crowe to tell him about himself, so he might receive him as his son. Then not long after, the King is telling Crowe all about his father??? Made no sense.<br /><br />It was hard to understand many conversations in the movie. I think the accents were so fake, and maybe the microphone wasnt close enough, that it didnt work well.<br /><br />I was disapointed in the movie, and I only rented it for $1 at redbox. I wonder if they have refunds?
B001DHXT1G|5.0|This was a much better Hulk than the first. I hate comparing the two cause the makers/directors have different intentions. It was a well-balanced movie with Action, Love, and Suspense. The only disappointing thing about the movie was that I wish there was more HULK. Too much Bruce Banner and not enough Hulk. Overall good movie.
B003Y5H59W|4.0|So first off, let me say that this movie was really fun! I'd been looking forward to it since I first saw the trailers over a month ago. The story line surrounding Captain America is golden. I love the idea that the guy who really loves his country and wants to do good is given the chance to be superior than everyone else who had frowned upon him in the past. I think that the CG for Steve Rogers before becoming Captain America was amazing. He really looks like he is 90 lbs, which makes the transformation really drastic. However, I was a little bit disappointed in the action CG ( such as when he is jumping on things and and punching people out) because it looks a little bit fake, but the acting is really good, so you kinda don't have too long to think about it. The attention to detail was really great, especially the costumes and makeup, which all look WW2 period.  I must say that there were some things that I would change. In the preview there is a clip of Captain America storming his way through a set of double doors with his team and shooting everywhich way, which i was really excited about, but that bit ended up being part of a montage, which disappointed me. I think that a lot of the technology was far to extensive and advanced for WW, but we are talking about a movie where a guy gets injected with super-human-serum, so I was okay with it. The actors and actresses were amazing and all very believable, also there is plenty of suspense, humor and heart in this movie. I think that I'll buy it when it comes out even though there were some things that I would have changed. Overall, really fun movie!  Stay for all of the credits, there is a really good extra at the end :)
B004P12SSW|4.0|I tried to keep an open mind while watching Burlesque and was pleasantly surprised by the fun energy that runs throughout the film.  Cher, Christina Aguilara, Stanley Tucci... all good performances, especially if you like them anyway in other things, but probably not too far from who they really are in real life - making their performances ultimately predictably good.<br /><br />The story is light, there aren't any real surprises.  This isn't a problem because the majority of the film is back to back musical numbers which really don't add to the story other than by illustrating the meaning of the word 'Burlesque' and stressing the group as an entertainment family.  The relationships (such as they are...) are believable enough to keep you hoping for a happy ending for everyone, and you get it.<br /><br />Burlesque wouldn't make my all-time top 50, but it might make #51.  Great music and dancing sequences, sewn together by big names wearing great costumes. An enjoyable movie if you're not looking to stuff it into a specific genre or critique the acting of everyone in it.
B003VR5PPY|1.0|OK, the graphics are good, the concept is good, and one of the charictors (Lotus) is a bombshell.  There are no puzzels in this game, no real chalange.  Its a scavenger hunt.  Nothing is really hidden, you just look around and find things.  But that's not the worst part.  Too...much...dialog...  After finding clues and getting out of the first room, be prepaired for approx. 50 screens of dialog.  It's a book. And it doesn't stop there.  Every time you collect clues and move there's more......dialog.  And the banter is just not consistant with people that have a \\"bomb\\" planted inside them. Dishes (plates) that are for neat as opposed to dished that are for seafood?  \\"Yikes\\".  Want a challange?  Professor Layton series, Machines.  You want to read a book, 9.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Takes a few missions to see the potential but as it gets further the game's difficulty increases and the game play is much more complex.
B003EYVY04|1.0|If you're like me and are ignoring the reviews for this product that complain about it not containing the extended version because that doesn't bother you, please read the following. The main reason I wanted this DVD was to add to my growing collection of HP Ultimate Editions to make for a very nice, orderly, congruent display on my shelf. The first two movies were released quite nicely; the book-like DVD case was wrapped in a vertical slip cover. Simple, effective. Here's how this release screwed up:    - Lenticular cover. Looks nice I guess, but it's ultimately pointless and it makes the first two releases (which don't have one) stand out. Also, it's extremely difficult to remove the lenticular picture. I admit that you'd probably wouldn't want to (there's nothing behind it! Not even a normal cover), but it's not glued in place so it almost looks like they thought you might want to. How is it held in? Read on.    - Lenticular cover is held in by corner flaps that, if you're not careful, will probably be caught on other DVDs as you slide them onto the shelf next to it. Corner flaps are the \\"3\\" and dragon seen on the cover as well as the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" title on the adjacent corner. There is NO way this can stay mint unless you're EXTREMELY careful.    - Horizontal slip cover. Technically a flimsy cardboard slip cover isn't ideal in any case, but if it's vertical it's a bit easier to be careful. Horizontal (which is, admittedly, how most box sets are done-- for example, if you have the 2004 Original Trilogy Star Wars DVDs box set, it's the same thing there), because of the way it needs to be folded to construct the box, leaves a tab of cardboard on the inside, pointing toward where you insert the DVD. If you're not careful it can catch, and start degrading your already very flimsy set up that you're trying to keep nice looking. I had to tape mine down which I was only okay with because it's in the inside. But I really shouldn't have to.    - Security tab stuck HALFWAY UNDER one end of the aforementioned cardboard tab, jutting out one end of it making it almost guaranteed to catch the DVD and get bent. I know Amazon probably orders these from the same place any other store does, but really? Security tags? It wasn't impossible to remove but it did take some work as it was stuck on pretty good. Real pain in butt.    - This box set is TALLER than the previous two! Not by much, it's certainly noticeable. It's possible it's because of the horizontal slip cover design (at least two bits of cardboard on the top and bottom that aren't there on the previous two releases), but it's still inexcusable. Part of the reason collectors like sets like these is because it makes movie collections look like one complete saga rather than a mindless cash grab. How much each of these sets look like part of one complete series will make or break them in collectors' eyes.    - The flap on the book-like DVD cover is no longer magnetic like the previous two releases. Not that big of a deal, but it was kind of nice to have that.     If you are like me, you'll probably want this set anyway because just having the first two years just doesn't cut it (and if you're REALLY like me, year 3 is your favorite HP movie so it'll be even harder to avoid). Just know what you're getting into. Movie studios don't have much of an incentive to make a set that will last a long time and be completely perfect because then they won't have a reason to sell you more copies of it later. Hopefully, if there's a box set that includes every movie in the future, it will be better than this and hopefully include all of the one hour documentaries that each of these releases have (another reason I'm buying these). But for now, this isn't the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" by any definition.    One final note: This set and the Year 4 set was released last year (2010), but I bought it recently. If I recall correctly, when I saw Year 3 and Year 4 in stores they didn't have that lenticular cover,but I notice the Year 5 and Year 6 DVDs do. This might be a new thing they're doing for 2011, and if they are still making the previous releases, they might have retroactively added those covers. If so, it might be worth your time to carefully research which version you're buying (and perhaps go back and get newer versions of Year 1 and Year 2 if they exist). That is if you value a matching set more than decently constructed DVD cases, though. Just a thought.
B00005N5RM|4.0|The original filming of 'The Blob' may have had Steve McQueen but not enough gore and special effects were pretty much still in the stone age.  Got to hand it to the new one for having the dissolving bodies, decent creature effects and it allowed Kevin Dillon to make a pay check and quit mooching off his successful brother for awhile.  While opening doors for co-star Shawnee Smith who also had a pretty good role in 'The Stand' by Stephen King and the 'SAW' movie series.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I loved the book in the beginning, but not the ending.  At first I couldn't put it down but then I started becoming dissappointed in it.  I decided to not even buy the third book because of this one.
0740748475|5.0|Three beautiful books in a very elegant protective case. The paper quality and colors are excellent. A really must for all Calvin and Hobbes fans.
B003Q6D1YW|2.0|**Spoilers Ahead**The cover and marketing were extremely overhyped.  I felt like I wasted my time watching this movie. It's not a thriller, it's not even that unusual of story, it's just a sucker falling for a housewife pretending to be a hot chick. If I had known it was a facebook documentary I would not have felt so duped. However, I think it they are meta trolling the audience by pretending it's a twisty thriller, just as the guy in this movie was fooled by the sad housewife.
B000IZA9PI|5.0|This movie keeps my interest the whole way through. To me, that's one of the marks of a good work of entertainment. It's filled with bunches of creative and unexpected scenes. There are minor spoilers ahead.    There are many things in the movie that delight me. First of all, Deanna and Riker getting married. After years of just being \\"very good friends\\" and basically tiptoeing around professionalism in general, this was a sweet outcome for them. Picard's wedding speech was touching (and funny) too.    Also, Picard's dune buggy scene. Some say that his predelection for fast driving is uncharacteristic of him, but we must remember that for years we've only mostly seen his professional \\"captain\\" persona. Anyway, it's nice to see him smile.    Another thing I really liked was how they redesigned the Romulans to make them look less adversarial. Even their planetwide fashion of angular shoulders isn't so severe anymore. And the movie ends with the beginnings of a peaceful alliance between them and the Federation.    The one thing that I didn't like about the movie was B-4. He was little more than a paperweight, and one Data lookalike was enough.
B004GYY714|5.0|Wonderful app and best reception. Best FM app I have found on the net. Clear local and national stations. Adaptable for all locations thusfar.
B00006FDCD|2.0|I appreciate that a lot of people read and loved the book, watched and loved this very long epic.  I'm even related to such a person who's read the book several times and encouraged me to read it too.  I am happy to report that I did read the book.  However.  Far from being a page turner that I couldn't put down, it turned into a two year marathon where I had to force myself to finish reading it, a bit at a time.  I thought, with that bad experience well behind me, that I'd give this televised version a chance.  MMMM-yeah.  I'm sorry, I kept waiting impatiently for it to get scary.  Instead, I found it rather limp, devoid of any genuine fright whatsoever.  I suppose it didn't help I've never thought of clowns as being particularly spooky.  I was also under the impression that they, like mimes, were supposed to be silent; their act being one of slapstick and pantomime.  Pennywise the Dancing Clown was anything but silent; in fact, all he did was yap (I did find Tim Curry's performance hysterical, meant in a positive way, as he's the only good thing about this miniseries).  To make matters worse, I found it to be terribly dated.  The cast was also filled with odd choices, Olivia Hussey in particular.  Harry Anderson was loud, obnoxious, and phony; his performance forced.  On the other hand, his younger half, Seth Green, was very natural and likable.  The late Jonathan Brandis was poignant while his older counterpart, Richard Thomas, seemed consistently bewildered (the ponytail didn't help).  As a whole, the younger actors did far better than the adults did.  Nevertheless, the single most disturbing aspect of this piece was the way in which it reveled in bullying, that seemed a far better direction to take, as far as horror is concerned, than the odd ghost/sci-fi/monster hybrid they attempted to produce but failed.  I laughed when I finished reading the BIG reveal in the book and I laughed when I saw it on the little screen.  I've got dust bunnies scarier than that.<br /><br />I suppose I can hope the remake is better?<br />Because I'm not watching this again!I suppose I can hope the remake is better?  Because I'm not watching this again!
B0052KJ5TK|2.0|I love(d) 3dd from the first time I heard \\"here without you\\" almost 9 years ago, late at night, in a friend's basement.  The 17 Days album that followed was original and interesting.  It had some terrific tunes, rounding out the 3 Doors Down style.  It made me wonder if they could go from popular to truly great.  Landing in London, for example, is one of the most stirring singles I've ever heard.  And its not much like anything else that any other artist or group has put out.    The 3 doors Down self-titled album that hit a couple years later showed some nice evolution, although some songs did sound a little like the work that had come before it.    But this new album is really, really, tired.  Besides a few not-heard-before chord progressions in \\"When You're Young\\" there's nothing new under the sun (or away from the sun) here.        I love you guys, especially you, Brad, with your hauntingly soulful redneck-in-distress crooning.  But I'm disappointed.  Actually, I'm ticked off.  You guys sat around for four years and did what with your talent?  You did nothing!  Sorry it had to come to this.
B0057A6GA6|3.0|This is a good looking game that runs very smoothly on my Evo 4g.<br /><br />It is WAY to easy on all but the insane difficulty levels.  The only real difficulty comes from not knowing where the next wave of zombies will come from. They spawn from locations in the sane order every gane tho, so, even if you guess poorly on your first try it will be pretty easy on the next go round.<br /><br />Its still a fun time killer if you don't mind the mindless simplicity of your tasks, and , it really does look great.<br /><br />I wish that you could hear the guns firing.<br /><br />I can't help but compare this to Field Runners, and when I do Grave Defense comes up wanting. It lacks depth.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cool game where you really can't lose try this one.<br /><br />If you are looking for a challenge with some teeth to it check out Field Runners.<br /><br />Either way you'll have some fun!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have the luxury of having just read this book in July 2011, right after A Dance with Dragons was published.  Therefore, I knew that some of the characters who seemed to be ignored in this book would be addressed in the next book which I am about to read.  Nonetheless, I strongly felt that the story continued to be as engrossing as it had been in the previous three novels and can see how Mr. Martin is developing and evolving the overall story of the Song of Ice and Fire.  While some of the \\"cliffhangers\\" might drive some readers to distraction and anger, I feel that the story continues to paint a picture where \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" are not hand-delivered to the reader.  Rather, he or she must make his or her own decisions about a great many of the characters presented and accept the idea that, for the most part, no one falls entirely under one umbrella or the other.  This is a rare gift that Tolkien himself did not tackle and is only present in the writings of immortals like Shakespeare or Milton.
0061784788|1.0|I must say that I have read all of the books and most are very entertaining...the last couple of ones though have become very very predicatable...
1401229921|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1BI7QUY685PCA]]It's a great idea to release a penciled version of graphic novel once in a while.<br /><br />Batman: Hush Unwrapped Deluxe is basically the same book as [[ASIN:1401223176 Batman: Hush]] with dialogue and all, except everything is in pencils. The only coloured bits are the sound effects and Batman's internal narration.<br /><br />Reading the book in just pencils is quite a different experience. It's basically like looking at the final draft of the book before the go ahead for inking. If you're marveled by Jim Lee's art in the coloured edition, you'll be blown away by this edition - if you're a comic artist maybe your brain will explode with awe.<br /><br />Every page is filled with detailed pencil work, deserving a slow peruse. The amazing pencil hatches and shading are everywhere, on the characters, the backgrounds. After reading the book, you'll probably get a new sense of appreciation for comic artists and the art of making comics. This book is definitely a collectors' edition for fans.<br /><br />As for the story, the storytelling is good and well paced, there are some surprises as Batman tried to uncover who this Hush villain is. The characters are well defined and believable. The sequences with Catwoman are fantastic - I love how Catwoman and Batman interacts.<br /><br />However, I've a problem with the ending. Even though the villain was revealed in the end, the motivation for going against Batman isn't, or is too weak for me to notice. Just because you're a bad guy and he's Batman means you've to go against him? So the story is great for me until the ending which I felt could be better.<br /><br />Also check out [[ASIN:1845765192 Icons: The DC Comics & Wildstorm  Art of Jim Lee]] if you can't get enough of the art.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I was worried about this book because of the mixed reviews, but was pleasantly surprised.  Thought the character development was great. Did not think it predictable at all.  Would highly recommend.
B0032UYFA6|4.0|As meth dealers Walter&Jessie are like Abbott&Costello,wow what a pair.I just finished watching Season3 and decided that I would let Jesse live.There were times there when I could have shot Jesse myself(joking)!As Gus stated\\"never trust a drug addict\\".What are they thinking,Walter's naive and Jessie's just plain stupid!Why does Walt continue to save Jesse from himself when all he does is mess up some more? I don't know if I can watch all of Season4 if this stupidity continues,so far I waiting for episode3.I guessed I'm hooked for now!
B003Y5H4SO|1.0|Ok, so wtf. This movie is terrible. The devil's in a elevator? Give me a break. I actually saw this in the theatres. From the opening credits with the upside down...everything, I was like...oh boy. This is going to suck isn't it? I guess everythings upside down becaaaaaause, an upside down cross is satanic? Whatever. This is one awful movie. Did I say that already? The plot is jolted and quickly choppy and all the sudden you're in the elevator and things starting getting...crazy. And ridiculous. How about that ending? Is that some awful bullcrap or what? Messed up too. Some ho and boyfriend sitting of front us in the theatres was all like what the F? Out the F loud. Will you shut up? Really. But truly, I was thinking the same thing. Like, what the F indeed? Why did I waste my money and time to see this worthless piece of crap? And then it all comes together at the end with this other thing, and that is truly terrible. Terrible acting. Terrible story. Ridiculous characters. Ridiculous premise, first of all. It is absolutely staggering there's not more one star reviews on here. You'll notice it disappeared as quickly out of theatres as it came into it. Kind of like the devil himself. Hmmm, irony? Maybe you should buy some tarots with an oujia board and visit trump towers' elevators instead. After all you may spot the donald. You can spot his hair. And that would be dramatically more entertaining than even one sec of this movie.
0896898288|5.0|This is a very different type of quilt book. There is a story in the book that is real. Quotes from real people are in the book. It is informative as well as entertaining. Then, there are blocks to sew. Very good mix of reading and sewing and learning patterns.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I bought this movie a long time ago my daughter, then 18 months, loved it and watched it over and over again.  She is now four.  I thought this was a very cute movie with a good point which is you are family no matter what happens.  My daughter watched it over and over and I never had any trouble with her mimicking anything she saw on TV.  She also understood the point of the movie, \\"Ohana\\" no one gets left behind.  I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this movie but we never had a problem.  I plan on letting my next child, due in Feb, watch this movie as well.  It doesn't have anyone die in it like a lot of Disney movies even though Lilo's parents are deceased.  I thought it was one of the best starter movies of Disney.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I am a 41 year old fan of rock music.  I have never written a review for an album.  This year I have been fortunate to see the Foo Fighters live with Motorhead, to have tickets to see them again in Calgary, own the excellent documentary - Back n Forth, and of course to own Wasting Light.  I think that Wasting Light is an exceptional album.  It has been a long time since I really loved every song on an album and felt connected to a band.  I don't know if band members ever check these reviews out, but if they do, \\"thank you\\".  Can't wait to see you again in the fall.
B004GUSG4M|1.0|This book had great newspaper reviews but was a big disappointment to read...incredibly repetitive, no character development, and actually the exact same plot as the movie 50 First Dates, which was also bad...I don't know which came first, but both were boring!
0385528752|5.0|What I loved about this book is that it prompted me to look at things in a totally different way.    How I am currently promoting my business and marketing myself can change dramatically just by applying the Switch strategies that the Heath's suggest.    I have a renewed enthusiasm for what I do and how I can make a difference to others because of this book.    My 12 year old son has also started reading it and I'm hoping that it will change the way he thinks about studies and failing/learning.    A fantastic book for individuals, business owners, corporate managers, teachers... well everyone really.    Cheers,    Clare  [...]
B004G6009U|5.0|Highly recommend this movie!  My daughter (4 1/2 years old) saw it in the movie theatre and LOVES it.  It also is entertaining for adults to watch.
0670034711|3.0|This book was definitely an interesting read. I learned a lot about culture, language, and world spirituality. Elizabeth Gilbert is an open-minded writer who does a great job portraying the world through her eyes. My only qualm about the book is that for such an educated person, she uses WAY too much vulgar language. I probably would not recommend this book to a friend simply because of the frequent use of the \\"F\\" word. It was extremely offensive to me and was not at all needed to illustrate her point. If not for this, the book would probably be one of my top ten reads.
B000002GVZ|5.0|Very happy I found this CD. The songs here bring back a lot of memories and are a real pleasure to listen to while driving or at the end of the day. I have always loved \\"Mockingbird\\" and I am thrilled to finally own it. I love this CD!!!!
0345522478|5.0|It almost seems as if the author was able to just sit down with pen and paper and this story wrote itself.It's effortless and rolls along, captivating the reader and carrying them along for a fantastical and yet somehow endearingly believable ride. Most of the pantheons of the world are represented even though the main character is a druid.    I won't rehash all the plot points since this is by no means the first review for this book. But it's very character driven. The Irish Wolfhound that is the druids pet is one of the main and most humorous characters. But there are also vampire and werewolf lawyers, a few oblivious deities, witches of several flavors, giants, and humans some of which are in the know and some of whom are thoroughly still shielded from the paranormal. It's divine to see how they interact! A surprisingly humorous, adventurous read. I got this book to pass the time but I am definitely going to have to get the next two books in the series.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Not only did this classic bring back fond memories of taking our own children to the movie when it came out, our grandchildren were mesmerized by the story, songs & fun.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Absolutely excellent TD game.  Graphics are great, play is great.  Xoom tablet.  Thanks Amazon for making free.  In fast mode, coins and health upgrades could hang out just a tad longer as someone else mentioned, but that's part of the price of playing on faster setting, I guess.  Might like to see screen orientation otions in future upgrades, but not a big deal.
0553801473|3.0|I loved the first four installments. It is hard to find another fantasy series that is as realistic and deliciously adult as this one. Having said that, however, I must admit that I am disappointed with the Dance.<br />First of all, it is a behemoth of a book. Not that I am scared by a big book, but this one could have easily been two. Another thing is, waiting for this book for 5 years, I forgot quite a few details. For example, I can barely remember how Tyrion ended in the ship hold, and where he is traveling. There are plenty of other character developments that escape me from the previous books.<br />Next, I was hoping for some situations to be resolved. More on Dany, Sansa, Arya, Jon, Bran, some positive changes in their lives. Instead, we get more characters...<br />Hopefully, the last two books will come out before I completely put this one out of my memory. I hope Mr. Martin is reading these reviews, because I am noticing a common theme to customers' responses here. Most of us are disappointed with this installment.<br />At this point, I am seriously considering whether to read the rest of the series. Just a few years ago, I couldn't imagine saying no to this series. Definitely, if it takes another five years for the next one, Mr. Martin can count me out.
B00006674X|5.0|very happy to see this movie and added to my collection

B004SB60OC|5.0|I first heard Christina Perri when she opened for James Blunt on his recent tour. I made a note to look for the CD because she was better than many opening acts I've seen.    At first glance, it's \\"oh, another one of those\\" -- that is, a female singer-songwriter no doubt trying to glamorize urban single womanhood by making it sound forlorn and depressing, where you're supposed to find more in the lyrics than in the music.    But it's not like that. The lyrics try to tell truth while being delivered in an uplifting way, and the music is (dare I say) quite inventive. It's not your run-of-the-mill delivery from a twentysomething female singer-songwriter.    In this regard, she is the female equivalent of Matt Nathanson or Royal Wood -- you think you know what you're about to get by looking at them, but actually get something many levels higher.    Each track has its own personality, and the music is varied enough within each track to hold your interest; the album flows well and feels whole; there is no apparent filler, and the album doesn't outstay its welcome length-wise.    What more can you ask for these days? Definitely worth a listen.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Its a good game same as PC version just has achievements.  cant say much more it works on MT4G good time killer
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is an incredibly gut wrenching book in the Hunger Games series. You will be so angry at the Capitol and President Snow's sick, twisted mind that you will catch yourself grinding your teeth. As if every District hasn't been through enough, the Capitol puts a disgusting twist on the Quell Games. I don't want to give anything away but you will start to wish Katniss and Peeta were together (I did) and be extremely off guard with every character. Pay attention to every detail...every one of them are important when you get close to the end. This series is extraordinary and I know that I will miss each and every one of the characters that have been in them. This series is a must read for all ages.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I would like to say this is my first review of anything I have purchased and I decided to finally review a product because the G155 blew me away. I received my G155 on July 13th and it is amazing. First off I want to address a common gripe about this being a portable unit. When you look up the definition of portable it states, \\"able to be easily carried or moved,\\" or as a noun, \\"a version of something, such as a small lightweight television or computer, that can be easily carried.\\" Ok now that I got that out of the way on to the review.<br /><br />The screen delivers a great picture and yes the viewing angles to the sides are not the best but it was only designed with one to two players in mind. I have tried many different games on it now and they have looked great. (COD: Black Ops, Dirt 3, Halo: Reach and Batman: Arkham Asylum to name a few) I have not suffered from any lag. I have noticed that when I open the case and I am not sitting high enough the picture will be slightly darker and I have to raise my chair up to get the best picture. I believe it was a great idea to go with the 720P over 1081 because the average game is built for 720P so it makes sense not to introduce lag by trying to push a 720P picture into a 1081 format. The included 7\\" HDMI cable is a nice plus too.<br /><br />The speakers are good but they lack presence. They are not high end but middle of the pack type speakers. You can adjust the EQ settings and get a little more punch from them but don't expect to get amazing sound. I prefer to use headsets anyway because I do not like to disturb others and you pick up sound cues better then TV speakers. There are two headphone jacks right below the screen which is nice when the parents want to keep the noise down but the kids want to get their game on or vice versa. :D<br /><br />The case itself is very well built. I do not fear dropping the case because it is padded and designed to be safe for transportation. The handle has a nice grip to it and I believe it holds the case very well. The latches on the G155 are sturdy and it is nice that they were designed to include the option of placing a lock on either side of the case. I do not find it hard to carry around despite its size. It has two mesh-like bags inside that hold your cords and controllers. I have been able to fit all my cords and a controller inside them. For those who look at the straps that secure the xbox 360 or PS3 to the case, it does not block the vent and does not overheat the console. I had my xbox 360 going for about four hours straight and while it did get warm, it did not overheat or seem too hot. My home xbox 360 gets about the same temperature and it is out in the open with plenty of air and room.<br /><br />Overall, Gaems designed a safe, secure and fun product that casual to hardcore gamers can use when they are at home or not. I would have preferred to have the remote included, a shoulder strap, better speakers, a way to carry a game or two inside the case and maybe a way to adjust the level of the screen once the case is opened. However, for the price, it is very rewarding. I travel a lot and there is down time from time to time at my work and I bring it in to play during those times and at lunch. I have not been disappointed by this purchase.  The G155 is worth the investment and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />On a side but equally important note, Customer Service from the Gaems crew is outstanding. They have a specifically made Twitter account just to get support and they are always willing to help and take in new ideas. It is nice to know that they take care of and value their customers.elieve it holds the case very well.

B0057A6GA6|4.0|I'm enjoying the campaign mode and it's a very good time waster. But I just don't see myself playing this after today
B004WPYNY8|5.0|First of all, I am huge fan of SyX. Second, I have all the albums of Dream Theater (and I will go on buying them), but I find their song writing, particularly their melodic approach, to be poor. Third, I am also huge fan of prog rock, especially Jethro Tull and Yes. Last of all, I think progressive rock/metal is not confined to odd signatures, sign changes, virtuosity, etc. (which I will call \\"straightforward prog\\" in this review), but do something novel in terms of music. The reason, I write this list at the beginning of my review is to stress that you're reading a biased review (just like all other reviews), but at least you can decide on whether to buy the album or not, based on whether my tastes are similar to yours.    A few misconceptions of the album. This is NOT Paradise Lost II! PL was more of a straightforward prog metal album. This album is purely heavy metal. Actually, this how Black Sabbath should have sounded if they had progressed from '75. Here comes to the second misconception: \\"this album is not progressive metal, we miss old SyX\\". Again wrong! If you listen closely, you can hear almost everything about old SyX. The great achievement of this album (and Michael Romeo) is that this album succeeds in combining everything cool about metal music in the same pot. You hear a thrash metal riff, backed up with contemporary classical influenced choral and keyboard work, and this has never been more fluid even for  SyX previously. Or you can hear some very fast interludes of guitar and drum, but not exactly you would hear from a thrash band, but with subtle proggy touches. It is easily possible to miss these \\"progressive\\" parts, but that is the main success of the album. These are metal songs, but written in a novel way. The questions that I ask to decide whether an album is great or not are, whether the songs are great, and whether this album will be musically influential. Both answers are YES! I think that Iconoclast will create a new metal style, combiningheavy riffs, melodic stuff, with straightforward prog metal.    Those who think V is better, please realize V was based on Verdi's theme with John Williams styles themes repeated through the whole album, and with some Mozart also. Though V was a great album, what we get at the end is a very nice adaptation of these original masters to heavy metal.. Now we have 100% pure SyX, and they are getting even better with each release.
0553386794|1.0|Martin shows obvious talent in his incredible attention to detail and genesis of environment.  However, I strongly feel that his talent is clouded by appetite.  I'm not very critical of books, I just like a good read, but there is so much indecent sex and so much shameless violence that I wonder if I want to insert my own mind in the dark world that a similarly classified author can create!  After one too many rapes, murdering of children, incest, and embarrassingly detailed accounts of bride exploitations, I finally had to put the book down, never to be picked up again.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this book.  Unless of course, you are the type to justify corruption and a complete lack of decency because it's the only way to live out your dark fantasies... then maybe you will like this book - and add to what's going wrong with this world.<br /><br />Now, if you want to enjoy authors that are just as talented in writing technique, go pick up a Tolkien or Sanderson book.  That's real talent: the ability to entertain without introducing degrading passion and violence.
B004132HZS|2.0|Sherlock Holmes was not made for the 21st century. I hated the modern verison.  Didn't even watch the second part.
B004XWMXX8|1.0|I have bought many CDs in my time for myself and my kids. Usually,when it comes to my kids' music, I buy it and listen to it with an open mind, usually being able to understand the attraction for them even if I don't appreciate it myself. This CD is utter garbage. I think I would expect better from my grade 8 music students ( I have been a music teacher for 20 years). It is a collection of complete and utter trash and is insulting to anyone who spends their hard earned cash on it.
B003F1WM2K|2.0|Given all the awards, good press, and opening chapter of the book, I had high hopes. The book did not live up to the hype and was actually pretty mediocre. There was way too much name dropping of all those 1960s writers and musicians and I have a hard time believing that all she described really happened. I thought all the references to French poets was a bit pretentious. The 1960s and New York City have been written about so much, no new ground was covered here. And the writing was just dull, it reads like something out of a diary, there wasn't a whole lot of introspection and I don't feel like I learned much about Smith as an artist. Maybe this book would make more sense if I was a Smith or Mappletorpe fan (I didn't know their work well before reading this but was hoping to get a better sense of who they were through this book); but the book on its own didn't meet my expectations.
B004132HZS|2.0|$24.99 for a mere 3 episodes is ridiculous. One could argue that with the length that it's equivalent to 6 episodes of a normal TV show, but that's still a ridiculous price.    Shame, because it's a great show and well worth watching. Wish I had recorded it 'live' when I had the chance. Course, I can also watch it on Netflix or Amazon Prime any time I want and I don't have to pay the exorbitant price for it.    Correction - I can get it from Netflix but not yet Amazon Prime. Gotta work on that Amazon - your selection of titles on Prime is still pathetic and you've got new competition with WalMart in the game.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|My favorite movies have always been foreign. I hardly ever watch American Movies. I had already bought the first Cranford for my collection and so very glad \\"Return to Cranford\\" was made.    Loved it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't share other people's opinion that the \\"Feast for Crows\\" is a failure. I think that this is the best book so far, though I haven't read the fifth book yet. Why am I saying this? I think Martin's writing is much more mature in this book than in the previous ones. It is true that the plot is not advancing at a fast pace, but in my opinion this not a bad thing. For me, the much deeper characterization makes up for the lack of action. We get a much more intimate view into the minds of the different point of view characters.    (The following explanations may contain spoilers for some, beware.)    I loved the way we could glimpse into the minds of Cersei and Jaime. Their chapters are simply brilliantly written. Just a little example to show Martin's new way of letting us go deeper into the characters: Whenever Jamie looks at Cersei flirting or just being nice with other men he always remembers Tyrion's remark \\"...she's been ****ing Lancel and Osmund Kettleback and Moonboy for all I know...\\" This little sentence appears at least a hundred times in Jamie's chapters, and it does not become boring, on the contrary. It shows how tormented and jealous Jamie is. Repetition is a powerful way to emphasize emotions; Martin uses it to a great effect.    The previous example was only one out of many. I enjoyed Cersei's chapters, too. It is a bold an welcome change that a really \\"evil\\" character was chosen as an important point of view character for this book. It is good that we get to know what motivates this almost insane woman, and how power and unjustified self-confidence can lead to a borderline personality.    I can understand that after the furious and action-packed \\"Storm of Swords\\" some readers felt that this book is a disappointment. Not for me. But those who need battles and sword-fights and characters dying each chapter may feel cheated. Please, look more closely. This book is a gem. You can rarely read a better description of what psychological effects war and power have on people's minds.     All in all, definitely a five-star book, but I must admit this is not everybody's piece of cake.

B003EYVXSW|2.0|Oh, those pesky outside-the-box scientists.  Give them a chance and they'll cut, splice, and dice DNA combos until they wind up with something that looks like Lady Gaga's meat costume--yet it can do your taxes.  And ethics?  Ethics schmethics.  We've got deadly diseases to cure!  Where's that test tube that had the ostrich bullion amino acids?  Over there, next to the cornish hen hamster.<br /><br />Thus we establish the premise of SPLICE, an out-of-control belly wobbler about a pair of geneticists who create first two globs of liver spot punching bags, then add human DNA to this mix and create. . .well, something between what you find in a bucket of KFC and what you slip a dollar bill to at the strip pole.  As we all know, the mutant is going to run amuck and cause massive carnage, and that our two scientists (Adrien Brody, who needs a meal, and Sarah Polley, who needs a valium) are going to face ethical and moral dilemmas that will challenge the foundation of whatever the nature of their relationship is.  Delphine Chaneac plays Dren, the creature, and when she's not sprouting wings or flicking a poison-tipped tail she's making noises akin to my accountant after a bottle of Wellers.  Sure turn-ons for Brody--that naughty scientist.<br /><br />We even come across a Brody clone in Brandon McGibbon, who plays Brody's brother, so SPLICE is actually Adrien Brody squared, which should be scary, but like everything else in this howler it's not.  I don't know why I give two stars to a horror movie I enjoyed so much it made me laugh all the way through; maybe it was the liver spot punching bags.  Call PETA.<br />--D.

1400052181|5.0|Before I started reading the book, I started reading the reviews to find out what different magazines, newspapers, journalists and critics had to say.  The reviews were positive and good.  That was a good indicator that I would enjoy the book.    I cannot put the book down.  I am almost finished with the book.  If you are interested in history and science, this book is for you.  I am grateful that this book is the Summer campus read for the school I attend. I am glad that I am reading this book.  Everyone should read this book when it is convenient for them.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.    Great book!

1582701709|1.0|Wow...I saw this film then read the book and was staggered by how over the top and under the credibility this was. For anyone who really does pay attention to human achievement studies this hurts. It's victory for those who think that positive thinking is only for the loony, chakra-balancing, talisman-wearing, crystal-adorned. It's so far over the top that I had a hard time getting through it. I can sum it up by paraphrasing one of its own final pieces of advice. 'if ever you have a question or challenge in your life, think of it and open up this book, and that page will contain your answer.' Sigh...this sets back the field by decades. Don't bother.

0316017930|5.0|A person considered an outlier is an individual excluded from the main group of people due to factors like intelligence quotient (IQ), success, physical activity performance etc. Malcolm Galdwell lucidly explains that the few number of people that have achieved great success is not due to their own will but other factors such as family, economics, education, environment they were raised etc. He makes a compelling argument to re-assess the way we view successful people. He also proposes that we should re-assess how we employ or select people whether for sports teams or eduction endevors to help many people to become more successful. The book is among the favorites of the books I have read. Great book and I highly recommend it.
B004N44SOI|4.0|Well I gotta admit that my first impressions of this album were not good, but it has turned out to be another case of not taking too much notice of songs posted on YouTube.  That's probably a good avenue to watch officially released film clips or to get a snippet of something from the forthcoming album of an artist that you like or are familiar with.  But if it's an artist you aren't totally into or haven't heard before, then I think it's well worth giving the album a fair go before making judgments and This Is Gonna Hurt is proof of that.<br />Yes this is Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx's baby, but really his playing isn't that outstanding that you'd actually know he was here at all if it wasn't his name on the cover.  On the other hand, current Guns N Roses guitarist DJ Ashba is all over it and proves that he really is one talented dude.  As well as handling guitars, I read somewhere that apparently he wrote most of the music and programmed the drums, and I really am hoping that he and Axl give us something new within the decade!  James Michael also shows us here that he is a very competent singer with quite a good voice, without being brilliant.<br />Stylistically this album is very hard to categorise because there are many completely different styles of music on offer here.  At times I hear the modern rock sound of 30 Seconds To Mars, particularly on Are You With Me (my favorite song on the album) and I hear a U2 sound on Oh My God (my equal favorite song on the album).  Then there's the country-pop flavored semi-ballad Sure Feels Right, the mellow piano and string instruments on Skin, and the hard hitting modern rock flavour on songs like the title track and Lies Of The Beautiful People (another two of my favorites).  There's also the piano and acoustic guitar ballad Smile which is quite a mellow song but I love it.  The other ballads on this album don't really work for me but this one sure does.  I'm convinced that the reason for this is because it sounds so much like an Aerosmith ballad that it actually sounds a little weird that Steven Tyler isn't actually singing it, that's how much of a fit I think it is for him.<br />The thing is with an album like this which varies so much stylistically there's bound to be some songs that just don't really do it for me (and probably most people who listen to it actually).  It's a total contrast of peaks and valleys with the former being the songs I've already mentioned that I like, and the latter being the awful Goodbye My Friends and Deadlihood (and why is it that Nikki Sixx has to have at least one song with \\"Hollywood\\" in the lyrics on just about every album he does?)  There are also the average songs in Live Forever, Help Is On The Way, Sure Feels Right and Skin which aren't really bad songs but aren't anything special and fall way short of the really good songs that are on this album.<br />Then there are the lyrics on Skin which get right up my nose.  Maybe they might strike a chord with the drop-outs, the disadvantaged, or the disenfranchised youth of the Y generation who feel underappreciated and full of self pity, but I don't fit into any of those categories.  So I just find the lyrics annoying and can't help thinking \\"get over it buddy and take a big swig of harden-the-f__k-up!\\"<br />On the other hand I find the lyrics of Oh My God quite poignant and thought provoking.  In total contrast to Skin the lyrics of this song really do strike a chord with me in a way in which I can't actually recall lyrics doing for a very long time.  When I listen to this song it does make me wonder why there is such a divide and inequality in our society and indeed why have we become immune to seeing tragedy and suffering unfolding before us on the 24 hour a day TV news?  I also find I question myself as to whether I have personally done (or am I doing) enough for my fellow man during my short existence on this planet?<br />Hmmm... pretty deep stuff for one of my reviews.  Anyway, despite it's flaws this is still a very good album.very good album.
0553801473|2.0|A long wait and so disappointing. The book was wordy and overly descriptive. How much detail do we really need when a person is eating... I don't really care about what the people are eating, I want a progressive plot. Unless the food is somehow moving the plot along, I just don't care. This goes as well for the lengthy deep thinking done by many of the characters, which actually come out as a lot of woe is me. The book could have been cut by 400 words. I found myself drifting off a lot, or skimming quickly through pages to get back to the plot. Some of the characters, such as Davos, were so boring that I almost skipped their chapters. The past books have been so good, this left me numb.
B001GQO50I|3.0|I do like some of the performances on this set. The sound quality is not good for an official release. For those that collect bootleg shows, this is very average sounding. If I had paid full price, I may have given it a one star review also.  rating it as I would rate my other bootleg shows, I would give it a B- or C+. If your interested in this set, I wouldnt reccommend paying full price. You would be much better off getting Absolutly Live, Live at Cobo, Live in New york, In other words almost any other live Doors show besides this. another live Doors to beware of is live in Vancover. Its a good set , but the quality is not much better than this set
B000FC1HBY|2.0|The first few books were brilliant, but this one compared to those seems lackluster and lazy.   For something that ultimately is this \\"late\\" beyond its original promised date (by the author) I was saddened to see him re-using the same plot elements over and over so frequently that plausibility shoots right out the window.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|An app of this level of quality is always appreciated, especially when it is the free app of the day.<br /><br />I was determined to try yesterday's... it couldn't be that bad, could it?  It wasn't good, nothing to hold interest, no &quot;carrot&quot; or clue as to what the word might be.  And basic issues; leave the app, lose all progress in your game.  I mention that app because this one doesn't have the technical deficits of yesterday's, and some of the other apps.<br /><br />I love word games, I must have eight or ten of them, some were the FAotD.  Any app well made is welcome, and this app, escapist fun that it absolutely ous, is nonetheless challenging, very polished, as another reviewer noted, and tremendous fun.<br /><br />Don't pass it up because it isn't &quot;highbrow&quot; - fun is fun, word play done well, but equally a game like this, which requires thought and strategy and thoughtfully provides four different play styles.  A beginner to this type of game can jump right in at casual and be challenged, but not overwhelmed.
B000003TAL|4.0|... I don't get it at all, definitely the low point of this album, sorry.. Also this is a record that you have to listen to a couple of times until you get it but in other ways it's pretty kewl !
B004PVKFR8|1.0|I wanted to check out AWOLNATION after hearing the single \\"Sail\\".  Right away I was disappointed as nothing else on this album sounded nearly the same and for the most part just sounded like some very basic, cookie-cutter pop music.  Too many of the songs were upbeat and felt like they should be the score for some Adam Sandler love story.  I can't really say much about the actual music... I suppose it sounded all right, but for the most part just not my thing.  The only track that I liked was the one that got me interested in the CD, so if you're like me and wanting to get it because you liked \\"Sail\\" save your time and money.
B0056NYMXC|4.0|The title of Kelly Rowland's third studio album is no accident. Years after singing songs like \\"Soldier\\" and \\"Independent Women\\" as 1/3 of Destiny's Child and some solo success including the Grammy Award winning smash \\"When Love Takes Over,\\" Rowland is officially charting her own path with \\"Here I Am\\". While defiant, like the sensual chart-topping single \\"Motivation,\\" \\"Here I Am\\" is heavy on self affirmation and confidence but light on everything else.    Led by the fiery declaration \\"I'm Dat Chick,\\"  in which Rowland thrusts \\"I tell them keep on talking cause` I love the attention,\\" \\"Here I Am\\" packs enough punch to excite listeners for some time but will likely be drowned out by more pressing and inventive tunes from others. Perhaps it is the buzz behind \\"Motivation\\" that raised expectations, add to that a defining performance at the 2011 BET Awards, but \\"Here I Am\\" leaves you wavering between commendation and boredom after a few listens. That is not to say \\"Here I Am\\" is an effort filled with mediocrity, it is, like a lot of albums today, one that has its timeless songs and others that last for a fleeting moment.    Three tracks that stand out, beyond the already successful \\"Motivation\\" and \\"Commander,\\" are \\"Turn It Up,\\" \\"Feelin Me Right Now,\\" and \\"All of the Night\\".    \\"Turn It Up,\\" an infectious record that kicks off with Rowland singing \\"I could tear the whole world down,\\" fits well with her vocal prowess. While not as much a dance record, like \\"Commander,\\" \\"Turn It Up\\" goes down smooth as Rowland sings to the former object of her affection who just so happens to be with another woman she could \\"tell everything\\". Apt, \\"Turn It Up\\" follows the similarly fluid \\"Feeling Me Right Now\\". Daring, like \\"Motivation\\" and \\"I'm Dat Chick,\\" this song finds Rowland singing \\"don't you leave without my handcuffs, I made some special plans for us tonight\\".  Handcuffs aren't the only thing Kelly coos about on this album, which is, if nothing else, way more intense, sexually, than any of her other efforts.  \\"All of the Night,\\" following the aforementioned in order, plays heavily to that end opening with the line \\"In the middle of the bedroom, kitchen or the hallway, just give me a little legroom and a little bit of foreplay\\".    If the sex-driven songs are not your thing, Kelly does take a moment to recognize relationships, at least her man in particular. Drafting fellow Houston-native Lil Playy, Rowland attempts to applaud the love of a \\"Work It Man\\" who \\"ain't scared\\" to carry her baggage. That all goes south however, on \\"Heaven & Earth,\\" a strong ballad (one of few on the album, \\"Keep It Between Us\\" another),  as she cries out \\"no more feeling sorry for myself cause I know my worth... because I know I deserve heaven and earth,\\" as she kicks her man to the curb.    While Kelly spends much of this album playing with radio friendly R&B/Urban Pop, sans \\"Lay It On Me,\\" she revisits the music that earned her much solo success in recent years -- dance. Led by the chart-topping single \\"Commander,\\" Rowland picks up where she left off with \\"When Love Takes Over\\" on songs like the stomp worthy \\"Down For Whatever\\" followed by the bonus track \\"Each Other,\\" an equally infectious record perfect for clubs.    Overall, Kelly Rowland deserves praise for taking a chance with this album, arguably her best effort to date. While it lacks the punch necessary to make it a smash, it is a worthy upgrade that could lead to greater solo success. After all, this is \\"Here I Am\\" not \\"All I Have\\". If you must make a few selections, listen to \\"Turn It Up,\\" \\"Feelin' Me Right Now,\\" \\"Lay It On Me,\\" \\"Motivation,\\" \\"Down For Whatever\\" and \\"All of the Night\\".
B002GHIPYI|4.0|UPDATE: 7/16/13<br /><br />** I've been using these almost daily for two years, and the headphones continue to function as if new. All in all, the sound performance with these is above average, and the affordable price makes this a great deal. The Superlux HD 681 wear comfortably on the head, fitting with cushions over the ears and molding well to the head. Sound quality shouldn't be compared to top-of-the line headphones, but these provide reasonable, above-average depth and sound clarity. I use these casually, listening to a full gamut of genres (rock, jazz, classical, hip hop, audiobooks, etc.) and find the headphones work well with the characteristics of all these audio genres. The only negative is the occasional slight distortion at louder volumes; the bass isn't superb, but that could be the Ipod version I'm using with these. The only other point worth noting is their relative bulky size, but the solid construction and notable sound quality overrides this point for me. Overall, two years in and I would continue to recommend these to casual audio listeners.  **<br /><br />The price of these headphones gives them a great value. Overall quality is pretty good. The headphones are comfortable on your ears; however, occasionally the headphones can irritate the top of your head, but with a little readjustment comfort is restored! Sound quality is good. I'm not an audio expert, but I definitely enjoy these. Appearance is one area where these are slightly lacking. The top of the headphones (as the image shows) stand out, so if you are trying to look \\"fly\\" in your 'phones, these might not be the best unit. But, I have not problem with it. All in all, I would recommend these to a casual or beginner headphone connoisseur...

B003YL4LYI|2.0|The first half of the book was a complete waste of time. Dragged endlessly and I'd rate it zero stars. The second half things actually did move (pretty slowly), so I'd rate it at 3 stars. For the size of the book (too much), there was an unbelievable lack of \\"stuff\\" in it (too little).<br />Arya, Cersei and Brienne/Jaime sections should have been removed. Their stories moved by such a miniscule amount that they were lost in the clutter. Tyrion/Jon/Stannis sections meandered endlessly and ended abruptly.<br />The only storylines that did move were Dany, Bran and perhaps the ironborn (at a frustratingly slow pace).<br />The cast of characters is huge and the spotlight seems to move erratically among them, highlighting them seemingly at random and moving on before you've had a chance to take note or even care (eg. action in Dorne). Or it stays on them endlessly as they go about the humdrum details of daily life (Tyrion/Jon).<br /><br />I did not feel the time and money I spent were worth it. I'm abandoning the series. A pity, the beginning was so great.
B005EF6KUU|5.0|This is one of the few episodes each season which is used to set up the rest of the season.  Without spoiling it, think of Very Bad Things.<br /><br />One problem I did have is that every time the scene switched to Jesse's \\"home\\" I had to turn the sound way down.  When you combine his sound system with a good home theater, you get ear-splitting results.  A bit of advice:  Keep your volume control close.<br /><br />Watch the little things in this episode.  If you know this series, you know how important miniscule details become.
B000UR9QHQ|3.0|As for the Halloween movie itself it deserves 5/5 stars. However for this BluRay edition I have to give it 3 stars because nothing special is included, the insert isn't anything either, and the blue \\"hue\\" lighting that looks amazing at the end has been removed from the film completely. That was an awesome part of the film for me. It really made the film feel spooky. Other then that, the transfer is beautiful. I just hope in the future there is a better release for this movie on Blu Ray that includes a good insert, special features, and the blue lighting. Oh, and I got it for $5 at Walmart.
0307739961|5.0|These books keep getting better. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third in the series and I loved it.
0307477479|4.0|The plot could be described as a web of characters and events gradually woven together back and forth through time.  I would certainly recommend this book.
B004UHF51S|5.0|From the moment I viewed the promotional video for the title track \\"Now That the Summer's Here\\", I knew we had another winner from Michael. I was once more drawn immediately into the warmth of his unique, tender and catchy style and incredible lyrical poetry.  The excellent band gives sterling support and the beguiling bossa-nova rhythms are just magical. Can't stop playing it.  We listen in our summer-house, and it's also very relaxing on car journeys. Every track is a gem, my favourites of the moment being \\"Samba Blue\\" and \\"One Day in St. Tropez\\".  I was of that 1963 era.  That Brasilian guitar just makes you melt! Truly this man adores Jobim, as do I. My own heart said \\"Wow\\"!  \\"Flora\\" should come with 'Kleenex' - for anyone,including ourselves, who has just lost a much-loved friend from the animal world. The last track, \\"Feathers from an Angel's Wing\\" includes the kind of bass solo I love, where the instrument rises from its usual position of undergirding the tune, to render its own beautiful sound as if to say, \\"I don't just do bass, I can sing, too!\\"  The perfect track to close this magical collection. I haven't felt like this since Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\". Every so often, a special musical person comes along.  This is Michael Franks, and there is no other like him.  I truly believe he is touched by God. Top marks, and more if they were available. If this CD doesn't win every award going, I shall want to know why. Thank you, thank you.   Liz Ashton (UK)
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Everytime I needed to search for an app on my ever increasing stockpile I would gripe about androids lack of a functional system to accomplish simple organization... not anymore! This app has changed my life and has made me love my phone again!
B004HNTER6|4.0|The first thing you need to know is this is a Region 2 PAL DVD. I have a region-free DVD player so I could play it no problem but most DVD players in the U.S. will not play this movie.     This is a first rate documentary of the racing career of Senna and I really enjoyed it. Interviews are recorded in the original languages (some are in English) and have subtitles available in Portugese and Italian. The second 'Extra Features' disk has English subtitles available. I didn't really see much there to watch.    Enough of the interviews are in English so even without subtitles, I could follow much of the story and it is a great story.    I have this movie in Blu-Ray also and bought this thinking it would add English subtitles so I could see what was missing from the Blu-Ray.  The main feature is the same -- Portugese and Italian subtitles only.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have always hated virtual keyboards, which is why I chose a Droid 2 to have a physical keyboard to rely on. This app has changed my perspective! I love it and use it all the time now!   The privacy issue concerned me at first, but I. actually read the privacy statement and it guaranteed that all saved information is stored on your phone's SD card and encrypted so I feel secure about it... as long as the phone stays in my hands... all is well.   I would like to see the keyboard recognize a period so that it would automatically capitalize the first word of the next sentence. However, this one is a keeper and worth the price!
B000JML7EC|4.0|I never read this book as a kid, and I don't even remember seeing the movie.  I have a whole new view on eating at Long John Silvers now!<br /><br />I thought it was an enjoyable story, albeit a bit far-fetched that young Jim was so capable, and that Long John could get around so well on a crutch.  Despite that, it was a fun read, and one I will recommend to my kids.
0307279189|5.0|This book was shown to me as \\"the bible of minimal support running\\" and I do believe this holds true.  I found this to be a good book from beginning to end.  I found the beginning to be more the story and character development, and the last half being more informative on running style and technique, not to say that each half did not have the other.  Definitely worth the time to read this book, everyone will take away from this.  I have started running in five-finger-vibrams,  and haven't looked back since, using techniques that i learned from this book to help correct some problems that I have been having in the past. So far so good.
055357342X|5.0|\\"A Storm of Swords\\" is the third book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire.  What I like most about this series is the unexpected twists, the strategic alliances and betrayals as the various families take part in the \\"game of thrones\\", and the willingness of Martin to kill off major characters in the story.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of this series and this book in particular is the blurry line between honor and dishonor.  Some characters are pure evil with dishonorable actions, but others show flashes of good and honor that are a bit surprising at times.  I think the book is somewhat realistic in that the common man typically wants to provide for his family and do the right thing while the rich and powerful are somewhat corrupt.<br /><br />Martin does a great job of balancing multiple story lines at the same time and transitioning between the battle in the North, the battle over the seven kingdoms, and Daenerys rise in the East.  It will be exciting to see all of these stories come together in later books!<br /><br />!! Warning !! There are some sex scenes in the book.  They are not graphic, and you can easily skip over them if that is offensive.
0765326353|5.0|I cannot overstate how much I love this start to his new series, and I'm giddy with anticipation for the next. The way that Sanderson builds this alien yet amazing world is mind-blowing to me, and a huge inspiration in my own attempts at writing. One thing I've always loved about his work is Sanderson's ability to create a completely new world from book to book, series to series, but still make it seem fresh and unknown.<br /><br />Some are saying that this is a slow read, and that certainly might be true for people who prefer battles and action to the quiet introspection of characters, but I think that the characters and the setting are well worth the time you invest in this book. Sanderson has said himself that this is larger in scope than anything else he's written, and that's readily apparent in the story itself; so something as big as this world takes time to get rolling. However, I never felt like the story was lagging, or that things were moving too slowly. I enjoy reading about a new world and the people who inhabit it as much as I enjoy the action and mystery, so I drank in every detail that Sanderson put into this book.<br /><br />On the one hand, I wish I hadn't read this book because now I have to wait years for the next installment. On the other hand, I'm so glad I read this book because it opened up my mind creatively in a way that I've only experienced from a few novels, and I have read a TON of novels.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I've watched this multiple times already.  A very good rendition of Northanger Abbey.  It's not completely true to the book but very close in many ways.  The characters are portrayed much like the book describes them all, right down to Mrs. Allen's obsessions with her gowns and fashion.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, you should buy this movie.
B004FECNIO|5.0|A Great SiFi Classic, what if, ? this could be a window in to our Future, you never know till its too Late!
B000244FDW|5.0|I have every version of Pride & Prejudice and this is my second favorite version, only 2nd to the 1995 A & E version.  This version is very, very close to the book in ways that the 1995 movie was not.  The movie is more \\"masterpiece theater\\" type instead of Hollywood, but once you start watching you'll find that it is charming in ways that the newest Pride & Prejudice with Kiera Knightly was not.  The characters are endearing, except for Mr. Darcy.  He is stanch, cold, and proud--exactly as he should be.  Then he becomes a very endearing character as you see him change b/c of Elizabeth.  If you are a Pride & Prejudice fan and haven't seen this movie, buy it.
B0030Y11O2|5.0|Say what you want about Michael Moore , at least he is trying to wake america up, but no one wants to belive it, the empire has fallen, and soon we will all be Surf's slaving away for the corporations, just too bad a greedy and powerful few has so much power over the masses until the wake up and take control, and responsibility, over their own lives,, I am a afraid, nothing will change,,, A must see, and think about.

B0056NYMXC|4.0|I'm so proud of her. Overall the album is amazing! Some of my favorite songs are: Feeling me Right now, Turn it up, All of the nights, Keep it between us, Heaven & Earth , and of course Motivation. She doesn't want to be put in a box and i can appreciate that. It's not just urban r&b or dance. At the end of the day, if its good music who cares about the genre? She has come a long way and deserves the commercial success just like Beyonce. People need to stop comparing the two because at the end of the day its not Kelly vs. Beyonce, its Kelly and Beyonce vs the world!
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is a great movie, as anyone who has seen it will atest.  I purchased it for my 5 year old on Amazon, because it's by far the best palce to find those videos which are no longer readily available.  The person I purchased from was great, sent the item promtply and I am highly satisfied!
B0057A6GA6|4.0|this game along with half the other apps Amazon gives away are always free on the actual Google Android Market.  kinda lame Amazon ...kinda lame...
0553801473|2.0|Much of what I feel about this book has already been said.  I had thought to give it three stars until I realized it would be an injustice rating the book based mainly on the nostalgia I felt for the first three books of the series.  After due consideration, I believe I gave it a fair rating as a book unto itself.<br /><br />The first three books gave a story that was epic and sweeping when it all began with A Game of Thrones.  But as the books moved forward and the span of time between them grew to monolithic proportions, it has become obvious that the author has run out of story and would rather fill the product with fodder and call it a book.  It's very disappointing to see such a great story lose sight of itself due to the author's obvious lack of love for his own work.  I'm of the mind that GRRM is more in love with the marketing of himself (i.e. the sorely lacking cable series and other works) than his own story.<br /><br />I bought the book in hopes that the wait was worth it, only to find that the reason why it took so long for this installment to be released was because it shouldn't have been released at all.  Unfortunate for everyone to have waited for so long only to find that the spirit and heart of this series have long been extinguished.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder Roleplaying game is an awesome system to move onto after D&d 3.5. Instead of changing the entire system like 4.0 does it keeps the spirit of the game that we all know and love but adds new elements to classes, revises spells and abilities and makes the game fresh.<br /><br />The Core Rulebook is an excellent addition to your collection and contains base races, classes, prestige classes, and all the basic information you would need to play or GM a game. Unlike D&d there is no need to purchase a DMG since this book covers all the basics that you need. Definitely would recommend  adding this to your tabletop RPG collection.
630512762X|5.0|I saw Face/Off in the movie theatre when it first came out.  For years now, I have missed it.  After purchasing this masterpiece on Amazon I was brought back to life with the inpirational, perfect, eerie and accurate perfomances of these two power packing actors.  You will love to hate them both.
1601251831|5.0|The pathfinder bestiary devotes a page to every entry and includes pictures for almost all  of them. This has been lacking in other Monster manuals I've used before and I was very pleased to see this. If you like having illustrations and a hardcopy rather than using the d20 site this is a good buy.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|The directors have done an awesome job bringing this book to reality in a TV show. It's suspenseful, entertaining, and I can't wait to see what will happen next. Such a great show. I watched the whole first season on ABCFamily and couldn't wait to have my own copy. Worth every penny!
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is one of those truly rare films that grabbed my attention and held it all the way through even though I knew how it would all end--this story is well known to many historians and some non-historians like myself know at least parts of the tale. The film succeeds because of the excellent acting by a five star cast; and the musical score is exceptional. The choreography and the cinematography impressed me as well. The plot moves along smoothly without being boring or excessively melodramatic.<br /><br />The film starts in 1925 and King George V of England (Michael Gambon) asks his second son, The Duke of York (Colin Firth), to make a closing speech at The Empire Exhibition in Wembley, London. The Duke of York dreads public speaking because he suffers from an embarrassing problem with stuttering. The speech does not go well; together he and his wife (Helena Bonham Carter, who would become Queen Elizabeth), try just about every doctor, specialist and speech therapist to no avail. After some time, however, the future Queen Elizabeth discovers an Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush); and she convinces her husband to try Lionel's unconventional treatments which combine speech therapy with physical exercises, humor and some kindly psychotherapy.<br /><br />We also see things becoming more complicated with the passage of time. The Duke's father, King George V, grows old, becomes disoriented and dies; this makes his first son King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). Yet King Edward VIII was romantically involved with a twice divorced woman named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best); and it isn't long before he abdicates the throne to marry her--leaving his brother, The Duke of York, still with a speech problem, in the uncomfortable position of having to ascend to the throne. Worse yet for the new King is that he becomes England's leader at a time when Europe was headed toward war with Germany and almost certainly other countries as well.<br /><br />I could tell you much more; I've already left out some of the plot and I won't write about the rest so I don't ruin it for you! Suffice it to say that the story plays out with elegance and poignancy and much credit is due to the actors, especially Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. In addition, look for solid performances by Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain; Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill; Jennifer Ehle as Myrtle Logue and Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang.<br /><br />The DVD has an optional running commentary with director Tom Hooper; a featurette entitled The King's Speech: An Inspirational Story of an Unlikely Friendship; a Q&A session with the director and the cast; another featurette about the real Lionel Logue--and more!<br /><br />The King's Speech is a brilliant and most sensitive portrayal of the man who hesitantly became King George VI of England as he conquered his speech disability with the help of a kindly, unconventional therapist. The friendship these two men gradually develop is touching as well. The other characters in this film are faultlessly showcased, too. I recommend this film for anyone who likes inspiring dramas based very much on real life events; and fans of the actors in this film would do well to get this for their collections.I've already left out some of the plot and I won't write about the rest so I don't ruin it for you!

B003ZSJ212|2.0|This review is in specific reference to the packaging Fox is using for the U.S. Blu-Ray release of the Star Wars Saga.  Like the Alien Anthology, Fox has opted to use a sleeve-book case.  Not a multi-disc BD case, not slim BD cases, not even a digipak.  Just the lackluster protection of cardboard sleeves to guard the Blu-Ray discs.    However, from the pictures I've seen, the UK release uses a more commonsense case design (either a multi-disc BD case or slim BD cases in a box).    Using a case like this for a catalog title of this magnitude is utterly disgusting.  I've already cancelled my Amazon pre-order and intend to import the UK edition...assuming they don't adopt a similar, eco-friendly, junk-design cover.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|You know, like I stated in my last album review with Beyonce, I used to LOVE this girl; when she was with DC, I used to want to be just like Beyonce and Letoya! I admired their beauty, grace, talent...and more importantly their modesty! Even when Bey first went solo, I was so excited to see  her doin her thang! Lol! But after \\"Dangerously In Love\\" I started to see changes in Beyonce; she became NARCISSISTIC, arrogant, dishonest, over-saturated, conniving, addicted to the attention, she became more revealing (as far as outfits), and her music started to take a turn for the worst; she abandoned the genre that she can prevail in---which is R&B--to make music that was ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! Overall, I started to see things about Beyonce that I did not like (especially the fact that DC was all a gimmick to get her popularity to a point where she could succeed as a solo artist). As much as I could go on FOREVER about the flaws in Beyonces' personality, my review is going to be about this album! As with all her albums, I have always tried to listen to each and every song with an open mind, but the more music she releases, the more she completely TURNS ME OFF as an artist! Before Beyonces' album was released, she stated that she actually wrote 72 songs! It baffles me that out of the 72 songs the supposedly \\"wrote,\\" this album were the songs that she selected as the best! Beyonce is a beautiful woman who has vocal abilities to be an AMAZING artist, but the fact that she hasn't (in my personal opinion) matured as an artist baffles me! Besides the fact that Beyonce has been in the music industry since '97, she is a MARRIED WOMAN! Not to say all her songs should be love ballads or of heartbreak, but songs such as \\"Run The World\\" just shows listeners like myself that she is not interested in showing her listeners that she has matured--it proves to me that she is not only fighting to stay relevant, but is not truly taking the time to write profound, deep, meaningful lyrics.     As much as I could analyze each song on the album,  I will just give a general opinion. I do not enjoy the \\"singing rap\\" that Beyonce seems to enjoy! The continuos hollering and the introduction of her using profanity quite frequently DOES NOT SHOW GROWTH! I really believe Beyonce really needs to either retire while she is on top (and has the most OVERLY-OBSESSED fans I have ever seen), OR SERIOUSLY take some time off from interviews, concerts, etc. and write some deep, sensual, ORIGINAL lyrics! I really wish stans would learn that their opinions keep Beyonce from growing and maturing the way she should; instead of continuously saying how great she is as a person, they should really learn to evaluate her music for what it's worth and provide an unbiased opinion! In other words, they should evaluate her music as if she wasn't Beyonce (if it was another artist singing the EXACT same song, would they still approve). To me, this is just another overrated FLOP! But then again....everyone is entitled to their own opinion!  I really believe if Beyonce were to take some YEARS off, have at least one child, and reflect on her years of over-saturating herself with terrible music, she would actually mature! Then again...I have always felt like since \\"BDay,\\" she is only remaining popular because she sells her cooch through her music. And if that wasn't the case, why is it 90% of the time, Beyonce is exposing her body? Just my opinion though.....
0345529057|5.0|After watching Game of Thrones on HBO I had to have more....so I purchased this box set. It arrived quickly in pristine condition and has kept me enthralled for hours.
B0056NYMXC|5.0|I am not sure about the other reviewers, but I first got Kellys' new album a week ago and I have been IN LOVE with it ever since! I do admit that she should have had more of a selection (i.e not just pop/dance songs, but also several slow-tempo'd \\"love-making\\" ballads) and more songs on this album, but I still loved it nonetheless! In my opinion, I feel this is a big step for Kelly; not only has she learned to utilize her vocals more, but she is also becoming a \\"risk taker\\" with her selection of music (meaning instead of \\"playing it safe\\" with ONLY R&B, she has migrated to dance/pop). You can definitely tell that the producers of this album want to see Kelly succeed instead of continuously taking a backseat to Beyonce! Notice that when Kelly was with the Knowles camp, Kelly sang some depressing music that wasn't daring, for the nightclubs, or the radio! My personal favorites on the album are:    -I'm Dat Chick  -Work It Man (**************** personal favorite)  -Lay It On Me (**********)  -Feeling Me Right Now (*********** 2nd personal favorite)  -All Of The Night (*********** 3rd personal favorite)  -Keep It Between Us  -Down For Whatever  -Heaven and Earth    I do wish Kelly would have added a few songs to this album such as \\"Commander (Remix), When Love Takes You Over (we pretty much know that was her song! lol), Forever and a Day,\\" etc. I am really happy for Kellys' success and I cannot wait to see her become #1 on the Billboard charts and finally give Beyonce the competition she deserves! I really don't agree with so many artists abandoning their R&B roots just to partake it \\"what's in\\" now, but it works so well for Kelly because she has the voice for it! To be completely honest, I always knew Kelly could sing, but I really didn't know the extent of the beautiful voice that she has...simply because she was always overshadowed by Beyonce! I only hope that Beyonce becomes TRULY happy for her when she surpasses her on the Billboard charts (because honestly, Beyonce LOVES the limelight and doesn't take to well to competition--REGARDLESS of what people see in the interviews, I can always detect her fabricated complements because I USED to be a fan)! \\"Here I Am\\" is definitely a MUST HAVE...or at least a try! Kelly really introduces the more energetic, sexy (without overdoing it), spontaneous side of her with this album and I have to admit...I LOVE IT! Keep up the good work Kelly! Coming from a fan who has anticipated this album for 2 years, I must say....you didn't let me down! I look forward to your future endeavors with your artistic abilities! But...at the same time, PLEASE don't completely abandon your R&B roots because you have the vocals to sing in both genres!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I enjoyed this book written by Jaycee Dugard.  Her story was very heartbreaking.  I liked that it was written by her even though sometime she is redundant and rambles a bit.  You understand how lonely she was all those years and the small things she was able to take comfort in.  You also see how badly she misses her mother throught the entire book. I understand now after reading her story why she didn't try to escape. She tells a story of a very shy child that never felt like she fit in.  After her abduction she felt even more isolated and asks the question several times \\"who would want me now\\"?  I so hope that Jaycee is able to find happiness.  She is still childlike in so many ways even though she now has children of her own. I can't imagine starting life again after what she endured. She is still young and although many years were \\"stolen\\" from her I hope she can overcome and have the life she deserves.
B005AUWXZ0|3.0|This movie has almost no relation to the first Cars movie except a few cars and Mater. The mood is entirely different and any child 6 or under will be scared out of their wits. It features race after race, shoot 'em ups and explosions over and over and over.     The tribute to Paul Newman's car was a nice touch.The moral of the story was good, but it took way too long to get to it. I thought the movie would never end. It reminded me of adult action movies, which some will love, but not young kids for sure. Parents were taking their kids out of the theatre within 1/2 hour. Our theatre has a particularly loud sound system, which added to the trauma I'm sure.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I found this a stylish movie with an interesting premise that delivers more than it fails.    Bradley Cooper, as \\"Eddie Mora,\\" was good in the lead and actually all the characters in the film were interesting. That includes the villains, who were credibly menacing.    Anyone who has been hooked on any kind of pill can relate to this film. The pill in this story, however, is different from anything anyone's heard of....and intriguing. You can't help but wonder if you would be tempted to take it yourself.    Co-starring with Cooper and his magic pill is the style of the film. It's very stylish and looks great on Blu-Ray. If you're into visuals, this is a good movie to check out. The same goes for fans of suspense.    Would I would watch again? Yeah, the ending is a little contrived but, simply,it's a fun movie to watch.
1589269071|5.0|Excellent relationship education.  Wish I had listened to this years ago, it would have saved me a lot of pain and attempts at guess work.
B0056NYMXC|5.0|This album is by far Kelly's best work.  Her voice has definitely grown.  Too many people have tried to compare her to other artists but she is finally coming into a sound all her own and it works for her.  Every track on the album stands on its own.  The production is great (ie Rico Love). Great Album all around! Love Kelly!
B004WCTLNY|3.0|Boy, I'm so tired of lackluster half-assed scantilly-thought-out movies, music, plays....<br />Just ENTERTAINMENT in general today SUCKS!! Everything is so plastic, disposable, and superficial.<br />Very few truly original voices really get through anymore, and are given the opportunity<br />connect in the mass market media of modern times.<br />In the case of \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\", it's clearly a Matrix / Inception / Click /<br />It's A Wonderful Life knock off...Is it reality, or is it not?---Am I dreaming, or am I awake?<br /><br />And, now that I've have been given exclusive knowledge of the Matrix, i.e. the mysteries of the universe, .i.e.<br />the source code, i.e. the hands of fate, how can I manipulate the whole course of the time-space continuum<br />to serve my own selfish ends, and inner sense of homeostasis?--The rest of the world be damned!<br />Not that this was a particularly bad (as in horrible) movie...it's okay....but it's just that...okay.<br />After watching the first 45 minutes of this...I was seriously fighting the urge to nod.<br />Then a few interesting things happened, followed by more mundane and contrived storyline.<br />This would've fared better as a Lifetime Original Movie or made the OWN channel a tad more interesting.<br />But a full-on box office thiller, this is not!  Even with great actors like Matt Damon, Anthony Mackie,<br />and others...it just doesn't gel. (Sigh!!)

B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have always been a fan of Lady GaGa, and I pre-ordered this album as soon as I heard the release date (forgot to write a review until now). Gaga outdid herself again! Yes, it is much different than her old music, and some do not like it, but that is what is great about GaGa, she as an artist transforms herself and her music. I listened to this album non-stop for a good month, it is just so addicting! If you are debating on buying the album or not, just do it, you will NOT regret it!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is an exceptional true story, beautifully written by a brave and talented young woman.  It is full of painfully taught lessons that can be related to, on some level, by all who read her words.  A tragic past gives light to a triumphant future and present life for Jaycee, and she truly deserves to be a best selling author.  I think it would serve her well to pursue a career as a writer.  She has a natural gift with words.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie was amazing in every direction.<br /><br />The animation was second to none.  I don't know how many people worked on it, but they didn't get enough credit.  Fabulous movement of the creatures, the settings where rich and amazing and the creation of smoke and froth (rabid hound) were awesome.<br /><br />The humor was top shelf.  The use of \\"cuss\\" as a swear was awesome.  Whackbat is as creative a game as you can get, and perfect b/c it makes no sense.<br /><br />The characters were great.  They were all so deep and interesting, with their own little quirks.  I feel movie characters are not unique enough and they run together, but not in this movie.  Granted, a lot of the characters were different species, but they all had something about them that made them unique.  Very well thought out by the writer.<br /><br />The actors who did this were superb.  If I hadn't been told it was George Clooney as Mr. Fox, I would have never known.  It's as if he really got into the character and allowed the character to manifest itself through him, not the other way around (such as Ellen does in Finding Nemo).<br /><br />The soundtrack is very entertaining.  It fits perfectly with the movie and the scenes.  It never overpowers what's happening, just adds to the scene.<br /><br />Ok, so it must be addressed.  This movie does not follow the book at all.  There are a couple similarities between the two (mainly the names of the characters and the fact that the farmers are after the fox), but it is it's own unique creation.  In my opinion, it is head and shoulders above the book.  And, yes, to answer your question I read the book a week or two before watching the movie and found the movie to be so much better.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is one of those rare films that simply has that right balance of characters, action, atmosphere, comedy, and heart. In fact, the balance is such that it all seems to blend together seemlessly. This film is a unique take on the zombie apocalipse concept, with clever visuals, strong chemistry and performances from a wonderful cast, and not just a sex-joke laden spoof to cater to the juvenile Seltzer and Friedburg crowd. I would reccomend this movie to anyone.

B0012GMUI6|5.0|I remember as a schoolboy some thirty odd years ago, our music teacher playing a few \\"Floyd\\" tracks, and asking us what we thought they meant? How does it make you feel? Well, he may have well been asking us about quantum mechanics and how it all worked.... We didn't have a clue, and why should we, we were after all just school kids,  we had no concept of  most of what they sang about, and didn't much care. If he were to ask me now, well maybe I would be able to answer him, at least in part anyway.<br /><br />This isn't \\"pop\\" music, it isn't \\"easy listening\\", it is a tapestry, a work of art, something to immerse yourself in, and if you are lucky, or unlucky, depending on your point of view, you will see and maybe understand where Mr Waters is trying to take you, and maybe you can empathise with the characters.<br /><br />I started to seriously \\"listen\\" to Floyd and Waters (Post Floyd) about twenty years ago. I find for me that it is (all) best enjoyed alone, when I am feeling mellow, maybe with a glass of scotch or a \\"special\\" cigarette....... The depth of emotion that this music can bring forth is astounding. In a darkened room, a quality sound system, no distractions... well it has taken me places far more than any movie ever could. Yes, I wish my old music teacher would ask me again how it makes me feel.<br /><br />I'm not saying you need to have a few years of good life experience to enjoy the music, there are after all some stunning sounds here, but to fully appreciate it in its entirety, I would say that it helps.
B001NXDSLG|1.0|WOODSTOCK is one of my favorite ever films.  It's a truly great movie, featuring some of the best musical performances ever put on film.  I have seen WOODSTOCK on cable TV, on VHS tape, DVD, and three times in a movie theater, so there's no denying that I am a massive fan.  Yet this Blu-Ray is the worst thing I've ever seen.  The \\"hi-def\\" transfer is unforgivably bad.  Perhaps its because of the fact they shot the movie in 16 mm, I don't know...yet what I watched on my 40\\" Samsung LED-LCD HDTV did not look high definition at all...In fact, it looked noticeably worse than the plain-jane DVD I bought years ago.    First off, any and all night performances look like they were filmed with a broken film camera.  Check out The Who, and Crosby, Stills and Nash...the images have red-glow aberrations on the edge of each performer's face.  It looks like what it is...a poorly enhanced digital image.    Second off - the screen aspect ratio is all over the place.  They made ZERO effort to conform the movie to the proper HD 16:9 ratio.  Instead they use a letterbox...which is normally fine, yet they also often use a 4:3 ratio (a small square that sits in the center of the screen)...which is a waste of HD screen time.  Of course I realize that WOODSTOCK is presented in the 1970's split-screen style that was popular at the time....yet on the Blu-Ray, the effect fails miserably.  Worse, the producers of the bl-ray insist on keeping amazing performers like Jimi Hendrix exclusively in a small, 4:3 aspect ratio for his entire performance.    Third off - the sound is embarrassingly bad.  I don't what the hell they did to that beautiful soundtrack, yet it sounds as if someone mixed it while deaf, drunk, and possibly dead.  One of the worst offenders...the closing song, \\"Woodstock\\" that plays over the credits at the end of the movie has some serious idiotic mix that sounds NOTHING like the amazing Crosby, Still, Nash & Young original...In fact, I think it might be an entirely different take of the song...and not even a good one.    I will NEVER play this criminally awful Blu-Ray disc again.  Right now, I am debating whether to use it as a paperweight, or just chuck it in the garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, AND MONEY.

140053271X|5.0|I bought the first-gen Nook in January 2011 and was very happy with it. Then the new Nook Simple Touch came out and I heard about the features and just had to have it. The long battery life and touch screen are big selling features. Plus it's so much faster and so much more fun to browse around on. I've had it for a couple of weeks and am still happy with my choice. I love love the touch screen, and it doesn't have the glare that some touch screens have.    You won't be sorry with this choice. As other reviews have noted - Amazon's price is higher than if you buy it at the B&N store. I paid $139 for mine at the B&N store, plus I got 30 free (pre-chosen) books because of the upgrade special (on an SD card that slides into the nook).
0743454537|5.0|Anne has gone threw thirteen years of her life doing countless things to help her sister Kate to fight the leukemia that has plagued her since she was a child.  Learn the fact that Anna was concieved and born to be a genetic match for bone marrow which Anna went along with her whole life until now on basically a teenage rebellion she starts to question who she is and why she has too give all parts of her to her sister.  Then she went to a lawyer to get the rights to her body and parts which puts a strain on her family.  Tho it does get her mom back into practicing law like she did before all of this happened.  You get to see not only what Anna is going threw with this decion, but also the rest of her family especially her brother.  The sad thing about all of this is that in the end one of them has to die for the family to truly live their lives and make something of themselves.  This shows not only what moral dilema this kind of situation can cause on people and their families.  There are also times in a crisis that one child or children can be overlooked due to a health issue.  That the death could cause people to reevalutate their lives and take a second chance that not everyone gets.
B004XZR63M|3.0|This was the second time I have read this book.  The material presented in it is well worth the cost of admission and the main points presented really help clarify the difference between behaviors of the rich compared to the poor or middle class.  However, the formatting of the e-book version of this book is pathetic!  Text changing size at seemingly random intervals, goofy chapter and section title sizes and placement, and general laziness in editing all lose this book a star.  I'm kind of offended that I just paid money for something that was pretty much just copied and pasted from somewhere without an ounce of effort put into this book's presentation.  Frustrating!
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie to me started out weird, but I was told that is how Tarin Tino work goes.  The movie was good going thru all of the characters that did her wrong and her being able to get her revenge on all of them.  All because they attacked her at her wedding and she thought that they killed the child that she was carrying that was Bill's.  The fighting scence in the club were great and surprising, but at the end you find out that the child isn't dead after all.  I highly recommend this movie to people it can be a little crazy especially after she gets out of the hospital.
B004289ZW0|2.0|This was used in a aviation environment and had numerous issues.   The power switch is the worst feature of this GPS and only works about half the time.   Sometimes it won't come on, other times it won't shut off and runs the battery dead.  Occasionally it comes on all by itself in your pocket or storage case when it senses any kind of motion.   I was able to deal with the power switch for the last several months by constantly charging it.   Today however, it locked up completely for about the 6th time.   There is an internal reset switch which requires insertion of a paper clip from the side access hole.   It completely broke the switch when when I inserted the paperclip rendering the GPS worthless.   Hopefully the manufacture can rectify these issues with a new model soon.  The technology seems fine; it just needs real and accessible switches for power on/off and reset.

B0050CQY1W|3.0|Ok, I am a beyonce fan and her past songs are great. Judging from her last album \\"I Am Sasha Fierce\\", I really liked and she showed her fans the both sides of her alter egos. On her first album, it was a mixture of up tempos and ballards, well I think more ballards then up tempos. Bday was a straight through pop/up tempo album, except \\"Irreplaceable, Resentment and hidden track Listen\\". When I heard 4, I said to myself \\"What happened\\"? But after me realizing that this woman is 29 years old and she should be going back to more ballards then doing pop. Overall I think 4 is a good album, especially if she wrote and almost produced half of the album herself. 4 is sort of a \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\" only it is more slow records then fast ones.    Favorite tracks  1 - end of time (I believe this should be a single, most def)  2 - i care  3 - miss you  4 - party (another possible single, it has that 90's vibe to it)  5 - rather die young (one of the R&B joints on there you can vibe to)  6 - start over (another possible single, voice and background singing is great)  7 - love on top (another possible single, i feel like this song is for the grown folks, get a nice card game going and nod your head to this joint)
B0055CJ8T2|4.0|Kelly Rowland is finally getting the recognition she deserves although its only arriving at a third album attempt. Her first album had her dabble in Rock/Pop. A genre far off her alley all in an attempt to differentiate her from the usual sound of her Destinys Child days and obviously paving the way for her fellow member Beyonce. The album was modest but not worthy of a recognition coming off a top charting single with Nelly. Her second album skewed more towards the Urban community evident from her debut single \\"Like This\\". No memorable singles and poor sales would see her get dropped from her label. Fast forward 4 years later, Kelly is out with with a new label, new management and a hot new record. Overall a solid the album and has many potential singles. Kelly might face difficulty pleasing fans shes captivated with her reign as Dance Diva but they will have to wait for the International album. For now, enjoy the album. 4/5    Standout tracks include-:   \\"Work it Man\\" ft Lil Play (Reminiscient of \\"Soldier\\" Destinys Child)   \\"Motivation\\" ft Lil Wayne   \\"Lay it on Me\\" ft Big Sean  \\"Feeling me Right Now\\" ( Has to be a single)   \\"All of the Night\\" ft Rico Love     As much as we like upbeat tempo songs, it would have been nice to have slow tempo songs that really showcase her voice. Nonetheless, its a great effort from the R&B Diva. Definitely worth a buy. 4/5 for Ms. Rowland.

B004GUSG4M|2.0|I thought, based on so many strong reviews, that this would be much more engaging and suspenseful.  But I found Christine unsympathetic, despite her unfortunate accident and resultant amnesia. I thought the idea that her husband would care for her at home seemed absurd and unrealistic and made the story harder to buy. And I was unimpressed with the \\"twist\\" ending...saw that coming.  It was ok but all in all I was disappointed.  I think you might be bummed if you spend the $13.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I've been in such a slump whenever I go to the bookstore. I'm at that transition point between young adult and regular fiction, and whenever I look at the young adult section, I'm usually very disappointed because most have the same basic storyline and I find them relatively predictable. This book was a very nice change compared to the cheesy teenage romances and such. The pictures make the book alive, and I like the the slightly romantic subplot didn't get in the way of all the adventure. The way Riggs takes the photos and incorporates them nearly seamlessly into the story is just astounding. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something different!
031261246X|3.0|Written by someone with an excellent reputation as a Windows programmer, Zero Day is as fast paced as it is plausible. The possibility that a motivated group of bad guys could actually affect a large number of computers with deadly effect, is chilling. Good read, recommended.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|I would probably have given this game 5 stars except for one thing: openfeint fail. On multiple occasions I would unlock an achievement in game and see it at the top of the screen but it wouldn&apos;t load into openfeint, and now I can&apos;t unlock it again, so my only option is to wipe the data I guess :-(\n\nThe game itself is very fun, though a bit short. Also, the game locks up on loading, and according to my logs its because of openfeint.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I had it way before this free release. I've played it religiously for months. It's so much fun, and every time you lose, you rethink your strategy. The levels get increasingly harder too...which provides a challenge. I'd pay over $10 for this!

1441866868|4.0|THE WINDUP GIRL is a book I've wanted to checkout for a while and fortunately was able to download it to my phone through android and audible.com and listen to as I recently drove across country... and what a great choice of story to pass those long hours on the road with.  I truly enjoyed this unique bizarre world of gadgets, technology, oppression and famine. Bacigalupi's THE WINDUP GIRL is set in a post-oil world complete with interesting genetically engineered creatures, genetically engineered food, plagues, extreme climates,  extreme circumstances, a range of surviving religions and beliefs and a large cast of well fleshed out characters; with individual stories, backgrounds and personalities that weave flawlessly through this dark tale as their lives intertwine.<br />All that said.. this is a very involved book with lots going on and even though it`s well done, it is not a read I'd recommend for the YA crowd or the light-hearted and I am convinced that although I found THE WINDUP GIRL to be an interesting piece of fiction that worked well as an audio book, I am not as confident that I would have gotten through reading it on my own. Along with the many characters and subplots, there is no shortage of strange names, accents, languages and brutal violence. And I will caution readers that there are some explicit and very graphic abuse scenes involving the windup girl's character that may be too much for some readers with more delicate sensibilities.<br />THE WINDUP GIRL is not an easy read, but definitely an interesting one for post-apocalyptic, biopunk and sci-fi fans alike.

B002RSDW80|2.0|The plot of this movie can be summed up as follows: Julia Child is bored with her life, so she decides to learn French cuisine.  Julie Powell is bored with her life, so she decides to make all of Julia Child's famous recipes and then blog about it.  We are bored with our lives, and so we decide to watch this movie, which, if we are VERY bored, we will switch off after fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Why is this movie so boring? Well, for one thing, it was directed and written by Nora Ephron, who simply cannot write anything interesting. For example, it would have been fascinating to follow Julia Child a little more closely as a real person. Instead we got Meryl Streep's relentlessly fruity Julia Child impersonation (peppered with some vague references to the McCarthy era, which Ephron thought would spice things up, but didn't). The reason Julie Powell was so boring is that she is, well, boring.  What could be less interesting that the quintessential chick flick heroine? She's awkward, incompetent (hey, I could poach an egg when I was nine), has dull, catty friends, and has an inferiority complex so thick you could make fillets out of it.<br /><br />The real question is: why do people like this boring stuff? Well, apparently we do so little with our lives that we can completely identify with a person who writes an inconsequential blog about a trivial topic (food, food, more food, and then feeling fat). Lacking purpose, we can sympthasize with purposelessness.<br /><br />But maybe it's something more than that.  The two things that Julia and Julie share is that they both are products of a recession.  After WWII, there was a concerted effort to remove women from the workplace to make room for returning soldiers.  During the 40s, women had been managing whole industries, and doing it very nicely, when BANG! the 1950s arrived. Women were tossed out of their jobs and turned into \\"home-makers.\\" Well, being stuck at home after having run a factory is boring.  Julia Child attempted to make the oldest profession (the real oldest profession) more tolerable by introducing a challenge: How time-consuming can I make cooking dinner? It was Julia's small, but significant contribution to the castration of post WWII women.<br /><br />We have a similar problem now.  The short-lived gains achieved by women during the 70s have been made largely irrelevant by right-wing religious politics (women should be barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen...with a microwave) and yet another recession. The only difference is that now, in spite of Martha Stewart's heroic efforts, the domestic arts are a thing of the past, so the only thing left to do with all that extra time is to blog.<br /><br />And get fat.<br /><br />Bon appetit!rofession (the real oldest profession) more tolerable by introducing a challenge: How time-consuming can I make cooking dinner?

It had 378 performances before closing on 2/17/85. Mamet won the 1984 Best Play Tony and the Pulitzer for Drama. Original cast included Best Actor Tony winner Joe Mantegna as Ricky Roma, and Best Actor nominee Robert Prosky as Shelley Levine.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Three failing land salesmen at Premiere Properties believe they can turn their luck around with the new Glengarry leads, but an unseen Mitch and Murray don't want to waste these on weak closers, thus Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the only man getting a shot at them. At the local tavern, Dave Moss (Harris) schemes to steal the leads and \\"take them across the street to Jerry Graff.\\" After revealing the plan to George Aaronow (Arkin), Moss tries coercing him into pulling the burglary.<br /><br />Shelley 'the Machine' Levene (JL), who's worried about his hospitalized daughter, hasn't made a penny this September. Now he, Moss and George have only one week to save their jobs, bad news that's brought to them by Blake (Baldwin), Mitch and Murray's hatchet man. Blake's cold-blooded \\"Coffee is for closers!\\" soliloquy, which was NOT in the stagepay, is a dramatic highlight of this dark and profane drama about men pushed to desperation.

0443069522|4.0|This is an excellent book for an anatomy student who does better from reading a text book - as opposed to just looking at the pictures in Netter's or Thieme.  It is a real textbook that breaks things down into their simplest components - things like blood supply to the abdomen are broken down simply by developmental regions.  It is really helpful for getting big concepts and a basic orientation to the incredible onslaught of vocabulary and spatial memorization that is med school gross anatomy.  However, it is a little light on the details.  Some things are glossed over and not mentioned at all, most likely for the sake of simplicity.  For an undergrad anatomy class, it is perfect.  For a med school gross anatomy course, you really need a solid atlas to go a long with it to ensure you don't miss those pesky little details that anatomists love to toss into an exam.
B0032UYFA6|2.0|I sure am in the minority here because most reviews are extremely positive. But BB has taken a strange turn this 3rd season. We just watched it to prepare for the new Season 4 and we are disappointed. Walt is moving off on a tangent, Jessie is more broody and quiet than ever, and the brother-in-law issues are just getting in the way of what began for 2 solid seasons as a show that stayed on a tried-and-true track.
0440423023|3.0|This is my first Lee Child book and I am sorry to say I was disappointed. The story started out great, definitely keeping my attention for about half of the book. Past that point the antagonist mostly fell out of the picture until the very end. He is presented as entirely evil, by the way, although he managed to get two beautiful women to fall in love and marry him.    The Reacher character has some positives but I found him hard to like without a better understanding of his past. His romantic involvement with another character seemed artificial to me. The resolution was satisfying but with little left to the imagination. The bad guys have no chance and every one of them is disposed of handily. The story has an interesting premise and the dialog is used effectively but to me it came to a Bond imitation and with less danger involved.

1400097029|5.0|Another great book by a great modern Irish author.  His prose style is superlative.  It is pure pleasure to read each sentence.  He brings a special nuance to language.    The story is interesting and captivating.  Typical of Banville the reader is in for a few surprises but everything comes together nicely.    I am about the same age as the hero of the book and I can relate to what drives him to go back to events of his childhood.  Often we have unresolved issues and only by going back after we have lived our lives can we truly face the demons of our youth.    Great book.

If you ask yourself whether these are two different titles, answer is - yes, these are two different books. Even thou both are devoted to Python, you will find them different. Head First Programming focuses on telling reader what programming is, while Head First Python goes directly into Python related topics. Another benefit of this book is that it touches various aspects of Python usage - application programming, Web development, Mobile development.<br /><br />What I like in the book is a way things are explained. Head First approach is one of favorite, so I like the book automatically - in a way. On the other hand, I think it could be better bundled with Head First Programming. Both books cover the same topics in few places which makes it questionable to buy both of them. Putting it straight. If you want to focus on Python itself, and you know what programming is all about - Head First Python is a good choice. If you don't know any programming language or you want to learn programming through the Python, definitely buy Head First Programming instead of this one.
B000ASATZ8|1.0|I enjoyed the first movie as a cheap flick that was funny. I enjoyed the cast in the first movie. I ordered the 4-movie set understanding this was a low-$$$ money film that was not on the level of say...Harry Potter...But the second movie was sorely flat. The entire feel of the movie was different. The acting was pretty bad. The story line was WORSE. It basically morphed into a liberal Michael Gross mocking and making fun of \\"right-winger\\" kind of movie. Had I known that this was going to morph into a Michael Gross series I would NOT have bought the pack of 4 movies and would have stopped at the first movie. I strained to watch the entire second movie and got ten minutes into the third and have yet to go back on my most boring days to finish it and have no plans whatsoever to watch the fourth. It was stupid...and not being a Michael Gross fan to begin with...I'm even less so now.    Save your money and if you're looking for another off beat movie to spend $10 bucks on...don't buy this pack. You basically get what you pay for. Four movies for $10? Yep...that's about right.
B004VB3UYW|5.0|Simply put, one of the best R starters around. What you get here are recipes for most common problems you will face while working with R. This book is an extended version of 25 Recipes for Getting Started with R. However, the coverage of material is different. While 25 Recipes focus on getting started with R, R Cookbook penetrates the subject in greater details and goes beyond simple usage of R. You will find here not only how to load data, manipulate it and plot some graphic. You can find description of various statistical analysis as well.<br /><br />This book, is not for a reading in bed just before you go to sleep. It is too pragmatic. Simple definition of the problem and just after that, simple solution - that's what you get when it comes to each issue covered within the book. This is the strength of R Cookbook. On the other hand, it's weakness. If you cant find the question within table of contents it might be hard to get the answer for what you ask about. As I like pragmatic approach, I like the book as well. For me it's just perfect. Well, maybe just too short.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I was tired of those cheap over the ear headsets and decided to purchase a real set of Headphones...<br />I was not disappointed. Although somewhat on the heavy side, these Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset<br />are very comfortable and have a great sound to them. I never miss a word during gaming or while watching a movie...<br /><br />My sound card is not the greatest, therefore I could not give this headset a fair judgement on the sound quality or Mic quality...<br /><br />Overall I am Extremely pleased with this unit...I highly recommend them!!!
B0026OR2PE|5.0|Scott takes you in a journey over the ideas you probably well known but was not aware of details. He goes though the history of innovation,<br />shows us some interesting examples and provides with entertainment. I lack better proven, well formed references thou - especially when it comes to Philosophy - I think Scott's analogies are to shallow in few places. On the other hand, this book should entertain you - it's obvious you will not get an answer how to create good idea. One of my teachers told us a joke once - how to build financial empire? Well it's simple, create popular product and logo - like Coca-Cola - and you are set. That's more or less the book is about. It shows how great inventions were created, how they were born and brought to us by inventors who were quite often rejected by others. Descrates wrote once: \\"it is necessary to reject everything that raises doubts in order to left only pure truth\\". I think, this idea remains somewhere in the background throughout all the book. If you really want to be outstanding person, you can't think like others do - you have to reject what you have been told, and do your things. Then, with little luck, you might become real inventor.
B000005HNQ|5.0|Nighttime Birds, the fourth full-length recording from The Gathering and second with vocalist Anneke van Giersbergen, is essentially a further exploration of the style and sound of 1995's Mandylion, sharing with that work the same basic songwriting principles and agenda, and even a very similar studio production. As Mandylion was an excellent effort announcing the formal arrival of The Gathering as a pioneering band in female-fronted atmospheric metal, Nighttime Birds, as a stylistically faithful follow-up, is another fine album which can be summed up as a brighter, slightly more extroverted but less mysterious version of Mandylion.     \\"I am the snow falling down on you   I tear up your face with my frost   And make you run to somewhere warm\\"    Having discovered the vocal gem that is Anneke after two failed attempts in the lead vocal department, The Gathering cannot exactly be faulted for spotlighting her gorgeously expressive singing. While a good amount of these songs contain extended instrumental passages, Anneke's effervescent voice remains the focal point of The Gathering's presentation, and as fantastic as these musicians are, they play to the band's newfound communicative strength in these diverse alterations of verse/chorus form, in which Giersbergen's emotively dynamic and invigorating voice sings the defining melody with such life-affirming conviction and genuine feeling that even when reflective and melancholy there is an enlivening element coursing through the music that is incredibly inspiring.    The music is abundant with skyline-reflecting lead guitar melodies and ethereal synth washes that, particularly when converging in a moment of pure heavenly ascendance, can be quite spell-binding and enveloping. There is very well established counterbalance between sweeping atmospheric passages of floating beauty and powerful, riff-driven movements, a feature that works to great effect in opener \\"On Most Surfaces\\" and \\"Confusion\\", but perhaps most powerfullyexemplified in \\"New Moon, Different Day\\", which begins with first-rays-of-sunlight keyboards and reflective guitar chords, and concludes with a surprisingly crushing riff and slamming drums, a resolving climax rising in intensity like a newly awakened joyous perspective on existence emerging from a cloud of fears.    \\"The clouds make a circle   on the soil that I'm on   and I trust what surrounds me   I want to cross     I break the storm through the cloud\\"    What really makes this music fascinating and thoroughly engaging is its simply expressed, positive affection for small pleasures and observations often taken for granted in the thrust and swell of everyday living. It considers the world and all its phenomena, from its changing seasons, diverse landscapes, and activity of its wildlife, to the hopes and dreams of its human inhabitants, and embraces all of it in a most cheerful melancholy; yes, much of it is about feeling good despite reasons for tremendous sadness and dark despair, but it speaks to a childlike wonder and innocence in us that is regrettably too easily lost to the practical concerns of maturity, and does so with unmistakable sincerity and directly expressive beauty.
B004I654WQ|4.0|Great Movie.  I am an adult, and it's been years since I have watched a CGI movie but my girlfriend and I both loved this one!! We picked it up because we both love cars, but ended up loving it for it's high quality story and well-developed characters.  It's definitely a feel good, family movie, but it has a lot to offer, especially for a car enthusiast.     The only reason we gave it 4 stars is because it forces you to buy a DVD combo if you want the blu-ray.  This seems excessive to me, and certainly a waste of a DVD.

B005EL6SUG|5.0|**As of November 2012, Lego listed this product as &#34;Retiring Soon&#34; and was, itself, sold out of the set. Supplies remain available here and there, but you should expect prices to begin to rise above MSRP. **<br /><br />I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other train reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. Obviously I am terribly partial to Lego (ignore my star rating), but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the decision that is right for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews. This set began trickling into U.S. stores in early July, 2011.<br /><br />A tidy and nicely designed set, 3677 includes a heavy switching engine (similar to a Deutsche Bundesbahn Class 290 diesel locomotive), a small green and white hazardous waste boxcar (with a pallet of lime green barrels), tipping ballast car, and maintenance-of-way (MOW) flatcar (which has a small cab, MOW truck, small crane and pallet).  The MOW truck has flip-down rail wheels.  There is also a trackside conveyor belt loader for the ballast, a trackside hopper, and four mini-figures.<br /><br />The set includes all the necessary Power Function parts (i.e., it is a remotely controlled, motorized train) and requires only batteries. The red battery box (a new color for this part) holds six AAA batteries and sits inside the engine. Lego also included the gray battery cover as a spare. If you don't like changing out AAAs, you can opt for the more expensive rechargeable lithium-ion battery and DC charger available directly from Lego. The lithium-ion battery has a gray cover, but if you are handy you can swap the covers using a small screwdriver. The set includes 16 pieces of curved track, 8 pieces of straight track, and 16 pieces of flex track (enough for an oval).<br /><br />This set sits between 7938 and 7939 in price, but may have the most playability of the three.  I find that kids love all the trains and naturally expand them with their own bricks and mini-figures, but this set has a bit more going on than the other two. While 7939 gives you two switches and a crane, with 3677's maintenance car, ballast car/loader, and hazardous waste car, there are more plot lines available (inevitably kids will stage a crash regardless of the train you buy).<br /><br />I like the engine design; it is the latest in a long line of Lego switching engines, the most recent being #4512 from 2003, and one of the most classic being #7760 from 1980. This new engine is very long and has a lift-off top to access the cab. The louvered doors on the side open to reveal engine controls (a sticker). My favorite part of the set is the brown tipper wagon. The green and white boxcar is merely okay.  I don't like how the double doors overhang the end when they are open; a single door would have been fine.  As for the MOW flatcar, I would have preferred a car that was a piece of MOW machinery (e.g. a ballast spreader) or carried something other than a truck (perhaps a flatcar full of rails). The MOW flatcar has a small cab with a hinged roof.<br /><br />I do recommend that you purchase #7936, Level Crossing, which has another Maintenance of Way vehicle that ties-in perfectly with 3677.<br /><br />Not many stores routinely carry Lego trains and even fewer have them built for you to view.  I recommend going to Youtube and doing a search for &#34;Lego 3677 brickshopholland&#34; so that you can get a better feel for this set. If you want to get a complete overview of what Lego offers for trains, you can go to the Lego site (go to the &#34;Shop&#34; and organize by &#34;theme&#34;) or you can click on my name, go to my Amazon page, choose the &#34;Guides&#34; tab, and then choose &#34;Get a Lego Train.&#34;ni-figures, but this set has a bit more going on than the other two.

1439181780|5.0|WOW!!!  Rhonda you have a gift that is amazing to all of us.  I have just finished reading the book \\"The Power\\" and it is incredable.  I have read many many books on this subject of Law of Attraction and never have I come across a book that has even come close to yours explaining in such a simple way how we can harness this law through our love.  I am so excited to finally realize the key emotion and how it all suddenly makes so much sense to me.    I can not express to you how much I love this book.  How much this book has changed me forever.  It has brought so much peace to my heart and has taught me already to give so much love to everyone and everything around me. I love how in this book there are some amazing quotes from some of the greatest minds dating back hundreds and thousands of years.  I am so grateful for this book that I went out and bought 4 more copies to give to my family so they can see just how easy it is to gain the power in there lives too.  Thank you again so much Rhonda.  Please, please keep writing what you learn because you have a great gift of teaching to all of us and I look forward to the many other books and films you will produce in the future.  Your gift of Love is felt so much through this book and I am so grateful to you for that.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|Before I begin anything if you haven't seen this yet stay after the credits as there is a end credit \\"scene\\" as with other Marvel films BUT with this one we also get a sneak peak of the 2012 \\"The Avengers\\".<br /><br />This isn't Captain America's first dance; the comic book has been adapted a number of times for the big and small screen; Cap first appeared on screen in 1944, the 1960's cartoon TV series, two 1979 TV movies (which were pilots for a series), a 1990 movie (which, somehow, thankfully I missed)and this the latest incarnation of Cap and the best version yet.<br /><br />Joe Johnston (\\"The Rocketeer\\", \\"Jurassic Park III\\")does an excellent job of evoking the period feeling in this origin story that also allows Cap to transition to the 21st century for forthcoming \\"The Avengers\\" movie.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />The plot: It's World War II--Steve Rogers (Chris Evans)continues to try and enlist to serve his country but is constantly rejected because of his weight and various illnesses. Dr. Abraham Erksine (Stanley Tucci) thinks he is the perfect candidate for his \\"super soldier\\" serum that will create a stronger, faster superhuman perfected after it was first used on Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt turned into a monster--known as the Red Skull who also commands Hitler's elite Hydra group. Roger's volunteers, undergoes the treatment and lives up to Erksine's dream. At first confined to Bond selling events as Captain America by Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) the military head of the program, Rogers goes into action when his best friend \\"Bucky\\" Barnes (Sebastian Stan)is taken by Schmidt's men along with the rest of the 107th division.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Evans does a superb job of balancing Cap's humanity with a generous dose of humor avoiding a campy tone. Packed with terrific supporting performers \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" stands as one of the best Marvel films made (along with the first two \\"Spider-Man\\" films by Sam Raimi, the \\"Iron Man\\" films by Jon Favreau and the first two \\"X-Men\\" films by Bryan Singer)continuing a winning streak for the studio.<br /><br />The direction by Johnston nicely balances the story and characterization with the stunts and action sequences of the film. Using a modern rap around sequence does a nice job of bridging the era the bulk of the film takes place in and bringing it into the 21st century for the next film.<br /><br />Shot in 3D (rather than being a conversation after the fact)enhances the film although it isn't necessary to see the film in that format to enjoy it. Still, Johnston makes excellent use of the 3D format without bashing the audience over the head with it and, unlike most movies, Johnston doesn't adjust his cutting style for the 3D format (3D doesn't handle rapid fire editing all that well)but then again his editing style here echoes an earlier era of film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.nd the first two \\"X-Men\\" films by Bryan Singer)continuing a winning streak for the studio.

1416583432|4.0|The book is informative and entertaining, as far as it goes, but offers little in the way of practical advice. It does offer insights that will promote greater human understanding of dogs and concludes with a strong chapter that suggests ways humans can relate better to the dogs in their households. The book also does an outstanding job of describing dogs' sensory experience of the world, devoting nearly 100 pages to the subject.<br />But in its claim to present the canine perspective, the book falls short. Horowitz does decode some situations according to a canine point of view -- her discussion of doggy raincoats and the way that their tight embrace might make dogs feel \\"subdued\\" rather than protected is an amusing example. But an overwhelming anthropomorphic bias comes through. For instance, after lengthy and well-done sections describing dogs' vision and how it differs from humans' and explaining that smell is dogs' primary source of information, Horowitz attributes her dog's hesitance to enter the elevator to age-related deterioration of her vision or difficulty adjusting to low light after being outside. These are both reasons a human might hesitate. But the crevice between the floor and the elevator harbors many strange smells; this is an alternative reason, more in tune with what matters to dogs, that dogs might hesitate to enter elevators. Another (though unlikely in the case of Horowitz's apartment-dwelling dog) is an unpleasant memory of the moving floor.<br />Horowitz also stays loyal to her scientist roots in her reliance on research studies -- even poorly designed and executed studies -- to draw conclusions, even when real-life experience points to different conclusions. A study of dogs' reactions to \\"emergency\\" situations is instructive. In this study, humans set up a highly contrived scenario, first having owners introduce their dogs to a \\"friendly stranger\\" and then having the owners feign an emergency -- a heart attack, for example. None of the dogs tested did what the humans wanted them to do (seek help from the \\"stranger\\"). Calling this a \\"clever\\" experiment, Horowitz draws the conclusion that dogs \\"simply do not naturally recognize or react to an emergency situation.\\" A more obvious conclusion, and one that gives more credit to the dogs' intelligence, is that the dogs could tell that the people were faking -- none of the scents and signals that indicate true alarm or physical dysfunction would have been present in the \\"actors.\\" Some dogs do, in fact, react to emergency situations, even those that they have not been specifically trained for.<br />Horowitz relies exclusively on some studies that dogs \\"failed,\\" such as the mirror test for self-awareness and a test of whether dogs felt \\"guilt\\" if they \\"stole\\" a treat, in arriving at her limited conclusions about doggy consciousness and self-awareness. She fails to acknowledge (or notice?) that the tests cited are anthropocentric in design -- that is, they test things that are relevant to people but not to dogs -- and were conducted in unfamiliar, contrived environments where the dogs' behavior would be far from natural. Other research showing strong evidence of dog self-awareness is not mentioned. Finally, and despite a section at the beginning of the book chiding scientists' tendency to see one animal as representative of a species, she makes many broad statements about dog behavior that are seemingly based on her observations of her one dog.<br />Overall, the book provides a good description of dogs' sensory perceptions of the world, but I think that its conclusions about dog behavior, consciousness, and self-awareness are questionable.d did what the humans wanted them to do (seek help from the \\"stranger\\").

B002ZG980U|1.0|This movie deserves a second star for its impressive special effects, but its convoluted and obscurantist plot negates the higher rating. The whole movie was just a vehicle for exhibiting the spectacle of a folding city. Inside a dream, are they dreaming, or are they dreaming about dreaming? Who gives a crap? Just plain boring silliness.
B001AQO446|5.0|I've read the reviews on Amazon but wanted the blu-ray upgrade.  Amazon's details may not be complete.  The blu-ray I purchased has theatrical and extended versions on a single disc.  There is a banner at the top front on my cover with says \\"Includes Theatrical and Extended Versions\\" and it is also mentioned again on the back cover.  The DTS sound is outstanding on my Polk 360 home system and I don't think I am missing anything by not having lossless DTS sound.  This movie looks and sounds great on blu-ray and the price is affordable.  I found myself enjoying the movie and singing along with the sub-titled songs.  I saw it in the theater when it first came out and here it is over 30 years later looking and sounding just as good if not better.
B003BQ78NW|5.0|This product met my expectation.  I did a lot of comparing to other range finders and other GPS systems.  There is no substitute for being able to find the range to any object on the course at any time.  GPS systems are fine, but, not every course is loaded and for the more experienced golfer knowing the distance to the pin when it is back or forward (a difference of several yards at times) can be the difference of 1 put or more.  I didn't buy the slope option.  I thought for my game the straight yardage was enough.  And, my boys will be able to use it for high-school tournament play when they get there.  It came with a smart clip-on case for quick access.  This product really speeds up play (no more searching for and walking off yardarge markers or guessing within 80 yrds of the hole!)

0375758992|5.0|Alexandra Fuller's book, DON'T LET'S GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT, is filled with imagery and color about her childhood in Africa.  She has provided details of a nomadic life with somewhat unpleasant undertones in a high-spirited tone that reveals a child's innocence in all the bewildering circumstances she finds herself.  Her loving acceptance, if not approval, of an alcoholic mother and footloose father are gratifying in a world that appears to be more interested in tawdry looks at family life.    This debut book is remarkable in its honesty.  Fuller doesn't shy away from incidents that most biographers would find hard to detail.  She does so with a unique humor and tolerance that recalls the innocence of youth when we are too delighted at being alive to be upset at disagreeable events.  She had moments of disgust and terror that she seemed able to set aside in childish acceptance, and then recalled the same events as an adult having a less charitable view.  Her ability to travel that road, and bring the reader with her, is a wonderful achievement.    Some of the prose and dialogue seemed somewhat amateurish to me.  I particularly found the numerous \\"ha ha\\" and \\"hee hee\\" asides to be disconcerting and unnecessary.  When a writer creates a humorous passage, interjections to underscore that humor need not be added.  The reader shouldn't need to be coaxed.  That said, her descriptions of the country and people (and the conditions in which they find themselves) are gloriously detailed.  Fuller is also able to illuminate Africa's beauty with her insightful writing style.  The reader is given acute visual and sensory impressions that bring the country alive.    Africa is a captivating country, full of beauty, violence and earthy existence.  Fuller has brought all that to life in DON\\"T LET'S GO TO THE DOGS.  I consider her memoir a must read.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have to say didn't know what to expect from this game when my son asked me to purchase it. We sat down as a family and started playing and it is very addicting.  This game can even keep the attention of my daughter who gets bored with everything so that speaks volumes to me.  We are looking at buying expansion games to attach to this game.  If you are looking for a strategy game that is a little different definitely give this game a try.  The other cool option about this game is the expansion games that you are able to purchase which I think is a great idea.
0679805273|5.0|I purchsed this book for my daugther and three of her friends to go with their graduation gifts.  They seemed like they appreciated it.  It was a fun idea and the girls read it aloud to the guest at the party.
B000002HH2|5.0|I'm a late-comer to Bjork and it was my great loss that I missed years of her joyous, insightful and brilliant music and singing.  I don't need to effuse on her brilliance, y'all know all about it.  But if you haven't discovered this fabulous singer/songwriter yet don't wait another day.  Post has me away just about as much as Homogenics or Vespertine.   She is a chanteuse of the Heart and Love is her theme. On top of that most of the songs are great for improv dancing with a special friend late at night in the living room, then you can same your way up the stairs and start all over again.  Bjork does that, she makes lovers out of us all.  To be expected, I suppose, from a triple Scorpio.  Passion and depth are the basis for everything she does.    On Post it is the samba-inspired I Miss You that has propelled me through my day.  I wake up to it and the days have been wonderful ever since.  Bjork displays her amazing versatility with the Broadway-esque It's Oh So Quiet.  She takes risks with her voice, like screaming wildly now and then between the softest, most caressing phrases.  Then there is Isobel, a compelling rhythmic trip through the spirit of Lust.  This is great dancing music for the uninhibited.      Right now I'm getting familiar with Debut, more on that soon I'm sure.  Bjork is unquestionably my favorite female pop singer, second only to the late, star-crossed Amy Winehouse who was an animal of a different stripe, with one of those once in several generations great blues voices.  Bjork isn't that great, but she's very close.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I switched to skx from swype when I got sick of swype's shortcomings. I find skx to be much more error tolerant and quite good with its predictions. so far I only had 3 issued with skx and one (capitalization) seems to have been fixed in the last update. the other two were lack of easy language switching and at times skx seems to freak out and starts entering nonstop gibberish (&quot;the creator of the most important thing on the internet.&quot;). if not for those I would give it 5 stars.
0307716511|4.0|This book was wonderful.  I couldn't put it down once I started to read it. The feeling of the mystery in it pulled me in before I could stop reading.  I loved every one of the one hundred thousand words that was included in this book.  The love between sisters and the knowing your sister was really believable.  And for anyone who has a sister or who has lost one will understand the bond of the \\"many little memories\\" that glues family relationship together as well as the empty space in your heart the lost has created.  I love the emotional side as well as the thriller part of it. Great read!!!!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle, since I want to read the Bible on it and someone at church recommended this for me. I enjoy reading the ESV Study Bible so far, as I found it a little easier to read than the NIV. I really like how there is an intro section before each book of the Bible, so you can understand the historical context and background information before you read it. A wonderful deal as it only cost $9.99 on the Kindle.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I can tell she worked very hard on this album. It's really REALLY good.   It is slightly more grown-up,but that's because she is 19. She is growing up.  I was a little taken back when I first heard the D word... But hey, that;s not REAL swearing.  I really like this album because people of all ages would like it.   People who are critisizing it should realize how hard she truly works.  My favorites are:  \\"My Dilemma\\"  \\"Who Says\\"  \\"Love You Like a Love Song\\"and  \\"Middle of Nowhere\\"  Love this album
B0033AX1YG|5.0|i definitely give this five stars.it covers garys performances from 1990-2001.he was one of the greatest guitar players ever.his performance of the obscure song\\"buisness as usual\\" had me in tears.he just tears through blues standards like \\"the stumble\\",\\"all your love\\",\\"tore down\\",\\"walking by myself\\", ect.he had so much energy,he gives it his all playing live.this disc will blow you away if your a fan or seeing him for the first time.r.i.p.
1594744769|2.0|Surprisingly dull. Not very well written nor engrossing. I am disappointed because it is a good idea for a story but it is poorly executed. It is tough to root for this hero. Plus it reminds my too much of Percy Jackson for some reason.
B004HEXSLI|4.0|My thoughts on this book:<br /><br />1. The details the author gives about brain and how it works was quite interesting for someone like me who is a Software Developer and don't get to see/know/learn things like this in my daily schedule.<br /><br />2. I think this book should be dedicated to mothers like GG - seriously. The care, love and thoughtfulness bestowed on any person could come only from a Mother. (now read the title of this review)<br /><br />3. The author mentions about the plasticity of the brain. I find Dr. Jill's story to describe how 'plastic' our brain is. In this regard, I found the book [[ASIN:0143113100 The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science (James H. Silberman Books)]] to be very fascinating and stimulating.<br /><br />Arun
B002WY65W4|1.0|Kudos to Amazon for not listing the Digital Copy on this product any more, but I read the back of the box (in the photos) and saw there was a Digital Copy...  But the fine print that said that the digital copy expires 2/2/2011.  Sony has only a one year allowance for use the digital copy.  I just BOUGHT this disk.  Pretty ticked off.<br /><br />I'm going to have to buy Blu-Ray from stores from now on, and carry a magnifying glass to read the (approximately) 4 point font.<br /><br />It's partially my fault because there are reviews and comments on this product related to this issue, but I'm not spending 20 minutes figuring out whether to purchase a $15 disk.  :)
0316056863|3.0|I was impressed by Fey being humorously thoughtful, and broadly funny, and serious about standing up for funny women.  I figured it would be close to impossible for a television writer to put out an entire book on one theme or even in one style, so it was good judgment to make this a hodgepodge of anecdotes. And, I liked the behind-the-scenes stories from SNL and 30 Rock (and Second City--I totally saw Second City when Tina Fey was there but I don't remember anything because I blacked out from laughing). Also, her awkward spazz persona came across without seeming hollow and fake, so I really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />However, it wasn't long enough--there were not $26 worth of words in here!<br /><br />In writing, Tina Fey is neither as funny nor as thoughtful as Haven Kimmel or David Sedaris. Is that an unfair comparison? No one forced her to get into the anecdotal humorous memoir game, so this is what she gets.<br /><br />Also, I didn't like the part where she answered emails.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was totally frustrated with this story. After waiting so long to find out what happens to all of these wonderful characters, I feel like their stories were an afterthought. Mr. Martin spends a lot of the book on side characters. And although one of the reasons I've enjoyed Song of Ice and Fire is the insight into the characters through their thoughts, I found myself skimming or skipping some of the meanderings of the side characters. When Mr. Martin does get to the stories of my favorite and beloved characters they move at a snail's pace or not at all. And although making any character vulnerable to injury or death does keep you on the edge, it seems like some of the most despicable characters have nine lives where the ones you cheer for the most are doomed (or in a very dark, precarious place.)<br />Also, as another reviewer points out, there were descriptions of food, clothing, plant and animal life, ad nauseum. It did put me in mind of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series where he endlessly describes clothing, etc. (Jordan didn't kill his beloved characters though.)<br />Was it worth the 6 year wait? I don't think this book moves the story along very much. But unfortunately since I've fallen in love with these characters, I had to find out if they'd survive (some don't.) Right now I'm so annoyed and disappointed about where the story ends I'm feeling like I won't read any more of the series. But I know in the end I probably will. If it takes another 6 years, I might change my mind!
B004LUHQ1G|2.0|I really wanted to like this album.  I like and own just about everything Dave has touched.  Before this album, I would say the weakest Foo Fighters album would be There is Nothing Left to Loose.  This one might be on par with that one.  I tried listening to it over and over, thinking that if I familiarize myself with it I may start to like it more.  That didn't work.  I like that they went back to basics and recorded it all analog, and Rope is a good single.  I also like White Limo.  It's reminds me of Weenie Beenie for their first album.  Unfortunately that's about all this album has going for it.  To me if I have to skip more than one or two tracks its not worth listening to an album at all.  So I guess this will stay on my shelf for a long while, until I give it another try or sell it.  I hope one day Dave can find his way back to the goofy fun power of the first two Foo Fighter albums.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Can a 67 year old rocker still make music that moves you?  The answer is a resounding affirmative.  \\"How to Become Clairvoyent\\" is a masterpiece from a master musician made with the help of many others. If you still resent Robbie for breaking up the Band, this cd will help you get over it.  It even includes a small apology/excuse in \\"When the Night was Young\\" about not being able to \\"strike up the band\\".  Robbie has always been a great musical storyteller and never better than in \\"Straight Down the Line\\" describing a journey \\"from the chitlin' circuit to the Peppermint Lounge\\".  He trades guitar solos with Robert Randolph's stinging pedal steel and shares vocals with Dana Glover, one of several female voices taking the rough edges off Robbie's tobacco-cured tenor.  And that's just the first two tracks. \\"Old Slowhand\\" makes many a contribution writing, playing and singing, especially on the soulful country blues, \\"Fear of Falling\\" and swapping guitar solos on \\"This is Where I Get Off\\". After the break-up of Cream, Eric crashed Big Pink in pink pants, hoping to join the Band.  At long last this ambition has been fulfulled and it was well worth the wait.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  This is an amazing woman.  I cannot imagine surviving what she did.  Her love for her mother and her daughters is so touching.    I do have a complaint about the excerpts about the cat and from her journal.  I could not increase the print size to read them.  I had to read these pages on my Iphone.  Had I not been able to do that, I would have missed out on that part of the story.  Please do something about that in the future in other books.  I am always disappointed in the quality of the pictures on Kindle.  These were actually better than most.  I rated the book a 4 because of the wonderful story of a woman's courage.  I would rate the Kindle edition of it a 2.  As noted in another comment, the lack of a contents page was unnecessary.
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|If you want to watch something satisfying and pleasant before bed... this is NOT the show to watch. I don't know how a premise that is so disgusting can be entertaining to ANYONE.  This is about a serial killer who kills serial killers = P.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|What an excellent read!!  A perfect blend of ancient Mythology and modern day magical adventure!  And yep, there's a great big helping of humor throughout, which I loved! \\"You are telling me that your lawyer is a bloodsucking vampire?\\"  Oh, and did I mention we're privy to 'mind-speak' conversations between the main character, Atticus and his Irish Wolfhound, Oberon?  Priceless!! ;-))  And then there's the Widow... \\"A friend will help ye move, Katie, but a really good friend will help ye move a body.\\"   This is one of those books (now I can say series since I've read the 3 books released to date - Hounded/Hexed/Hammered), that will totally captivate your imagination, and make you long to be part of such a fun ride!!  Don't let the abundance of names and places deter you either... you'll quickly latch on to the ones that play the biggest parts.  Just read this book - this series - it's a gift and you will be so happy you did!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best book series I've read in a long time.  I could not put it down.  Each page had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I found myself rooting for the heroine. I would recommend this book for teens through adult.
B00000JLWW|3.0|I was anxious to View this dvd, I thought I had deleted scenes, behind the scenes, etc.. but nothing of that, the film is in stereo, has very good sound, but you expect more for $ 54.00

0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey is one of the smartest people you'll ever meet via a good book. Bossypants is very funny and full of insights about her creations, and she's passes the praise around. Smart ladies everywhere can benefit from this book, and their Main Squeeze's should read it just to find out what's going on. Can't recommend it too highly.  M. Brown
0525423273|4.0|Cute. Cute, cute, cute.<br /><br />By the way, Anna and the French Kiss = Cute.<br /><br />You know the cliche, \\"my teeth are hurting, that was so sweet\\"? That fits this book perfectly. I think it gave me several cavities in the few hours it took for me to devour it, and yes - I devoured it.<br /><br />Sweet, real, funny (Oh so funny - laugh out loud funny), filled with perfect puppy-love, romantic atmosphere (can you get any more romantic than Paris?), friends, struggles, relationship drama, high school drama, boarding school drama.. you name it, this book had it.<br /><br />I've heard so much hype over the last several months about how perfect this book is, and while I agree that it was pretty darn close to perfect, I can't say that I necessarily LOVED IT AND MUST SWOON OVER ETIENNE. Because I can't - there was just a few too many cliched moments for me. However, I did find it absolutely adorable and a cut above the other books out there trying to capture that first \\"real\\" love moment. Despite his horrible name (Etienne St. Claire... really?) Etienne was a likeable guy with issues that were pretty darn real. Anna also struggled with some very familiar feelings - being away from home, learning lessons on forgiveness and on how to be independent. Anna and the French Kiss gently speaks about these issues while coating them into a delicious candy coating, filled with descriptions of Paris that had me longing to visit and descriptions of a romance that was just too. darn. cute.<br /><br />I'll be checking out Stephanie Perkins next book, to be certain. I enjoy a good, fluffy young adult novel every now and then and this definitely hit the spot.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A BOB fan, I took my time to get Pacific.  The production and acting are excellent and the personalized story lines gripping.  I watched in horror; my wife watched from behind a pillow.  It gives you bad dreams.  The epilogue offers brief biographies of the Marines followed.  I was so haunted that I bought their books - biographies written by survivors of that carnage, not historians.  Read them all back to back from the library, then bought my own copies to keep.    These Marines were mostly boys whose lives and bodies were torn apart by this insane mechanized war.  They weren't the Rambos or Seal Team Six, they were scrawny, milk-cheeked kids with guns and unfathomable guts.  Their stories remind us (those of us who care to listen) of the reality behind the slogans and euphemisms.  The producers of this film are faithful to the accounts of the real men - even those that you'll think just had to be Hollywood.  Happened.    Watch it. It's more than a film; it's our collective history, sorrow, and shame.  What a waste of wonderful lives.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Awesome game and graphics. Thanks for the free offering! I really enjoy it on my rooted nook color. It looks awesome.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I paid for it after all.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert)<br /><br />Sadly Martin continues his painful tradition of killing off the honorable characters and letting his evil ones live to fight another day.  Enough, we get it, life is hard on Westros.  I think he will lose a lot of readers as they have fewer and fewer options to cheer for.  As one writer quipped by Book 6 or 7 the only group he will have left to write about will be the Others.
0060989157|5.0|Awesome book, hands down one of the best autobiographies of a rock band ever.  Reads really easy and is a lot better from the entire group, rather than one persons memories of how things went down.  Motley Crue really knew how to party!!  Would have loved to have been a part of it (if I could have survived)
B000ZN802W|3.0|Good movie mostly, but some sadness prevails.  As he chooses the live off the land rather than do the corporate grind, you can tell he is  not at all prepared to meet the wild head on.  I guess we can all see ourselves in him from  time to time.  A bit slow moving and the scenery is terrific.
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|Just another app abandoned here in the Appstore... Two updates have been put out on Android Market for this since I downloaded it; still nothing here in the Appstore...

1451629184|5.0|A Stolen Life was a remarkable \\"read\\".  I highly recommend it and admire Jaycee Dugard's courage then and now!
1878424505|2.0|I am human and imperfect. I am not at my best when I am tired or frustrated or dissapointed or overwhelmed. Sometimes I even make bad choices on purpose!

B003EYVXSW|2.0|I think the people behind \\"Splice\\" were going for a tragic-Frankenstein-like tale, but missed the mark horribly. Going into the film, I had some expectation (not a lot...but some) that it would be a fun creature-feature type flick. I mean it had an Academy Award winner as its star, it had to be somewhat better than a SyFy Channel original movie...right?<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />\\"Splice\\" tells the story of two genetic scientists (Adrian Brody & Sarah Polley)who've created a new life form by combining certain elements from a bunch of animals. These two \\"animals\\" which look like leather bags filled with bad cheese are producing an protien that helps fight diseases in animals. The scientists want to take the next step of adding human DNA into the mix. They are told no, and of course do it anyway. Soon a little hamster-chicken thing is running around the lab eating Tic Tac's. For some reason the hamster-chicken grows super-fast and the scientist begin raising it like a little girl, and before you know it blamm-o she's a young woman...with a poison filled stinger at the tip of her tail.<br /><br />There were just so many mis-steps in \\"Splice\\" it's difficult to just pinpoint where the movie veers off-course, but my guess would be when you first meet the two scientists in the opening scenes with their meat-sack creations, and by the time you see the little chicken-hamster thing, you can't help but start chuckling. What kind of scientists are these guys, the certainly aren't very good evil scientists, and they are not likable, and to top it off the they drive around in a 1970's era AMC Gremlin! Just poor judgement all aound.<br /><br />Also, on a side note. If you are making a horror film, at least try to make it somewhat scary. There is no tension, no suspense and no horror in \\"Splice\\"...well except for Adrian Brody's love-makin' face which we get to see twice unfortunately. Just a horrible film, that at times is laughable, but not in a good way. I recommend \\"Sharktopus\\" or \\"Dinocroc\\" instead. Sure they're bad, but they at least accomplish what they set out to do.they're bad, but they at least accomplish what they set out to do.
0156027321|5.0|This is why I read! I loved it! It was well written, exciting, unpredictable, and thought provoking! It was fun, mystical, educational, and captivating! It was just fantastic! Even my small kids wanted to know what happen next after every chapter. Pulls the rug right from under you. Yann Martel is a genius.
1451629184|5.0|As many have said, this is a page-turner, because even though (I assume) we all know how the story ends, you cannot help but wonder how Jaycee got through it all. I have never cried so much reading a book... it was terribly difficult at places because it was so graphic - but I know it needed to be told, as Jaycee is only doing it to reclaim her life, and to take away the control those events in her mind. I think we can all learn something about life from her story, and that she is helping the world to become a better place by sharing it. I am very grateful that she let us into her world.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|As what might be considered a serious classical recording enthusiast, my collection includes many separate (as opposed to complete sets) recordings of all nine (9) symphonies.   Truth be told, the main reason for me trying to obtain all of Anton's monumental Symphonies was because in my college days a professor that I admired and respected greatly advised me that any \\"serious\\" classical recording collection MUST have Bruckner's symphonies.  Therefore, down through the years I tried to procure all of his symphonies.  Until purchasing this bargained ($36.97) nine (9) disc set brilliantly conducted by Herbert von Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic, I really did NOT have too much appreciation for Bruckner's symphonies.  To be brutally honest, and most important to me, I never found any of the performances in this collection to be \\"sleep inducing\\" as I have found in so many performances of Bruckner's Symphonies.  Karajan's tempos, rhythms, melodic details, etc., seemed so very good that I found myself yelling \\"bravo\\" many times.      By the way DGG has done a great job re-engineering these late 1970s and early  1980s recordings,  The sound is spectacular.

B001CDLATE|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in the theater, on laser disc, DVD, and now Blu Ray.  It is such a beautiful meditation on the experience of living, that any medium will convey the feeling of this film.  Of course the Blu Ray version is incredible, but watching it in the theater was a communal experience, know what I mean?

0316056863|2.0|I really enjoy Tina Fey and her humor, but unfortunately, I didn't like this book. I thought it would be better and funnier, but it fell short in my opinion. Go to the library for this one - don't buy it.
0812550706|1.0|Firstly, I should make it clear that I loved the original 1970s short story on which this novel was based. I also love many of the characters in this book, including Ender; after reading reviews highlighting the lack of depth and plausibility of these characters, I would probably agree that I identify with Ender due to bad experiences I had at school (which had nothing to do with intellectual superiority, and everything to do with my poor social skills!).     However... I find it hard to understand how people cannot notice the deep themes of child abuse that run through this novel. From the struggle within Ender (the abused) to avoid becoming Peter (his first abuser), to \\"Uncle Graf\\" isolating Ender by removing him first from the protection of his family and then from friendships with his peers.     Though Graff and Peter say that they love Ender as he sleeps in bed, their behaviour isn't loving; it's psychological and physical torture. There is a particularly disturbing chapter where Graff watches the boys in the shower as they fight naked to the death. This follows from the scene where Graff explains how he plans to convince Ender that no matter what, no adult will ever come to his rescue. Interestingly, Graff is later prosecuted for his treatment of these boys; he is fully acquitted and offered a promotion.    What I found most disturbing of all was the way in which very young children were presented as being capable of adult speech, thought and actions. In fact I seem to remember it being stated several times that the characters didn't really feel like children/weren't really children. From my limited knowledge of the psychology of child abusers, this is a belief held by a subgroup.     I have read other criticisms of this book that object to the hero committing genocide and calculated murder while remaining virtually blameless. What I also find difficult to accept is that in the same way that the situations Ender was placed in make his acts of extreme violencemorally acceptable, the acts of child abuse carried out by Ender's 'teachers' are similarly justified. Even Peter, who tortured his young siblings and small animals and then manipulated his way into power, is apparently redeemed at the end of the book with no sign that he felt guilt or regretted hurting others.    I can definitely see how someone (especially a hurt and isolated boy) could find strength and gain focus in their life from this book. Equally, I can see how they could find justification for hurting others - apparently this is a recommended text for military recruits. I certainly would not recommend this to any child and would only recommend it to an adult who's child/boyfriend had already read it; this is so that the adult could offer a balanced argument against some of Card's distasteful implicit viewpoints.    In summary, this book caught my attention and taught me a lot about the warped psychology of certain individuals. But I don't think that was what the author intended.
0380973839|5.0|I just read this for the first time and loved it. I am a big fan of futuristic stories and Bradbury gives a great story. Hard to believe that a science fiction book this old can still be taken seriously, but it definitely is worth the read!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is definitely worth reading.  I didn't want to stop reading although I had to at times because I was so emotional. The details are vivid, the story is heart wrenching.  There are no words to describe the horrible things that poor girl went through and to come out of it so positive is beyond me. Much love and prayers for Jaycee and her family.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|Pride and Prejudice deserves a 5 star rating, but this Kindle edition is sloppy, and \\"free\\" is not an excuse.  Those familiar with Jane Austen, and P&P in particular, need only search for \\"call her mother a wit\\" to see what I mean.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I've always wanted to get a better idea of the Foo Fighters and how they came to be, the line-up changes, and what's in store for the future. This DVD covered everything! Awesome documentary on the greatest band out there!

B003YUSLYA|5.0|I have been a Crocs fan from the get go, and I applaud the launch of a canvas shoe that far outdoes the conventional sneaker of it's type. They are so light and comfortable. Best of all, they don't really look like Crocs.
031261246X|3.0|Make no mistake, it is still an entertaining read, and if you're into the business of computer security you should just read it.<br />Almost every time a woman comes into the scene there is a sexual reference, so its shows its a nerd behind the pen, but I've seen a lot of more seasoned writers make this same mistake.
0765367297|3.0|This book doesn't really need a review does it? I needed something kind of light to decompress between chapters of Revolutionary Road and this one hit the spot. There's nothing really special about Halo sci-fi. In fact, there's nothing really that interesting about the Halo universe in general...that is except for the fact that the Master Chief is a bad ass. This book is a prequel to the games and tells a little bit of the origins of the Chief and his fellow Spartan super soldiers, and why exactly it is that by the start of the game he's the only one left. Decent entertainment.
0553801473|2.0|Severely disappointing. Both these things needed to happen: 1) A drastic reduction in wordcount, cutting out all the fat, including the lengthy passages where characters move from one location to another without accomplishing anything; and 2) A drastic increase in wordcount as the book builds towards three climaxes, in the North (Stannis), in the Far East, and in the South, but fails to deliver on any of them. Seriously, the book just stops.<br /><br />Other negatives included ending on a cliffhanger for one major character, and the loss of suspense. In the earlier books, anyone could die any time - a couple of the Starks as very good examples. Here, even minor characters have over 9000 lives, such as Davos Seaworth.<br /><br />Highly unlikely to purchase hardcover for the next one - thank God for public libraries.
0006755232|4.0|A really fantastic story in theme. Jones's novel is full of fun magic and fantasy suitable for all ages, yes even adults, but I found her pacing to be a little off. It was fun to see how Sophie came to cope with living with Howl in a magic castle, and more importantly to see how her relationship with Howl himself unfolds, but I have to admit, I felt no real mystery from this book. Jones doesn't really build up revelations or secrets very well, in fact I hardly cared at all about what any of the characters were hiding. I was much more interested in their personalities. So when push came to shove and the truth is out in the last 15 or so pages, I was confused and disinterested.<br /><br />In spite of these somewhat strong criticisms, I think that again, the strength of the book lies in its characters. I really like Sophie a lot. She's perhaps only the second fictional woman I fell in love with (the first being Elphaba). She's very strong, witty and independent, a strong female lead character that sheds none of her intimacy or tenderness in her assertiveness. She's devious, but at the same time overwhelmingly kind and deferential, and in spite of the fantasy and magic going on around her, she's incredibly real. I think she can do much better than Howl.

0553386794|4.0|The beginning of a modern fantasy epic that has the potential to be very, very good. I have to admit that halfway through I was having trouble understanding what all the hype was about. Martin takes his sweet time setting up his dominoes before starting off a chain reaction that unravels quickly with quite a few satisfying and saddening twists and turns by the end. While the first half of the book reads quite slowly (there's a massive cast of characters to introduce and geography to be laid out) the second half is quite gripping. Martin definitely deserves credit for the development of his plot and some, but not all of the characters. There are three separate, but finely intertwined stories that develop quite independent of each other throughout the course of the novel and one gets just the briefest glances of how they may someday come thundering together.<br /><br />What's good? Martin constructs an interesting world that is heavily back-storied. In that respect, I suppose you could compare him to Tolkein. Families have lineages listed in an appendix and races and religions have histories that are deep. You can tell that Martin took as much care constructing the setting of his world and the tangential elements as he did with the main plot and characters. There's just a hint of magic and fantasy throughout most of the story that leaves you yearning for more. This is a world that's moved beyond magic and dragons - a time beyond the Age of Heroes and is mostly a story about men, and a few very cunning and clever women, who play out their lives doing what men throughout history have always done: they fight over territory, women, pride and honor to the disaster of their fellow men. Not to worry though, Martin starts to deliver and we do see some traditional fantasy elements begin to rear their heads by the end, which entices us into the second book. The politicking and intrigue is layered and keeps you guessing throughout most of this work and a lot of the predictions I made for where the story was going failed to materialize, which was actually quite pleasant. It feels like he's doing something quite unexpected and different from the usual vein of the fantasy genre. The characters are wonderfully round too, much to young Sansa's (who believes in epic tales of good knights and evil villains; a character not unlike the typical fantasy reader) despair. Noble men like Eddard Stark are blinded by their preoccupation with duty and honor into impracticality while crude and barbaric individuals display the occasional and inexplicable kindness, perhaps spurred by a memory of their past or a desire to be something more human for once. You find yourself rooting for some characters to be vindicated and ridiculously pleased when things turn against those you despise. Favorite among these is Tyrion Lannister, the misshapen dwarf brother of some of the main antagonists in this volume. It reminds me a lot of what Moore did for comic book superheroes in the 1980s with Watchmen.<br /><br />What's bad? I think Martin is trying too hard to be a rogue among epic high fantasy writers. Yes, it's refreshing to get characters with a bit more gray in this genre rather than the stark blacks and whites and naivet&eacute; that are symptomatic of the poorer novels in this field, but it's easy to see how he can sometimes go overboard with the blood and rape and pillaging and the like. Maybe that's some people's cup of tea, but I could do without graphic depictions of rape several times throughout the course of a single volume of a multi-part epic. It's enough to introduce the idea that war is bad. Anyone with a shred of knowledge of history knows how terribly unpleasant it is to be among the losers in a war, especially if you're female. The casualness of these scenes is unpleasant and highly uncomfortable. Some people might argue that that was the intent of the author, and that's all well and good, but this series hardly strikes me as one that aims to break societal conventions and get us to rethink our culture and values. It's very nature is escapist entertainment and I don't like repeated instances of rape, especially of young girls, in my escapist entertainment and it made me uncomfortable enough to make me drop it a star in my rating. Other reviewers complained that the multiple sex scenes distracted from the narrative as a whole or were too explicit, but I don't necessarily agree with that. Yes, this is an R-rated book, but it's not smut fiction. As I mentioned earlier the beginning takes a long time to play out too. The pacing in the first half seemed like it could use some work from an editor, but I think it meshes by the end and you have to remember that this book was planned as only the beginning of an entire series that's thousands of pages long, so four hundred or so of exposition isn't too bad.d get us to rethink our culture and values.

0553582038|2.0|I took the advice of several reviews and divided my reading into \\"mini character books\\".  This has worked for me as each character's story has stayed fresh in my mind. I've finished Jaime, Brienne and Sam and am still left with many questions.  This is not as fun a read as the first three books.  The story is moving along very slowly and I find myself skipping over extremely descriptive sections regarding food, clothing or the scenery.  I thought ADWD was the last book, but just read that there are a total of 7?  Yikes - might have to take a break and read some other things.  It's almost become work reading these books!
0553573403|5.0|The moment I turned the last page of Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, I immediately checked to see if there was a copy available at my local library for the next book, Clash of Kings. There it was, all 1000 pages of it. I breathed a sigh of relief. You have before you a penitent, former skeptic, now convert. I get it. It may be 100 degrees outside, but my friends, Winter is Coming!!!<br /><br />Let me back up a little as to how my book club decided to read Game of Thrones for the month of June 2011 in the first place. You see we are fiery women who do not like being told what we ought to like or not like to read. We took offense, as many other women did, at New York Times' Ginia Bellafante's claim that HBO threw in a bunch of sex scenes in its adaptation of the book to lure women who would otherwise not touch Game of Thrones:<br /><br />\\"The true perversion, though, is the sense you get that all of this illicitness has been tossed in as a little something for the ladies, out of a justifiable fear, perhaps, that no woman alive would watch otherwise. While I do not doubt that there are women in the world who read books like Mr. Martin's, I can honestly say that I have never met a single woman who has stood up in indignation at her book club and refused to read the latest from Lorrie Moore unless everyone agreed to \\"The Hobbit\\" first. \\"Game of Thrones\\" is boy fiction patronizingly turned out to reach the population's other half.\\"<br /><br />Can I get a \\"Oh, no she didn't!\\" Bellafante has been raked repeatedly over the coals on this one so I won't go into the all sorts of wrong, wrong, and wrong goin' on in her abyss of ignorance. Let's just talk about the good stuff, shall we?<br /><br />First, although I do read fantasy on occasion, I have to be lured to it with the promise of lots and lots of sex scenes :) Unfortunately, there is a paucity of sex scenes in a book of this length and not that many scenes of knitting or shopping and, I have to caution you gals, no matchmaking balls whatsoever. However did it entertain this female reader?<br /><br />The writing, the world building, and the characters - all spellbinding. I read the first chapter and shivered with delight (and from the ominous catch phrase woven throughout the book \\"Winter is coming.\\" - cool in all the right ways during a hot summer)<br /><br />\\"Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.<br /><br />His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye.<br /><br />The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw.<br /><br />The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold.\\"<br /><br />Game of Thrones' first surprise was although it has fantasy elements, this first of the series has more in common with Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel than Lord of the Rings. The royal court is full of political intrigue and treachery by the power-hungry; I could not help but compare it to reading about the Tudors. As the title indicates, there are several kings, would-be kings, and usurpers vying for control. The Starks, a noble family far north of the Seven Kingdoms, have been ensnared in the dangerous web of the King's Court when Lord Eddard reluctantly becomes the King's Hand (think of him as Thomas Cromwell to Henry VIII). His unswerving loyalty to the King, a loveable man of large appetites, leads to tragedy as those in court double-deal, even triple-deal in their ruthless pursuit of power.<br /><br />Martin's brilliance to me lies in the characters he chose to tell the interweaving stories. There are many characters and many families in Game of Thrones (not to fear, though, lineage charts in the back of the book). Rather than focusing only on the heroic and larger than life characters that typically people fantasy books,we see this world through the outcasts' perspectives: Lord Eddard's bastard outcast son, Jon Snow; Lord Eddard's tomboy daughter, Arya; the King's disrespected brother-in-law, the dwarf Tyrion; and the child bride of the King of the Dothraki, Dani.<br /><br />And this is where Game of Thrones won me (and broke my heart a couple of times. I actually yelled, \\"NO! in anguish at a scene when a beloved character came to harm. Mr. Martin, if you kill off Bran, I will never forgive you. Ever.) The novel is set in a medieval-ish, feudal society where the men rule and women are mere helpmates and child-bearers. Or so I first thought. During the first few chapters, I marveled at the writing but groaned when I thought Martin might prove Bellafante right.<br /><br />Yes, it is a patriarchal society, but I will make the argument that it is the women - Lady Catelyn Stark, Cersei Lannister, and Dani - who drive the story. If it were not for Lady Stark and Queen Cersei, the Seven Kingdoms would not have been plunged into civil war. And Dani, oh Dani- how I dismissed you at first as a weak trophy wife beneath my interest. Well, folks, I'm here to tell you that hers is the most riveting of the storylines. From where she begins to where she ends is a magnificent journey that simply stunned me. Everything about Game of Thrones blew my expectations.<br /><br />\\"'You are a woman, my lady,' the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice. 'Women do not understand these things.'<br /><br />\\"'You are the gentle sex,' said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. 'A man has need for vengeance.'<br /><br />\\"'Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how gentle a woman can be,' Catelyn replied.\\"<br /><br />Wanting desperately to know what happens to rebellious Jon Snow, sweet Bran, Dani, and plucky Arya is what has got me pledging my summer, fall, winter, and in all probability spring to the Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />Incidentally, Game of Thrones led to the first really vigorous discussion I've ever had with my dad over a book. To my knock-me-over-with-a-feather surprise, I found out that he is a die hard a fan of many years.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|Well when you listen to a project for such a public figure you really have to take into account everything you know about the artist. Well for starters she recently married and has been in the business well over a decadeand is a international artist for starters.  This is truly reflective of her life and influences to this point of her life and all the songs truly exhibit this to the fullest.  First of all I have to say that when you listen to a Beyonce song you have to take into acoount that a recording studio just doesnt do her any justice.  I have yet to experience an artist who outdoes herself.  Her performance of 1+1 on American Idol almost makes you not recognize the album version.  She bought the house DOWN.  It was really beyond words.  So when you listen to the tracks you just can imagine what she sounds like live and it really puts the song in a whole nother perspective.  I Care, La La La and all of the vocal acrobatics she does in the background are quite amazing.  Track after track she really demonstrates variety and depth of her style and vocal power. Best thing I never had is a song that can make us all look back our good fortunes.  Party is reminiscent of Jahne and Love on Top just gives you Whitney Houston vibe/style. Countdown put in a Destiny's Child frame of mind, with a little hiphop perspective.  End of Time and I was here just gives you a collective we are one vibe and Run the World consistent with her girl power, Single Ladies mode.  Each track flows into the next and make you feel whole and very satisfied. Like her article in Complex Mag she reflected on a 80's vibe in regard to the direction of this project and it is true to form.  We should really be counting our blessings to witness an artist of this magnitude in our lifetime and not spend time trying to find flaws in her.  She is incredibly beautiful, vocally magnificent, humble and owns the stage.  There will be not another in our lifetime with all those attributes so we should give credit where it is due.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Such an imaginative series with great eye candy as well and the guys can actually act too and the lead female is not just an airhead but is smart.  It keeps you guessing every step of the way.
B00004XQ8H|5.0|The first recording of Richard Strauss's famous \\"Vier letzte lieder\\"  (not counting concert premiere in 1950s where Flagstad sang it) this is a note-perfect interpretation of a classic piece, surprisingly recorded not in usually accepted order but  in a way they were originally completed,therefore it starts with \\"On going to sleep\\".    The very first time I fell in love with this music,it was the recording by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and my own croatian Lovro von Matai done in the very same year as Della Casa - 1953 - so naturally,listening and loving that one made me prejudiced towards all the other versions. After all these years i still keep my ears open and out of curiosity I like to check what other artist can do with the same material (often I wonder what Schwarzkopf though herself about Jessye Norman 1982 recording? Was she pleased? Upset? Envious? If anybody knows let me know) and thought often its very much the same thing,occasionally its simply the sound of different voice that makes a huge difference. Nothing would ever replace majestic Schwarzkopf for me but I must admit that Della Casa is actually very,very close to the top of what I have heard so far - everything about her singing,poise and sensitivity is inspired,it also helps that she is backed by no less than Wiener Philharmoniker under the baton of celebrated Karl Böhm so prepare yourself to be swept away by the sheer beauty of the music.    The rest of CD is filled with selections from \\"Arabella\\", \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\" and \\"Capriccio\\" where Della Casa shines perhaps even more - this is impressive beyond words and here finally I stopped to think about Schwarzkopf and simply enjoyed music. Her duets with Hilde Guelden and Paul Schoeffler are such attack on the senses that I couldn't keep still and had to walk a little - it is very interesting that music can make such effect on the listener,absolutely intoxicating!
B004EQAVFU|5.0|I've looked at many of the reviews of this movie here on the Amazon site. Many of these reviews are a result of thought and articulation.  I wish I could write as does Kazuo Ishiguro. This quality of this review would then be greatly improved. Alas, that is not to be. I found this to be a moving and touching morality tale. Great questions are posed. Answerers are not provided. This is a film that will stay with you. To me, it was a perfect film. I thank all involved in producing this work of art.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I'm a mathematician myself, so i might be biased, but having the main character as a mathematician was pretty cool, as well as the use of hanafuda in the story.  Its a great family movie and even non-anime fans will enjoy the detailed animation and deep story telling.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|Um... what? That was what I said after the movie was over.<br /><br />OK, Mr. Aronofsky, I get it. I get the whole \\"price of fame\\" and \\"an artist's sacrifice\\" and \\"dark underbelly of high art\\" thing. I even buy it. I buy Natalie Portman's strong, haunting performance. I buy the nonsense she has to go through in order to rise to the top. I buy the notion that a young woman can go through 20+ years of her life being completely normal, then all of a sudden crack under pressure and develop full-blown paranoid schizophrenia. I even buy the notion that the drawn-out lesbian sex scene is somehow relevant to the story, though I fail to see how.<br /><br />What I DO NOT buy is that a person - any person in this world, even a raving schizophrenic - can dance two acts of a ballet (and dance perfectly at that) with a foot-long mirror shard embedded under their ribs, without batting an eyelid or anyone noticing or even a droplet of blood falling... then CONVENIENTLY begin to bleed just as the orchestra plays the final climatic chord.<br /><br />Seriously? Five stars? What are you people smoking? What is the Academy smoking even nominating this nonsense for best picture? Two stars for Natalie Portrman and only Natalie Portman. Aronofsky should have fewer mirrors in his house, he's not the genius he seems to think he is.
0811875040|3.0|As mentioned by many, many reviewers, yes there are numerous mistakes in this book.  I ordered it anyway, because I'm a sucker for aesthetics and really wanted  book with smaller portions. I printed out the list of errata from Chronicle Books' website and just keep it handly in the cover.  However, not only does my copy contain the regular errors in the recipes, but about 5 pages were bound upside down.  It's on an informative section rather than where the recipes are actually located, so I think I'm just going to let it go rather than try to get an exchange.  It's just very disappointing.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|I really enjoyed the Captain America film.  I've read most of the Kirby-inspired comics and his adventures in the modern times, but the film takes place when Captain America was first scripted, during the days of World War II.<br /><br />In the 1940s comic book companies wrote plenty of patriotic stories and encouraged their readers to buy war bonds and even to (sadly) donate their comics collections and have them pulped for the war effort (painful to type that).<br /><br />Story & Plot:<br /><br />Great themes in this story.  A man who was born weak and asthmatic whose best friend is going off to war.  Steve Rogers wants to go along but has been 4-F'd several times.  A casual conversation with Rogers and gang is overheard by a professor Abraham who encourages Rogers to be the guinea pig in an experiment that would create super soldiers.<br /><br />Meanwhile another man, ostensibly fighting for the Nazi's, has his own plans.  He too has been subjected to an earlier form of the super soldier serum.  But Schultz, now super-sized, becomes the Red Skull and his minions of Hydra wish nothing less than world conquest.<br /><br />The clash between the Red Skull and Captain America is palpable with emotion.  The good guy gets his lumps; the bad guy retreats in defeat.<br /><br />War!<br /><br />Several scenes were memorable:  The experiment that made a skinny runt into a tall, handsome super-soldier is relegated to selling war bonds and basically being made fun of.  He's made into a symbol by Madison Avenue.  They even make comic books out of him - such irony.  The silly costume and the dancing girls are the icing on the cake.<br /><br />We have a version of the Howling Commandoes here as they are led by a new Captain America and he gives the Red Skull a bloody nose in several battles - the Captain with his shield and the Red Skull with his new laser weapons, powered by a technology that may have come from \\"the treasure room of Odin.\\"<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I've read some reviews of fans who were disappointed, but they just don't get that this is an adaptation of the comics - that it must be altered for those who have never heard of Captain America and are unfamiliar with his story.  The World War II angle with the Nazi's was necessary as that's when the Captain was first formed.<br /><br />And who would not want to see a few Nazi's burned, huh?<br /><br />A combination of an Indiana Jones-type thriller and the sensibility of Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow, a must-watch for comics fans and friends of fantasy.et that this is an adaptation of the comics - that it must be altered for those who have never heard of Captain America and are unfamiliar with his story.

B000TEUCFA|5.0|A really great album - probably her best yet. She has proved she is as good singing contemporary stuff as she is in singing from the American Songbook - probably better I'd say. The quality of the material she is working with is first rate as is the band and her interpretations are marvellous - she makes each song her own and this is best illustrated on Armstrong's \\"What a wonderful world\\" - after hearing her version it's hard to go back to Sashmo's rendition.

B0025KVLS8|5.0|This is the sound of Beatlemania.  This is the sound that changed the landscape of popular music. It is the sound that impelled thousands of young men to pick up guitars and learn to write their own songs.  This one.  Not \\"Rubber Soul,\\" nor \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". Absent is the mannerism of \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" (not that those two are not outstanding albums, but they lack the spontaneity evident on every track on this singular work).  It is not an accident that it is very much John Lennon's album.  Only three tracks are Paul's.  John wrote \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in one night.  McCartney, if asked, would probably say he helped John on each one - but that is Paul's ego speaking which is harder than Everest to climb and just as foggy.  Not one croaker in the bunch.  Make no kistake, in 1964 this was as hard as rock had ever been.  Listen to their competition: Dean Martin, Ferrante and Teicher, the derivitiveness of early Beach Boys (\\"Fun, Fun, Fun,\\" \\"Surfin USA\\"), Fabian, a mellowed out and gutless Elvis, and the once great Louis Armstrong.  Fifty percent of all popular music sold in the early sixties was instrumental. This album and the film to which its acts as soundtrack changed that (even the bastardized US version featured abysmal instrumentals). Their first two albums were fresh but it was in this album that their songwriting skills came into their own and they soared with confidence and energy the like of which has never hit the airwaves before (and perhaps since).  If the group had released nothing after this, they would still rank in the Pantheon for this effort alone.  To these ears, it ranks as one of their two greatest albums.
B0014I4KIK|3.0|While many compare Duffy and Winehouse as far as their voices and styles are concerned, it seems to me there is not much common ground between them.  Winehouse's voice smolders, Duffy's simply laments. Winehouse swaggers, Duffy sashays.  Winehouse breathes fire, Duffy gasps deep concern. Don't get me wrong, Duffy is a fine singer but she could not attempt to do justice to, say, \\"Back to Black\\" on her best day (it would sound like an adolescent's complaint).  Duffy's material does not aid her in the least.  Three songs here are very good, the rest, as other critics here have maintained, sound alike.  One always gets the feeling that when Winehouse sings it is as though her life depended on it, Duffy sings as though she wants to make certain of having her way with the notes.  If Duffy were to be compared to Britney or Pink (to the detriment of the Americans) it would serve her better.
B003WTE886|4.0|This is a very good album! Most of the songs were good but some just annoyed me. Her first two albums were better then this one also. My favorite songs were Speak Now, Sparks Fly, and The Story of Us. The worst song was Back to December. Thanks for readin!
1451629184|4.0|Amazing book! It is amazing to read the ordeal Jaycee went through for so long. I can not imagine being taken away from my family and surviving. This story is a true tale of survival and strength. I hope and pray for the best for her and her family now as she reunites with her mother, sister and aunt as well as readjusts to life being free with her two daughters.<br /><br />**Warning*** I was quite surprised at the language used in the book. Not a book for minors. Also, some pretty explicit details are given of the amount of torture and abuse Jaycee experienced. I would not recommend anyone under 18 reading it unless a parent has read it first and gave approval.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars

0553801473|4.0|A lot of what the other reviewers say has merit.  The story does not progress much from the last book and it could have used a bit more editing. I never got to a point in this book where I absolutely couldn't put it down even to go to sleep (a point I reached many many times in the first 3 books in the series) but I also never had to force myself to pick it up again like I did for the first half of a Feast for Crows (The second half of Feast totally redeemed the book for me though).  A lot of Dance for Dragons is a build up to the next book, but there is enough new food for thought to keep it interesting and Martin's writing is so good, his characters and the universe that they inhabit so rich, that the book is still thoroughly enjoyable.
0439023513|4.0|From the moment I finished reading \\"The Hunger Games\\", I became obsessed with Katniss, Peeta, Gale and Panem. I devoured Catching Fire and felt like I couldn't breathe until I finished \\"Mockingjay.\\" Even though I was riveted by the heartfelt love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale, Collins reminds us with this last installment that this was not supposed to be a romance series. If you're looking for the romance you're not going to find it with this one. What you'll find instead is war and everything it entails. This book is deeply sad, and will leave you wondering about the state of mankind. At the end of the story, Katniss is with someone she loves, but the way in which it all comes together is unbelievable.
B004UHPU5E|4.0|It has been months since getting this album, and it has worn well.  If you want old King Crimson, go listen to old King Crimson records. If you want mildly stimulating, pseudo-melodic King Crimson elevator music, this is the ticket.
B000006OS2|5.0|I grew up watching this movie with my Dad.  Also, one of my husband's favorites.  Doesn't matter how many times we have watched it, we laugh every time.  Despite we know the dialogue by heart, we continue to watch over and over
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I had never heard of Florence and the Machine before until last winter when I randomly came across the Drumming Song video on youtube and was blown away. Then I found the Cosmic Love song and loved that one even more. After listening to most of the songs and loving them, I had to get this cd. It's definitely a favorite now.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This megamix of games certainly doesn't rank up there with the top-of-the-line mobile games available these days, but for those who enjoy puzzles and very simple mini-games, then you'll enjoy this mix. I have spent plenty of time playing these games during short periods of downtime, like when waiting on a friend, or during a break at work. Not all of them have been worth my while, but it's not like I have a shortage of games to choose from. =)
B000GFLE86|5.0|The voice is especially pleasing.  The lyrical ascendency is captured by her unique phrasing and inflection.  A true original and an instant standard and classic performer.
B000RWEM3M|2.0|I liked the first two books much more than this one. Up to the point he sails off in search of the dragons he deals with the aftermath of a war that changed everyone. What was exciting about people has ceased to be exciting, and relationships start collapsing. Then it does get lame as he heads off in search of the land of the dragons. It feels like the first part of the book was a novella that lacked a satisfactory ending and he desperately grabbed for anything to come up with a rock-em sock-em ending (which it wasn't).
B004X8W4A4|5.0|Reading this book was like watching a movie of the TV series.  The characters though some name changes followed the TV series very well.  Very difficult trying to see \\"who doneit\\", a surprise ending.  Who is Richard Castle?
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is high fantasy at its prime. You feel for the characters, you want more of the world's past lore, and you experience the pain and hardships going on throughout the book. At one point I almost felt tired of running back and forth holding bridges haha.<br /><br /> Brandon took years to write this one, and I can't wait for the rest of the series. This is a book you can not miss if you're a fan of epic fantasy, buy it and be prepared for a very good read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is very entertaining but is also extremely addicting.  I lost much sleep and even skipped some work because of this game. I now dream of corn catapults and zombies.
0553801473|2.0|Martin is a very good writer. We have to understand that we're reading an ancient political drama, and a lot of the time in a feudal society people die. But Martin seems to forget that most people read epic fantasy books for a dramatic story of protagonist and antagonist with eventually the good side winning in the end. Its called an escape from reality for a reason. In the Song books, no one ever wins.<br /><br />  As the series goes on it gets slightly more depressing. Not in the 'Harry Potter' way either, unless Harry dies in the first book and Hermione is raped every now and then. But in a way that seems that even when the series is all over, and even if humanity survives in the end, who really cares? Everyone you cheered for is either dead or crippled, and Martin is going to be discussing what the few survivors are eating or something.<br /><br />  Overall I enjoyed the book, I'm just disappointed with the overall downturn of the series.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I've taken my 15 month old daughter out on four bike rides so far, and she's had a blast! I think she likes being able to see what's going on. She's a bit of a chunk, but she fits fine in the seat, and when she gets tired she can lay her head on the padded front piece.  The only downside is that when she gets fussy, she can grab at the handlebars and actually jerk the steering a bit. So, I need to keep both hands on the handlebars when she's in a mood.

0345444051|5.0|Sir Arthur's early effort in speculative science fiction is an astounding piece of story-telling. Although Clarke himself has expressed that this novel is not his personal best, it at least must be one of his most important. Childhood's End refers to the end of humanity as we know it - no, this is not a disaster or dystopian extrapolation, it is humanity's first step into an 'adulthood' of true understanding, extra-sensorary evolution and an era of meaning and purpose for the race.<br /><br />Like many of Clarke's works, the scope of this novel is phenomenal. From the appearance of starships hovering over every major city on the planet (a notion borrowed liberally by countless films), we know that humanity will never be the same again. How would humankind react to irrefuteable proof of extra-terrestrial life? Or benign, superior alien life, to be more precise? Shock, anger, acceptance, indifference are but a sample of humankind's somewhat fickle reactions to the Overlords' presence. Their purpose is mysterious, but their impact is staggering: the atrocities of the previous eras come to a close overnight, for what use is it to squabble among ourselves when all secrets are observed, known and occasionally controlled by the Overlords?<br /><br />The novel shows us more about human nature than any other intelligence in the novel (and let me tell you, there is more than one other intelligence described). In this sense, there is a wealth of social psychology to consider, but Clarke's excellent pacing ensures we're never bogged down too deeply in any one element of this admitedly grandiose tale. Hard science fiction fans are catered to as well - the intricacies of Eisteinian time dilation is used as a unique plot mechanism. This shows that reality really does provide circumstances 'queerer than we can imagine' while impressing to this reader of Clarke's daring and grasp of fiction and non-fiction alike.
1594744769|5.0|This book called to me and insisted I buy it! I swear that little girl on the cover got into my head. It took me 2-3 days to read it, during which I took it with me on the bus, and continued reading it while walking up the sidewalk to my destinations. (I rarely read while walking, but this book had me in its clutches, and I was in quiet neighborhoods, not busy downtown areas).  The plot was great.  A boy seeking answers to his Grandfather's past and sudden death visits the ruins of the place where his Grandfather grew up, and suddenly becomes more involved with the past than he'd ever dreamed of.  The Peculiar Children in the photographs spring to life, and provide many answers.    The photos themselves are an integral part of the story, each picture introduced at the appropriate point, so there is never any doubt how the pictures fit into the overall plot.  The pictures themselves are as peculiar as their subjects, using old time photographic techniques to create the strangeness of the images, rather than relying on modern digital technology.      I have been waiting for another truly enchanting book since I finished reading the Harry Potter series, and finally found it here.  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a truly enchanting book that casts a spell on the reader that lasts long after the last page is read.  I am fervently hoping for sequels!

But 2 major things happened I just dont get -     1. How do you create/send a new email - there is no navigation that allows that!!!!  2. Once the initial email headers are download (using IMAP), there is no way I found to go back and modify any of the account settings.    For these reasons, I deleted the app.    Anyone knows better?
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Capitalism: A Love Story is a wake up call for the working class citizens of the United States. We've been brainwashed for decades to believe that capitalism is what makes our nation so great. Michael Moore unveils the truth about capitalism and how it keeps the majority of the American people at the mercy of the rich and the greedy. He also investigates alternatives to capitalism and shows how other countries have a different, apparently better system. Capitalism: A Love Story is filled with real-life examples of everyday American people who have been financially devastated by banks, big corporations and the government. Watch this movie. It's time to wake up!
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This is a thoughtful and well done movie and an atypical role for Clooney, who took a risk in doing it since he usually does more admirable or at least sympathetic characters. But Clooney plays a cold-blooded hit man who is not above killing close friends if he has to, so there's no doubt he's a bad guy here. With fine acting, a very minimal and understated script, a beautiful setting and cinematography, and an unusual story, one wonders why all the negative reviews. But the movie is more about the personal relationships Clooney develops with the townspeople rather then another James Bond or Bourne Identity spy thriller.<br /><br />Among these relationships the most interesting one is with the older priest, who befriends Clooney when he first arrives in town. The priest is no fool, and suspects Clooney isn't who he appears to be (Clooney claims he is a photographer), especially since after Clooney arrives, occasionally outsiders start turning up dead in an otherwise sleepy little Italian mountain town.<br /><br />But getting back to the the negative reviews problem, no doubt many people were expecting a more dramatic action flick due to the marketing hype, and were disappointed. The film received a general release from Focus Films which it wasn't suited for in this country, and should have just played in the art theaters. The film's slow but deliberate pacing didn't help, and a good deal of the dialog is in Italian. Overall the film just has a more European, artsy feel to it.<br /><br />So this is a different type of hit man movie, more an intimate character study rather than your typical action flick. In some ways it's very reminiscent of \\"Destiny of a Spy,\\" a now obscure movie from 1969 that starred Lorne Green as a Russian agent and killer. Like \\"The American,\\" it was more of an intimate and thoughtful portrayal of the main character rather than your usual shoot 'em up thriller.<br /><br />Overall, a fine movie but unfortunately not one really suited for general audiences in the U.S., which is why all the negative reviews here. So if you're a quality movie fan don't be put off by all the bad Amazon reviews and just see it and decide for yourself.is why all the negative reviews here. So if you're a quality movie fan don't be put off by all the bad Amazon reviews and just see it and decide for yourself.
0061730335|5.0|Having lived for two years in Africa, I found this book a good example of what it is like to live in a country so unlike our own.  Many people have the mistaken idea that African people are backward and ignorant, while we met many people who could speak 5 and 6 languages.  William's experiences points out the intellegence and ingenuity that one boy can have despite the hardships in his life.  My book club read this book and all enjoyed it immensely.
B002RSDW80|1.0|If only I could get back those moments of my life I spent watching this.  At least with a DVD you can fast forward, but I saw this with my mother in the theater, and there went $25 and two hours.<br /><br />Streep's tooting caricature of Child's voice was not the most annoying part of the movie, but it was close to it.  The Julie character was so unlikeable and narcissistic that I wanted to slap the movie screen.  No wonder Julia Childs disliked the author so much.  I loved Julia Childs and I'm with her; I hated this movie. The book is undoubtedly as shallow and stupid.<br /><br />Finally, to add insult to hellish boredom, was the completely random and gratuitous slam against Republicans.  Really, Hollywood, like we don't get it that you are liberal?<br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the jujubes, at $3 a box.
B003VANOFY|2.0|first off let me say that I am a big fan of logitech and have been for many years, and this is the first bad review I ever had to say about them.<br />I am using windows 7 64 bit, the headphones just lock up the sound all the time. what I mean is you can not get back your pc sound or even choose another sound option, you have to shut your system down. I  am not talking about the fact that if they go idle for 15 minutes they shut off, but that too, and the pc needs to be rebooted. there are many complaints on logitech and around the internet about them to crash the pc all together. all win 7 64 bit complaints. I have tried compatibility adjustments and no such luck.<br />And they hurt like hell, after an hour they are so uncomfortable. the surround sound is bull,  I have a usb surround sound dongle from another company that you can just plug any old head set in and the surround sound is great, but with these, even regular stereo separation is not acceptable, like the 5 hour battery life.<br />the only good thing I have to say about them, is they are loud and have great bass WHEN THEY WORK.<br />  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!! AND TOTAL TRASH, SHAME ON YOU LOGITECH.

0312330537|4.0|This book has hands down the best first chapter I have ever read. I was immediatley sucked in.     The story takes you through an amazing journey through the Indian slums to the Afghani desert. At times, the storyline gets a little long-winded, but generally speaking this is a wonderfully written book.    Especially for anyone who really likes the Indian culture, I would highly recommend this book. Happy Reading.

0762434279|5.0|Ignore the negative reviews; it's a top seller for a reason!  Some people just have issues, and are blocked by their own negativity.  In a nutshell this book explains the different attitudes (Mental traits - The outlook of the way a person views situations!) This is ultimately the deciding factor between rich and poor people.  I'm also an author of the book Woman Vs Womaniser \\"This is the Book Men Do Not want Women to Read'  [...] This is a self help book for women, but also shows my life journey which facilitates this.  Here you see a very clear comparison of how different attitudes shape the way a persons life turns out.  Rich dad poor Dad is not good it's brilliant!

However, they should have hired a professional to produce the recording, as it is one of the worst pieces of work I have seen. The volume of the music goes up and down in a superbly annoying way.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Be prepared to cry. Tears of sorrow for what she went through and tears of happiness for how she survived and overcame what happened to her all those years. Very hard to read the beginning. I had to put the book down several times and come back to it. Nothing was a surprise after seeing her interview on TV but while reading the book, it feels like 11 year old Jaycee is telling the accounts of what happened and while on TV I see a 31 year old Jaycee explaining the accounts. Big difference for me. Worth a read if you can get through the beginning.

I can't imagine the suffering she endured during the subequent years and why all the systems failed her.  There are so many people besides those who are behind bars who should be accountable for what this young woman endured.  Blessings to you and your daughters Jaycee.

After I bought this I purchased \\"Hands on Rigid Heddle Weaving.\\"  Between the two books, I got my loom warped and was off and weaving. If you have a table or floor loom, this book is a must buy.

B003D0ZNM4|5.0|Marvelous music of Arvo Part. It has shadings of midevil music while being modern. It almost reminds me of Philip Glass in it's structure. Lots of times a melody is built upon like Phillip Glass music but the music of Arvo Part is all his own. It has that mystic feeling of midevil music and an antique feeling as if it was composed in the 1300's.  Yet it has the starkness of modern times in it. Definately late night Holy music if there is any such item.                      's

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I use this gameboard to play World of Warcraft. The construction is ergonomic for my small hands. My wrist and fingers are comfortable using this gameboard hour after hour. The joystick makes it easier to walk. The buttons are all easy to reach and they indent so you know where your fingers are without looking at the screen. Programming macros and assigning keys to the buttons is easy to do. Multiple profiles are allowed for gamers who share their computers, use multiple cames or have multiple characters on a game. I couldn't play WoW without my gameboard!
B001QWBM62|4.0|I'm using this to capture audio for video production, so I'm using the XLR inputs primarily with the occasional 1/8\\" input for a reference audio channel. As you may expect, the attached microphones are pretty unusable for anything truly professional, although they can capture ref audio as well or even background noise for post. The preamp and phantom power capabilities are very nice. One thing I don't like is that when set to record through the XLR inputs, the device also records through the attached stereo mics. The pain is that monitoring audio during recording is that you have to manually turn down the built in mic volume because it produces so much hiss that you can't otherwise hear your clean XLR channels. It would be great if there was an option to quickly set which channel(s) you wish to monitor, without having to manually select the two others individually and lower the volumes. Then to adjust audio recording levels for the other input(s), you have to repeat the process. Perhaps a channel solo option would be the fix for the next version, and of course the option to not record with the stereo mics at all if you don't want to. That being said, I haven't read the manual, so someone correct me if I'm wrong.    Other than my one gripe, this device (with good mics and cables) does produce some great quality sound for something as inexpensive as it is. The build quality is solid and it seems like it will hold up well. The menu system is easy to use and logical, but seems a bit low-tech. There is a standard 1/4\\" thread on the back of the device for easy mounting on camera rigs or anything else.    All in all, I'm happy with the purchase for my needs.    -Rob
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are good, yes its fun to have the app. I would suggest better try the app first before ignoring it based on negative commands.

0553386794|5.0|I'll keep this short.  I read this after being drawn to it from the HBO series.  The series followed the this book, which makes up season 1, mostly to a tee.  However, there's great insight and enjoyment to see what details and subtle character and plot idiosyncracies that weren't covered in the series.  Therefore, I highly recommend this book to those who enjoyed the series but would like to develop a deeper understanding of Martin's tale.
0316098329|4.0|This book is impactful and written flawlessly. The narrator is clever, charming, innocent, brilliant and simple all at the same time. I admire the author's ability to capture nuances that kept me rushing home to continue reading where I left off. I was heavily invested in the characters and respect Donaghue for her bold plot choices. This book will make you contemplate priorities, really playing with your child and the importance of gifting our little ones with imagination, instead of slick-packaged media flashing from all directions. I now look forward to reading another of her books.

B0051CSI0G|3.0|\\"We die, or worse yet, we die and comeback.\\"  After the collapse of the US economy and a horrific vampire epidemic sweeps the country very few humans are left.  Along with vampire hunter Mister (Damici), Martin (Paolo) decides to drive to Canada for saftey.  This will probebly be a short review.  The only way to explain this really is that this is a serious version of \\"Zombieland\\", only with vampires and not zombies.  Both have a older and a younger man who travel together and kill bad guys.  They meet a girl on the way who joins them. Only thing this is missing is a cameo by a big name star.  Unlike \\"Zombieland\\" though this one went straight serious and horror, which isn't a bad thing really. Overall, not a bad movie, but I prefer the comedy one better.  I give it a C.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Probebly not, but it made me want to watch \\"Zombieland\\" again.<br /><br />*Also try - Shadowland & Zombieland

B000FA5TTW|5.0|I am not quite sure how to describe this amazing book, and I am confident that my words will not do it justice. To be quite honest, I typically enjoy light reads that do not evoke much thought, that are entertaining, and quick. This is one of my first dramatic reads in a few years (recently purchasing a Kindle, I'm going into overdrive, catching up on books that I should have read a long time ago). Anyway, this book is absolutely gut-wrenching, emotional, thought-provoking, touching, unpredictable (but realistic)...I literally could not put it down once I started it. It's also one of those books that makes you think long after you have finished it. And, even though it's not a religious-based book, you cannot help by think harder about your own spirituality and the concept of life after death. This is a must-read!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This cover is GREAT for what it is designed to PROTECT against ... SCRATCHES, not DROPS!!  This case is perfect for protecting the AT&T iPhone 4 against minor wear (i.e., scratches) from day-to-day usage.  It adds minimal (if any) bulk and weight to the phone.  My husband recently purchased AT&T iPhone 4s for both of us.  I thought this case would be perfect for me.  I used it for 2 weeks and loved it because it helped protect my phone from smudges, scratches and dirt.  However, one day, I was getting in the car (not paying close attention) and ALMOST dropped the phone on the ground.  I caught it THAT time, but it was then that I decided I needed some HEAVY DUTY protection for my phone, since I am VERY inclined to dropping things and because I also allow my kids to play games on the phone.  I ended up purchasing an OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black, Retail Packaging, Fits AT&T iPhone) here on Amazon for under $20.  Unlike this AmazonBasics Protective TPU Case, the OtterBox Defender Case adds both bulk and weight, but boy does it protect (which is what I REALLY needed).  So, again, if you are a person who generally does not drop your phone and is looking for protection from smudges, dirt and scratches only (without the bulk and weight), this is PERFECT!  In fact, the day I took this cover off my phone, my husband \\"borrowed\\" it to \\"try\\" on his phone.  One month later and he's still using it. :)

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I have never seen Star Trek look this amazing.  The picture just jumps off the screen with brightness and color.  Gone are the huge number of imperfections in the picture (scratches, tears, etc).  You can tell the studio put much work into the restoration process.  It's not perfect but it was a great job.  I do agree with others' reviews in regards to sound.  It does seem like the dialog is overpowered by sound effects.  I don't know if this was by design, but when I go through my tv speakers there are episodes where I can't hear the dialog even with the volume all the way up.  It sounds much better on my 6 speaker system.  They did however give the option for the original mono track.  I haven't listened to this so I don't know how it sounds.  There have been complaints about the price.  When I purchased the 2004 dvd season sets, I paid $100 per season.  This set is far superior and costs a lot less.  If you are a purist you can turn all of the new special effects off.  I however love the new effects.  This is the definitive Star Trek collection and I don't see how it could possibly improve.  Highly recommended!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Ever since The Lion King came out on DVD, they changed one of the songs and scenes to it. Its where Simba pounces on Zazu. Other than that, everything is still the same. One of the best Disney movies in the 90's and brings back a lot of childhood memories. A must have if you're a Disney fanatic/collector. Overall, VHS of The Lion King is still the best.
B0053VKP8S|2.0|Here is the deal Brighthouse (HD cable service) Samsung SMT-H3270 (converter) to Philips 52PFL570 Via HDMI then(SPDIF)out to Fiio then RCA to Yamaha HTR- 5130 (TV input). Lots of distortion tried unplugging of course and mapping the  connections again same results, I could only come up with one hiccup HDMI to TV maybe if i switch to analog (YBR)out to TV then switch the converter box to output to PCM it may work but I don't feel up to it and whats the purpose of HDMI connection. I will return this item and try the more expensive Geffen unit $90.00 bucks UGGHH!If anyone has any suggestions please comment.Peace Paul
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin! My second favorite all time Disney DVD! Absolutely love it. A MUST HAVE if you're a Disney collector/fanatic. It also includes the special features, which I have watched about 30 minutes of and it just makes the movie experience even better! It is exactly like the VHS as I remember it, so there is no complaints about that. Haha.

B005D9MUWY|3.0|I was excited to find this for free last week. I had purchased SwiftKey for my crusty old HTC Droid Eris a couple months before, and liked it a lot. It performed better than 8-pen, and even Swype, which used to be my favorite. I have a slow processor, and the screen tracking isn't consistent enough for Swype. Swiftkey fixed my mistakes and predicted my grammar quickly enough that it was a savings over the stock Froyo keyboard.  For some reason, the Swiftkey X is far slower than its predecessor. I tried to clear the database, tried different prediction options, fumbled with every setting I could find, but I still spend half my time waiting for Swiftkey X to catch up to my finger taps. For a better phone, which is almost all phones nowadays, the extra processor requirements of Swiftkey X are probably negligible. For my rooted, overclocked, outdated Eris, I'm back to using the stock keyboard. Even having to correct more of my own mistakes manually, it saves time over Swiftkey X.
B0057A6GA6|1.0|This game is full of ad spam. They'll show up everywhere; on the play screen, when you start the app, when you finish a level, and even in your notifications area. For me the notification ad was an instant dealbreaker. I will never accept that from any app.<br />As for the game itself, it's uninspired and very boring. There are hundreds of TD games out there, and this one just isn't good or original enough to stand out at all.<br />Also, even the weapons and enemies are uninspired. They're all just numbers. There are no special turrets (like slow, area effect, etc.) at all, and the enemies don't do anything but have varying amounts of HP. There's no variety at all, at least not in the first level. The game failed in too many ways for me to stick around to see level 2.<br />Overall, my advice is to find a better TD game. If only Kingdom Rush was available as a mobile app. THAT is a proper TD game!
0316056863|5.0|It made me laugh, laugh and laugh some more. Then I turned to page 2. Yes it's that funny.  It reads like a conversation with the funniest person you know but ten times funnier. I'm in awe of the quantity of humor between the covers.

0060775858|5.0|When I was a kid I used to love this book, and my mom would read it to me every night. Now being older, I don't read it (as often) but I still very much like this this book. I highly recommend that you read this book to your kids or babies as it is a soothing bedtime classic.  Oh- and by the way, your kids will probably get a laugh out of \\"Goodnight Nobody\\",  just like many people who have read this book!
B003VB5D84|5.0|BUY THIS DVD . The combination of songs & Musicians is unbeatable. The people that play togeather on this CD is amazing. They learned, because My earlier Crossroads DVD was mostly one artist doing their music. This one is Multiple big names having a jam session that looks like open mike night. The Best. Sound Quality is great & so is the camera work.
B0050PLT8W|1.0|Bland, a poor effort. I expected at least (1) good song, but there is none. Honestly, pass on this album.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video arrived quickly.  My friend did two days of the video so far.  And man with just a 20 minute video, Jillian kicks your butt on the first day.  It's quick and easy to follow...doesn't mean that it's easy to do though! Still an amazing workout with us dripping in sweat and huffing and puffing along during the video.  Definitely will keep up with this.  Thanks, Jillian.
B000T5O48U|4.0|This movie terrified me when I was little, well younger. And to this day, because of the atmosphere, and certain really creepy scenes, it still creeps me out. As you can see from my rating, I did like it. The acting is decent and the make-up for the rabid dog was impressive, for it's time. Stephen King's movies are a genre all their own, but the re-make fad needs to leave his stories alone, IT did NOT need a remake, nor did the Stand or even Pet Semetary, but guess what? they're getting it anyway! As you know from my reviews, I'm fairly liberal with re-makes, most of the time, but their ARE exceptions. This film is one of my favorites because the atmosphere builds slowly, and when the end credits roll, even now, for me, you're left almost breathless. I want to read the book now, surprised?
B004MKM8L8|5.0|If you are a Harry Potter fan or have fans in your family, this DVD is a must.  It gets watched over and over.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I randomly watched this movie a month ago. I was not expecting to become so immersed in the movie that I wanted to learn more about the story. And that is exactly what happened...That is exactly what happened to many other people which I just found out. Why? I have no idea. But I will say this...    Let Me In is the example of why you should not judge a movie by its cover. Find yourself lost in the characters of Abby and Owen as their relationship progresses and intensifies. Owen struggles to connect with anybody including his parents who unknowingly neglect him. He is lonely and bullied harshly at school. Watching Kodi play this role is just so emotional. Just look at his face during the bathroom scene. How can you not feel for that kid?    Chloe plays Abby, the 12 year old vampire. She and Owen connect and understand one another through not just their age similarities but what they've been through. It's a beautiful thing, yet it's also uncomfortable knowing that Abby is more than she seems... in a bad way. The only happy thing these characters have are each other. It's deeper than romance. It's finding someone who gets you, regardless of who or what they are and what they've done or been through.    This movie will haunt you for days after watching. Maybe not everyone, but the few who are will end up reading the book and watching the original film. It's a fantastic movie. Something we needed for a long time. WATCH IT! PAY ATTENTION!
B0057UVLQ0|5.0|Ok, I love SELENA! I love her albums, ESPECIALLY When the sun goes down, And the PERSON, who said its ''diabolical'' is being rude.I mean If don't like that kind of music,don't listen to it.And,as far as the D word go's,Shes 19 now,an Adult,and there are Plenty of other songs by other artist that have way worse in them. Everybody has different taste in music.Selena is a AMAZING, Artist. I am one of her biggest fans! And you will not waste any money on this. This is a amazing album,
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I watched \\"Let Me In\\" and was absolutely haunted by the film. I can't explain why I felt the way I did, but perhaps something in my subconscious is able to relate with it very well. On the other hand, it's also because it was a very well made movie and the characters are what made the film.<br /><br />So naturally I went on Netflix and watched \\"Let The Right One In.\\" First thing I noticed was the lighting and cinematography. It was brighter and more vibrant. The character Oskar, is played a bit more differently. He's still the tormented and lonely kid, but in here he seems more disturbed than Owen from the American remake. Eli is played differently as well. She seems more like a child here than Abby did. To say the remake is the same as the original would not be accurate.<br /><br />I found myself watching this version more. I loved the character Eli. I loved how Lina plays her and her little facial expressions here and there gave her a sort of complex and mysterious feel. The music is amazing and emotional. And the Swedish language sounds so cool to me. To see a relationship between two lonely, tormented, and somewhat disturbed characters grow throughout the progression of the movie was very entertaining. Great writing, direction, and acting. I, of course, ended up buying this  movie on bluray from Amazon.<br /><br />This is the human/vampire relationship story that is on the other side of what we are used to seeing. If Twilight is one side of a coin, then this movie is the other side. Not everyone will connect so well with the movie, but give it a watch and it may haunt you for a long time....trust me.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Such a good debut album!  you can really tell who he is and his passion for what he does.  and he does it sooooo well!
0060925000|4.0|Many reviewers here evidently know much more about India than I do. I did not in fact approach this book as about India but about people who happen to live in India. Indeed, the manner in which a match was to be found for the girl (i.e., a suitable boy) reminded me of stories I heard about matchmakers in Jewish tradition and I guess some of it might remind one of Jane Austen. Anyway, I found that I simply could not put this long book down - it devoured several days of my life but very pleasantly (at least until the end, which like many others, I disliked - actually, I hated it, which is why I took a star away). I only wish I could find more books like it with characters I found believable and, in many cases, congenial. A good read.
B002ZG9800|2.0|When I read the title of this movie, I thought it was a movie about a cigarette company, along the lines of 'Thank you for smoking'.  Reading the description on the outside did not tell me much about the contents of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is about a love story, between two men.  Also it is about the escapes of a con man from a prison so many times, and the life in prison.  In most other movies about prisons, the gay people or new guys to the prison are beaten or raped, but this movie is different and seems like they are accommodated nicely.<br /><br />I liked the story line, and the various adventures that they go through.  But the gay love scenes were a turn-off for me. It is not the type of movie you would want to watch with your girlfriend, unless of course you are a girl.  :)
B00436GNVC|1.0|I wanted to like this CD as I really love her previous effort, Rockferry.  Where that CD is steeped in 60s soul and showcases the influences of Cilla Black, Dusty Springfield; this one is a bland 80s rip-off of uptempo tunes that do nothing to showcase that amazing voice we all fell in love with the first time out.  In fact, her vocal prowess seems to have suffered tremendously on this CD.  Her wobbly vibrato is annoying and ruins the songs.  I could not even listen to the whole CD through without stopping for a break; her voice is that painful. At one point, she strains to reach high notes and her voice cracks.<br /><br />Where are all of the polished arrangements that made \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Warwick Avenue\\" such rare gems?! Apparently, the album suffers from too little outside influence to reign in the Duffy's indulgences.  While I admire her drive to push her music in new directions, I think the next CD would fair better if she reteamed with her Rockferry production team.<br /><br />I guess I will be waiting for her third CD to see if these challenges sort themselves out.  And, from the reviews I've been reading, it looks like I will be in good company.
0307266303|5.0|What a game changer.  I completely fell off the face of the fitness earth after college due to being burnt out on atheletics, being to busy, or just plain laziness. Attempts at lifting just didn't leave me fulfilled, what is the fun of walking from machine to machine?  Reading this book reminded me of all the times I'd broken away from the pack, picked my eyes up from my feet, looked at my surroundings, felt my body working, and let myself enjoy running.  No other seminar, coach, or enthusiastic friend could instill this in me.  Chris MicDougall kicked my mental ass into gear by giving running a context that I'd never been able to verbalize or conceptualize, but that I must have inately had a feeling for all along.    Read this book and rediscover why you should run the long loop and take the path less traveled.
B0019NG73G|4.0|First of,  I bought my Gettysburg blu-ray from amazon germany,used as new,for just over £11,much cheaper than elsewhere,HOWEVER,it was the normal,rather than digibook,packaging which,although \\"nice\\",isn,t in the same league as the,far more expensive,digibook.The digibook is very classy,IMO.  Now,to the film itself,I aint gonna write a review of the actual film,the \\"name\\" speaks for itself,you Guys from America have forgotten more than I know about Gettysburg, the American Civil War too,so I aint gonna \\"insult\\" you by even having the slightest discussion about this subject,what I will say is,Gettysburg/American Civil War is a fascinating subject for me,and that,s how I found this film,FASCINATING!!!!  The blu-ray transfer is very,VERY good,imo,far better than the dvd,many scenes are beautiful to look at,there are the odd grainy scenes,but the blu-ray knocks the dvd to smithereens for picture quality!!!! I thought the audio could have been better,but that,s maybe a wee bit nitpicking on my part.  I think the film hinges on two roles,Longstreet and Chamberlain,and both are played excellently by Tom Berenger and,especially,Jeff Daniels.The bayonet charge down Little Roundtop by Chamberlain is quite inspirational,especially for an \\"outsider\\" like me,and I think Berenger caught Longstreet,s \\"dillemma\\" perfectly,\\"how can you disagree with Robert E. Lee\\"??????? and History proves Longstreet was correct,and Lee wrong,maybe Lee,s only mistake,but what a time to make that \\"mistake\\"!!!!IMO.  Gettysburg blu-ray is a MUST-BUY for anybody interested in the American Civil War,and it stands on it,s own as a very good \\"war movie\\" too.  A wee final observation about the packaging,America and Great Britain are \\"lucky\\",we dont have the age certificate placed on the front covers as Germany does,in my opinion this totally spoils many a beautiful cover,Gettysburg included,and it,s completely unnecessary!!!! put the age certificate on the BACK cover,the Gettysburg Blu-ray Digibook is a beautiful cover,perfect for any collection.  Davy Cairns,Scotland.  ps,  Can you imagine what Steven Spielberg/Ridley Scott could have done with Gettysburg,especially the battle scenes??????? NO DISRESPECT intended to anyone involved in the making of Gettysburg.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|I wasn't anticipating much when I rented Unknown since the majority of the movies I've rented recently have been duds.  I was surprised to find a thriller in the spirit of \\"The Fugitive.\\"  it would be hard too not to draw comparisons between Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford especially in this film.  The plot was refreshingly easy to follow and the directing team relied heavily on the thrill of the chase to create tension and to hook viewers.  I highly recommend this film amongst current offerings!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love it! My best game! (tied with angry birds...) its worth every penny! So get it and enjoy the game!
1594133379|5.0|This book is a very powerful account of how it feels to have a stroke from the point of view of a person who does extensive research on strokes.  It is also a testimonial to the restorative powers of the human body when a person is highly motivated to recover.  Not only that, the author takes her recovery one step further and becomes a better person than before!  I highly recommend this book.
0061980269|3.0|I had to read this for school during the summer. It was a good book yet very confusing at times. I would recommend this book only to strong readers.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|This concert is unbelieveably great! The band is awesome. The video and audio quality is awesome. I've seen many a live performance and this is truly among the best I've ever seen. Don't miss this one!!!
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I first heard this in a dance class (ballet) - and it was so different from other ballet music I have ever heard. But I love the work of these two cellists!  So naturally  I had to ask my teacher about the music, and ended up here.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I recently ordered the Joovy Caboose Sit and Stand Tandem Stroller and knew it didn't come with a parent organizer. Instead of upgrading to the newer version, for over a 100$ more, I decided to look for an inexpensive organizer to attach to it. I found it in the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy. It has tons of space, cup holders, and a place to securely hold my car keys and cell phone. It attached very easily to the stroller too. I am very pleased with this purchase!
B0058VW36U|5.0|ZeptoLab have taken a simple concept and creatively expanded upon it to produce a varied and addictive game that drips with charm. Simply awesome.
B001AQO446|5.0|The video quality is one of the best I have seen. With this movie, I would take whatever I can get.
1605981834|5.0|My mother bought a hardback copy of this book when it first came out in the late 1950s, and when I was in high school and looking for things to read, I found her copy in the attic and read it. I could not put it down: it was very suspenseful, very well-plotted, and I had No Idea! When I finished the book I was very impressed. About fifteen years later I decided for some reason or other that I wanted to read \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" again, just to see if it was as good as I remembered it. Despite the fact that I now knew everything about the characters and plot, and had by this time seen the 1950s film based on the book (good flick, by the way), I still enjoyed the novel and was impressed with what Levin had accomplished.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|This back pack bag is well made and a big step up from the little camera bag I have. I had to remove the inserts and put them back in reversed so my D-40 is at the bottom of the bag, not at the top where it would have been top heavy. The D-40 does not fit in the bag flat because of the battery grip and I'm not going to remove it to put the camera in the bag. There is was plenty of room for the 55-200 mm lens, my 3 piece macro lens set, a tulip hard hood, a soft 55mm lens hood, the Nikon remote, two spare batteries. There is room for a couple more lenses or another long lens and a flash but I'd hate to put a second DSLR in there.<br /><br />The straps are unnecessarily padded and bulky and I've removed the horizontal strap that connects the two arm straps. If the bag had been square at the top, there'd be more room available.<br /><br />I guess I should have gotten a hard case, but this bag will meet my needs for now.
B002GJT4Y6|4.0|We love Harry Potter in our house, so we were very excited to get the Ultimate Edition. I couldn't wait to download the digital copy onto our laptop, so we would have HP with us whenever we wanted. BUT, the digital copy code for movie #2 had expired! So, if you're buying this edition, in part due to the digital copy, know that you're out of luck.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|In typical Miyazaki fashion, he creates a world of beauty and complexity and immerses the viewer in it with colorful characters, a great plot and the eventual resolving of all conflicts. I don't like all that Miyazaki has done but my all time favorite in Spirited Away. Ponyo comes in second. I saw this in the theater and had to add it to my amine collection.
B00540G3G6|1.0|I guess from a value proposition, this pack seems worth getting regardless if you own a 3DTV or not.  Amazon still has the original Blu-Ray 2-Disc pack listed at $24, so paying 7 extra to include a 3D version is alright I guess.  Especially in my case, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've NEVER watched this movie and it's only just recently that I've finally jumped on the HD bandwagon, so this movie's Blu-Ray re-release is pretty good timing.<br /><br />Review Update:<br />Please bear in mind that I made the review back when the combo pack was CONSIDERABLY cheaper than what it's going for now. Now, it is most definitely not worth getting.
B00095NX9G|4.0|I received this from Rachel at a show she was teaching at. I had it on my wishlist for a year or more. Upon reviewing it, it was a culmination of what she had just covered in class, which was great as there was too much to take notes on. It also is a great combination of yoga moves for flexibility and then dance moves that she drills well. It is a workout so be prepared to do some work if you are committed. She also provides tips on how to get through the extensive material in the 2 DVD set. The tips are great.
0345522478|3.0|I love urban fantasy, but UF with a male lead is few and far between. Because of this reality, Hounded immediately piqued my interest, and the amazing premise kicked my interest up a few more notches. Unfortunately, a male protagonist and a great mythology does not equal a great book. A good chunk of the book is simply warnings for the hero, countless scenes with no purpose but to tell how awesome and old Atticus is, and battles where he barely received a scratch. Yes, this is book one in the series, which has to set up the rest of the books, but so many of my favorite UF got to business without needing to explain the who, the what, the why, and the how, much less overload the book with an annoying dose of snark (it seems too many UF authors rely upon snarkiness for \\"humor\\"). But my main gripe is that I didn't buy Atticus for who he said he was: an incredibly old, cunning, and dangerous Druid. The effort to make him blend in with society and come across as likable ended up backfiring for me, as I could only ever picture him as a lame 21 year old guy. Perhaps the subsequent books amend this issue, but I don't know if I'm interested enough to try them out. Hounded will probably work for those eager to read UF with a male protagonist, and definitely for those who do not read urban fantasy on a regular basis.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I purchased Season 1 of Breaking Bad from iTunes because they had it on sale and I wanted something to watch while I worked out on the elliptical at the gym. I knew the show had received excellent reviews from TV critics so I figured I would give it a try even though it isn't normally the kind of show I'd watch. By the 3rd episode I was hooked. The acting in Breaking Bad is the best. Bryan Cranston, in the role of Walter White, is phenomenal. It is easy to understand why he has won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.     This show has fairly graphic violence, dark humor as well as uplifting and funny moments; the writing and direction is sublime. You will be on the edge of your seat at times, you'll cringe, laugh and be surprised.
0553801473|3.0|I won't go into too much detail here because so many wonderful fans and reviewers have already said some very insightful and well written things that I happen to agree with. That said, as a consumer, a fan, and a human being, I have to put in my two cents:<br /><br />The Journey is the oldest and greatest of stories and story-lines. We all get that. The Hero must overcome his adversaries, blah blah. (This is coming from an English Lit. Major)<br /><br />Bad things happen to good people, and the reverse.<br /><br />Life doesn't always go as planned.<br /><br />There are a lot of ancillary characters in everyone's life who don't matter for squat.<br /><br />Many times people do things in obvious contradiction to previous acts.<br /><br />Always finish what you started.<br /><br />And, to paraphrase Tolkien: Never leave a dragon out of your thoughts, especially if you birthed them and stuck them in a basement.<br /><br />But when it comes to literature, and great stories like ASOIAF, you gotta give the reader a break. Yes, you sacrifice a Ned and Robb Stark; and a Tywin Lannister. That's good hard story telling. But with some of the characters.. please. 99% of the time someone wants to cross the street, they make it across the street. 99% of the time in ASOIAF, they wind up dead, enslaved, crippled, and most likely thousands of miles from where they started. On top of that, 60% of the time, they die after hundreds of pages of traveling and self-doubt. To no end.<br /><br />I appreciate the scope that GRRM has created, and I have reveled in it. But I am at an end. Let's put it this way: I think readers would have cheered if Danaerys had hopped back on the dragon, gone to Mereen and said to Selmy, \\"I'm done. Back to Westeros. Get a ship, I'm flying.\\"
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" is an important piece of information.  It shows DSK being a rational anti-banker (a minority report or just a frontrunner?).  It shows R. Glenn Hubbard standing up for the establishment that created the mess.  It shows the rest as they are; miserable human beings who continue to rip off the system.  Really...an important look at what happens when all the regulations get thrown into the trash bin..in the name of \\"Gordon Geeko - Greed\\".
0066620996|4.0|This is a book that will probably give readers a taste of what it's like to run a successful business, or at least what it's like to watch a successful business run. In this vein, it provides a handful of good concepts that will give entrepreneurs and executives pause before they sign on to the latest cliches of management. The concept of the fly-wheel (keep churning and it will get easier and more successful with each turn), the three aspects of a successful business idea, and the concept that good workers make the most significant difference in a company's success were the most valuable take-aways.<br /><br />I do have my criticisms. First, the methodology--the study was conducted very scientifically, but only on a portion of the companies. They used performance to identify their cases, then went backward to see what went right. Then they studied similar companies that didn't have the same success and went backward to see what went wrong. They did not investigate companies that did what the successful companies did and still failed, or companies that did not do what the case companies did and succeeded. Doing this would have made it a more comprehensive study.<br /><br />Second, the depth--the strength of this book is making powerful concepts accessible and memorable. \\"Get the right people on the bus,\\" \\"Hedgehog concept,\\" \\"Wash your cottage cheese,\\" etc. are all useful images that evoke what could be powerful management tools. The problem is that the author repeats these concepts ad nauseam and at the expense of real depth in the logic. As a result, the reader will remember the concepts, but might not be able to apply them in unique circumstances.<br /><br />It could be that I am looking for something that this book is not meant to provide, in which case I would love if someone could provide leads on books that cover the theory behind these concepts: Why is \\"Who, then What\\" successful? Why does modesty in leadership work over cockiness? How does bureaucracy form, how can it be diminished, and how does it affect workers and productivity?<br /><br />Third, the logic--It is possible that much of the logic is out there somewhere, and the lack of depth makes the arguments seem incongruent, but I could not agree with some of the book's central themes. For instance, \\"Who, then What\\" simply doesn't make sense. For instance, how do you get good people \\"on the bus\\" if they don't know or don't like where the bus is going?<br /><br />Fourth, the nits--I \\"read\\" the audio book version of this and was put off by the narrator's (the author's) style. He ended up putting exaggerated stress on pretty much everything he said, which means that nothing was highlighted and often most of the point was made ridiculous. It was like he was hammering a keyboard in order to make it register more than it would by just clicking the keys naturally.<br /><br />With that being said, the book is great inspiration for people who want to create greatness and use their business to do so. And anyone who has any recommendations for more theoretical-based surveys in this field, please comment this review--thanks!, and how does it affect workers and productivity?

First published with new foreword and new first chapter, 1990.    Contents    Foreword    Part 1: Earth and the Overlords  Part 2: The Golden Age  Part 3: The Last Generation    ================================================='    I have to say that I am a little baffled by the many claims made for Childhood's End to be Clarke's \\"best novel\\". To me it seems a little dwarfed in comparison with \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" and especially with \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". Then again, these novels were first published 15 and 20 years later, respectively, and books are to be read and appreciated, in the context of their time certainly, but not really in relation to one another (though within the author's oeuvre this approach might on occasion be enlightening).    Even without the dubious benefit of comparisons, \\"Childhood's End\\" has at least one notable drawback. Basically, though it is not very easy to put it into words, this is the perfunctory treatment of some episodes. This is most notable in the first part of the book which is by far the weakest one - fortunately, it is the shortest one as well. The coming of the Overlords is a bit too sudden, and rather lamely described in the \\"new\\" first chapter (written some quarter of a century after the rest of the novel), and mankind's only too eager submission is hardly credible. Certain episodes in this first part are distinctly superficial, even puerile, and if the rest of the book had turned out to be similarly sketchy and insubstantial, the final rating would have been quite a bit lower. Fortunately, in the last two parts Arthur finally finishes the warming up and reminds me that he is a great story-teller and a brilliant writer. Occasionally, however, these parts may also suffer from the same rough-and-ready treatment, or there may be some slightly childish passages.    Nevertheless, this is a great book. For one thing, it has a really terrific story. I certainly disagree with the oft-repeated accusation claim that Clarke's novels are loosely structured and fragmentary. This is true neither in general nor in this particular case. As a matter of fact, Clarke is extremely skillful novelist who knows how to pace a story, when to introduce more dramatic and when more contemplative episodes, and how to create an enormous suspense and prepare stupendous dramatic climax. Even the title here has certain dramatic value. Somewhere in the middle of the book one may be led to think that it is a metaphor for the mankind's transition from their self-destructive history to the ultimate Utopia created with the indispensable help, and control, of the Overlords. This is surely not the case though. Clarke's endless imagination and incisive pen have quite a surprise in store. Nothing more should be said on the subject here, for otherwise the pleasure of those who have yet to read the book will be considerably spoiled.    I should like to mention two other well-known accusations which are demolished in this novel. One of these refers to Clarke in general and the other to this book in particular: his poor characterisation and the use of paranormal forces, respectively. To start with the latter, I don't see any particular problem with it. One of Clarke's most famous aphorisms is that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This is certainly true and so is the opposite case. Besides, it must be stressed, that the paranormal stuff in the novel, though very important for the plot, is by no means of major importance for its philosophical significance. As for the characters, well, the accusation is somewhat legitimate in this case. Certainly character development is not Clarke's forte and he is always more interested in the ideas behind the people. But this is such by design and should be expected in a genre such as science fiction. That said, for my part I have always found Clarke's characters compelling, perhaps because they are so sparsely drawn and leave a great deal to the imagination of the reader. What they lack in complexity though, they more than compensate for in vividness. What's more, none of the characters here - Stormgren, Karellen, Jan, George, Jean, Sullivan - is entirely one-sided and Clarke's powerful ability to describe them, and their inner words, with a sentence or two should not be underestimated. In fact, controversial as this may sound, I think Clarke's characters contribute only slightly less than his ideas to the enduring value of his books.    In addition to pretty great story, with quite a few twists and simply staggering finale, the greatness of \\"Childhood's End\\" rests on its immense philosophical depth - yet another area, like his characters, for which Clarke is seldom given the credit he deserves. There are so many threads intertwined here that it is difficult to single out the most important ones - which are difficult enough to put into words anyway. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the book is that it stimulates - in me at least - a great, though by no means unqualified, admiration for the human race. On the other hand, it is horrifying to contemplate the curious desire for self-destruction inherent in our nature and it is sad, to say the least, to realise that \\"stars are not for man\\". These are Karellen's words and though Clarke would have disagreed any time, more than half a century later they still hold true.    Only slightly less disconcerting is another main premise of the book, namely that the human race is perhaps incapable of living in Utopia, let alone creating such a world without massive help from the outer space. This is never made explicit in the novel, as the mind-blowing finale comes too swiftly for that, but I think Clarke gives more than a few hints that human nature and utopia are incompatible. One of my favourite examples is Rupert's party where, with but few sentences, Clarke conveys spiritual emptiness more powerfully than anything Fitzgerald might offer you in \\"The Great Gatsby\\". It is perhaps significant, too, that the Colony, which desperately tries to break with the hedonistic lifestyle enjoyed by the rest of the planet, should display such pathetic achievements in pretty much all arts, from music to sculpture. The only art which the Colony may be said to have enriched is - cartoon movies.    Yet, on the other hand, it may well be that Utopia is not really worth achieving and the essence of human life lies in the struggle: everything is more valuable when it is hard to get and short-lived. Trite but true. Moreover, too much satisfaction and too much hedonism would probably put an end to the two most important creations of mankind: science and art. Something in our psychological make-up, I believe, prevents us from attaining the ultimate happiness, but it might be this very \\"defect\\" that makes life worth living. Considering the economy of his writing style, Arthur Clarke shows a considerable insight into human nature. This is what I call originality; not florid vocabulary or stylistic acrobatics, nor prose as dense and impenetrable as solid rock, but quite to the contrary: using ordinary words to say extraordinary things. Just one among many examples is Clarke's perceptive evaluation of idleness, strangely closely mirroring Somerset Maugham's notion that few of us are so constituted as to be able to indulge in constant idleness. The difficult thing is to find the most suitable work for everybody and fit this into the most practical global picture:    \\"...but the number of people sufficiently strong-willed to indulge in a life of complete idleness is much smaller than is generally supposed. Supporting such parasites was considerably less of a burden than providing for the armies of ticket collectors, shop assistants, bank clerks, stock-brokers, and so forth, whose main function, when one took the global point of view, was to transfer items from one ledger to another.\\"    Last but not least, the extreme altruism and benignity of the Overlords, though difficult to believe, is not without some inspiring value. Al Capone may well have been right that you can achieve more with a kind word and a gun than only with a kind word, but if one is able to substitute the weapon with a smile and a good deal of intelligence, one may exceed even the boldest dreams of the legendary underworld boss. The conversation between Karellen and Stormgren about the use of power is one of the most memorable in the book. The essence is indeed \\"correct application\\" - and the operative word here is \\"correct\\". People in general have always been attracted to the maxim \\"Might is Right\\". Well, the lesson to learn from the Overlords is that cunning is often way mightier than might. As luck would have it, we might even ascend few steps on the stairway of goodness in the process. Meanwhile Karellen's words are as chilling as they are true for our race:    \\"You have never possessed real power, or the knowledge necessary to apply it.\\"    Just one interesting example in the novel about a subtle application of power on psychological level is Karellen's reaction to a state that had broken the rules. He simply did nothing. The poor fellows thus experienced terrors no punishment with force would have achieved. And the results were far more efficient, too.    Quite apart from all that, Clarke touches briefly, but hardly superficially, on problems only slightly less thorny today than they must have been in the 1950s, or ever indeed. For example, the clash between religion and science, including the uselessness of the former and the dangers of limiting the latter, is mentioned several times and not quite in passing. Some people, I daresay, would find Clarke's remarks trite and superficial. For my part I find them humorous and stirring:    \\"You will find men like him in all the world's religions. They know that we represent reason and science, and, however confident they may be in their beliefs, they fear that we will overthrow their gods. Not necessarily through any deliberate act, but in a subtler fashion. Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now.\\"    The value of art, too, is also discussed at few places, and a good case is made that it is incompatible with utopia. The essence of artistic creation may mostly lie in the struggles of the artist with the society around him. Thus the eternal satisfaction of Utopia may well bring art to a halt; or worse indeed: cause its slow but sure degeneration. Is the latter not happening already, far as we are from any utopia? On the other hand, this may well be too simplistic and, if not talent, at least artistic genius might be largely independent from such mundane considerations. After all, most truly great and universally recognised artists - say, figures of the caliber of Michelangelo or Beethoven - didn't bother too much with the rules of the world. Quite to the contrary: they made their own rules and then adapted the world to them. Readers of \\"Childhood's End\\" are well-advised to read carefully in order not to miss Clarke's pithy observations on the subject in the maelstrom of the action.    And sometimes Clarke shows his uncanny trademark ability to predict the future. If anything, the following words are far more relevant today than they were in the early 1950s:    \\"Do you realize that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that's available at the turn of a switch! No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges - absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day? Soon people won't be living their own lives any more. It will be a full-time job keeping up with the various family serials on TV!\\"    Frightfully modern! Substitute \\"Internet\\" for \\"radio and TV\\" and multiply the amount of entertainment by one hundred (at least) and you will get the picture exactly as it is today.    Considering that Arthur Clarke was 36 at the time of writing, \\"Childhood's End\\" is an impressive achievement in every aspect: story, ideas, characters and, above all, food for thought. The confused foreword and the incoherent first chapter written much later you may skip without fear of missing anything important. The whole of the first part is a bit dull and certain passages from the other two parts may sound superficial or preachy, but these quibbles, though worth mentioning, are not worth elaborating upon. The story is breath-taking, very well-told, awe-inspiring and decidedly optimistic - despite the devastating and haunting end. Descriptions and metaphors, certain wholes scenes even, may somewhat lack the confidence of the mature Clarke, but his staggering imagination and his well-nigh unmatched ability to vividly recreate the most amazing visions imaginable are here all right. As with all great books, reading \\"Childhood's\\" End is a shattering yet comforting experience. It will bear a re-reading for sure.    P. S. A note on the musical references in Childhood's End. Apart from mentioning briefly, but poignantly, Bach towards the end, there is a vastly amusing, if brief, account of a symphonic concert in the Colony. It is rather hilarious to see Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms described as \\"the only concession to popular taste\\", as the rest of program was \\"aggressively modernistic\\". I shudder to think what a hideous noise that must be!
B003K16P3M|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time! It's very well written, and I love the whole Graces idea. I've read some reviews that say that Katsa'a choice not to marry makes her weak, or stupid,or shallow, or that the author is sending out horrible messages to teen girls. Well guess what? I'M a teen girl, and I don't have the sudden urge to never marry! Not one of the reviewers who wrote about the whole marriage thing thought that maybe marriage in the time that Katsa was a teen was different than now. Back as early as the last century women were practically bound for life to their husbands. You could not own land,or be independent,or even divorce if your husband abused you! I'm just saying that this book is great, and a decision of the character to remain single should not mar your experience of this book.
B000002H6C|5.0|Few days ago I have made a simple experiment. I have listened to Metallica's albums from 1991 and 1988 one after another. After hearing the Black Album, all twelve tracks and more than 60 minutes of it, I thought \\"Man, that's a terrific album!\\". After hearing \\"...And Justice For All\\" I was much too stunned to think of anything else but \\"God, that's Metallica!\\"    When you come to think of it, it was actually inevitable that Metallica should start falling down after this album. What else can you do once you reach the top? But it's been quite a ride! After the amazing \\"jump\\" from the promising, but trashy (in every sense of the word), \\"Kill'em All\\" (1983) to the majestic \\"Ride the Lightning\\" (1984), the tendency of growing complexity continued with \\"Master of Puppets\\" (1986) and finally culminated in \\"...And Justice For All\\" (1988). We all know what happened later.    Whether \\"...And Justice For All\\" is Metallica's finest album is of course a matter of taste. What is indisputable is that this is certainly their most musically accomplished and perfectly recorded album. Take Lars for instance: never before or since had he explored so many rhythms and so many complex transitions as he did here - not to mention his speaker-blowing work with the double bass drum, also without analogue in any other of the band's albums. James and Kirk are both in top form and I am simply baffled at the complaints about the bass I often hear. Cliff was a force of nature, no argument here, but Jason is no slouch either. And the album is simply splendidly recorded, as one might expect from fanatical perfectionists like Metallica. The sound is massive and grand, perfectly suitable for the music and with excellent \\"windows\\" between the instruments (and yes, the bass is quite prominent indeed). My only quibble is that the cymbals might occasionally have been a little more prominent.    As for the songs themselves, even the weakest among them (\\"Eye of the Beholder\\", \\"The Shortest Straw\\") are candidate-masterpieces. Words are hardly able to describe the epic grandeur of compositions like \\"One\\" and \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\", or the nine-odd minutes of the instrumental \\"To Live is To Die\\" and the eponymous song. Even the songs most reminding one of trash (\\"Blackened\\", \\"Dyers Eve\\") completely transcend the monotonous nature of the genre. In addition to musical complexity and technical precision - things that are not so hard to find nowadays, even among pretty heavy bands - what sets Metallica apart from most bands, past and present, is their melodic flair and their perfect sense for structure. Indeed, analogies with classical music are due. Magnificent composition like \\"To Live is to Dye\\" might have been composed by Richard Strauss himself; even though the orchestration could have been a little different than two guitars, drums and bass, the structure and the music would have made an excellent showpiece for large symphony orchestra. Like the album on the whole, \\"To Live is to Die\\" is the culmination of a string of magnificent instrumentals that started with \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" and continued with \\"Orion\\" (from \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\", respectively).     Another thing that makes Metallica in general and this tremendous album in particular nearly unique is that they always sound like a band. This is a rare phenomenon indeed. There have been many great bands - such as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, to name but two - who always have sounded like a bunch of brilliant musicians, rather than like bands. Metallica always has been comprised of great instrumentalists too, but they always had a kind of coherence and cooperation, both in composition and in performance, that usually escape other bands. I can think of only two other bands - Queen and Led Zeppelin - where so much individual genius has been put into the service of music.    Last but not least, and another not-so-often-encountered thing, is that the greatness of the music is well matched bythat of the lyrics. Apart from the juvenile aggression of \\"Kill'em All\\", Metallica have always been keen on writing texts with a great deal of substance in them. Yet again \\"...And Justice...\\" is a kind of summit in this respect as well. Never before or since had Metallica written more uncompromising and powerful lyrics dealing with the eternal corruption of justice, the unimaginable horrors of war, the devastating pollution of the planet, the sanity/insanity of the individual, the clash of generations within the family, the monstrous perversity of society, and anything else under the sun one may think of. It must be added, though, that in terms of lyrics Metallica had, if not surpassed, at least occasionally equaled these achievements before (e.g. \\"Sanitarium\\").    In short, stupendous album from every point of view: musicianship, virtuosity, lyrics, sound. Separate songs from \\"Master of Puppets (1986) and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" (1984) may be as good as the best ones here, but on the whole \\"...And Justice For All\\" remains, for me, by far Metallica's most ambitious yet most consistent masterpiece.
B004WJREMW|2.0|This is easily the worst McCartney solo album that I've heard. I've only heard 6 whole albums so that isn't exactly a darning statement. This album is bad though. There are some saving graces such as COMING UP, which is good but barely qualifies as a classic. When you put it next to any of his more well-known hits, it stands towards the bottom of the list. Conspicuously missing is the excellent GOODNIGHT TONIGHT which was part of the 1990 cd release but is nowhere to be found on this remaster. What a ripoff!!   I got the remaster that comes with one bonus disc btw. I bought this thinking that it would be special with the new remastering package but of all the songs on the original album, only about 6 are listenable. It sounds better than a typical 1980 recording, but these new remasters are not really impressive in sound. On the extras disc, there were 3 songs that I found enjoyable. There's the Maca classic WONDERFUL CHRISTMASTIME, which turns out to be the best song on this entire package. ALL of the new wave experiments found on this album are bad. There are two other extras on the bonus disc that are listenable; the lounge/disco BLUE SWAY and the electro-reggae/blues number CHECK MY MACHINE. This album is definitely for completists.   If you liked this album in the 80s or you must have everything that Paul ever recorded, then this is for you, otherwise there are many better albums from him. I recommend Band On The Run, Venus & Mars, Ram, Tug Of War; even the overproduced Wings At The Speed Of Sound is much better than this.  Highlights:  WONDERFUL CHRISTMASTIME  COMING UP  BLUE SWAY  CHECK MY MACHINE
B0016QNSFQ|4.0|The philosopher Wittgenstein is notable for his attempt, in the Tractatus, to create a formally logical philosophy.  Trying to delineate and characterize those objects and ideas in the universe that can be described via language, he proceeded to enumerate the requisite foundational ideas in a hierarchy to reveal their relationships to each other.  But, as he later clarified, he thought that the most important aspect of this was the complement of his endeavor, that is, the portion of the universe that cannot be described.  The unnameable and unknowable are far more important than the trivialities encompassed by mere words.    Or course Wittgenstein later rejected the Tractatus as a failure and adopted a theory centered around language games.  He considered the collection of possible games one that is impossible to describe because of its complexity.  He supported this using the analogy of \\"family resemblance\\" that relates one game to another.  His illustrations, unfortunately, all fall within the set of mathematical objects covered by mathematical game theory (including everything from hopscotch to poker, Go to quantum games).  While that does not mean that his insights cannot be useful, it does imply that his pronouncements must be considered with some care.        This film, with its minimal dialogue and sets, bare and black backgrounds and short scenes, is imitative of the structure of the Tractatus.  And it relates to the life of Wittgenstein just as the Tractatus does to the world.  The film is a minimalist work of art whose subject is Wittgenstein, not a documentary.  It focuses on the kind of tales that a student in philosophy learns in the hallway during the first year in graduate school.  It's campy, fun and filled with humor and social critique.  By the end, the missing backgrounds have come to symbolize the depth of missing information needed to understand Wittgenstein's philosophical views.      I enjoyed it as a work of art.  It might be an interesting way to expose a rebellious or inquisitive person to some philosophical ideas and people in an entertaining way.  Perhaps such a viewer will be tempted to fill in those missing backgrounds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|And it didn't matter one whit. I lost track of post-apocalyptic tales of tests with heavy loss and surprising redemption. I was so wrapped up in the story I didn't care that it was written for teenage girls. I'm a 57 y.o. guy! I loved it. Maybe it combined the best of brutal one-on-one warfare with spirit lifting possibilities. I laughed, I cried (Prim). Soaring and crushing. Well done! And it sort of mirrors the politics today. again, well done!!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I needed something that wasn't \\"serious\\", I saw so many good reviews that I thought I'd give it a try. What a refreshing fun story. This is not true, nor is it ridiculous, it is every little girls dream mixed in with all of our dumb realities. I giggled my way all the way through, recognizing characters as people I have known, and will turn back to this author the next time I need a mental vacation!

B004LWZW2E|4.0|Insidious is a movie that I would classify as being creepy and less scary. It starts off with a family moving into a new house with their 2 little boys and baby daughter. Soon strange things start to occur, like books being knocked off the shelf and boxes being moved to the attic. To make a long story short and without giving anything of importance away, one of the boys is being haunted a little more than the others. I do believe that Isidious and Poltergeist share a lot of similar elements. All in all I did feel slightly uneasy while watching it and had the urge to look over my shoulder, but I didn't jump or feel actually scared. While the ending is somewhat predictable, I just accepted that I knew what was gonna happen just let myself enjoy it. I definitely recommend watching it if you love scary movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fast and believable. Sad but happy,  confussing and smart. This trilogy has it all. There is one part Katniss is So misserable and defeated, you can actually feel bad. But everytime there is a problem, she finds a way of getting through. Loved it. Amazing couple that teaches how strong love is. Brilliant. The only thing I would change is the certain death of 2 characters
0553801473|5.0|Wonderfully written.  I am only 20% (Kindle) of the way through but am enjoying this book immensely.  Beautifully written and I will hate when it ends.  I realize that the never-ending storyline drives people crazy but the real horror is when the last page of the last book is turned and there is nothing left to expect, ever.  Get the book, enjoy the ride and read as it is a wonderful literary trip.  Read the series again if you are frustrated with the publishing schedule.  Just love great writing and the turtle description was great.
0553801473|5.0|People are crazy.  That's all I can guess is causing all of these negative reviews.<br />This book is good. Really good.  Possibly the best in the series.  You want events that rival what happens to Ned, or the Red Wedding, or any of the other memorable events in the previous books?  This book has got 'em.  Do you want shocking moments that make you step back from the book?  This book has got 'em.<br />Did you get tired of all the walking in circles that everyone seemed to be doing in Feast for Crows?  Yeah, me too. This book says forget all that.  Martin is back on his game.<br />This book moves forward every major plot point in the entire series with the possible exception of Sam and Littlefinger (because they aren't in this book).  The repercussions of the events in ADwD will resonate up until the end of the series.  Dany's story moves forward finally in some breathtaking ways.  Jon's story - holy crap, does some stuff happen at the wall.  Stannis?  Asha? Yep.  Don't get me started on Tyrion's journey.  Wow. So much amazing stuff.  If you love the series then this book will not disappoint you.  Unless you are crazy.

B003QNXPUK|2.0|This product works well for protecting the sides from scratching for about a month, when it starts to peel and turn yellow..  That's about it.  There are better options, and certainly better prices, for front and rear protectors.  In addition, the use of adhesive on this film has made me more and more uneasy about this product.  I would go with one of the many static cling types out there, as they have no change of pulling the coating off the iPhone glass.
B004S9OYBA|5.0|For the most part, cover songs tend to be a disaster. They often lack something magical that made the original version so special and are often performed by mediocre singers. In the past, however, Irish band the Corrs have managed to turn their few cover songs upside down, putting their own unique stamp on them - for example, their remake of Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams' is so different from the original as to put them in two different categories. Therefore, when the band's lead singer, Andrea, decided to release an album of all cover songs as her follow-up to 2007's \\"Ten Feet High\\", I wasn't immediately worried. Looking at the song choices has solidified my belief in her: the album is fantastic.    In order to make \\"Lifelines\\" work, Andrea needed to choose lesser-known tracks and put her own unique stamp on them. Happily, this is exactly what she's done. Choosing from artists as varied as John Lennon (and no, she didn't pick the over-done 'Imagine'), Roy Orbison, and the Velvet Underground, she has crafted a record of eleven classics that weave together in a magical way.     From the first few notes of World War II standard 'I'll Be Seeing You', it's evident that this album is the polar opposite of her first solo record. Where that was a mess of over-production, this one seems to rely on the sentiment that less is, truly, more. For me, the best tracks are 'Pale Blue Eyes', which somehow weaves magic, sneaking up on you when you least expect it; 'Blue Bayou', a catchy and summery Roy Orbison tune; 'No 9 Dream', a dream-like explosion of color; 'Tinseltown in the Rain', which is not only unique but unexpected; and 'They Don't Know', a catchy yet scaled-back sing-along classic. That's not to put down any of the other songs, though, because they are incredible as well.     Unlike its predecessor, \\"Lifelines\\" has managed to capture what's great about Andrea's music sensibility and her voice. Relying on stripped-back production and just plain great singing, it is one of thoserare gems: a cover album that sounds like it's new.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I not only love \\"Friends with Benefits\\" because Justin Timberlake is in it, but it's a funny, exciting film that deals with how friends can become intimate without the worry of getting involved in a relationship. The term \\"friends with benefits\\" has been used a lot in the last ten years as we see more and more people shying away from marriage and from being involved romantically with someone, so it's nice to see a film that explores this issue.<br /><br /> The movie also stars Mila Kunis and co-stars a very funny Woody Harrelson who plays the gay friend of the Justin Timberlake character.<br /><br /> The movie is very similar in theme to the Ashton Kutcher film \\"No Strings Attached\\" that was released earlier this year.<br /><br /> \\"Friends with Benefits\\" became a certified hit at the boxoffice making nearly $19,000,000 and coming in third for the week.
0061452068|5.0|Things are better now than they ever have been.  And they are getting better.  Humans have created for themselves a world of advanced and ever-growing technology and convenience.      Matt Ridley's The Rational Optimist takes us on a tour of prehistory and ancient times, and follows the evolution of human history and ingenuity up to the present day.  He begins with hunter-gatherer societies, and progresses right up to our current global market and online world.  He argues that as human ingenuity develops, ideas \\"have sex,\\" and society adapts and evolves.  The more interconnected we become, the more we learn and grow from our collective existence.    Ridley refutes the romantic notion of an idyllic past and explains, in-depth, why the present is a much better place to live than ancient times, the Middle Ages, or even just 50 years ago.  Disease has retreated.  Food supply and life spans have increased.  Medical technology advances at an unprecedented rate.    Ridley does not look through rose-colored glasses and say that everything is fine.  He acknowledges that there are still real problems that the world faces, but feels that overall we are headed in the right direction.  His purpose with this book is to argue for a positive outlook.  Ridley has stated, in the book as well as interviews, that he wrote this as a gift to a younger version of himself.  He grew up hearing from teachers and society the most dire predictions about over-population, draining of natural resources, mass starvations, and inheriting a much worse world than the one he was currently living in; a pessimistic and unrealistic diatribe, which, he says, continues to be taught to his own kids today.  Ridley injects that tired thinking with a dose of realistic optimism about how we got to this point and why we will continue to do better.    The Rational Optimist is a must read.  An interesting and upbeat book.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Making over $160,000,000 at the movie boxoffice, \\"Freaky Friday\\" became one of Lindsay Lohan's most successful films. In it she co-stars with the wonderful Jamie Lee Curtis and the plots involves how mother and daughter magically exchange places because of a fortune cookie.<br /><br /> The movie was based on the 1976 Jodie Foster film of the same name. The second time this film was done was for ABC television in 1995 starring Shelly Long.<br /><br /> In this outing hunky Chad Michael Murray from TV's \\"One Tree Hill\\" fame has a supporting role as the girl's boyfriend.
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|A riveting story about a young woman who struggles to save her improvised family from destitution.  We are taken on a journey to the wild, beautiful but stark southwestern area of Missouri called the Ozarks. Ree is informed by the local bail bondsman that her deadbeat meth-cooking criminal father has jumped bail putting the family farm, house, and their possessions at risk. Jennifer Lawrence gives a wonderful and believable performance as Ree the young strong matriarch responsible for the care of her senile mother, younger brother, and sister. She is given the challenge to either find her father, or solve the mystery concerning his disappearance. Her scary odyssey takes us through a strange labyrinth of extended family relationships, family based gang alliances, and the  shadowy world of local kingpin Little Arthur (Kevin Breznahan). Her only ally in this dark drama being her father's brother Jessup (John Hawkes) a drug addicted sociopath who might either help her, hurt her or get them both killed. The rest of the cast deserves credit for the totally believable, and exacting performances in this gritty but fascinating movie about another improvised, drug plagued anarchical part of America.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Halloween 2 isn't a bad movie but the real treat is that we are FINALLY getting Terror in the Aisles on a digital format. I figured that the rights issues would have prevented this from ever being re-released but I'm soo happy that we're going to get it on Blu-ray. I just hope that nothing has been cut.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is my favorite show and it just keeps getting better and better. Got the first season on blu ray and gonna get this one too.
0553801473|5.0|Deep, deep breath. I have been among the legion of fans who have had to sit the entire wait of YEARS for this book. I got A Feast for Crows on day one, and on day one many years later came A Dance With Dragons. I really, really didn't want to read it. Bare with me, a review is coming, but to understand the hate and vitriol in the other interviews this explanation is necessary. Before AFfC, Martin's brilliant novels were running on fewer, tighter plotlines, and a major revelation awaited in each one. Often more than one major revelation actually. Then AFfC came out, and despite being warned, we all cried foul to see that many of our favorite characters simply weren't involved. So there we were, having finished a book that seemed to have shorted us a bit, with a promise of the next book to be delivered after a short wait. Six years later we get what is essentially AFfC part 2, with an addendum containing the beginning of the next book.<br /><br />We started this leg of the journey very angry with AFfC, and over the years, and delays, we became more angry. We began to lose hope that the series would finish at all. And if nothing else, that sort of passion and hopelessness should let you know just how amazing this series is at connecting directly into you. Expectations were high. Just four months shy of six years after AFfC it's here: A Dance with Dragons. And that six years is the problem...<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons brings back the missing characters from AFfC, and as it begins there is nothing to complain about. Taken as a whole the book is clearly the middle of the road between acts two and three of the story entire. Having that in mind I think you'll enjoy it very much. Especially if you are a true fan of the series. So those of you who are, and who may be thinking about not buying (you know you will eventually), go ahead and buy it. It's Martin. It's his writing, it's his characters, and it's the same world you fell in love with over the rest of the four books. Stories as long as this have parts that may not seem to do much, but that's because the major consequences of the things that happen in A Dance wont be fully known until the start of the NEXT book. Dance is the literary equivalent of the story slowing down to stretch it's legs for the sprint. But it being written by Martin, as long as you keep that in mind, you can take a longer view and realize exactly what it is he's setting up. And what he's setting up is a MASSIVE shake-up in nearly every political, religious, and even supernatural facet of the world he's made. He's laying the path for events that will change things to such an extent that I think it may turn out to be unprecedented in fantasy literature.<br /><br />Let that sink in for a bit.<br /><br />A Dance With Dragons features less epic style action, and more personal, small conflicts. It takes the characters away from what they know, and it puts them in the thick of places they might not even belong. It's a growing experience for each and every character in the book. The problem is that these new paths are not the end of old paths.<br /><br />You see we as fans have wanted conclusions to some very major story points, we collectively assumed that Martin wouldn't be expanding his story any further, only staying with what he'd begun and starting to wrap it up. He didn't do that. So all of us who were reading with baited breath to find out, for instance, about Jon's parents were left in the dark. We end a Jon chapter and find that a new character is being introduced, and it seemingly has nothing at all to do with what was hinted at before. This makes us angry.<br /><br />But take a deep breath. The reason we were all here in the first place is precisely because of Martin's writing. This man, undoubtedly, knows what he's doing. He's 5 of 7 into what I think is going to be recognized as possibly THE fantasy series for mature audiences. We should not be angry that he didn't write what WE would have written.It's not our story to finish. It's his. And you can even take it a bit further. Re-read the first books and you'll notice how many small hints are dropped about Valyria, then come back to Dance to find that there is now a journey TO Valyria. I believe he's trying to tie up more than just the stories of the great houses we've been following. I think he's trying to tie up the bulk of his entire mythos by the end. And read more. Notice that until Dance with Dragons we had no idea that there would be a SINGLE commander of the white walkers and the things beyond the wall (and that it may be the very one who is training Bran). We didn't know the people of the forests were alive.<br /><br />No, I think Martin is right on track. I think he's doing brilliantly. I think I'm more than happy to give my patience and trust in him not leaving us in a lurch.<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire will have an ending. Please just take a deep breath and realize how stupid it would have been of him to start tying off all those incredible loose ends with two more books to go. Westeros just took a deep breath (and I took one with it), the next book will be the beginning of the plunge, and the last will be the plunge itself.<br /><br />But this book. This one stands as a worthy addition to the story. It didn't go precisely where all of us wanted, in fact it spent a lot of time in a place that was as unpleasant for us as it was for a few of the characters in it. But there is a real sense of the slow beginnings of inertia near the end. When even more characters start popping in and when the dual storylines running parallel in AFfC and ADwD finally do end... you can feel it start to move. By the end I was left feeling that all of that spreading out of story and plotlines and character arcs was about to start converging. Dance, along with Feast, are very singular events in publishing. They only came about because we, the fans, demanded Martin not skip forward several years. We wanted to know whathappened. And he gave it to us. The last two books were those written precisely so that we wouldn't feel cheated. Martin cared so much about fan outcry that he wrote two extra books. I for one am greatful. The more I read from him about this world the better.<br /><br />For five books now we've said it along with all the Starks: \\"Winter is Coming.\\" By the end of this book... winter is here. And NOW the fun begins. Just don't take another decade to finish this George. Please.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This is my favorite show. its NOTHING like Twilight and thats a good thing. Its so much more realistic and interesting
B005BW15XS|5.0|Ok people,  Kelly done brought the noise loud and clear that she is a force to be reckoned with! The opening track is insane I'M DAT CHICK just blew me away. Then the album just rolls on and on and from one dope track to another.    Love, Love, Love this album!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|It's rather funny that the phrase \\"words are wind\\" pops up in a book that has so. many. extra. words. And why does every chapter have to end with a \\"who shot JR\\" moment?<br />This book could have been 300 pages shorter and been more compelling for it.<br /><br />I don't have much to add on top of other reviews except to reiterate a counterpoint to something I read in a GRRM interview: Mr. Martin, I don't really want to fear for the lives of my favorite characters. Life has plenty of nonsensical killings and the bad guys getting away with it. Not what I'm looking for in a fantasy. And, if a particular storyline turns out to be as dire as it seems by the end of the book, then I'm reading the wrong author and will just move on.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Summary: This gift set was fantastic! The quality on the movie (watched the Blu-Ray) was flawless in my opinion, and I'm known to be a pretty picky person when it comes to quality! The price was too good to beat for such a great set and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed this classic years ago!    I must say, I was at first hesitant when I thought about all the extras that came in the box - I mean what would I need or do with all the items that this set comes with? But I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to see all the extras! The books were very interesting and the postcards were such a clever add in!! The music box was of such great quality and I truly enjoy listening to it. I think that for the high quality Blu-Ray (and DVD), the amount of extras, and the price, you really can't beat this deal!    Seeing this classic on such high quality resolution that I used to watch when I was younger and still sing along to is probably one of the greatest recent memories I hold! I truly recommend this gift set to anyone interested or hesitant upon purchasing!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Let's address the pink elephant in the room: Jon Anderson is not on this album.  Debating whether this album would be better with him is a moot point, this album wouldn't BE with him.  The band's choice wasn't whether to make an album with Jon (and as some say Rick) the choice was whether to make an album at all or not.  And clearly waiting for Jon wasn't working (it's been 10 years since the last album).    So this is a new Yes.  And let's face it- Yes has changed SEVERAL times over the years.  It's a bit unfair to compare it to previous works.  They're not gonna make another Fragile or Close to the edge even with Jon & Rick.  Is the album an enjoyable listen (irregardless of band name/musicians)?  My answer: YES!  Does the album sound enough like Yes to warrant calling it Yes?  Again: YES!  It's just that simple.  Listen to this with an open mind (NOT comparing it or with pre-conceived expectations) and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Also, I liked it upon first listen, but found I really liked it after repeated listens.    My last 2 cents: comparisons of this to the Buggles is INSANE!  This has very little to do with the Buggles, except that the keyboard player is here (who was also a previous member of Yes!) and both were produced by Trevor Horn.  That's it!  This has more Asia members in it than Buggles, but I don't see anyone comparing it to Asia.  For the people referencing Buggles- go listen to Buggles again- this sounds nothing like that.    And for those that think Jon & Rick are Yes- go listen to their latest CD.  This is WAY better (and sounds way more like \\"older Yes\\") than that does!    But bottom line- it's a good CD- nothing more- nothing less.  I'm glad they did something- better than nothing!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce has taken music to a whole new level. It's def a timeless album. There are classic R&B records that need to be heard by today's generation. She delivered with confidence and took a break from the usual route she takes with her music. Production is CRAZY, songs are great, vocals are out of this world! she's the best!! a must have
B005D9MUWY|2.0|stops auto correction so i have to restart the App and some predictions are just stupid. but over is okay.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|There are very few few games that keep my attention for more than a few minutes. I have spent hours playing this game. I have installed it on my EVO and my Touch. Love the addiction.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|When I first saw the Gaems G155 unit, I knew I wanted one so I could take my Xbox 360 and PS3 anywhere I travelled to and play my games. I ordered it and within a week It arrived on my doorstep over in New Zealand from USA. I have played on it every night and am loving the experience this gives, sturdy hard case with a great screen giving me fantastic visuals!  Gaems have also been exceptional at support and sent me a free remote and t shirt for this system which definately adds to the experience, remote is really helpful for changing volume from a distance while watching movies!  - Fantastic 720p LED screen  - No LAG from console to screen  - Speakers on G155 unit do the job well  - Storage bags hold controllers, remote, and 2.5\\" usb hdd well for movies on my xbox!  - works well with Wireless Xbox Adapter which is great for wireless system link around my house   - allows for padlocks to lock up case  - Optional remote control for g155 screen  - Allows for multiplayer gaming with Player One and Player Two Audio Points  - Works with Xbox 360, Xbox 360 Slim and PS3 Slim    Nothing better then this for fantastic competitive gaming experience on home consoles.  I have brought another one and it is on it's way to me now!!    Do yourself a favour and buy one now, you will not regret it!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Loved it. Story is probably four stars, but acting, visuals, editing, cut scenes, packaging extras make this a five start treat. Even more so if you are into anime and are used to this type of story telling. I thought it was cleaver how they mapped one story to the other and then added exciting action sequences to spice it up. I'm a bit irritated by some of the negative critics reviews... so i think i'll just ignore them. ;)
B001JNNE64|4.0|I am critical of Blu-Ray....the biggest problem with it is that the techs who are responsible for manipulating the picture are not director's or even artists, it seems....I have seen beautiful movies butchered by tech (Legends of the Fall).....but they did do well here. The BR folks did not diminish the qualities that make Amadeus so beautiful. The soft character lighting is upheld while colors flicker more brilliantly in the close candlelight....the sound is perfect and the details of things like the architecture are honed in on, while intentionally blurred backgrounds are left alone....well done here, folks....and thank deus!!!!
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|I came to this CD never having heard of Susan Tedeschi & only having seen/heard Derek Trucks once in concert (supporting Eric Clapton).  One reviewer said she can't sing;  well, that's just plain wrong & indeed somewhat insulting.  Conversely, she hasn't got the greatest voice since Ella Fitzgerald either (btw, the Bonnie Raitt comparison is quite fair) & indeed on certain tracks (eg \\"Until You Remember\\") she DOES strain it a little unnecessarily.  This said, in all other respects it is quite unexceptionable......  As for Trucks, he is clearly a fine guitarist, particularly on slide.  As I gather that previous albums of his are a bit more \\"fiery\\", to the extent that this is a somewhat restrained affair I can see how some people might be a tad disappointed, especially as Tedeschi's voice is by far the most prominent \\"instrument\\" with Trucks' guitar only occasionally gaining solo space.  Nevertheless, all-in-all this is a smart, tight, sassy and quite soulful album that, at least for the uninitiated, merits at least one listen.
B000F9RB8K|2.0|Unfortunately, the wait was not because they were doing a better job....    This movie is a fairly recent movie, compared with, let's say, \\"Out of Africa\\", but the work done to make it Blu-ray was not well done. I have both movies and I would say that the original is a better representation of what the movie requires. The Blu-ray, in this case, did not add any clarity to the grandeur of the landscapes, nor enhance the softer character lighting. This movie is a classic and requires more than what was given it. I am greatly disappointed that the tech people did not figure that out before working on it....
B003ZSJ212|5.0|At the End of the Day, it's star wars.. I'm sure even the guys who voted 1 star will secretly purchase this.. i mean, who are you guys fooling? We all love Starwars and I don't care if there will be 5 versions of the BD release..I'll get all of them.    A true Fan & Member of the 501st,  Luis
B00095NX9G|4.0|I have been using this DVD for about a year and I appreciate it now more than i did to start with. I have 4-5 years belly dance experience.<br /><br />The best of this DVD set is that it contains several sections (15-30 min each) that you can combine and include in your own practice, so it is very flexible to use according to your needs. Each section is at the right pace to be followed like if you were at a dance class, with the right number of  repetitions so you get the movement without getting bored.<br /><br /> The first DVD is technique. It is similar to a classical tribal-fusion dance class. It is very good practice: you can feel the muscles work at the end, the coordination is tricky at first but gets better after practicing a while.  It includes most of the basic isolation moves, without  much explanation. To each movement with the body there is a routine with different steps associated, which is a good idea. Most of the yoga training is similar to the basic stretching that a dancer would do. I did not find it  improved my backband.<br /><br />The second DVD are two choreographies. Yes, the music is kind of weird like many people pointed out- however, it is tribal fusion, AND, most of the combos can be easily adapted to other music- they are not that specific to the music piece. They are full Rachel's style and can add different combinations of ondulations and isolations-shimmies to any dancer's repertoire. Especially, the footwork and some details in posture to obtain the final effect are made clear.<br /><br />All this said, Rachel's technique is definitely great, and, if this DVD has had so many good reviews, probably it is worth to try it. It will give you new ideas and combinations, and each of the sections is  a good workout by itself.
0062060554|5.0|This book encompasses everything I look for in a good summer read 1) thought-provoking, 2) page-turner, 3) shocking ending.  Once I started this book I could not put it down.  It made me consider how I would want to live if I was in Christine's shoes.  I became so engrossed in her daily fears that I too began to wonder if her life is what she chose.  This is a perfect read for a weekend trip, but guarantee you will finish the first night you start it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I know these movies well and purchased them in bluray for my collection of the best Scifi flicks ever. The seller was totally great with response time and condition of \\"new\\" product, so 5 stars to them. If you know the \\"Alien\\" series then nothing need be said. If not, then you live under a rock and it's time to come out now and enjoy yourself. I have to many friends who are deathly afraid of what they call \\"to much screen time\\" and most of them suffer some sort of depression or need medication. I say to them \\"wild women never get the blues\\" just to see that quizzical look they give back.  Enjoy your life now, today, take it all in and live. Thanks
031604461X|5.0|I was not quite sure about this one from the mixed reviews, but my expectations were still quite high since I loved all the other books in the series.  I didn't think it could get much better after the funny romance during the honeymoon... until I read chapter 24: Surprise... which I actually loved even more.  After I read that chapter I had to close my book to give myself some time to daydream LOL.  Not a teen here by the way and it was still awesome.  I saw some people complaining in reviews about how Bella's parents are hardly mentioned until very late in the book - well with the content earlier in the book it would have made no sense for them to be in it - she would not call them while on her honeymoon - and when it is in Jacob's point of view for a while in the middle of the book(which I enjoyed more that I thought I would), why would they be mentioned?  Anyway, I thought it was great!  On the negative side, I really could have gone without the whole Jacob & Renesmee thing, but it did not annoy me enough to rate the book lower.  I guess it was just there so Jacob would have a reason to want to stay in Bella's world.  I did very much enjoy Bella's initial reaction to it.  I totally disagree with all the negative reviews saying that the book teaching young girls that you get pregnant the first time you have sex and pregnancy is horrible and all that - if you really are into the book you would realize it was like this because the father is a vampire... there is plenty of description as to why her pregnancy is so horrific, reasons that would never apply to real life.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|Or do if being scared out of your mind is your thing. This movie has left me reeling. I watched it, then watched it a second time. I don't usually scare easily, I am talking the exorcist, the omen, interesting but not haunting. Butthis movie, in the dark, high def with surround sound, between the sound track, an excellent cast of characters, and a well written screen play this movie left me begging my husband to shut off the surround sound and thinking about it ohhhhh over 24 jours now. A must see, leaves you with just enough questions at the end that you will be left thinking about it for a long time afterwards. I will not summarize the movie for you,read the back if you want that, or give away the ending for that matter but I will say that it left me watching scenes for second, then third time, trying to figure out well, if.... cant say without ruining the ending.... just do watch, because you are missing some quality horror cinema if you don't!
0060872675|5.0|My husband and I love Terry Pratchett's books and bought this book when our firstborn was a tiny baby, more for us than for our kids. We never thought we'd try reading it to our kids more than once, never thought they'd like it. Our son is now 3 and we have a 2 year old daughter as well, and it has been hands-down their favorite book! We have an entire bookcase filled with children's books, but this book is literally the only one that has tape on every page and is slowly falling to pieces because it is so well-loved and used! I bought brand new copies for my son and daughter, and a third copy for the baby on the way who I expect will probably love it as much as her siblings do, so that someday they can each have a nice copy to read to their own children.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|A Discovery of Witches opens with a classic, effective (though not original) hook - an old manuscript that holds power and secrets. The protagonist is an over-achieving historian and faculty at Oxford, too young for her accomplishments, and a bit too conflicted. She's determined to reject her family history of witchcraft, but it isn't clear why she would be so determined to abandon the kind of power others only wish for. She is likeable enough, but a bit boring (and this could be intended and fits her character).     The manuscript is described in a way that deepens its hook into the story, but why Diana would refuse to dig deeper into its mystery was not believable to me. I wanted to know more about it, even if she didn't, so I remained interested. We're given a lot of backstory early on (I thought that was taboo for writers today...but it was helpful in knowing Diana) and the pace is slow.     I enjoy the intelligence of Diana and felt flutters of esoterica, but they were dashed by the intrusion of cliched and silly examples of a witch's ability--making a washing machine not over-fill, having a book drop from a top shelf into her hand and turning to the right page, etc. These are poor flashbacks to the 1960's sitcom Bewitched, and I was disappointed that an author who has clearly done her own research would stoop so low, even if it is to interest a readership who likes such things.     So, what is this book? I guess that's my problem. I'm never really sure. I hope, as the story progresses, the author will find her literary ground and hold it. I like Diana, and hope Bewitched and Samantha stay far from the story.     Then enters a Cullen-ish vampire. I almost stopped reading, but I hope the story of this strange manuscript will ultimately satisfy. This hope keeps me going for now.     One last opinion. Witches are not human? I think that's a big mistake to make in this story.
0439023521|5.0|I love this book series.  I read it in the past but didn't want to wait in the library que to read it again.  I had to order it for myself and a friend.
B00275EGX8|4.0|The Story:    Going in I only knew the basic premise, the story is about a  U.S. army bomb squad in Iraq. I could not have predicted the level of suspense the film is able to generate with the excellent directing, cinematography and sound editing. The action is visceral and the bomb defusing and combat scenes are completely engaging. As others have said the movie ends in seemingly unusual or perhaps unexciting way, but even though it feels like the ending drops the ball, the entire experience is worth it.    Quality:    10/10, among the best visuals I have seen on any blu-ray, stunning detail even at 720p. This film will permanently change your standards for video and audio quality on a blu-ray, and is worth watching if for only that reason. The scenarios place them in combat and with explosions which get to demonstrate the awesome quality of the transfer, a must watch.
0897500482|1.0|Utter junk.  Most of this is transcribed/plagiarized from old boxing and wrestling manuals and from J. Krishnamurti.  Marketed by his opportunistic widow to disenfranchised kids who want to become tough guys.  Sad, sad, sociopathically sad.  As a culture we need to grow past these movie/video game/testosteronic, enormously destructive patterns of romanticizing violence.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|This movie was a great action suspense surprise.  It was well worth the investment and the price was good too.
0061673730|5.0|Though the book received was not the actual book I got, the text is the same. The book is in perfect condition, arrived quickly, and is being enjoyed as we speak. I would use this seller again!
0553801473|1.0|I loved Martin's first three books, but I doubt I will read another in this series. He is no Tolkien.  I don't mind a 1,000 page book if it is interesting, has a good plot, and the characters are well-developed.  However, I feel that Martin thought he was being paid by the word!  This particular book is supposed to run parallel to book four.  He admits that book four was running too long and that he split it.  Well, he should have taken one of the swords from the book to it.  It gives you the feeling that he cut all the description or stuff he didn't like in book four and threw it into book 5 as an after thought.  He keeps killing off old characters and creating new ones, as well.  This makes the book seem disjointed.<br /><br />I wound up skimming a great deal and forcing myself to read through to the ending.  Only a few story lines were resolved in the book.  I am really disappointed.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Its been a few years since I read the previous books in this series but this is distinctly my least favorite. So much so, that I'm not going to bother with the next one. I'm not sure what changed, but I found this extremely cumbersome to read and found myself skimming through a lot of it. The plot barely moves an inch, sizable portions of book focus on characters (like Theon and Davos) that I wasn't particularly interested in (that's probably subjective though). Tyrion was one of my favorite characters, but this time around there are fewer sarcastic quips and a lot more self loathing - which is fine, except that the self-loathing gets very repetitive (actually a lot of everything seems very repetitive in this book). Maybe this is how Tyrion always was in the other books, and I've forgotten. Also, a lot of the things I liked about the previous books seemed like gimmicks in this one (random acts of cruelty, random killing of a main character through acts of treachery, and so on). Again, I'm not sure if that's due to a drop in quality or if my tastes have changed, probably a bit of both.
0307341577|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! Could not put it down! Dark describes it perfectly..and suspenseful to the max! You will be absolutely hooked on page one. Highly recommend this novel and can't wait to read her other works!
0345529057|4.0|There are so many reviews out there about the books themselves, that I just won't go there.  Needless to say, I'm loving the series and can't wait for the next book, hopefully with the success of the HBO series, Martin will feel more pressure to finish the last two books.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that the box that the books came in was super flimsy!  I ripped two corners just picking it up and had to reinforce all four with tape.  Overall, you can't beat the deal of getting all four books at a great price.
B00006LWSF|3.0|This cd should've been a lot better than it is.  Billed as having guest appearances by some of the best rappers who have ever spit, Eminem's 8 Mile soundtrack looks like it would be a surefire classic.  Rakim is here, Jay-Z, Nas, Xzibit, and Gang Starr.  With guest appearances of that caliber, this should have been a great cd.  The problem is Eminem is the only one on here who actually lives up to form.  \\"Lose Yourself,\\" \\"8 Mile,\\" and \\"Rabbit Run\\" are standard eminem.  I would call \\"Rabbit Run\\" one of his top five songs, period.  \\"Lose Yourself\\" lost a little power because it was so overplayed, but the three of them are raw, emotional, and they show Em at his best.      But then there's the guest appearances.  Obie Trice has two pretty awful songs on here, \\"Love Me,\\" and \\"Adrenaline Rush.\\"  These two songs are very boring.  The beats are boring, the lyrics are not interesting at all.  50 Cent also contributes 2 duds, with \\"Places to Go,\\" and \\"Wanksta.\\"  They're typical 50 Cent songs, so if you like him, you'll probably like these two songs.  I find him to be pretty unoriginal, and on these two songs, the hooks are annoying, and the lyrics are very elementary.  D-12 joins Eminem on \\"Rap Game\\" but unfortunately, while he outshines his group, his verse isnt strong enough to overshadow the rest of the horrible rhymes on the song.  Nas, Rakim, and Gang Starr are the veterans of the gaggle of guests.  \\"U Wanna Be Me,\\" \\"R.A.K.I.M\\" and \\"Battle\\" sound like tracks that have been left off of their cds and scraped off the bottom of the barrel for their inclusion here.  \\"That's My N**** for Real\\" by Young Zee and \\"Wasting my Time\\" by Boomkat are two tracks that are impossible to listen to, the first being a rap song with a beat that sounds like it came from an 8-bit video game, and the latter being an R&B song.  Young Zee sounds like Kool Keith's deaf brother who can't rap.      There are a few people on here who don't embarrass themselves.  Jay-Z's \\"8 Miles and Runnin'\\" isn't GREAT for Jay, but as one of the few on here that are tolerable, its pretty refreshing.  Xzibit's \\"Spit Shine\\" is as good as Xzibit gets, I don't know why he bothered to give such great material to an overall poorly executed project.  The best non-Eminem song on here is either Xzibit's or Macy Gray's \\"Time of My Life,\\" which has a great beat, regardless of if you're into R&B.  This cd all together is just OK.  Only about 1/4 of the songs on here are worth buying.  The rest are just garbage filler that I can't imagine anyone really WANTING to hear.  If you get this cd, you'll get a handful of good songs, but mostly songs to skip over.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|This is a great record from Asia - their second since the reunion. The first one came in 2008. This one is from 2010. It is full of hits. Every song is a possible A-side for a single. There are rockers and ballads and everything. With great playing from every member. Among the best songs are \\"I'm still the same\\" and \\"There was a time\\".

I am not at all into car racing but the race car \\"education\\" and analogies were entertaining and informative. The author of this book is just simply fantastic.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|In total ive spent probably about 20$ on different keyboard apps for my evo and this one slaughtered all of them in every way.  There is no lag no issues with spell correct,  the neon theme is sick especially because my phone is rooted and has a custom rom. It all blends together and works seamlessly. And the best part of it all was that i got it when it was free.  I would gladly have paod the 4 dollars if i knew how much i would love this keyboard .  Ps if you rate this app a 1 you clearly arent smart enough to appreciate it.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Normally, it's almost impossible to get me to stop reading a book series in the middle of it.  But I won't be buying the rest of this series.  Maybe in 20 years, if it is in the library (if we still have libraries), I'll borrow the last book and see if the ones in the middle might be worth reading.<br /><br />I just didn't like any of the characters in this book.  Tyrion and Daenyris are not as compelling as they have been in earlier books.  None of the characters felt real anymore, their behavior just didn't seem consistent with how they've been written in earlier books.<br /><br />Plus, no progress on plotlines after a how many year wait?<br /><br />The series for me ended with this book.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite games. Between this and Angry Birds... I have to say I like this just a little bit more. It has the flavor of a Tower Defense game (Which I love) but a story to go with the game. The different levels are great, and getting new plants to help you defend is always cool.

0312370849|5.0|I'm so glad I finally read \\"Sarah's Key\\" by Tatiana De Rosnay, which came out in 2007 and has garnered widespread praise.  The novel is based on the roundup of Parisian Jews by French police in the summer of 1942. Tens of thousands of Jews were herded into the Vélodrome d'Hiver (an indoor cycling arena in Paris) where they were held for days, pending transfer to camps outside Paris, from which they were eventually sent to Auschwitz. De Rosnay's story focuses on Sarah, a young girl who, along with her parents, is among those forcibly taken from their homes.  In the few moments the French police give the family to gather a few belongings, Sarah hides her four-year-old brother in a cupboard, assuring him she will be back for him soon.  This narrative alternates with a contemporary story about Julia Jarmond, an American journalist living in Paris, whose editor assigns her to cover the 60th anniversary of the Vél' d'Hiv' roundups and whose family coincidentally is set to move into the apartment once occupied by Sarah and her family. When Julia learns about the earlier occupants, she sets out to discover what happened to the family.    De Rosnay alternates the narratives and time periods frequently in the first half of the book, with brief chapters that quickly flip back and forth between story lines. The effect is to move each narrative along briskly and draw the reader in.  I was transfixed.  I do a lot of reading each week, but not much of it gets done after I'm in bed at night.  My eyelids cut those moments short.  However, Sarah's Key kept me reading for several hours one night this week -- the first time in several years that a book has grabbed me that way.  This is also the kind of book that stays with you long after you finish reading it.  Very satisfying.

B004EPYZZ8|1.0|While I applaud Bethany, and understand what a problem she must have had getting accustomed to her disability. I am NOT an overtly preachy christian. I was glad to read the reviews that basically spelled out exactly what this film was trying to get past us.  I have had more than enough Christians acting on my behalf and trying to get me to believe in their god to \\"heal me\\" it is a load of pablum fed to the masses, and I am sorry that religion has reared its head to ruin what I thought was going to be an awesome movie.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|Remember Pan's Labyrinth,how the little girl in that movie had wild fantasies and lived out fantastical events?  It's pretty much the same idea here, although they took it a step further and put imagination into imagination.  There are three levels going on here:<br /><br />First Level(Reality) - the girls are in an insane asylum<br />Second Level (Fantasy A) - the girls are trapped in a burlesque house type of deal<br />Third Level (Fantasy B) - the girls are a team of fighters; the events in this fantasy are guided by events in Reality and Fantasy A.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a bang and then slows down so much it makes you wonder if you have the right movie playing........However, it picks up again and eventually provides a satisfying ending.<br /><br />One of the annoyances of the movie was the BLARING soundtrack during the fantasy sequences.  A little less would have been better.<br /><br />Check out Sucker Punch.

We have many types of fruit trees not covered in the book but were able to incorporate them into icecreams based on what the book showed us. Fun read as well. Revised: after working through more recipes this is even better.
B00005B4GT|3.0|I think Capitol shorted themselves (and us) on this.  For my ears, I really don't think they remastered this for vinyl.  They simply took the compact disk mix and pressed it on wax.  It's pretty pathetic when a company advertises something special and then fails at the most important point.    The sound is much the same as the digital version, plus the added noise of pops and click (and possible dullness) that comes with wax.  On a good vinyl master there is a good deal more detail; with a noise floor that lets your ears peruse into the murky fuzz that only clouds an even higher resolution.      But on this pressing what you have is that murky fuzz minimally clouding off what you can already hear clearly on the digital version.  For those of us that like the sound of vinyl, we can be somewhat happy.  But for those of you that like respectable sound quality in regards to what is advertised... don't buy this.    I'm really quite disappointed in this, as I would love a proper pressing of this album along with KidA.
0061433047|5.0|Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors. I would love to meet him and shake his hand, thanking him for nearly single-handedly raising the intelligence-level of modern fantasy and satire. As you read his Discworld books with their deliciously irreverent mythologies and perfectly aimed character descriptions, you get the feeling that this guy has read more books than you could ever read-- and he's remembered all of it.<br /><br />I Shall Wear Midnight is the fourth book in Pratchett's Tiffany Aching sequence and is in many ways the most sentimental and brazen. It follows Tiffany as she encounters an evil that is bent on destroying her and her kind. Her journey is accompanied by the delightful and brilliant Nac Mac Feegles. These people are a few inches tall, insanely strong, blue, and talk with a heavy brogue. They have names like Rob Anybody and Daft Wullie. They live by a strict code of honor, and aside from that code, anything goes.<br /><br />Between Tiffany, love interests, the Nac Mac Feegles and a strong plot, I Shall Wear Midnight is a good read. What makes it an unusually moving yet frustrating read is the bold sentimentality and preaching done by Tiffany and witches in general. On the good side, Pratchett has a wonderful appreciation for women and what they do. He also has a reverence for life which is inspirational. Additionally, his protagonists are motivated by a strong sense of real justice and duty. Furthermore, his books are populated by people who act like real people and the people we are cheering for find strength and courage to become better, and by doing so, overcome their challenges.<br /><br />This is wonderful.<br /><br />But Pratchett is obviously atheist. There's nothing wrong with that. Indeed, he's typically been very indulgent towards believers, essentially allowing them their strong beliefs and rituals as long as their harmless. But in I Shall Wear Midnight, deity and worship seem to be a big joke. The priest of Om in this book seems to know perfectly well that what he believes is idiotic and silly. Indeed, the antagonist originated as a priest. It just feels a little preachy.<br /><br />I have little trouble putting these attitudes aside as I read. Thus, the book is still excellent. There are long stretches of prose so beautiful that you marvel. There are brilliant, laugh-out-loud moments as well. As always, the Feegles delight. This book is highly recommended.<br /><br />Pens: 4.5 out of 5at he believes is idiotic and silly. Indeed, the antagonist originated as a priest. It just feels a little preachy.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this book for the first time almost 13 years ago.  I was required to read it for my Science Fiction & Fantasy class my senior year.  Unlike most of the books we read that year I gladly read this book cover to cover.  There's something about the story that just speaks to me.  After I graduated I not only went and bought this book and reread it but I bought and read the rest of the series and have always anticipated the release of the next book in the series.  None to this day have disappointed.  I also own the audiobook and the comic series.  To Mr. Card I say I hope you are doing well with your recovery and looking forward to Shadows in Flight no matter how long it takes for you to get it to us.

B000683VI4|5.0|This review is about: The Notebook (DVD)  I was following three Nicholas Sparks stories, !. A Walk to Remember, 2. Now and Then, 3. The Notrbook.   As to # 3;  It is a wonderful story! It is  a compelling romance of two young people in  a rural town. While very young the couple engages in a heated physical   scene (but not vulgar beyond heavy breathing). As they grow uo they drift apart entering into marriages to others. A lifetime later, they are shown  very old and oddly enough in the same senior citizens home,  But they have a journal the lady (now an Alzeheimers victim) had  written  throughout the years.  Now that's revealing too much,  just buy the DVD and watch it.  James Garner is perfect in this!                                                                                                               Thanks from \\"A senior reviewer\\"
B0000004V2|5.0|The Stone Roses (BY The Stone Roses) is a very hypnotizing album to say the least. It is almost like a crossroads between the British indie scene going on at the time, and the 1960's psychedelic scene, creating a very unique brand of alternative music that only The Smiths could have equally matched (have they not broken up before this release unfortunately :( ). This is a very diverse, exciting, and fun album, and is an ABSOLUTELY essential purchase for any music collection.
0553801473|3.0|I have waited for few books as long as I did this one. After Feast for Crows came out, I foolishly believed the afterword which said the next book would be out shortly. (5 years later...) When something takes this long, it seems inevitable that the result will be mediocre. (Deathly Hallows anyone?) Initially I assumed the series would be done in 3 books, then 7. Now I'm wondering if it will ever end. So many new plot lines--some of which, such as the entire Iron Islands subplot, as well as 75% of the Slaver's Bay storyline--I could not care less about.<br /><br />In addition to the dozens of characters already existing, Martin has re-wrapped many in new personas, spending entire chapters explaining their new situations. The end result is a lot of back story and very little that moves the plot forward. I had a similar issue with A Feast for Crows (the introduction of the Dorne storyline irritated me) but at least that book ended on a satisfying note. This book feels as if it simply ends, leaving multiple characters in the middle of journeys and the reader with minimal investment in where they're going or if they get there.<br /><br />Many of the characters I adored, especially Jon Snow, seem to have changed personalities completely. Jon, who previously has made painful and almost cruel choices to uphold the integrity of the Black Watch, now seems to abandon those beliefs. Tyrion has shifted from bitter, clever and sardonic to cartoonish, mawkish and ineffectual. (The introduction of a helpless female dwarf does not help.) Dany, previously portrayed as tough, if a little out of her depth, seems to transform into a helpless adolescent, overly dependent on the men around her and requiring rescue at every turn.<br /><br />Some of this might have been forgiven if the pacing had not been so sluggish. At one point Tyrion takes a river trip (to what purpose is unclear) and meets a group called Stone Men; I could feel myself fossilizing along with them. The delightfully wicked characters have disappeared, replaced with brutality that seems to have no purpose but shock. The strong characters you loved are falling apart. So with no one to hate and no one to root for, what are you left with?<br /><br />To sum up: only for the faithful. I hope the next one shows a return to form.
B001TM1X54|5.0|We received this book as a gift, and my 10 month old has loved it ever since I first started reading to him.  It was *the* book I brought along last time we took a plane with him.  It's very simple, so it's easy for babies to pick up on - and a great way to start teaching them the names of different animals.  Starting at about 6 months (maybe?) my son started lifting the flaps himself.  Boy does he love to do that!  The flaps are very sturdy so our book is still in great condition.  Each \\"box\\" containing an animals is a different shape, so it's been a good exercise for my son to have to figure out that some flaps open from the bottom, some from the top.  We've been reading it every day for months, and I imagine this book will stay fun for years ahead.  I'm about to order it as part of a baby shower gift for my best friend.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter gets the best ending imaginable and one that should please even the most skeptical fans of the books.  I have always had the ability to separate the books from the films, but there are many people that can't and end up judging a movie by how close it is to the book.  The saying \\"The book is better\\" almost always applies to adaption's (that was unintentional alliteration by the way), but that doesn't mean the films aren't successful.  In fact, every Harry Potter film is \\"certified fresh\\" on Rotten Tomatoes, with Deathly Hallows Part II standing at the top with 96%.  For me, the only films that were better than their book counterparts were Prisoner of Azkaban and Deathly Hallows.  I felt like for the most part the changes made in these three films was an improvement on the book.  For example, the change made in Part I with Hedwig ultimately made more sense and flowed in the movie much better.  Part II mixed action, romance, and comedy seamlessly, which are all the things that made the franchise great in the first place.  I get the feeling that when we are able to watch Deathly Hallows in it's entirety, it will flow extremely well and even though the two parts differ a lot in the way they look and feel, they seem like they will go together very well.      As for the franchise as a whole, here are some popular complaints about the series that I disagree with:  \\"David Yates ruined the Harry Potter Franchise\\"- Yates had a tough job with his first two films.  Order of the Phoenix is a ridiculously long book that doesn't have a main objective throughout most of the book, and Half-Blood Prince is the toughest adaption by far with no main villain.  The stark difference in all of his films proved that he is the second best director in the series after Cuaron (and ultimately could be the best, as it seems he will have a great career).  \\"1 and 2 are the best in the franchise\\"- The first two are good in their own right, but they are lacking visually and the villainsare one-dimensional.  \\"Michael Gambon is an abomination\\"-  Gambon did not take over where Richard Harris left off, but he still played an effective Dumbledore and improved in every successive film he was in.  Unlike Harris, Gambon made you believe he was the most powerful person in the franchise.  I got the feeling that Harris would have really struggled with some things that would be required of him later in the series, but he was a tremendous actor.  \\"Deathly Hallows should have been one movie\\"-  Ironically, I have seen people say that Part II is rushed but that Deathly Hallows should have been one long movie.  Huh?  A 3 hour movie would be incomprehensible and beyond rushed.   Harry Potter= Necessary addition, Twilight = Money Grab  \\"Characters deaths should have been more emotional\\"-  This is a common complaint from hardcore fans.  In my opinion, the film nailed the deaths.  In the book, there are characters that get one line dedicated to their deaths, so some problems are because of the book.  However, I feel like if every character gets an emotional song and dramatic moment, it would lose its impact very quickly.  In Part II, some of the best moments are the ones without dialogue. Harrys reaction to seeing the ones he loves die are powerful scenes in their own right.   \\"There should have been a crowd during the final battle\\"-  This is a reasonable argument but I think having people cheer would have been superficial considering everyone lost loved ones and friends.  If you won a battle, would you be clapping and cheering even though you lost a friend or sibling just moments before?    In conclusion, when people think of this past decade in films it will most likely be remembered for comic book movies, the Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter (and Batman of course deserves a separate mention from comic book movies, what I believe will be the best trilogy of all time).  Harry Potter is an incredible achievement for many different reasons.  Actors were picked whenthey were 10 years old and for the most part all turned out well.  I feel like the films improved as they went on, which is unheard of.  Has there ever been one franchise this long that was so consistent, and one where the last film was arguably the best.      My opinion changes all the time, but right now here's how I would rank them (with Rotten Tomatoes ratings):  1. Deathly Hallows Part II (96%)  2. Prisoner of Azkaban (91%)  3. Order of the Phoenix (77%)  4. Deathly Hallows Part I (79%)  5. Half-Blood Prince (83%)  6. Goblet of Fire (88%)  7. Sorcerer's Stone (80%)  8. Chamber of Secrets (83%)    If you are a huge fan of the books but have never gotten into the films, I highly suggest you try to give them another chance with an open mind.  The films aren't for everyone, but it would be a shame to disregard the series just because some decisions made weren't the same as how we would make them.  Harry Potter is the most profitable film and book franchise of all time, and it's for a good reason...

B004T0XYKK|4.0|\\"Rio Lobo\\" is one of the John Wayne's late western epics. This movie marks the last time that he and Howard Hawks worked together. The cinematography is georgeous and Jerry Goldsmith provides an exciting soundtrack. The blu-ray transfer was beautiful and worthy of the cinematography. The story is pretty basic with John Wayne having to cleanup a corrupt town. There are more beautiful women in this little sink-hole of a town than in any other John Wayne movie. If you are a Wayne fan, it is worthy of collecting.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I have had several headsets, most of them were cheap. But I have had really nice headphones. These are great, I had no issue what so ever with it installing and working on my windows 7 64 bit edition. Just followed instructions, and boom done. The surround sound I use with what ever I want, mostly movies, games. It sounds good and realistic. It even has decent bass. The range reaches everywhere in my house(2 story 4room 2 bath). The only place it cuts out is if I walk far out onto my driveway(which is really far) or if the microwave is going upstairs and I am standing next to it. I love the g keys, I set up Itunes with it, so I can play/pause, fast forward, or go back. A great deal for 100bucks. Good sounding mic, no issues. The voice change is ok, which it was more customizable(probably can download mods), but who really ever uses it anyways? anyways overall good buy no issues.  Note: I also installed the software on my windows xp netbook. It worked just fine, no issues. All I have to do to use them on my netbook it pull out the receiver from the desk top and plug it into the usb on my net book, turn on the headphones, and I am good to go.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album has been my mantra for the past couple months.  Anyone that has an appreciation for I guess what you could call 'modern rock' needs to have this album on their shelf.  This is one of those albums that you won't hear a bad track.  The Foo's have gone through some different approaches and sounds to their albums, but based on this album they're only getting better.    If for some reason my disc was damaged, I would go out and buy it again as soon as possible.  Worried about getting your money's worth from buying the album?  Don't hesitate, it's worth every penny.  Which shouldn't be too hard to see when it has over 200 reviews and is rated *****    Bands and albums like this are what let me know there's still good music around!    Enjoy!!!
B000VWOV3O|5.0|To have all of The Mahavishnu Orchestra's output from the early 70's, for 10 bucks (!), is the reason to purchase this product. I was fortunate enough to witness the original Mahavishnu Orchestra in Boulder, Colorado, and it is still, one of my all-time musical orgasmic life experiences. No one has made music like that, before or since. This is an opportunity, for others to contemplate and enjoy, the sheer virtuosity that this band possessed. Outside of 'Dream Theater', I cannot think of any other band, that had such a high caliber of artistry.<br />So, never mind the lack of liner notes, and the cheap packaging, it's the music! Made by: The Greatest Band That Ever Was!
0061714372|3.0|A remarkably candid account of Dave Mustaine's career with Metallica and Megadeth. He comes across as very honest, particularly with regard to his feelings towards the members of Metallica. The personalities and relationships along the path of his career are discussed in a surprisingly literate fashion and make for interesting reading. There's something missing here though: Music. There's very little about his musicianship: how he grew as a musician or developed a style. And likewise almost nothing about the music business side of things. You would have thought there would be an interesting story there.

B000002KB8|4.0|First of all, Black Sabbath is probably the only hard-core heavy metal band I like this much. Formed in the late 1960's by four tough, working-class young men with little else going for them, they banded together to forge what was possibly the most copied band of their type in history. They joined the ranks of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in terms of creating something in terms of musical output which can be identified by their own name. Only a few have done this. Originally called \\"Earth,\\" they had a song in their repertoire named after an old Boris Karloff film which became the band's new name, and between 1970 and 1978, they recorded eight impressive albums, each seemingly out to try something new and to redefine themselves.<br /><br />Simply called \\"Black Sabbath,\\" this was the maiden voyage, possibly the first full album-length collection of \\"doom\\" music by one band, packaged in a jacket which also displays a very disturbing photo on the front cover; that's a scary picture, it looks something right out of a gothic European horror film. Recorded on a very small budget with very little studio time at their disposal, this is probably how they sounded on stage in those days, sans some guitar overdubs and one selection's double-tracked vocal. The sound is pure, simple and immediate.<br /><br />Individually, the components of this teaming up are Terry \\"Geezer\\" Butler, a very under-rated bass player, providing a strong, melodic underpinning for the rest of the band to embellish and develop some of the most identifiable rock in modern history. Bill Ward is a strong, solid drummer with, strangely, some light jazz in his drumming technique. He plays lightly where appropriate, and heavily when the music calls for it, always using just the right approach. John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne is probably metal's most famous vocalist, and his vocal delivery is one of the more obvious changeling elements in this band's development. Sometimes sounding callow and undeveloped, sometimes full and accomplished, his voice is immediately recognizable, even though in this record, his vocal delivery is unique in the whole Sabbath canon. It is deep and hollow, a tortured wail which seemed to be specifically developed for this material and this release's artwork. It's more theatrical than melodic, but an ideal tool for this material. Guitarist Tony Iommi, oddly, was an early member of Jethro Tull, and can be seen in Tull's performance on the \\"Rolling Stones' Rock And Roll Circus\\" from December 1968, with the Stones, The Who, Marianne Faithful, Taj Mahal, John Lennon, Mitch Mitchell, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards. Most remarkable for Iommi is the fact that despite losing the tips of two fingers on his fretboard hand in an industrial accident, he became one of the world's most respected guitarists, playing some incredible guitar work, even though a lot of his work here is fairly basic, especially when compared with his later work. But make no mistake, even this is top-notch playing, very solid and deliberate; his solos hard-hitting and pronounced, yet delivering a recognizable melody the whole time.<br /><br />This disc, at least the one I have, scores four stars out of five, not from any lack in good material, but for the sequencing of the selections. The opener, \\"Black Sabbath,\\" is an individual track, as is \\"The Wizard.\\" \\"Wasp\\" is probably the intro to \\"Behind The Wall Of Sleep,\\" which is the third track, but it segues into Butler's bass solo, called \\"Bassically,\\" which then leads right into \\"N.I.B.\\" These are all together on the third track, so if you want to hear \\"N.I.B.,\\" for instance, you have to cue up track three and scan through the two (or three, depending) other selections to find it. On the European release, \\"Evil Woman\\" follows, a cover of the song by a band called Crow, the vocalist sounding eerily similar to Iron Butterfly's Doug Ingle. This particular release skips a track, going into the LP's final medley, \\"Sleeping Village,\\" \\"A Bit Of Finger,\\" and \\"Warning.\\" Again, three separate components are grouped together as one, but to better effect than the earlier example. This version of the disc closes with the original LP's Side Two opener, \\"Wicked World.\\" Substantially lower fidelity plagues this track, but the band's original raw intensity is unadulterated, again probably a very accurate depiction of the band's early live sound. But for some odd reason, it was removed from the original order and placed at the end, damaging the original LP's track listing.<br /><br />These quirks aside, the music contained within is very important to this particular genre, a disc which fans of Black Sabbath's music should listen to, even if they wind up not particularly liking it.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a book that moved me to the core. I hated what I read but I couldn't put the book down. My heart ached for Jaycee from the moment she was abducted until the day of her rescue & beyond. However, I couldn't have been more proud of her if she was my own daughter. No child should have to endure what Jaycee endured. Plus, she became a mother of 2 children while she was still a child herself. She didn't only love her children, she protected them & she educated them when she only had a Grade 5 education. Her strength has to be admired. It should be noted that Jaycee wrote this book without sharing anything in it that can be used to identify her 2 girls. This in itself shows what an amazing mom she is. Anyone reading this book has to admire Jaycee. It's so sad that the community as a whole & the justice system all failed her & although she has every right to be anger & bitter today, she isn't. She shows us all that we can not only survive the impossible but we can rise above it. Reading Jaycee's story also reminds us how important it is to live each day to the fullest because there may not be a tomorrow.     I pray that Phillip & Nancy somehow pay for what they did to Jaycee. It's so difficult to believe that such disgusting & vile people live & are a part of this civilized society.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A well written book. She went through so much, but yet seem to find joy amid so much hardship. She was blessed by two children, I think, that helped give her something to live for while going through so much. While, sometimes it is hard to read, it is good to read to see that she did have some happy times during her time in captivity. She wasn't treated badly the whole time she was away. Don't get me wrong, those people were sick that took her, and she was in horrific conditions most of the time, she did have some happy times during those times that kept her sane. She was able to still learn and teach her children. I couldn't put the book down. I read it all in one day. God bless you, Jaycee! You and your family have gone through so much and yet have remained so strong. You have been blessed to have the support since being found. It is sad that you were let down by the system and it took so long to find you, but now you have your life back and can get on with your lives!

0767827791|4.0|I remember the first time I saw Picnic. I must have been in my preteens but even then I could see the conflicts and such in the characters. Another William Inge masterpiece of his Kansas home and the people. To say he wasn't ahead for his time is sad because he was. In this you have a lady boarder(Betty Field) with two daughters, Madge(Kim Novak)considered beautiful and whom Field is trying her level best to protect, and Millie(Susan Strasberg),a nice sensible girl who is more smarter than she thinks. One of the boarders with Field is middle aged teacher Rosemary Sydney(Rosalind Russell),who feel her ship's passed on. Anyway, William Holden meets these folks when he stops in the town to meet an old college buddy Arthur(Cliff Robertson)who is the local rich boy and courting Madge, who owns the town mill along with his father(Raymond Bailey)to whom Holden has come to town seeking. Instead, he falls for Madge with time and she with him. Miss Sydney, hoping to capture her youth and Holden's eye tries to get with him but he is uninterested, and when he tries to pull away, she rips his shirt and blames him for giving Millie alcohol, when in reality, it was Miss Sydney's boyfriend(Arthur O'Connell)who brought it trying to have a good time. Of course, the conflicts abound, but in the end it ties itself up in a nice bow as all the movies do.

B004XJHBCE|2.0|I went through all the trouble of setting this app up, configuring folders, creating custom shortcuts, setting icons, rearranging my home and all other screens. It definitely made the phone more organized and easier to use without having to hunt for things.    Then fast forward to two days later, none of my shortcuts work, all my assigned labels and folders are empty. My phone is now basically junked up with a bunch of non working shortcuts, infuriating. I'm guessing this app is bugged? Out of nowhere it just forgot all of the stuff that I had configured. I was then left with two options, go through the painstaking process of setting this app up again, or go back to the way it was before. My phone worked just fine before, so I chose option two.    In my opinion this app could be great, but it's definitely not worth investing time or money into when you never know if it will just randomly reset itself.    This app wasted a lot of my time, I wouldn't recommend it.

B005D9MUWY|3.0|Worked decently for the 6 days that I had it. Somewhat intelligent word prediction. I like how the \\"?\\" was on the same screen as the letters so I had quick access to it. After awhile it would always start my new sentences with \\"I \\" which i found a little annoying. It kept doing that no matter how many times i delete it and start a sentence differently. It froze my phone one time during a text so I uninstalled it. It has potential, maybe i'll reinstall after a couple updates.    Stock EVO 3D
B003UCPEJ2|5.0|I was nearly dissuaded from purchasing this set after reading several reviews that complained of flaws and blank discs.  I can now say (after having purchased the set in February) that each and every disc played flawlessly, and spectacularly.  One note: many of the discs had dust and small bits of paper from the cardboard sleeves on them, which if not cleaned off would likely cause a CD player to mistrack or reject the disc entirely.  I cleaned each disc with a microfiber cloth (wiping gently from the center out), and blew into each sleeve to blow out any additional loose dust.  All of this likely was left over from when the cardboard sleeves were cut.      Overall, the recording quality is excellent, not only considering the time period, but in general for any time period.  The slight lack in transparency compared to the best modern recordings is more than compensated for by the warmth and vibrancy of the sound.  As another reviewer pointed out, the low end in particular is surprisingly full and even.  Even within the period these recordings were made, improvements in recording technique were made to the extent that there is a discernible difference between the mid 50's and early 60's recordings.      The performances on the whole, are of course legendary, and for good reason.  It's a great starting point for anyone with a minimal or scattershot classical collection, although the casual buyer should take note of the large quantity of opera in the set, which of course could either be a positive or negative consideration depending on one's preferences.    The price of the set has increased since I purchased it, and I imagine it won't be available for too long.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|One of the best CG movies to come out ranks in the top with How to train your Dragon and Toy Story 3.  Fun Beautiful and to bad Disney didn't get this movie instant classic...
B001NY42KQ|5.0|The HSM series is kind of young, but always an upbeat way to raise your mood. HSM 3 is the most mature of the 3 movies and brings to a close a great, sweet story that grew up before our eyes, and is forever in our memory about first love and the innocence that fades as we get older. It reminds the older viewer of days of glory and revisits the memories of past joys of the end of childhood, at the threshhold of adulthood. The extended version of HSM 3 gives you interviews and insights into the cast and how close they became over the course of the three movies, and even make you shed a tear at their final scene shooting, taking in all of their tears and hugs. Great finish to a great series, and a fine video.

I don't see what purpose the vivid torture descriptions serve.  I think torture can be alluded to and still make the point.  Really disappointed with this book.  So much so that I've given up on the series.
B003WTE886|5.0|I was very excited to get this cd. I was going to buy it in the store, but i realized it was just as cheap on amazon. As soon as i received the cd i listened to it nonstop. In just a few days i knew every word to every song. It is a great cd for anyone who likes country or pop music. It was worth every penny. If you are a Taylor fan, this cd is a must have. I love every song on the cd, but my favorite is \\"speak now\\". Other favorites of mine are haunted, mean, sparks fly, and better than revenge.
B0057A6GA6|3.0|This is a decent, rather by-the-numbers tower defense game. Main twist is that throughout each level the zombies will repeatedly alter the routes they take.    Graphics are alright, though the lack of any animations for your projectiles is a little off-putting. It's a little hard even to tell that the slower towers like the cannon are doing anything at times.    Main problem I'd say is that the easy modes are easy, while the hard modes are mainly a grind. On hard, you can't possibly beat the harder levels on the first try, since you have to know where the zombies are coming from in advance to know where to put your towers. So you die once or twice, remember the pattern, and replay, which isn't exactly scintillating gameplay.
1401300529|4.0|I read this book on my Kindle.    Previously, I had read Halberstam's Best and Brightest and found it riveting. He was a gifted writer, that is certain. In Coldest Winter, the book is full of character development that is perhaps unrivalled in such a relatively short  amount of space. Halberstam's descriptions of some of the early battles in Korea are also extremely well done. He properly put Douglas McArthur and his sycophantic general officers in their proper place in history, and he treated Harry Truman with the great respect that Truman deserves,    However excellent prose is, Halberstam had the Vietnam War wrong, quite wrong, and in Coldest WInter he takes some gratuitous shots at both Vietnam and Iraq. He was certainly entitled to his political opinions - or any opinions - though he presented them as facts that we should all embrace; and they are not facts, they are his astonishingly inaccurate conclusions. I am sorry we lost Halberstam; he was a talented writer, and perhaps he eventually would have come to know the error of his ways. I highly recommend this book for those who think McArthur was a great soldier and for those who want to understand more about the start of the Korean War.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|This is an album you can listen to start to finish the 1st of its kind in my opinion, she wasn't trying to be like anyone else but herself. 5 STAR POWER
1400064287|4.0|Overall Assessment:<br /><br />I can vote this book four stars because, despite its defects, I have already verified its effectiveness in my own teaching and research--even before I read the book! And in fact the book actually does a good job, for the most part, of getting its message across using the very rules of the SUCCES model it is articulating: \\"Sticky\\" ideas tend to have the attributes of:<br /><br />Simplicity<br />Unexpectedness<br />Concreteness<br />Credibility<br />Emotion<br />Stories<br /><br />Key for readers is to understand the importance of how these rules help overcome \\"The curse of knowledge\\", illustrated beautifully by the cited research example in which \\"tappers\\" were amazed that \\"listeners\\" could not discern the tunes the former were composing using taps, because they of course already had the tune clearly in their head and could not grasp their listener's lack of frame of reference. The key thing we must do when trying to communicate a topic we thoroughly understand to a neophyte audience is pare messages down to basic cores and give them the attributes of the SUCCES model to make them \\"sticky\\"--or so the Heath brother say.<br /><br />Again, the authors in each chapter did a nice job of applying the very rules they articulate while in the act of articulating those rules.<br /><br />IChapter 1 (\\"Simple\\")<br /><br /> They provide the excellent examples of \\"Commander's Intent\\" employed by the military to simplify operational instructions for battlefield units confronted with the fact that \\"No plan survives contact with the enemy;\\" paring down the '92 Clinton campaign message to \\"It's the economy stupid;\\" following the generally applicable rule in journalism of not \\"burying the lead\\"; the \\"a bird in the hand\\" metaphor and its multinational variations; Hollywood high-concept pitches such as Alien being \\"Jaws in Space\\", the use of \\"generative analogies\\" such as \\"staff as cast members\\" at Disneyland.<br /><br />Chapter 2 (\\"Unexpected\\").<br /><br />People pay attention when something is counterintuitive. I was pleased that I had been instinctively using this principle in my teaching. The \\"gap theory\\" of curiosity posits that \\"gaps\\" in our understanding of the world (mysteries) create a need for resolution in the mind of the audience. Sticky ideas play to this crucial aspect of human nature.<br /><br />Chapter 3 (\\"Concrete\\")<br /><br />Specific, concrete ideas (\\"''60 Chevy\\") are stickier than more general and abstract ones (\\"American automotive engineering\\"), so concrete examples and references help ideas stick. Making an idea sticky means exploiting the \\"Velcro theory\\" of memory: Memory is like Velcro, with loops that enable a concept to attach to it, and different constituents of our memory have more loops to which an idea might be attached. Concrete ideas have more loops.<br /><br />(I was less pleased with the Heath Brothers' use of the example of Jane Elliot, who famously used the blue-eye/brown-eye distinction among her students to illustrate the power of arbitrary bias. To me it was a concrete example of overeager progressivism degenerating into an unethical psychic assault on children.)<br /><br />(Chapter 4: \\"Credible\\")<br /><br />Obviously, support from real authorities can make an idea stickier if people believe it has expert corroboration (e.g. \\"97 percent of researchers whose specialty is climate science agree with the conclusions presented by the IPCC\\"). However, an idea can have \\"internal credibility\\" if it contains little concrete details that make it seem real (like the various renditions of the urban legend of the boyfriend murdered and scraping his lifeless foot on the roof of the car to be discovered by discovered by his horrified date; people always place it in their home county!).  Another way to make an idea credible is to put it in a comprehensible scale. Statistics require comparative referents that make sense to people (you're more likely to be killed by a deer than a shark--which alsohas counterintuitiveness). There is the Sinatra Test of credibility: one impressive factual achievement means the product can \\"make it anywhere\\". Another example is the \\"testable credential\\", such as Ronald Reagan asking if you are better off four years ago than you are today.<br /><br />(Chapter 5: \\"Emotional\\")<br /><br />No surprises here, and again it pleased me to note I was using this technique if not explicitly. And one of the best emotional appeals is self-interest: (\\"Acting on climate change now could save our ass.\\") An interesting discussion to come out of this is that Maslow's hierarchy of needs might not be a correct model in the sense of recognizing a set order in which those needs are met. Different appeals can be successful by appealing to different components of the hierarchy (e.g. you might be able to appeal to someone better at actualization level even if some \\"lower\\" level need might seem like the likely target.) Examples of emotional appeals to get kids to appreciate the importance of math with near slam-dunk application of the SUCCESS model: \\"Never. You will never use this again. But Math is mental weight training.\\"<br /><br />(Chapter 6: \\"Stories\\")<br /><br />Yet again having used this in my own research and teaching it's a sense of vindication to see it recommended. Obviously, memorable anecdotes stick better than dry recitation of dreary numbers and arguments.<br /><br />Minor Critique:<br /><br />All this is great food for thought for those of us trying to articulate something we think is \\"true\\" to the world, but I do have a couple of reservations, and I do not guarantee that their articulation conforms to the SUCCES model:<br /><br />First, taken to an extreme, the SUCCES model makes communicators slaves to the psychology, emotionalism, simplemindedness, and laziness of the audience. Neil Postman's *Amusing Ourselves to Death* discusses the degeneration of American culture from the days of a highly literate populous in the early republic tothe modern discordant hash of electronic sound bites. For example, while the Heath brothers lauded the Clinton campaign's successful employment of \\"It's the economy, stupid,\\" as a keen adaptation to James Carville's admonition that \\"If you say three things, you say nothing,\\" I more lament that power in our democracy is so easily won and lost on such paltry turns of phrase.<br /><br />Second, some really important things just might be inherently un-sticky, and maybe sometimes the best way to make something stick is to communicate it to a strictly qualified and interested audience, or warn an unqualified an uninterested in advance: \\"Look. This is tedious and boring. But it's still very important. Pay attention.\\" The current deficit reduction debate is an example in which sticky but grotesquely distorting clich&eacute;s like, \\"on the backs of the elderly and sick\\", or \\"no more taxes on the American people,\\" or \\"tax breaks for the rich,\\" and so on are thrown around willy-nilly, and more often than not, stick.<br /><br />At some point we as an audience consuming ideas need to see what's sticking to us and why--and ask whether we need to get ourselves disentangled and be open first to the truth, not stickiness.

This is this first study bible i have had so i can't compare it to other study bibles, but i like the ESV translation and now i can't imagine using anything else. The book introductions are great, and along with the color maps, figures and verse notes, this bible answers all my questions. I have wanted to read the bible cover to cover for some time now, but with little understanding of historical context, geography etc never got very far. This bible makes it easy to read and understand the word. Enjoy

0802473156|5.0|For all the 1-2-3 star reviewed people, we all get caught up in life.  It's the moments you take to realize what you are neglecting.  I train quite a bit in my profession and guess what, yes it takes 13 chapters to not only explain but provide concrete examples and explanations to make it stick and have people grasp the concept.  I guess the low star reviewers are perfect...but hey if you're so perfect why did you read the book cause your marriages must be perfect too right?    This book is the BGO moment - Blinding Glimpse of the Obvious.  But guess what it shows the chinks in our armor and how to correct for those.  Of course it doesnt take 100% of life factors in, but those get intertwined into the concepts.  Great book, great read on 2 flights this week and gee well worth the $8 I spent.    Most people spend that on 2 Starbucks while complaining the whole time that their marriage stinks.  If you have any rumblings in your relationship, its worth a few hours and a few bucks to get a different perspective.

0618680004|2.0|Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics, once spoke to fellow scientists on the value of science. Had Mr. Dawkins been as smart as Mr. Feynmann, or had he been wise enough to listen and learn, he might not have written this book. Feynman said \\"I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy--and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he will sound as naive as anyone untrained in the matter.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins is just as dumb as the next guy. He has degrees in science, not theology. His knowledge of religion is the same, possibly less, than that of most religious people. He hasn't really studied the subject and is proud of the fact that he hasn't, since he doesn't believe there is anything real to study. This reminds me of Steven Wright's joke that he wasn't going to pay his electric bill because he hadn't seen any electricity. We would hardly give credence to someone who, without studying science, wrote a book saying that the belief in genetics is nonsense.<br /><br />Believing oneself correct, in the absence of actual knowledge, is an act of faith.<br /><br />Dawkins is dishonest. He describes as a \\"robust but humorous broadside\\" his infamous paragraph describing the God of the Hebrew Bible -- worshiped in various ways and degrees by perhaps 3.5 billion people -- as \\"unjust,\\" \\"vindictive,\\" \\"malevolent,\\" \\"racist,\\" \\"bloodthirsty,\\" and more. If Mr. Dawkins considers this language \\"humorous\\" then he is a fool. I prefer to think he is a liar -- too cowardly to admit that his words are incendiary. Were someone to refer to his wife or his writing with equal vitriol, I doubt he would find it humorous.<br /><br />Dawkins is illogical. He has set up a straw man -- selecting to debate, not the wisest of religious philosophers, but the least wise. He would have been defeated in the first moments by a clearer definition of God -- something I learned in a philosophy of religion course nearly fifty years ago. Showing that God is not Zeus or Jupiter or Ra does not disprove the existence of God, only the errors of humans seeking to represent that which is supremely worthy of worship. Leading scientists once believed that the Earth was the center of the universe. It now appears they were quite wrong. Nevertheless, the countless errors of earlier scientists are not grounds for saying science is nonsense.<br /><br />Dawkins hopes to strengthen his case by finding others who agree with him, at least in part. But whether Einstein believed or not is irrelevant. The logical fallacy is called argumentum ad verecundiam -- using the opinion of an authority to prove something. Einstein is an authority -- in science, not in religion. Newton, who was both, said \\"Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind that it never had many professors.\\" Newton may be right about the view of most people regarding atheists, but even his well-informed opinion does not prove the existence of God or the senselessness of atheism. Interesting quotations are the high point of the book. They don't prove his case.<br /><br />The most serious condemnation of this poorly reasoned book by an ill-mannered and uninformed rabble-rouser is that he claims to be a scientist, but has an attitude that is distinctly unscientific. The proper attitude of a scientist is uncertainty. If we believe we know, we need look no further. The pretense of certainty, which surely characterizes Dawkins' writing, dooms us to stop thinking, stop listening, stop learning.<br /><br />Dr. Samuel Johnson offered an opinion suited to this book: \\"Your manuscript is both good and original.

I listened to it from start to finish and of course I'm very impressed. Here I Am, drips sexiness and a straight adult album. Even though I didn't care for the lead single, the rest of the album is highly on point. The only thing I wished she would have done was include Grown Woman on the album. Some of the highlights are, 'Work It Man', 'Feeling Me Right Now', 'All of the Night', and 'Down for whatever'. Besides the many people who will be comparing this album to Beyonce's 4, Kelly is in a lane all her own. Keep motivating us Kelly, I'll keep listening!

I also tend to favor relationships with older characters just so I can bypass the foolishness that often destroys coupledom, but again the book was so good that it made me look at young love in a new light. I went through the ups and downs of Abby's and Travis' relationship, laughing when they laughed, crying when they cried (sometimes crying even when they didn't). I swear, it reminded me of The Notebook because I haven't seen a match so perfect since I first watched that movie. Simply put this book is well worth the five dollars. Take the time to read this. I promise that it will make you yearn for a love that was as complicated, tumultuous, and as right as theirs. *A little advice for the slow readers: you may want to wait till the weekend to indulge. It took me two days and I was ready to pass out from exhaustion after staying up till 5:30 that first night.
B004KWVDWI|4.0|Franklin Schaffner's 1973 film dramatizes the life of Henri \\"Papillon\\" Charriere and his incarceration and attempts at escape from French Guiana's notorious offshore prison Devil's Island.  There's an unusual sense of confinement and open space in the structure of this story and the visual elements of the film itself.  Masterful editing creates a sense of time dilation that in turn invokes a feeling of despair and fatigue that hungers for escape and release.  And freedom.<br /><br />We are Charriere.  Steve McQueen is great as he endures seemingly endless trials, betrayals tortures and treacheries and we resonate with his angry, taunting cries of \\"I'm still here, you bastards.\\"  In McQueen's face and body, he embeds and imbues the resilience and dignity of the human spirit to be free and survive.  It is a magnificent performance that is wholly different but similar to his character in THE GREAT ESCAPE.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman steals scenes with his Louis Dega character, but it is McQueen that burns our eyes and hearts.
0553801473|5.0|First I want to say that I wish the plot had moved forward more than it did.  However, I absolutely loved almost every chapter in the book.  His writing has never been better.
0316098329|5.0|This book promised( via reviews on amazon) to be a good story and a great read. It lived up to the reviews for sure. Although some parts of the book may be distrubing to some, the whole of the story is one of strength and hope. Read it, you wont be sorry you did!
1572816295|4.0|\\"Playing\\" with the Paulina Tarot deck may take you to another dimension, as the art on the cards is fabulous! I just want to study, search and re-search the images to see how much more there is to see. Each card shows lots of movement, with swirls, stars, circles, and dots. The colors are muted, but still quite colorful. I would love to see the original, larger artwork used for the production of these cards.The instruction booklet gives a brief, but concise meaning for each card and does show reversed meanings. I don't know how I would choose a \\"favorite\\" card, as they are all gorgeous! Highly recommended to anyone who loves watercolor images, fairies, make-believe and movement. The cards are easily handled as they are 4 3/4\\" X 2 5/8\\".
1594744769|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a uniquely creative book based around a series of antique photographs. The quirky paranormal/time-travel tale will appeal to many fantasy and science fiction fans, but the sheer strangeness of the story will put others off.<br /><br />I loved the pictures and the way the story was obviously built around them. What's truly impressive is that these pictures aren't edited. They're authentic, vintage photographs and most are completely weird. They're pictures that are begging to have their stories told and Ransom Riggs puts forth a fine effort in making them more than a bunch of strange images.<br /><br />I couldn't get into this story, no matter how much the premise and photos appealed to me. It's an odd story about odd children in an odd place. I enjoy quirky, but it went beyond that into something too out there and jumbled for me. The story was darker than I expected and I found it to be sort of depressing. The characters were fascinating, but some of them didn't quite mesh with the sideshow freak thing the book already had going for it. Levitation, super-strength and even invisibly fit the story, but I quickly lost interest once we moved onto shapeshifters with time travel abilities and people who ate with the back of their heads.<br /><br />I didn't love Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, but I didn't hate it either. I wouldn't read it again, but I would recommend it to certain people. The book wasn't quite my thing, which sort of surprised me, but I can totally appreciate it's appeal to others. Fox has the movie rights already and I'm wouldn't be surprised if this is one of those novels that works better for me on the big screen than in print.
B004XQO90E|4.0|Director Duncan Jones (he's David Bowie's son) makes every second count in this sci-fi thriller that reminds us of the momentous import of being present in the moments of our life.  There is no future, there is no past - it's only the present that matters.  In a way, this is a Zen film because it's really about tapping into the precious present moments as life skims by.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga star in this critically acclaimed mind-bender that focuses on a soldier who wakes up in the body of an unknown man only to realize he's part of a mission to identify the bomber of a commuter train barreling into a Chicago station.<br /><br />The DVD and Blu-ray are packed with excellent bonus features including a fine audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, director Jones and writer Ben Ripley.  I was spellbound by this provocative tale and found the commentary from scientific experts regarding time travel most intriguing.<br /><br />Be here now.  It's the only dance there is.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|I don't have much to say right now, but I'm going to be honest. This is one of the greatest albums I've ever owned or listened to. I understand that many people think that it's overrated and dull, but musical taste is subjective and if you like something, never let anyone change your ideas or preferences.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|Alright... to be honest, I'm more of a techno/industrial kind of guy. The softest I tend to get is the bebop era of jazz, though I'd be hard pressed to say I don't enjoy watching the quirky VIDEOS of Ok Go.<br /><br />That said, I really loved listening to this album. It doesn't really have any singles with catchy (or commercialized) hooks, but the seemingly delicate arrangements feel authentic and pleasing.<br /><br />There was just something about the piercing vocals and atonal harmonies on all of the tracks that immediately pulled me in... not to mention to not quite surf rock, not quite indie feel of the instrumentation... together they made something reminiscent to me of Tom Petty, The Beatles and The Shins (I know I'll get tons of flack for making those comparisons, but I'm being completely honest that they both came to mind while listening to the tracks).<br /><br />Standouts to me on the album were Blue Beard and Dilly.<br /><br />Pick it up at your leisure, but definitely add it to your collection.
0061784788|5.0|This is exactly what I've come to expect from the Sigma Force novels and it really doesn't disappoint (except that Lisa doesn't really appear at all, and poor Grey just can't win...very sad parts for him).<br /><br />There is fantastic action, wonderful character development.  Lots of last minute danger and down to the wire action.<br /><br />One nice thing about this one is that it has a predominantly Native American theme with a positively fascinating idea about an ancient civilization of \\"white Indians/lost tribe of Isreal\\" that traveled over long ago and rebuilt their own little temple of Solomon in which they created a dangerous nanotech that could consume the world.  (gray sludge theory is what I'm familiar with hearing it called)  There are also modern day Natives, nods to older cultures, and an explanation for the mysterious disappearance of the Aztecs.  Plots by Jefferson, Lewis (of Lewis and Clark) and others are also invoked.  Special materials, lost processes, and other ideas are all invoked.<br /><br />And we start to see the glimmer of a lot deeper into the Guild (nemesis of Sigma) and its ancient history as well as a much more embracing modern plot that I can only assume we'll see more of in the following book.  While this novel certainly stands alone, it's definitely seeking to advance the Sigma Force plot.<br /><br />Just in case you've never read a Rollins novel, he excels so well at his research, alternate history, and plausible sounding science (most of it borrowed from current ongoing and often little known true science).  His character development is engaging and there is hardly ever a dull minute.  He's an excellent author with only a few misses, and this certainly is not one of them.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|How boring?  I forgot I saw it in a theater with a Potter fan. She wanted to go to the first showing of part 2 so I thought I would catch up. Don't bother.  You didn't miss anything important.
B001AQT0OU|4.0|Shot in just over 300 days, mostly in Ireland, Stanley Kubrick's 1975 adaptation of William Makepeace Thackery's picaresque 1844 novel is as other-worldly as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSY.  Somewhat dismissed when it was first released, it now holds a far more respected place in the best 100 lists of film critics and film fans.  Martin Scorsese names it as his favorite Kubrick film.  It certainly is mine.  The story is about how Irish lad Redmond Barry became English nobleman Barry Lyndon.  But it's not so much the plot or the episodic adventure as it is the world in which it unfolds.<br /><br />Kubrick wanted the film to be as perfect a mirror of its 18th century setting as possible.  He studied the landscape paintings of the era, especially those Watteau and Gainsborough.  He is said to have special camera lenses ground that could photograph natural lighting not only on exterior locations but also interior sets lit by candles to better evoke the era.<br /><br />The resulting film, now transferred to Blu-ray, is exquisite. John Alcott's extraordinary cinematography must be seen on a big hi-def display to fully appreciate this vivid, eerie, ethereal, lucid dream of a movie that only gets better with age and repeated viewings.  The disc has no extras.  It would be nice, but the movie is more than enough.<br /><br />Gaze into this shimmering mirror of another time and place.  It will take you away...
B002N5N4MG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a great show with a huge quantity of fun. you can laugh hours with this crew and Sheldon's theorys. This box have a great quality of sound and image, with the best price of the market that we can only find here on Amazon.com
B004EPZ06G|4.0|This film may be similar to the first one, but I don't mind that, as the first Hangover was one of the best comedies I'd seen in years.  It may not have been as good, but it still was a pleasure to watch and had plenty of funny moments.  Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis steal the show, and Bradley Cooper is very good as well.  There was one scene that totally made me almost cry laughing...but I'll let you find out for yourself.  It might have been a little dirtier than the first one, but not by much.  Paul Giamatti makes an appearance, as does Mike Tyson, but Tyson is only in the last scene.  Overall, a great comedy, but the bar was set pretty high from the first one, and it doesn't quite measure up, but still is worth a watch as it is much better than most comedies out there.
1400052181|5.0|The book looked brand new when it got to my house. It looked as though I had gotten it from Barnes & Noble or a similar kind of store. I was very happy with my purchase.
1250004349|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment. I was attracted to the theme: the round-up of Jews by the French police in 1942 and its emotional, moral, and political impact on our lives today.  I was also interested in seeing how de Rosnay would deal with the two narrations: the historical one with the young girl, Sara, and the today story with Julia, an American journalist in Paris who uncovers her tragic story.     The Vel d'Hiv roundup is a touchy, volatile subject that needs a talented writer to do it justice, someone who knows how to build strong characters that live and breathe. If not, we won't be able to understand the different ways in which people react in a traumatic situation such as this. And it needs a good writer to keep the story moving while sneaking in the history with which many readers may not be familiar. We don't want cardboard characters yakety-yaking about history, going on and on about what happened. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.     Truth be told: Tatiana de Rosnay is a weak writer. Her characters are spineless, their emotions are empty, the writing is full of clichés. There is not an original thought or phrase to make the reading worthwhile. I stuck with it until the historical narration with Sara was over, mid-way, even though that part of the story is poorly executed too. De Rosnay puts thoughts into the girl's head that a ten-year-old simply wouldn't think. Nonetheless, I was willing to go along with it, clenching my teeth at the triteness of the today-story, because I was interested in finding out how the author would resolve the historical narration. But, as I say, the moment Sara's story was resolved, and it looked like she wasn't going to come back, there was not enough to keep me going. I found myself skipping ahead and then, I finally just put the book down. I don't have time to read poorly-executed stories that do not know how to reach the heart and mind of intelligent readers. I was reading it on vacation and I decided Iwon't take it home with me. I haven't decided yet if I'll leave it here in the vacation rental. Clearly, many people liked the book and it may find other readers, so maybe I'll just leave it here in the bookcase. I don't understand how readers can connect to these cardboard characters, but, well, that's the nature of the beast called Novel, I suppose. Sigh.    Oh, and another thing: I do NOT think that teenagers or young adults should read this book. Primarily because the adult narratror, Julia, is so terribly trite and her story so shallow. WHy should teenagers read that? And secondly, it doesn't do the theme emotional justice. Young people interested in the holocaust can read other books. The Book Thief, for example -- an extremely heartfelt book
B004UXUXGE|5.0|Werner Herzog takes his curiosity and 3-D camera down into France's Chauvet Caverns to ponder the transcendent beauty, mystery and meaning of humankind's oldest known art (and the mother of all graffiti).  Along the way, we ponder some of the big questions of who we are, how we got here and what it means to create.  But mostly this amazing, meditative film is about touching the past and finding the present.  It's a mystery that is worthy of embrace because it is us.
B004Y1USRG|4.0|First, the facts.  I didn't buy \\"Fly From Here\\" because I'm a huge YES fan.  I bought it because it was being released on vinyl (record collector) and the price was right.  I also didn't know that Jon Anderson was no longer in YES.  If I did, I wouldn't have bought it.  I haven't paid full price for a YES release since I was in the 8th grade and that was 1983's 90125.  Everything after that was bought from a cut out bin, on cassette or free.  In other words, I didn't jump for joy at the thought of a new YES release.  Now for the review.  The LP is dead quiet and sounds fantastic.  If you have a decent turntable with a decent cartridge you can't go worng with the vinyl release.  My only gripe is that it should (like most new LP releases) come with a code for a MP3 download of the album.  Side one sounds like typical pre 80's YES.  Yes the new singer sounds a bit like Anderson but to my ears its not over the top.  Which makes it YES 2011.  Side two is all together different from side one and at times seperates itself from the typical YES sound. \\"Life On A Film Set\\" reminds me of ELP.  Overall all its a welcome addition to the YES catalog.  I mentioned that if I knew Anderson was no longer in YES I wouldn't have bought it.  That would have been a mistake.
B003UESJFG|5.0|My wife and son saw this in the theater when it was out and both of them really liked it.  We decided to buy the movie when it came out on Blu Ray.  I am a huge fan of the combo packs that include the DVD as well.  My wife and son did not steer my wrong with this one.  This was a very good movie and an excellent story.  I put this one right up there with the best of the Pixar movies.
0061730335|5.0|The book is fast reading and very interesting as a depiction of African life in a third-world country which includes famine, poor national leadership, poor healthcare, lack of educational opportunities, crooked government workers.  It is written in a simple style, and the story carries you right along.  I loved reading about William and wish him luck in all his efforts.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Simply the greatest Gorillaz album, and maybe even one of the the best albums ever made. I got this CD back when i was about 7 years old, when it 1st came out, and i would listen to it all the time. One day i dropped the case and had to put the front back on but it was all scratched and even though the cd was fine i bought another one and its still rapped in the plastic it comes in thats how much i love this CD. Gorillaz has to be the best band ever or possibly tying with daft punk. I also liked the game/video that came on the CD when it was put in a computer.
0553805371|5.0|I have been researching the fields of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics for a couple years now so I have \\"some\\" background knowledge. I read this book, in one day, and thoroughly enjoyed it! If you have been away from the field of science for a couple years along with an interest in space, then this book is for you. I'd say about half the book is bringing up and explaining phenomena that have been discovered up to this day: double-slit experiment, interference, gravity, ect. The authors do a great job of crediting the `inventors' of these scientific theories and refreshing the reader. The way they bring the theories together is spot on as well. They use a lot of simple metaphors to convey messages that even a teenager could understand - so don't feel that you will be overwhelmed when you read it.    If your very familiar with these topics and are hoping to gain some vast knowledge from this book - its probably not for you!     On a side note, there is more humor in it than expected which was great! And the cartoons/pictures are pretty cool.
1433502410|5.0|I have owned, at different times, these Study Bibles:  the Harper-Collins NRSV (the required study bible for the intro OT and NT courses at my mainline seminary); the NIV; the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible (which unfortunately is no longer published); the ESV Reformation Study Bible; and the ESV Study Bible.  With the exception of the Harper-Collins Study Bible, I would recommend all of them, but for me the ESV Study Bible is the best.  I found the quality (meaning binding, page and print quality) of the hardcover edition to be excellent (although I note many other reviewers had a different experience), especially for the price.  This Study Bible has the most comprehensive notes, outlines and articles of any of the study bibles I have owned.  It is virtually a commentary in itself.<br /><br />As many reviewers have noted, the theological perspective is heavily conservative and leans Calvinistic (which I personally like), but the contributors are careful scholars who have obviously placed a great deal of thought and study into their arguments.  In other words, you may not agree with all of their conclusions, but I do not believe they are not arrived at carelessly or hastily.  I appreciate the combination of careful scholarship with a commitment to the inerrancy of Scripture.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|After such a hiatus from releasing new material, I feel Morbid Angel have finally grown their wings to fly! The blast beats, and death metal scene have grown way OLD. Morbid Angel were smart enought to realize this, and produced an angry, chaotic, metal, recording that should stand the test of time, unlike most of their previous releases. The haters are definetly coming out to bash this, but I feel those are the ones still listening to bands that do nothing but blast beats and cookie monster vocals. The song 10 more dead is all about YOU!
B004S5C8WG|3.0|I am a Jeffrey Archer fan from way back and he always spins a very entertaining tale. But this book definitely left me feeling disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed most of the story, but it was almost as if Mr Archer ran out of ideas and wanted to finish it quickly as the last few chapters of this novel were very disappointing and the ending was an anti-climactic semi-cliff hanger. It leaves me thinking that there must be another book to follow as there are so many loose ends? Please put me out of my misery Jeffrey and write another book to follow! :)
B002VJ0576|5.0|Wasn't sure I would like this version but.....it didn't SUCK. The actor who portrayed Sherlock Holmes seemed miscast at first, seriously who could EVER fill Basil Rathbone's shoes, but he grew on me as the movie progressed. Same with Dr. Watson. It was nice to see him portrayed as someone who wasn't quite the 'buffoon' that Nigel Bruce played it.<br /><br />Although the story line was simply implausible, a dinosaur, giant octopus, fire breathing dragon and a robot woman, wreaking havoc on London all in the name of REVENGE...the movie was non-the-less VERY entertaining. The acting is what made it worth watching. It left me hoping there would be another movie in the making. Not sure what they could come up with the next time though. I'd say it was worth your time to buy this and give it a go.
1423389387|4.0|This review is for the unabridged audio version, which is 43 hours long.  I listened to it in my car while commuting to/from work, and it provided several weeks of entertainment.<br /><br />To put this in perspective, I listened to this book without having read/heard the first one.  So, perhaps my viewpoint would be different, or maybe I would have gotten something different from this story, had I known the original story.<br /><br />For the most part, I really enjoyed this story.  I've always prefered fantasy books, so this was right up my alley.  I thought it started a bit slow, but once it got into Kvothe's back story after about an hour, I really got drawn in.  I liked the story about his time at the university and his adventures.  I began to care about the character and what happened to him and his friends.  I thought that the characters were developed well, and the reader did a good job with the voices (at least, I could tell who was supposed to be talking).<br /><br />After several hours of enjoyment, though, I thought that the quality of the story declined near the end.  It seemed like the details started to be more sparse and the story felt more shallow and rushed.  It wasn't so bad that it ruined the experience for me, but it did seem like the author got tired of writing near the end.  The ending left me hanging and feeling unfulfilled (perhaps because I don't know the original story).  Hence, I didn't love it and took away one star.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend it, though.  Ending aside, I got over 40 hours of enjoyment from this and enjoyed my commute much more for those weeks.
0553801473|1.0|I never write reviews, but this book just made my blood boil. I defended GRRM many times for being 5 years late with this book, after all, good writing takes it time. So I expected a good book, with plot you know? Instead I got an overly expensive travelguide for a country I have no chance ever visiting, what a rip-off! The Bran, Davos and Arya chapters are phenomenal, but too few to save this book from all the horrible Dany-chapters. And worst of all, George has turned Tyrion into a boring character, or he has at least written utterly boring chapters about him.<br /><br />What is most frustrating though: all this drivel could have been written in a single year, only predictable things happen and most of the story is about the scenery. What has he been up to? Meereenese knot? I don't see it. God, how I wish he just had inserted the 5 year gap. All the last chapters of the POV characters in AFFC and ADWD are great (except for Dany of course, who had 1 good chapter in this book thanks to Strong Belwas(and Tyrion actually doesn't have a last chapter!)).<br /><br />George RR Martin, I defended you, but now you have called me a sockpuppet for writing a bad review on Amazon. Because only sockpuppets and detractors write bad reviews anonymously on the internet! Screw that, you just keep thinking you're the American Tolkien. I have joined the ranks of GRRuMblers and urge everyone to only buy this book when the series is done, perhaps then it will have its charm.
B003MXJV66|5.0|Bought BOS in 74 right after graduating, and it sounds the best on the original vinyl. Im not a big fan of the digital remastering, it takes that depth and feel away. So much energy in this vinyl recording still blows me away today. It is my NUMBER ONE, when i die its going with me. THANK YOU ROBIN TROWER!!! Nobody better, never ever.
1401229921|5.0|as an illustrator myself i was completely blown away with all the pencil detail that went into this! (not taking anything away from Scott Williams or alex sinclair-the inkist & colorist) but its truly amazing to see each page and each panel come to life with the mighty pencil...if your into drawing comics and take it serious,then you should DEFF buy this book....or if your just a huge batman fan,then this will also be up your alley! (WORTH THE PURCHASE!)
0446615625|4.0|I wanted to start at the beginning of the Camel Club to make sure I didn't miss anything. I really enjoyed this book.  \\"Oliver Stone\\" and the rest of the Camel Club are great characters, and I enjoyed learning about them in this book.  The plot itself was quite convoluted and at times not particularly believable.  But I have to say it kept my interest, which is all I really ask of an action/adventure/thriller novel. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
0470474874|5.0|I finally got this book and I am indubitably impressed. This book has so far refreshed everything that I have already learned and then taken me to new levels of Excel mastery. The book builds on key functions and charts, graphs, from previous versions along with Microsoft 2010. I love it and I will certainly buy another from this author and this particular series. I'm very happy and I am looking forward to delving deeper into the book. The table of contents alone is pretty impressive to me, highly recommended for any user of Excel looking to advance, from beginner to advanced, you will be surprised by what you didn't know and will learn with this comprehensive book.

0307460444|3.0|I think this book was good for ideas as to different types of cupcakes and decorations, but I feel like I will have to tinker with the recipes. Most of the cupcakes I've tried to make have come out denser than I would have liked, and I'm not a fan of some of the glazes/frostings as I found them too be too cloyingly sweet.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I think the the 360 controller is a far superior model and shape. So I went looking for a PS3 shaped version of that and found the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.    It works great 90% of the time and have little complain about. if I were to nit pick I have three things.    - I can't turn on my PS3 using this controller's home button.  - every once in a blue moon is loses its connection and I freeze in game until it establishes a connection again.  - It uses a USB dongle that just looks lame sticking out of my PS3.    Overall rating A-
B0056NYMXC|5.0|This album is much better than her previous solo efforts, though her previous albums did really well outside the US markets. \\"Commander\\" was a huge success in Europe and I am so glad the popularity spreads to the dance music fans here as well. Back to the album, her voice matures very well and she has found her niche without compromising each tracks' quality.<br />From \\"I'm Dat Chick\\" to \\"Turn It Up\\" , \\"All Of The Night\\" and finishing with \\"Each Other\\", I must say I am proud that finally Kelly has step up to be one of the few to watch out for in 2011/2012.<br />Commander Kelly is back!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Let me tell you first that we LOVE movies. We watch at least 1 movie per night at home, so we know to evaluate a good vs. a bad quality movie.  About RIO, we went to see this movie TWICE at the movies, that's how good it is!!!  Now we can't wait to own it on DVD/ Blu-ray, even if it's a bit pricey. It's an excellent movie, very entertaining for kids, as well as for parents. My kids (and us) loved it!  I highly recommend this movie to you.
0553801473|2.0|This was just monumentally disappointing to me. I had such high hopes for this because I thought the reason I didn't really care for A Feast for Crows was that none of my favorite characters were featured. But no, it's because nothing important happened and no secrets were revealed. Turns out it's ten times worse when all of your favorite characters are doing nothing. I wish I could've been Martin's editor so I could have him lay out what happens and then give him a maximum number of chapters for each. For example (and I don't think I'm really spoiling anything, but I will hit plot points here, so be warned):<br /><br />Dany - discovering the difficulties of ruling and controlling monstrous dragons: 2-3 chapters, potentially 4 (this takes 10, with another 8 dedicated to her storyline)<br />Jon - letting the wildlings come south of the Wall and earning the ire of the Night's Watch: Four chapters (13)<br />Tyrion - merry misadventures across the Narrow Sea that ultimately have no real consequences: Three? Maybe? (12)<br />Theon - pain and realizing the error of his ways: Three should suffice (6)<br />Davos - getting a new mission: Two or three (3 - success!)<br />Bran - learning the extent of his abilities: Between two and eight depending on how detailed you want to get. Oh, not detailed at all? Okay, two. (3)<br />Griff - major spoiler that could change the entire trajectory of the last two books: I don't know, a dozen? (2... wait, what?)<br /><br />Really this book just seemed like such a waste, especially after such a long wait. It felt like it did nothing but set up the pieces for the next one. There's a great scene in Jon's second chapter, then a whole lot of nothing happens for about 40 chapters, then another fantastic scene in Dany's second to last chapter, then more nothing, then stuff ramps up with about five chapters to go. I felt like I got some interesting perspectives here and there with Theon and Griff, but my three favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Dany) did absolutely nothing for me here.<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire is in my top two or three favorite series of all time, and I probably considered it #1 after the first three books, but I honestly don't think I can take another installment like this one, especially if it comes with another five year wait.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been using this gamepad for about 6 months now and I don't think I can go back to gaming without it.  I primarly play MMO's like World of Warcraft and Rift and found myself having a difficult time reaching all the buttons I needed to reach on a regular keyboard.  With the gamepad, they are all within easy reach (except maybe the G1 and G7 keys since I'm a female with small hands.)      I've used this gamepad on both a Mac and a PC and both times, the software loaded quickly and easily.  It recongized WOW and loaded the profile without any brainpower on my part, which was great.  I did end up changing some of the keymapping but that was a painless, pretty self-explanatory process.      Problem areas for me:  The joystic (with it's default mapping) was making movement very difficult for me.  I spent a lot of time in the Stormwind canals because I couldn't walk a straight line.  Once I turned off both \\"turning\\" and \\"strafing\\" just using it for \\"forward\\" and \\"back\\" and went back to using my mouse for turning, things got better.    I also had a problem with my profile going back to \\"default WOW\\" rather than my customized WOW profile, but I think this was most likely user error and not having the \\"static profile\\" thingy checked.  A user manual would maybe have made this a little easier to understand.    Astetically, the G13 is pleasing.  It looks sturdy, feels good ergonomically.  And I can make it glow any color I want!!  Today, it's purple.  I'm a girl, so these things matter.    Overall, I highly recommend this product.

B0051MKNV8|1.0|first of all the storyline has no depth. it was underdeveloped, along with the characters; some scenes seem staged, and last but not least, it all came to an end so fast and simple-from a false advertising climax-that's worthless!    don't see it, don't buy it! if you don't believe me, simply rent it. i just gave it one star just because i was told i'd be given a favor if i were to watch it with someone.     just another crappy movie that came out of Hollywood's a*****e.
0553801473|3.0|This book isn't a continuation of Storm of Swords, it's a continuation of A Feast for Crows.<br />It has all the detailed character examination AFFC has, and lacks the serious biff or plot advancements that SoS has.<br /><br />Only one of the major characters has a major plot twist. This character gets major insight into their thinking, until it comes to their major decision where their thinking is not examined at all. Frustrating.<br /><br />Saying that, it's a wonderful exposition of the characters and the world. But not much happens. And what does happen gets skipped over or cliff hanged. So it's frustrating. I was hoping for more Storm of Swords style plot/charcater advancement.<br /><br />Maybe next book (should it arrive).
B00407PNY2|5.0|I love the classic car chase...this is why I bought this DVD! The rest of the movie, I couldn't get into as much, but still enjoyed it. Definitely a great movie for it's time. Love Steve McQueen movies.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|GRave Defense is an enjoyable monster themed \\"tower defense\\" style game that has good graphics and a decent interface. I got this when it was the free \\"app of the day\\" but, after playing it for about four hours straight, would likely have paid for it. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros -<br />+ Compatibility; works on my HTC EVO<br />+ Graphics; good maps and creatures<br />+ Challenge; waves of monsters enter and exit at different map points, even in the same level<br />+ Story; plot line is given between levels<br /><br />Cons -<br />- Map screen defaults to larger than my screen size, but \\"pinching\\" the screen resizes it<br />- Hard to get \\"power ups\\", not sure if it is programing or my device but sometimes I just can't get an item, even after multiple taps on the screen<br /><br />This is more fun than I expected and will be spending a lot more time playing it.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B004WCTLNY|1.0|stay away*--- don't even rent it.    this movie's plot is simple and boring. it's as if some producer was bored and desperate to make a movie. it would have better as a short story instead. nothing happens in it. from the moment matt's character discovers the adjustment bureau, he finds his crush and they run for a few minutes to escape them; until finally finding a brief hiding place on top of a tall magic building. there is no action. instead the (adjstmnt bru, matt and emily) reconcile their differences with the adjstmnt bru-feeling sorry for them and allowing to be--- it's so boring it's pointless.      stay away* there's nothing interesting about this movie, well except for the mild coherent connection to God and the universe and all that BS- if you're into that stuff.    only watched it because of emily blunt, hence the one shining star.    just another crappy movie Hollywood produced from their a*****e.
B0000088DC|5.0|Nirvana is, in my opinion, hands down, the best band ever. I think its idiotic that people get on here and bad mouth them.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I give this book 5 stars mainly because of the strength and courage it took for her to write about what she endured. It's told in an informal, honest and direct manner. It can be a bit confusing and repetitive but she prefaces the book explaining why it might confuse readers. Overall, I was able to follow her story without any problem. I could feel her sadness and loneliness as well as the domination, manipulation and oppression from her captors (I can't write their names. They disgust me so much). After reading the first few chapters about what she initially suffered, I wasn't sure I could read anymore. However, I wanted to be left with a more positive view of her life rather than just those years with her captors. I hope Jaycee continues to overcome and recover from the harm they did to her. She and her family deserve many private, happy years together!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I like the game just as much as fieldrunners. runs great and has nice graphics although one weird sound effect like some squeak is getting annoying.
B004XQO90E|4.0|Though some might say he's there already, I'd say Jake is just getting going. He's so ridiculously likeable, but somewhat distant, yet always engagingly intelligent in alomst everything he does...it's a unique take on things and every time out he brings it home. Same as always here, with a good script milking the old time travel cliches to fit our current manufactured obsession with the guaranteed-to-be-never-ending War On Terror. With the wrong lead this film could really blow, but Gyllenhall keeps it happening from start to finish.<br /><br />Source Code is another crisp character study of one man up against oblivion, as with the director's first film, Moon, and it works just as well. Come to think of it, Jake and Sam Rockwell would be an excellent pairing in a movie. Hello, Hollywood...<br /><br />There's a lot of Philip K. Dick in here, from ideas to tone, and the best part is the clever ending, which borrows from many previous time travel works to fashion a best-of-genre ending that's cheesy yet also pretty satisfying, using technology to fulfill our desire for immortality along with happy endings (oxymoronic though that may be...hey, no one ever said we were that smart...). Yet the final conceit, the morally upright soldier doing what's right against her superior's wishes, is a great concept but almost non-existent in the real world military. We only wish our soldiers put people before protocol. Oh well, this is a fantasy after all...<br /><br />If you like sci-fi or Gyllenhall (in super crisp hi-def blu-ray closeups!) or some edgy, mostly non-violent suspense, Source Code will keep you locked into an interesting mind loop for an hour and a half of your life.<br /><br />Or was it 8 minutes?
0312600844|2.0|I won't bore the readers with a review due to the fact that I do not have that much time.  This book was obviously written by an intelligent individual that apparently could not decide how to end this depressing ride.  I wanted to like it, even tried to like it. However, the characters were pointless and never really redeemed themselves. There was no one great character to rally behind.  Hopeless and Pointless

0891419063|5.0|I bought this book the same time i ordered The Pacific.  I started the book before I started the miniseries and was about 150 pages in when I started the DVDs.  I remember watching the pacific and recognizing things pulled from Sledge's book.  I finished the miniseries before the book and was able to recongnize clips from the film in the book.  I must agree it is long, but it is worth it.  It took me about two weeks to read the entire book.  The book accounts for what these men went through in the two campaigns Sledge served it.  I loved this book and would like to thank Sledge for his service and his book.
0743454537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It is an extremely accurate portrayal of the life of a family dealing with a cancer diagnosis.

B0053F042G|4.0|This is a pretty good scifi movie. It's kinda like a cross between Groundhog Day, 12 Monkeys and The Matrix (don't worry, that actually works out). For those fans of time travel movies, this movie will add something unexpected and novel to your cinematic experience (it did for me anyway and I've seen quite a few scifi films).     Now, for a little technical divergence on the topic of time travel in movies. Some time travel movies are inconsistent (incoherent plots with contradictions) such as the Back To the Future movies. 12 Monkeys, on the other hand, involves a causal loop scenario and was also quite a good movie. Both 12 Monkeys and Source Code involve time travel scenarios that, though abstract and somewhat convoluted, at least makes coherent sense. Source Code instead uses a \\"forking universe\\" or \\"branching universe\\" scenario to avoid the inconsistencies which commonly rear their ugly heads in plots involving backward time travel. I don't remember seeing this particular device ever used in a movie to make sense of backward time travel. I really do appreciate film makers who take the time to work out coherent time travel scenarios. It takes some effort but I feel like those who make inconsistent time travel films are insulting their audiences' intelligence. I know the film maker for Source Code (Duncun Jones) probably thought about time travel quite a bit in graduate school working on his PhD in philosophy so it's not a surprise that that experience shows itself in a more nuanced, coherent and sophisticated plot.     Bare with the plot a little and even see it twice. For the most part, it makes sense and it is well worth it. Jones also incorporates a sensitivity to his movies exposing a very human frailty in his protagonists. Like his previous scifi movie Moon, the protagonist for this movie played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is deeply mistaken about his identity through extremely unusual and interesting circumstances. Also much like Moon he is mislead by those in power and eventually finds out that he is being used but finds an interesting way to gain back his dignity and some freedom in a very difficult situation (and win the girl in the end for Gyllenhaal's character). I liked Moon a lot better than Source Code but that only says how much I loved Moon. Source code is definitely not a \\"sophomore\\" flop for Jones.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We enjoyed seeing it on PBS and have enjoyed the DVD. We saw the show on stage several years ago and continue singing some of the songs to ourself. Great music.
B0016AJU2C|4.0|I only have two CD's of Alanis Morissette's, this one and Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, and I enjoy them both. A lot of people dislike this album because it 'not like Jagged Little Pill'. Of course it's not, it's its own album, it's entitled to be different. It's been how long between Flavors of Entanglement, and Jagged Little Pill?...Three years?<br />I think it shows artistry when a singer can change things up a bit. Frankly, I'd be disappointed if a singer kept producing the same style, the same sound, and the same lyrics for three years, it gets old.<br /><br />My main reason for getting this CD were the songs \\"Not As We\\" and \\"Tapes\\". They're some of my favorites on the album. And after listening to the songs, all the way through, (Not just the 30 second previews) there are others on here that I find I like just as much.<br /><br />\\"Torch\\" is a really pretty, ballad type song, with a catchy chorus. The same can be said of \\"Limbo No More\\". \\"Incomplete\\" is an interesting song. \\"Madness\\" has kind of an ethereal feel about it. \\"Orchid\\" starts out soft and turns into something that's not quite ballad, but not as strongly rock or techno, as others.<br />\\"Underneath\\", \\"Moratorium\\", and \\"Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\" has more of the rock quality to them. Same with \\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\", which is my least favorite song of this CD. \\"Citizen of the Planet\\", \\"Strait Jacket\\", \\"Versions of Violence\\" and \\"The Guy Who Leaves\\" are the more techno sounding songs of the album.<br />And lastly, \\"On the Tequila\\" is just a fun song. It's not my favorite, but I can't listen to this song and not smile. It's just funny.<br /><br />Even though I do like some songs on here better than others, I don't hate any of them. I can see myself enjoying this CD for a long time. And I have no problems recommending Flavors of Entanglement to others.<br /><br />In fact, if you like this album, you'll probably like CD's by Imogen Heap. This album of Alanis's reminds me a great deal of her at times.
0811876373|5.0|This book is wonderful  I recently started to try to make cake pops and this book has given me all the tips I need!
0553801473|5.0|First, I'd like to say that I'm not sure what some of the reviewers here were expecting.  If you read \\"A Feast for Crows\\" then you should know that this is part two of that book.  George RR Martin said that AFFC had become to large and could not be completed by a single volume so it was split into two books.  ADWD is that second book.<br /><br />A Dance With Dragons happens at the same time as AFFC.  These are the points of view of the characters in the north and across the narrow sea.  ADWD tells us what was going on with the characters we really care about like Dany, Jon, Tyrion and Davos while the events of AFFC were taking place.  Only the last 200 pages or so move forward from the events happening in the book before this one.  In my humble opinion these points of view are required to keep the story on track.  If all of this was skipped GRRM would have had to resort to a hundred flashbacks to tell us about what was happening in the north and across the Narrow Sea during AFFC.  Otherwise, we wouldn't understand what was going on with Meereen, the Iron Fleet would appear in Slavers Bay out of no where,  we'd  wonder, \\"who's this Aegon, where did Jon Connington come from, how'd that happen to Jon and is Arya still in Braavos?\\"  (trying to keep spoilers to a minimum.)  Tying up all these loose ends is required before we can move forward to new events.  I know some of you really wanted \\"x\\" or \\"y\\" to happen but chill out there are still 2 books to go.  Ok, I can hear the outrage against my last statement now, \\"I waited 6 years for the other side of AFFC? I wanted more.\\"  However, six years ago he told you this was exactly what you were getting.  If you read both AFFC and ADWD as one volume you would see how one really does require the other before you can move on.<br /><br />So, all that being said I'll give you my honest review of this book with as few spoilers as possible.<br /><br />George RR Martin takes us back to Westeros in A Dance With Dragons.  Our favorite characters are back: Dany, Tyrion, Davos and Jon all have chapters in this book.  A Dance with Dragons tells us what was happening with all our favorite characters during the events that took place in  \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"  Many of the cliffhangers from AFFC are resolved like \\"What happens to Davos\\"?  What happens to Cercei and what happens with Jon.  We get a new player in the game, the dragons grow and become more dangerous and on top of that Dany deals with several nagging issues which had to be resolved before she could possibly leave slavers bay.  Stannis is on the move and so is Bolton and his bastard Ramsey.  On top of all of that this book contains one of the most stunning moments since the red wedding in \\"A Storm of Swords.\\"<br /><br />This book was superbly written.  George RR Martin paints the world in such a way that it feels alive.  Like Mozart did with music by adding many voices George RR Martin does the same with Fantasy.  I loved this book!  The series would have been missing so many important things if GRRM had skipped over all these points of view.  ASOIAF is absolutely the best fantasy series out there and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" was a great addition to the series.

B002FRNCG0|3.0|When I got this, I found myself listening to it every chance I got. And when I wasn't able to, I still had the songs stuck in my head.<br /><br />To think of something to compare this to, the only thing coming to mind is Avril Lavigne. Except that I like this is a bit better... this is cleaner.<br />A lot of the songs on this album have a catchy tune, and the lyrics aren't bad either.<br /><br />\\"Careful\\", Ignorance\\", \\"Playing God\\", and \\"All I Wanted\\" were songs that I liked from the first time I heard this CD.<br />\\"Turn It Off\\" quickly became a new favorite of mine after listening to it a few times, while \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" was a favorite from the beginning.<br />\\"Brick by Boring Brick\\", and \\"The Only Exception\\" were songs that I had heard on the Radio, but didn't know the name of, or that it was Paramore who sang it. So I was surprised when I found them on the CD. And they likewise, became a fast favorite.<br />\\"Feeling Sorry\\" grew on me after a while of listening to the album.<br />\\"Looking Up\\", and \\"Where the Lines Overlap\\" are my least favorite, and depending on any given day, I've been known to even skip over these songs before.<br /><br />Some of the songs tend to blend, but it was cleverly done in the fact that the ones that are very much alike, are spaced out from each other, so you don't notice as easily.<br /><br />This is the only Paramore album that I own, and I don't think it's a bad introduction to the band either. I wouldn't mind owning their CD \\"Riot\\" next though, because people tend to like it better than this one.<br /><br />I would recommend this album to people with no problem. Like I said, I'd recommend this before Avril Lavigne, especially if you don't want your children listening to songs that curse at least once per song.<br />At least with Paramore's Brand New Eyes, you get the same style music, that's more family friendly, without all the unnecessary language thrown in.
B004XANKVO|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2Z62016PAHXGJ]]I like the products that Thule makes. They're sturdy and of high quality, and that's why I was looking forward so much to getting this backpack, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />From the video I posted, you can see the storage space in the backpack.<br /><br />There's plenty of padding to keep a laptop secure. It'll easily fit the 17\\" laptops and Macbooks. We put a 17\\" HP laptop which is thicker than a Macbook and it fit just fine.<br /><br />The hardened storage compartment is great for sunglasses or ipods so they don't get scratched by all the other stuff you might have in the backpack. It also makes it easy to access your ipod, headphones, sunglasses, or whatever else you might put in there.<br /><br />The only drawback is that the shoulder straps feel just a tight around the edges, almost like they're angled in. That could be just a matter of having the straps too tight, and I really only feel it when putting on the backpack.<br /><br />Other than that, it's been our laptop case of choice when we're going out and about and need to take the laptop.<br /><br />There's a space on the backpack where you could stuff a jacket in which comes in handy when travelling.<br /><br />So all around, great backpack for taking care of important digital devices you want to take around.
0240815807|5.0|In his chapter on \\"Timing and Tuning Adjustments\\" Mike Senior explains how a drummer may drift accurately from a DAW's metric grid and how the home studio owner can adjust this drift to fit the overall groove.  He concludes this paragraph with a parenthetical comment:     If you're still scratching your head about this, then check out Figure 6.1 for further           clarification.                                                    (Mixing Secrets, p91)    At this point in my reading, the author's sentence literally caught me scratching my head, and I self-consciously removed my hand from my scalp to turn to the helpful graph on the following page.  This may seem like a silly anecdote, but it does illustrate one of Mike Senior's greatest strengths as an author on a technical subject: he never fails to anticipate where his reader is at and is so often spot on in guiding him or her to a complete understanding of what is often difficult subject matter.  These readers are most likely people like me, for whom some initial dabbling in home recording has turned into a full-blown obsession over the years, and who, like me, are sometimes stumped by a lack of technical training.  Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio successfully addresses these gaps in knowledge and experience, and the author does this with clarity, and a level of detail, depth and organisation with which online forums, though valuable, cannot compete.  (Think of trying to evaluate the best of several, perhaps conflicting answers, or enduring the banter...or perhaps even abuse of `the pros' online).      I have found Mike Senior to be friendly, helpful, funny and communicative, both in his writing as well as his online presence-an excellent website containing recommended products, plugins and multitrack wav files, all directly relevant to the text.  He is open to constructive feedback and where possible takes time to answer questions.  Additionally, the author's down-to-earth and realistic approach will help you squeeze the most out of your budget, whatever it may be.      There are a lot of `professional hobbyists' out there, and I am sure that after reading this book they would have to agree that it is one of a handful of truly excellent resources out there to help us achieve our goal: to become better at recording and mixing, and perhaps give our friends, family, band-members and fans something worth listening to.

Bad  Do you have a manager who drives a business via metrics? Bad    Can you explain to you the manager why this is bad? No squishy feeling stuff, but actual reasons why this is a bad idea? This book helped me understand what things in our business were actually causing people to not enjoy their work. With this is mind we have made a lot of changes and the result has been outstanding.

B0055CJ8T2|3.0|There is something about this album that is new, original and fresh. Some of it has to do with Kelly's greatly-pitched voice which I have always liked and part of it is the fresh beats found on these 14 tracks. This album has an upbeat tone almost all the way through. There are a few ballads, though.<br /><br />\\"Motivation\\" is easily one of 2011's biggest songs. I am so proud of Kelly. She has always seemed very humble, so she deserves such success. Personally, this song took some getting used to because it kind of drags along and this surely is not one of Wayne's best raps, but after all the airplay, I was lured into really liking it. The remix could have been left off because it sounds so much like the original. \\"Commander\\" also has 2 versions on this album. I prefer the remix, but both versions hold their own. The original is an up-tempo track with a huge techno influence. Kelly sounds great and proves she can make a dance track just as well as her female contemporaries can. \\"Heaven and Earth\\" is easily one of this album's highlights. Here, Kelly is proclaiming that she deserves all this life has to offer, literally. She says she deserves \\"heaven and earth.\\" Sure, it's one of those \\"empowering women songs\\", but women are going to fall in love with it.<br /><br />Some songs are better than others, but this is an overall nice album for music lovers to enjoy.

B005DD7JL2|2.0|I rarely write reviews but I had to warn you! I should have went to sleep and saved my $3.99 for a MP3 Album Deal of the Day. This was definitely a 99 cents rental. I liked DOA and was hoping it would be similar to that movie. Unfortunately, it was as bad as Street Fighter. It also makes me think of the Dragonball: Evolution fail. I only gave it 2 stars because at least Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa visually made a good Heihachi Mishima. Lateef Crowder was a good Eddy Gordo. Jon Foo made a decent Jin but he's not even Japanese. The fight scenes were wack. This movie was so low budget, they couldn't afford Donnie Yen to play Marshall Law. If you do watch it, then there is something after the end credits. I hope this is redone right! I leave you with a fitting line from the movie: \\"Defeat is a choice, so is victory.\\" The people behind this movie obvious went with the former.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|I know it's a toy. You know it's a toy. But when you open the package, your first thought shall be: this is a toy. Chunky and plastic-y, with seams and flashing all over the place, the build quality isn't up to snuff. Considering other companies offer replica prop \\"toys\\" at the same price point with more elaborate electronics and metal parts, the Sonic Screwdriver doesn't feel like $20 in your hand.    The UV light does indeed look blue in real life (as opposed to purple in photos) as others have noted, but it isn't the right shade, making the end look cheap when it's activated. The sound is quiet and the speaker is (inexplicably) mounted so that it points AWAY from the user, making it seem even quieter. There are two alternating sounds, one with a simple buzz, the other a buzz that pitches up slightly higher along with a looping \\"purring chirp\\", though the Sonic needs to be firmly planted against your ear to hear the difference in most situations. The \\"teeter-totter\\" design of the switch is just cheap, as the button could have easily been designed to be depressed by the slider switch... but that probably would cost an extra 2 cents per unit.    In another ode to cheapness, the clear tube is molded in two separate pieces, leaving a huge seam down each side. Great.    The battery compartment is hilariously oversized, meaning that the extra length added for the electronics is just wasted space, and this could have easily been proportioned like the actual prop. Quick note: the blurb about the toy being used in the show is a bit of a stretch; it was only used as a \\"stunt\\" prop, whenever the Sonic was supposed to be thrown, dropped or otherwise abused. The proper metal one was still used most of the time.    The pen nib is an interesting addition, though you do have to twist the cap off when using it; pulling it will just unplug the whole tip. The UV feature works as advertised, but quickly loses what little charm it has. The regular pen tip is much more practical, if awkward to use unless you have gigantic hands.    All in all, this feels more like a prototype, a bug-filled version to be tweaked and changed before production, but here it is. Too bad, as this could have been a great piece.    But I gave it four stars. Because, no matter how cheap, now matter how poorly designed, no matter how maddening the numerous issues may be, this thing is still fun. Super fun. Stupid fun. I can't help but pick it up and play with it every time I see it! As a replica, this thing fails. As a toy, it's still riddled with problems. But it's a damned fun toy. 4 stars it is. For sheer fun.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|I had very high expectations for PfC2 and it exceeded every one of them!  The music was wonderful and lively and it was so good to see a lot of familiar faces from PfC1 -- both singers and musicians.  My only regret is that \\"Waiting on the Dock\\" was not included on the CD.  There was not one song I didn't like, and there is such a different feeling when you see musicians from all over the world.  Nice to have South American countries included also.  This is definitely a must-buy for all PFC lovers!

B000002KDS|5.0|Killer averages a 5 stars ranking on Amazon and rightfully so, it's an amazing and essential Alice Cooper album. Out of all the Alice Cooper band efforts, this is my favorite and that's saying something since the band's early albums remain the best Alice Cooper album long after Mr. Vincent Furnier took the AC name for his own and went solo. Here what you have is a strong, cohesive band effort under the guidance of acclaimed producer Bob Ezrin. The sound is a lot more experimental than you would think, particularly on songs like \\"Halo of Flies\\". Never again would Alice Cooper, band or solo, be so diverse, weird and experimental again. \\"Love It To Death\\", \\"School's Out\\", \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\", \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" are all contenders but \\"Killer\\" is always hailed as one of Alice's best releases (often \\"THE\\") and it truly is, on my list this one sits on top actually.<br /><br />\\"Under My Wheels\\" is a solid opener, an effective short rocker with silly yet fun lyrics gets the album off to a rocking start. \\"Be My Lover\\" is a happy and more upbeat song compared to some of the dark lyrics an imagery that's just around the corner.  It wouldn't have been out of place on Love It To Death, it's predecessor album. \\"Halo of Flies\\" is so good it would almost be worth it to buy the album just for this epic 8+ minutes song. It's really an 8 minute roller-coaster ride with different time changes, interesting progression and the song takes you on a ride not quite like what you've experienced before. It's hard to describe, this is a song that has to be heard it's the longest and the best although I understand it may be too experimental and \\"weird\\" for some. I simply think they don't music like this today. \\"Desperado\\" is a softer and more melodic song, the highlight of this song is Alice's voice his performance is so heartfelt, especially when he sings in a softer voice that's more like his real voice. In an interview Alice said this song was written about Jim Morrison, any way it's one of the best moments on \\"Killer\\". \\"Dead Babies\\" features some dark, twisted and somewhat disturbing lyrics (\\"Little Betty is sleeping in the graveyard...\\") and even features a baby crying to add to its effect. It's one of the most powerful track here and it stands out. The title track closes the album in a way that's nothing short of grandiose and epic. There's a very creepy ambiance about this song and I remember being scared at the end of the song the last 30 seconds being very spooky. It's an excellent track with some great effects and it concludes the album very well. I loved this album at first listen and I have a feeling I will be listening to it for quite some time to come.<br /><br />There are even parts in which Alice sings in his \\"real\\" voice which is great to hear such as on \\"Desperado\\". There's also an overall great and strong bass sound courtesy of Denis Dunaway, the bass is so vivid and present it's hard not to be impressed. Along with drummer Neal Smith they form a very tight rhythm section. There is also some interesting orchestration and effects on some of the songs, which isn't all that surprising considering Bob Ezrin was the producer. If you're into classic rock, particularly if you're a fan of early 70's bands this a classic well worth owning. There are 8 songs here and they're all great, there's no bad track here and it can be listened to from beginning to end without skipping a song once. I count no shorter than 3 epic songs : \\"Halo of Flies\\", \\"Dead Babies\\" and the title track, the album's longest and craziest cuts. There's a certain atmosphere, an aura that is special around timeless albums and the same goes for \\"Killer\\".<br /><br />It's been a long time since Alice released an album like this although to be fair he did deliver some pretty good material over the years. \\"Killer\\" is without a doubt the masterpiece it is hailed to be, an absolute fiver have no fear buying this one. I've read a review that claimed some of the songs on thisare disturbring. On the downside \\"Killer\\" would highly benefit from a deluxe edition with some new remastering, the sound is the only thing that's not \\"killer\\" about the album. This is the Alice Cooper band at its finest an Vincent Furnier himself who played the AC character in his solo career never beat this, \\"Killer\\" is as good as it gets when it comes to Alice Cooper! 5/5.downside \\"Killer\\" would highly benefit from a deluxe edition with some new remastering, the sound is the only thing that's not \\"killer\\" about the album.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|This was a surprisingly entertaining, tender movie that was an absolute pleasure to watch.    Sometimes it takes a movie like this to slow down and smell the flowers.  Richard Farnsworth does an absolutely fantastic job acting in this movie as Lyle Straight.  The cinematography is also notably excellent, and it is still a shock to realize that this film was directed by the ever-weird David Lynch.      I did a bit of research on the real Alvin Straight, and I have a tendency to think that he was not entirely the humanistic, compassionate soul that was portrayed in the movie.  It takes a reclusive, cantankerous man with too much time on his hands to refuse to get on a Greyhound bus and instead embark on a six week journey on a tractor just to go a few hundred miles.  To the real Alvin Straight's credit, he reportedly refused to appear on David Letterman and other shows trumpeting his odyssey.  This was clearly a man who wanted to be left alone.    Actually, the real star of the movie is this rural corner of the US that is the Iowa/Wisconsin border.  The peaceful scenery and hospitable people, as well as laid-back lifestyle and slower pace of life can really be appealing.  I think that the film captures that aspect very well, and it makes one want to go and visit.  The film itself was reportedly filmed along the actual route that the real Alvin Straight took on his journey.    So even though this film offers us a clearly romanticized view of this event, it does so in a way that is not unrealistic, even if it is idealized.  After all, isn't that the real reason we go to movies in the first place?
B0057A6GA6|4.0|People who rated this game 1-2 STARS are being unfair to the developers... Just because it doesn't work or work very well on your old phone... It doesn't mean the game is horrible! I have HTC EVO 3D, and this game is AWESOME!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|What a pleasant surprise Battle: Los Angeles was! After mixed reviews when it was in theaters, this movie was not high up in my queue. But after perusing On Demand last night with my kids the consensus was Battle: LA so I went with it...and I'm really glad that I did.<br /><br />First of all, the trailers give the silly impression that for some reason aliens have decided to set their sites only on Los Angeles and launch a brutal attack on that city. As it turns out, the attack is much more widespread than just LA; but the focus of the movie is on a battalion of Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton that are sent to defend the LA area against that regional attack. The story is told from a military perspective and it worked very well for me.<br /><br />If you're a gamer and you've played any of the [[ASIN:B00269QLH4 Call of Duty]] games, [[ASIN:B000JLIXIG Resistance: Fall Of Man]] or better yet both...you should love this movie. Call of Duty = lots of well designed, tactical military combat missions. Resistance Fall of Man = lots of military combat action against aliens. And both of those game descriptions sum up what you get with Battle: LA...with the exception of course being that you get to sit back and enjoy the movie action in under 2 hours versus the up to over 10 hours it might take you to finish just one of the games.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart (who I hardly recognized and thought was an odd choice for the role) actually did a great job as the Staff Sergeant tasked with leading his team of Marines into battle. He and his cast turn in some Hoo-Rah!, believable performances. The special effects in the film are terrific and breaks in the action are few and far between. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />I don't see any announcements for a sequel, but the door was certainly left wide open for one considering that the movie focused only on a relatively small portion of a global attack. Oh well, at least I'm inspired to wipe the dust off my old copy of Resistance Fall of Man; that game will keep me busy for a while.<br /><br />Battle: LA is a great Sci-Fi / Action flick. I'd highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.n; that game will keep me busy for a while.     Battle: LA is a great Sci-Fi / Action flick. I'd highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.
B004XQO90O|3.0|Source Code has been likened to Groundhog Day, Matrix, and Quantum Leap. Perhaps in a glancing way, yes. It's really a pale, simplistic riff on 12 Monkeys, the superb sci-fi starring Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Source Code manages to cover very little ground (in the \\"past\\" world) and provide minimal character development when compared to 12 Monkeys. I do like the fact that it has an upbeat ending (possible spoiler**: although it's flawed from a pure sci-fi, quantum-theory standpoint - definitely invokes a paradox when you consider who Jake must be in the end). This movie is perfect for an evening that needs no intellectual challenges, minimal violence or bad language, and ends with a positive love-story. Definitely has a good triumphs over evil theme and in the end love conquers all - and that makes it worth watching.
0307341577|5.0|I have read quite a few reviews on this book...while considering my own.     I do understand this book is not everyone's cup of tea, but, I have to say there have been few books that truly kept me on the edge of my seat and were as compelling as this one.     Not only does the author provide a robust, unique characterization of a family that always seems to have their slice of pie served with a fly on it, but it doesn't try to lure you into a plot where the good and evil can easily be segregated with a thick line. In fact, there is a lot of gray in this book. Quite a lot.    The main character in this book is a Libby, a former victim/survivor of a horrible famous crime. Most of her family was killed...slaughtered, even...and her brother was accused and convicted of the crime.     She has spent much of her life NOT looking for the answers and not wanting to know anything about her family or what really happened. In her own words, she feels like there is something \\"bad\\" in her and she seems to almost be punishing herself for that \\"badness\\" by not allowing herself to move on...to be happy...to enjoy her life. She participates in petty crimes...in small scams...anything to maintain that label of \\"no good\\" while she moves through and uses (or is used by) person after person. For such a young person, she seems to have given up on life. She is not interested in anything except survival -- and from some of her comments, that's not a given, either.     When her money starts dwindling and she realizes that she might actually have to go to work to sustain herself, she starts looking for help through people who have become interested in her family's past and the horrible crime that goes with it.    As she starts to learn more about them, she unearths facts about her family, its past and herself she didn't know. As she starts to look under rocks, she realizes there is more to the events than she ever knew. And that everything she knew to be \\"true,\\" just might not be.     This isnot a lovable character. This is not a sweet, warm victim of crime you immediately want to \\"overcome.\\" In some parts of the book, frankly, it's hard to like her. But that's the point. As Libby moves through the book, you don't have to like her. She is what she is. But you will come to understand her. To admire her as a \\"fighter\\" for whom survival is ultimately her greatest gift.    I can honestly say that the characters in this book...the compelling plot...the true \\"mysteries\\" that are contained in this book...they are fresh. They aren't the same old thing you've seen twenty times over...rehashed and reheated for a new look.     I look forward to reading more from this author. I hope she has many more stories in her...

0553801473|1.0|A huge disappointment.  After all the promises that this one would be better than AFFC, we end up with a book like this.  After 1800 pages spread of two novels and lacking any real plot advancement, perhaps a better title for this latest book would be \\"Slouching towards a possible finish sometime in the future, but don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm making waaaaay too much money\\".  Everyone now likes to compare Martin to Robert Jordan, but what an insult to Jordan!  Face it, we've never seen an author who has spun out a series for so long, and whose writing has declined so steeply, and yet made so much money.
B0018CMJSU|4.0|The movie itself deserves 5 stars because it is unquestionably the best movie ever made!    The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the front cover is a little scratched and the UPS guy left my package outside my door in the rain.

0553801473|2.0|Now I hopped onto the Ice and Fire train relatively late. I started Game of Thrones probably six months before the HBO series and--like everyone else--I raced through Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords. Realizing I was going a bit fast I paused on Feast for Crows...I started reading up and learning about the long wait for Feast and then the still ongoing wait for Dance. So I decided to read Feast a week or so after Dance released, afterward moving straight on to Dance.<br /><br />It is extremely clear that after Storm Martin had lost a certain vigor that he had with the previous books. Feast and Dance share a lot of flaws and this is needless repition and not just in his prose. He constantly seems to use the same two plot lines for every character. It seems that ever since Feast a character is either in a long (and mostly very drawn out) journey (Tyrion, Brienne, Quentyn, Victarion, Griff, Asha, Bran) or is stuck in a single place trying to rule whilst every character around them, to an extent, tries to corrupt their plans (Dany, Jon, Cersei, Barristan) the only characters that slightly--sometimes very slightly--avoid these two plots are Theon, Davos, Jaime, Arya, Sansa and the Dornish from Feast. Most of those characters who are not victims to the Two-Plot rule (with a few exceptions) have very minimal parts in Feast and Dance. Basically the plot never significantly moves forward for practically all the characters. As opposed to the first three books where A character would be traveling somewhere at the end of the chapter to end up there in their next chapter the book drags every single detail and sight in the journey.<br /><br />Basically it seems that Martin just didn't know where to put the characters after Storm of Swords and it shows in Feast and Dance. Cersei is reduced to a typical paranoid tyrannical, Tyrion a traveling show dwarf, Dany a young girl who  knows little in the ways of war, Jon a commander who can't explain things to his troops.<br /><br />AlsoGRRM seems to be resorting to cheap plot devices and cliffhangers. He has seemingly brought every character back to life at least once in Dance (only slight exaggeration). Basically most chapters end with the death of their characters next chapter of theirs begins with their mostly random story of how they escaped the death narrowly. This throws a lot of realism out the window. Also he increasingly decides to create new characters in POV's. Instead of maybe five or six total POV's in a book with each one pretty much representing a region of the world we now have some characters showing and talking about the same events, some that are completely nowhere related to the rest of the story. I think Martin needs to understand that we don't need every detail of every story...I wouldn't mind a character not being present but hearing about a ceratin event. Basically a chief example is Dany in Meereen, when she leaves the city Barristan randomly gets his own POV to show what's happening in the city when instead we could have followed Dany or Tyrion and just learned through rumor or word of mouth what happened in Meereen.<br /><br />Basically at the end of Dance the plot is no further along than at the end of Storm. The writing is very good and I'm one of the few that don't seem to mind the excess details but I think they would be more tolerable with a more driven story. Overall the story seems to be crumbling in on itself and Martin would need to work extremely hard to dig himself out the hole that is Feast and Dance
0061928356|3.0|This book was easy to read and entertaining as it engrossed me for the full 24 hours it took to read it. However, it was no Jhumpa Lahiri.  The book had a been there, done that feel, with re-visited themes of poverty and cultural stereotypes and confusion. Initially the story line was compelling but the book lost me when it failed to convince me that a young woman in Northern California could grow up so clueless about her own Indian roots, as everyone is aware that Northern Cali is heavily populated with Indians.  Instead of bridging the gaps of East and West, it only cemented outdated stereotypes.  Furthermore, I was unsettled by several factual errors that are blatant to anyone with any knowledge of Indian culture. Overall, it was a beach read and a good try for this debut author-groundbreaking and a piece of literature it is not.

I already have a Fenix Tk 11, so I know of Fenix's quality and performance, one of the reasons I ordered this over the Tk 35, is the fact that it runs on AA batteries which you can practically get anywhere in the world at any time, quite easily, and the longer runtime. As with any other Fenix product it is built rugged, tough, and sturdy. Type III HA aluminium, waterproof to 2 meters (haven't tested this yet). This thing throws a lot of light a lot of distance, the two button interface makes it very simple to use, and they don't make any clicking noise. This is a good light for Military, Law Enforcement Emergency/Utility personnel. More suited as a squad light, you can keep it in the vehicle of your respective, service, and you're good to go. I am a Law Enforcement Officer, (which is why I bought the light) although I will find use for this light at home, and from experience, Fenix lights can take a beating and keep on going.

Clary: Can i smack her? she is whiney, petulant, self-depreciating and she never really grew during the book. She is constantly comparing herself to Isabelle, to the point where I was comparing myself to her and feeling bad. No love for Clary! She never redeems herself in my eyes. The others though, I had love for.

0439023521|5.0|What an awesome book! I'm a huge fan of sci-fi literature, but haven't been reading much of anything for about a year now. I decided to jump back into reading for fun with The Hunger Games after reading raving reviews and watching an awesome parody done by WinterSpringPro on YouTube, and I couldn't have made a better choice! However, I must say that I'm not a huge fan of how The Hunger Games ended. (NO SPOILERS!) From the time they left the cave until the end it started to seem like Collins was trying to pull some Twilight crap. A bit of romance is great, however the whole \\"I'm crazy in love but only sixteen\\" thing is over the top. (In my mind I ended up picturing them being in their early to mid twenties and- for me at least- it became much more believable.)  I give the book an A+ up until that point. I mean, hey, I just spent eleven hours straight reading it so the ending couldn't have been THAT bad! I must also add that I'm not sure if I want to read the rest of the trilogy. I'm pretty sure this book is going to be as action packed as it gets, but we'll see!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This movie is funny, clear and simple.  The actors played their roles' and delivered.  The dubbed language. the Chinese language and even the subtitles (I have seen it several times dubbed and in Chines) are not a barrier.  My husband and I watched and taught ourselves the AX Man dance.  That Pig Sty Alley, what a place.  An enjoyable must see movie.    I am anxiously awaiting Kung Fu Hustle II.
B003Y74AZ2|1.0|I bought mine about 3 months ago, and not even into the first 2 weeks the material was ripped. The rip stayed for awhile and I dealt with it until it finally ripped off, making the case worthless and unusable. Even if I never had the rip, I would have given the case 3 stars due to the poor craftsmanship of the case and the Amazon Basics logo sketched in the back. Also the cut in the case were the volume and vibrate/sound switch was not cut right as the cut is way to big for the phone. Not worth it for $8+ when you can get something way better... well at least its better then buying one at the Verizon, AT&T, etc store.. $25 for a case, what a ripoff.

1451629184|5.0|Reading this book makes you wonder where lays the limit of human resilience.<br />It is impossible for any reasonable person to even begin to imagine what this child had to endure for so long, and how she managed to cope and adapt, simply in order to survive.<br />The level of manipulation of this maniac held over her had to be overwhelming in order for this sweet girl to comply with his disgusting demands.<br />She spares very little detail and although it makes it a hard read, it also faces you with the harsh reality that became her life for 18 years. Day and day out - raising her precious daughters in complete isolation, and without the most minimal emotional stimulation of her captors, she made a life for them and held it all together.  My God, what endurance!<br />A must read.
B0056NYMXC|5.0|Not going to give you a long winded review, just gonna say my peace and be out but Ms. Kelly Rowland has finally delivered a album that her \\"Urban\\" fans have wanted from her for years! Let's be honest her first album failed to make waves in the USA. Second album, while the song with Eve was hot, didn't break through the way we hoped. But with this album Kelly put all the pieces together and made one of the hottest R&B records of the year! My favorite tracks, \\"All Of The Night\\", \\"Lay It On Me\\", \\"Turn it Up\\", \\"Motivation\\" and \\"Keep it Between Us\\". It's not until she gets to the dance tracks that the skip button becomes necessary for me. But I understand those songs are for her other fan base so I wont hold that against her.     For those other reviewers that say she's \\"A Missed Opportunity\\", they wouldn't know a hit record if they heard one. The cohesion of the album is in the Urban Hip-Hop/R&B side of the album. The urban music lovers will buy this album and skip \\"Here I Am in\\" Europe and the U.K version. We'll see which album sells the best shall we? Kelly gets five stars from me! Can't wait for another album from her!
0545123291|4.0|Listened to this to refresh my memory in anticipation of reading Forever, #3 in the series.  Enjoyed the audio version as each of the main characters is voiced by a different person.  Sam seems to be cured of the curse that causes him to change into a wolf every winter but Grace may be on the path to being a wolf herself.  She smells like wolf and becomes quite ill.  The mostly-chaste romance between Sam and Grace continues, despite an edict from Grace's suddenly-attentive parents that Grace not see Sam until she turns 18 (a mere four months).  The fact that there is interest from the parents is a surprise, because they have been hands-off for the entire series.<br /><br />The introduction of a new character, Cole, St. Clair, added to the storyline but I was surprised that the two things that tied Cole and Sam together--being a wolf and music--did not make them friends or at least something more than mere acquaintances.  I'd thought that music would be a natural tie-in for the two boys.  But I did enjoy the story, and look forward to Forever.
B000NQRR1Q|1.0|I wish there was an option for zero stars. This is the worst book-to-film adaptation I have ever witnessed. I challenge you to read the book 'The Club Dumas' by Arturo Pérez-Reverte before watching the movie. Pérez-Reverte crafts wonderful tales and unfortunately most of his book was lost in the movie, and the rest was reduced almost to campy horror. The basic elements of the book are portrayed (gathering the elements necessary to summon the devil) and in the book, it all seemed plausible, yet in the film it was laughable. Having said that, I thought that Depp was a perfect choice for Corso. I still have hopes for 'Captain Alatriste' with Viggo Mortensen, the film adaptation of Pérez-Reverte's eponymous novel.
B005529BDK|2.0|This is an ideal game for killing time when you are waiting. It's simple to figure out, and you can play quick games on it. Works fine without problems on my Droid X.
B00000DLUV|5.0|you will not tire of this CD. It is a hit around the world as I took it with me and it was a favorite everywhere.
B000006TRV|2.0|Except some good songs and excellent solos of David Gilmour,for me it's a great failure of Pink Floyd.I don't like the lyrics,nor the album's concept idea.It's populistic and doesn't hold the test of time.If I were R.Waters,I would be greatly ashamed of this disc.When fans talk about three big masterpieces of Pink Floyd,alongside with \\"The Dark Side of The Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" they include \\"The Wall\\".Instead of this overated populistic schlock I would include \\"Animals\\", which is much better.So three real great masterpieces of Pink Floyd are \\"The Dark Side of The Moon\\",\\"Wish You Were Here\\" AND \\"Animals\\".Fullstop.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Got this for free on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and it works very well. it's a little slow in the beginning, so you can use the fast forward button in the upper left.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I just LOVE this show! It is SO SWEET and it really ROCKS too! I don't care if the actors are too old to be in high school, I still love it. My favorite character is KLAINE. LOL LOL They are THE BEST. Kurt sings like an ANGEL. And Blaine is just AWESOME. I bawled my eyes out when the Glee Club gave the service at Sue's sister's funeral. It was SO SWEET! I sure hope they win at Nationals. A 100 STARS, if I could. This is my FAVORITE SHOW!
0300169787|4.0|This book doesn't contain as much commentary as I would like, but it's great to see everything that was at the exhibit. When I went to the Met to see Savage Beauty, it was so packed that I had a really hard time seeing each piece and couldn't read all of the placards. I'm glad that I can read and see everything I missed and have it all in one book.
1451629184|4.0|This book is remarkable for a woman who stopped going to school at aged 11. The maturity of her insight into her situation while in captivity is worth reading about alone, plus the events after she was discovered.  It could have been improved by running the story of her mother's search for her in parallel and perhaps a psychologist's explanation of the Garrido's beahviour. Nevertheless, it confirms that the Jaycee Dugard in the interview with Dianne Sawyer was indeed her authentic self and that is reflected in her tone, her voice and her inner monologue.    Be aware that once you know what happened to her, you cannot \\"unknown\\" it. She tells the truth in graphic detail and it will disgust you and haunt you. You will feel frightened for her and angry at this man's sense of entitlement.    Perhaps not a book for students under 15 years of age for that reason.    That she does not seem bitter, angry and resentful is the biggest surprise. I know I would be - and that is what makes her so remarkable.
0756404738|3.0|There is something about fantasy authors that makes them think their books should be insanely long. Fine -- but only if they are also insanely good. And this was one is just so-so. It does not compare to any of the Song of Ice and Fire books. It absolutely doesn't compare with Lord of the Rings. So, I think, the length is silly. Okay, with that out of the way, I will say that many parts of the book are very good -- the characters, the build up, the basic plot. But, Rothfuss takes his protagonist on a long journey, with a lot of stops along the way. I found myself wishing he would just to get to the point sometimes, but I understand that it is the journey and not the destination that is important here. All in all, I am sure I will read the final book of the series. But I definitely would not recommend this series to anyone. Read Game of Thrones instead.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I really love the Sunshine Accessory. But, I don't use it on a stroller, I have CP - cererbal palsy - so I use it on the side of my wheelchair. It is very awesome to have to hold sun glasses, wallet, drinks, about anything you will ever need when you're out and about.  I absolutely recommend this to any mother or a disabled person. Thank you.
1589269071|5.0|The audio book (MP3 format) was written well and provides essentials to a greater relationship.  The return on investment is priceless!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game isn't one to play when you've got a few seconds of spare time.. Each level takes at least 5 minutes, but it is way fun when you've got time.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Wicked good flick. I thought a certain character, and I'm sure those of you who have seen it know who I'm talking about, was going to die at the end, but the ending surprised me. At first, judging from the previews, I thought it was going to be a horror film, but to me it ended up being more of a suspense film. A jumpy scene or two, but all in all it was great. I definitely plan on watching it again and am glad I bought it.
0316069485|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Michael Connelly and this book didn't disappoint. Another great, fast paced story that will keep you guessing till the very end. Was a bit disappointed with the ending being a cliff-hanger but I'll deal.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Gilmore Girls Show for a long time.  I am sad to have seen it end but grateful for all the laughes.  This is an amazing collection of all episodes including bonus features and interviews. Highly recommend this to any Gilmore Girls Fan who wants to keep the show alive in their own living room.
0553801473|1.0|Wow...Let me start off by saying that I just watched the entire first season of Game of Thrones and I really liked it (as I did the first few books)..... However, I really can't say much about this book... I guess I am in some kind of shock after realizing that I just read 1000 pages where absolutely nothing happened..... All I will say is, if you are looking for a good book (or even a decent one) I would not recommend you read this one..... At times you feel like the plot is picking up only for it to go off to 10 random chapters of what feel like filler material.....<br /><br />I'll pass on the next books
0765322889|2.0|I really wanted to give this series a chance.  After slogging through books 6-10 of Wheel of Time and waiting for A Dance with Dragons to come out, I needed something to get me back into the fantasy swing on a good foot.  This was not the book for that.    Everything about Gardens of the Moon just sort of turned me off.  Whether it was the confusing, jump-all-over-the-place narrative, the absolutely absurd character names, are the obnoxious and insufferable characters themselves, namely Captain Paran, you name it, I hated it.  I know some people will claim that I might not be clever or patient enough to quite \\"get it\\".  Whatever.  There really isn't much there that I would want to get in the first place.    Something I did get was Erickson's blatant attempt to create his own typical super-badass antihero in the form of Anomander Rake.  I will not spoil it for anyone who has the fortune of not having read this book, but let me just say if there is a problem, Mr. Rake can use his all powerful badass powers to fix it.  Seriously, the entire last quarter of the book consists of the author coming up with bigger badies with the sole purpose of getting killed by this guy.  The worst part is that everyone seems to actually like this shallow, cheap character.  Whatever floats your boat I guess.    All in all, Gardens of the Moon is not the worst book I have ever read (that distinction goes to Crossroads of Twilight).  But its pretty damn close.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Excelente, un tema controversial!!! El amor es tratado desde otro punto, el cual puede crear y ser controversial. Una relacion intensan. La recomiendo.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|A fan of both, Jolie and Depp, they are stunning in this movie. But I expected a more thrilling movie.<br />Have way through, I started suspecting how the plot would continue, and how it would end. Altough not quite sure, it kept me guessing for a while, but nearing the end, I was quite sure. It kind a had a catch-me-if-you-can and romantic flavor to it. To me it was 'ok'. Nice movie, with good actors, nice sceneries, costumes, locations and set.
B000W799NU|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best movie in the Harry Potter franchise! It's darker and has a great storyline. This year, Harry goes back to Hogwarts at his own risk. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to figure out who the heir of Slytherin is and try to stop them from petrifying students. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS!!!
B005AUWY2W|1.0|When I want kids to see an animation, I hope that they can be kids and enjoy their lives. They have so many more stresses these days than (in many ways) we did. I do not want lil ones having propaganda tossed at them. Pixar used to be a safe haven from that. No more, sadly. Kids get plenty of propaganda at school. Can't we give them a break and let them \\"make believe\\" that the world is not going to blow up just because they used gasoline to drive to granny's?
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it. When I first saw it, I thought it didn't have enough action and started out pretty slow. But the more I see it, I appreciate it more. The action scenes were pretty awesome. It had beautiful scenery, a decent cast, some funny moments, and Captain America's costume was really cool. (Hayley Altwell did a great job as Peggy Carter. She was very pretty, and looked like she was from the 40's.)<br /><br />Steve Rogers is too skinny and weak to join the military in 1942. He is offered a chance to be the first in the \\"Super-Soldier\\" experiment. He soon becomes tall and muscular and becomes a national treasure as 'Captain America' with an awesome motorcycle and bulletproof American flag shield. He must stop Red Skull from destroying the world with a cubed jewel. If you enjoy Marvel Comic movies, you might enjoy CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER!!!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is a great way to kill some time.  Graphics,  gameplay,  and controls are very good.  The story is about as hokey as they come,  but hey,  it's a zombie game. I got it for free from Amazon,  but it's worth the money if you're into tower defense games.
B00003CXI1|5.0|See how it all began. Six years before Harry and Voldemort's final battle, we find out that Harry is a young wizard and must be trained at Hogwarts. He befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Together, they try to stop someone from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone. I still remember being 11 years old and seeing this with my mom. This is a very fun movie to watch. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE!!!
B001UV4XIS|3.0|The movie deserves zero stars, but I gave it three stars, because I felt that the actors all did a really good job on this one.    The storyline is unlike the book on almost every point. Places of major events were changed, added dialog, dialogs swapped from one character to another, and on and on and on.     The film is so dark(literally), that it is hard to make anything out. Most of the movie seems to have been filmed through a blue filter, ruining the realistic, and extraordinary backgrounds of the filming locations. A ton of graphics added in over everything, so that most of the time you aren't sure even what room or area the characters are in.      The ending is the worst. The book concluded in a concise fashion, and explained everything in the last ten minutes or so, but the movie left all of that out. Instead there is that swirl of graphics over the top of everything, which just basically ruined it. The final part of the movie concerning the \\"wand\\" was changed(like the rest of the movie), for no apparent reason except that they could.    All in all, a bummer for anyone who loved the books. They should have had Peter Jackson(The Lord Of The Rings) direct it, it would have been great!
B002IKLNW4|2.0|I read 3 of Bill Bryson's books prior to this one - A Walk in the Woods, In a Sunburned Country and The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid. The idea of a roadtrip across America written by him sounded delicious.      The Lost Continent was written before those 3 books and I didn't find it as enjoyable. There is the same lilting prose and some really laugh-out-loud funny descriptions but then he went too far I guess trying to be funny. I'm not sure who he thought his audience was but I would bet it would have insulted at least some of the people living in the towns he visited.  I thought some of the comments were outright rude and judgemental and I don't even live in the US. He generally wrote as if he would thankfully never come that way again. I finished it just to see if there was some sort of full-circle realization but not really. This was an excellent theme for the writer, so full of material with which to display his writing charm. I wish he could write this book now, but what's done is done.        If I were Bryson, I would let this book drift out of print.
0064431622|5.0|I bought this book for my 4 boys and from the first time we read it together over a year ago it has been a favorite of theirs. It has been a rare night that they haven't asked to read this story.  The illustrations are absolutely hilarious too! The chameleon in the story asks for what he thinks are the best parts of different animals he sees at the zoo. So as those parts are added to his body he looks funnier and funnier as the story progresses.  There is an important message in the story that I believe is a good message for people of all ages.  After the chameleon is all mixed up he has lost his ability to eat flies, and his final wish is to be himself. Great message told in a funny way. I haven't gotten tired of reading this one yet!!
B001DJLCPE|4.0|DR. STRANGELOVE: OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB still makes me laugh.  Watching it on Blu-ray last night reminded me once again what a fantastic movie this is.  Stanley Kubrick was a genius, and he made sure to cast fellow geniuses Peter Sellars and George C. Scott in his film.  For my money, the film has Peter Sellars best performances ever.  Though I had read that he was unhappy with the over-the-top takes used, George C. Scott is sheer perfection...and incredibly funny.  And who better to play insane General Jack D. Ripper than Sterling Hayden?    This is very much the perfect movie.  Great script (thanks to Kubrick, Peter George and Terry Southern).  Great cinematography, thanks to Gilbert Taylor (the man who would later shoot STAR WARS).  Great production design, thanks to the legendary Ken Adam.  Great performances, as mentioned above.  Plus Great direction, thanks to Maestro Stanley Kubrick.    Blu-ray HD transfer is not perfect, yet still pretty good.  Was pleased that the film was presented in HD-ready full-screen 16:9.  Black and white cinematography looks beautiful, even with slight aberration (unnatural grain) evident under certain lighting conditions.
B005D6442G|5.0|Dexter season 5 is great. This season is a transition for Dexter after the blood bath of season 4. The same dark drama, humor, and thoughtfulness of this show continues throughout the season, especially the later half. If you enjoyed Dexter before, you will also find more to like here.
0061974307|5.0|Great book!  Enjoyed learning about the cultural differences between Indians and Americans.[[ASIN:0061974307 Secret Daughter]].  It's sad that daughters are considered a burden among poor people.  The greatest lesson is that that Merchants' daughter turned out to be a moral, successful person and the son is a criminal.  Interesting irony!
1594744769|3.0|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is difficult to categorize. It's not a graphic novel, nor is it quite a picture book. The tale of a young man investigating his grandfather's questionable death at an old orphanage is illustrated with a wonderful bunch of beautifully haunting vintage looking photos.     For me, the characters lacked development and the plot was somewhat labyrinthian. Still, the photos had my imagination and kept me reading. Honestly, the photos are the best part of the duo and are well worth the book alone.     Rebecca Kyle, July 2011
B004GHYCKW|5.0|It's easy to dismiss Let England Shake as the least personal, most tuneful, and most straightforward record of Harvey's career - all of those things are true.  As a long time fan of Harvey, I nearly always brace myself for disappointment with a new Harvey record that sometimes shows up but usually recedes as certain songs lodge in my head and reveal themselves as quietly brilliant as time goes by.  Let England Shake exactly followed this pattern - I was dismayed to hear Harvey's voice stay in about one place for the record (although, that place is higher and more shrill than normal), but found myself returning to the songs regardless of their \\"conventionality.\\"  And I have to put any claim of its conventionality to bed anyway - this is a record where Harvey obsesses about war records, body counts, blood lust, and fear, recounting, essentially, the birth of civilization.  Why is Harvey so fascinated with events of 300 years ago?  There must be a reason, but as \\"Let England Shake\\" jangles in with a tune cribbed from \\"Istanbul, Not Constantinopal,\\" you have no doubt she means every antiquated word of it.  As the album moves on, Harvey reveals herself one layer at a time, climaxing in three truly perfect songs at album's end, \\"Hanging In The Wire,\\" \\"Written On The Forehead,\\" and \\"Colour of the Earth\\" that are as beautiful as they are bloody.  In the middle, too, the soaring notes of \\"On Battleship Hill\\" take you places Harvey didn't seem to want to go before.  Harvey has long said she never likes repeating herself, and rejects songs for being \\"too PJ Harvey,\\" so, if Harvey's new undiscovered terrain is in the world of conventional-sounding music, she has found and won her first battle.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|This a wonderfull Sting show.  With all success songs from The Police!  I just love it!  I can't stop watching it!!!!  The best Live Show ever!  The picture and sound are great!  The show design is magical!
0393337170|5.0|This book covers the Game Theory very well and is an excellent text for beginners. What this book made clear to me is that Game Theory is not just about strategy only. It is rather an explanation for behavior of people in different situations. In general, it is a very big and vast topic and it  won't be justified to expect one book to cover it all. The authors of [[ASIN:0393337170 The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist's Guide to Success in Business and Life]] have made a great attempt to provide an overview of the various aspects and situations.<br /><br />Actually, the first chapter itself is a good summary of the whole book and is aptly titled \\"Ten Tales of Strategy\\". In subsequent chapters, they develop these ten strategic moves with examples. A few of the strategies discussed include, art of backward reasoning, prisoner's dilemma, dominant strategy, etc.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book is about case studies, which further help to increase the knowledge of concepts. They could have made the book better by picking up some more examples from real life with business and corporations, since they help more to relate and out these theories in context.
B005529BDK|5.0|Running on an LG Optimus T. This is great for a quick game or for a long challenge, due to several different game play options. Definitely a favorite on my phone. Game play is never the same &amp; presents a good challenge. Controls are smooth &amp; directions were easy to follow, even on a small screen.
B003B96AOW|5.0|This figure is awesome! There are really no flaws with this figure. If I just wanted to be super critical, the only thing I'd say is that the thigh joints could be better. I say this because without his base he is more likely to fall over because of the weakness of the joints. I also wish they could have given him the joint in the chest. Nevertheless the pros of this figure outweigh the cons by a long-shot. His weapons are awesome and the paint job is spectacular. If you are a fan of marvel or deadpool get this figure! I also wanna say Amazon is awesome! They ship they're products soo fast! I ordered it Friday morning and got it the following Monday around 7 p.m. Anyways get this figure!
0553386794|5.0|Game of Thrones is a wonderful work.  I heard of it through the HBO series (which I still haven't seen) and tried it a bit reluctantly--Fantasy Fiction is not usually my thing.  SO glad I did.  Martin not only unveils multiple story lines but multiple generations as well and manages to create female characters as vivid and important to the plot as any in fiction. He handles this all with the skill of a master-story teller.<br /><br />There are old religions and new, ancient dynasties and usurpers, but what really keeps this story moving is simple human emotion:  honor v. greed, lust v. love, duty v. ambition.  There are villains and heroes galore--the incestuous Lannister twins, honorable Catelyn and Eddard Stark, undeserving King Robert and a host of others including my personal favorite the ambivalent and estimable dwarf named Tyrion.<br /><br />I can't imagine Martin being able to sustain the pace and the power of the first book but I absolutely intend to stay with this series as long as he does.
1594744769|3.0|This book is unique with the incorporation of pictures with the story. However, I feel like the story was created around the pictures to somehow incorporate them or that the pictures forced the story into sudden plot twists...the book wasn't bad but it didn't hold my attention at all. I just simply never picked the book up to finish it and I've read three other books in the mean time..
0345529057|5.0|The books are extraordinary! The author George R.R Martin keeps you on the edge of your seat and spellbound with every chapter. In each chapter Martin takes a character and transforms you back to that time and place where kings were kings and you trusted no one. The author has made this series of books a definite page turner! You will find yourself looking for every opportunity to read the next page! I give this author and this series the kings gold crown of all books! Amazon.com was excellent and I recommend ordering from them again!
0439023521|5.0|This book was traumatizing, shocking, amazingly plotted, beautiful characters and marvelous comparison of different societies and how people live (as in America vs. a third world country). Extremely revealing of human nature.
B000FA57US|5.0|Good ol' Halloween 5. A work of art. The best thing is Donald Pleasance repeatedly scaring kids. Also featured are like 5 fake scares in a row. From cats and a partygoer dressed as Michael Myers.   Also don't miss Michael wearing an old man mask while driving around in a sweet old Mustang with some chick who thinks she's with her boyfriend. Spoiler, he stops to let her get cigarettes and the cops save her. Not even kidding. Great flick.
1439196834|5.0|Me and my dad are both huge fans of the show, so I got this and \\"the Bro code\\" for fathers day. He loved it!!!!! The books are so funny! great for anyone who loves the show.
0307913090|4.0|The storyline is quite complex and the author does a good job keeping it moving between the different areas of the world.  The narrator does well differentiating the voices and making it feel like an old-England setting.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I use this on all of my android devices. Description says it's not optimized for 3.0, but I installed it on my tablet running honeycomb and it looks and acts great. Syncronizes quickly and cleanly with google calendars across all my devices including pc. Best calendar I've seen by far.
0316056863|5.0|This book is two things: an illuminating look at network television and women in comedy, and one of the funniest books I've ever read. Put it next to David Sedaris and Dave Barry on your bookshelf and remember -- neither of them has anything to say about breastfeeding and the Teat Nazis.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Bought this a month or so ago for my Viewsonic GTab.  Plays exceptionally well on a tablet (i.e. full screen).  Graphics and sound are top notch. Well worth $2.... or FREE as it is now on Amazon.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|A nugget of precise mayhem that never seems to get old. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman's partnership is at or near its peak at this point in their careers, delivering a perfect blend of wildly original visuals and unusually appropriate musical cues, and they get plenty of extra help from the cast. Mixing and matching bit players from dozens of sources, it's a true ensemble piece without a true focal point. Even Michael Keaton's unrestrained performance as the film's namesake can't claim center stage for long due to constant pressure from Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and a borderline-unrecognizable Alec Baldwin. A genuinely hilarious script dances in awkward beauty from comedy to horror and back again, leaving plenty of room for scalding improvisation and keeping even the most tenured viewer guessing about what's around the next corner. I loved it growing up, when I didn't quite get every joke, and I adore it even more today.
B004XQO90E|4.0|The Movie   Moon was Duncan Jones' first movie he directed and the second time around he again succeeds with Source Code. The movie is an intelligent crafted suspense action thriller that never lets up. There is not a dull moment in Source Code. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a soldier stationed in Afghanistan mysteriously wakes up on a train. At first he doesn't exactly know where he is and what is happening. What he soon finds out is that he is the main part of a project and investigation to find out who placed a bomb on the train. He has 8 minutes to figure this out, which is all the time the source code allows him. The inventor of the source code, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) sends him on the mission to find who the bomber is and what the bombers next move is. This is not a spoiler, since we see it in the trailer, but he can keep being sent back to 8 minutes before the explosion to investigate and each time he goes back he is faced with new challenges. In order to achieve anything, he has to overcome many obstacles and along the way there is a few good twists and turns. The film alternates between the real world and the parallel universe, both of which Colter is a part of. His main source of communication in the real world is Colleen (Vera Farmiga) and on the train in the alternate world he meets a girl name Christina (Michelle Monaghan). Overall, the cast does an excellent job and there is a believable amount of suspense going on. The characters show a great ordeal of emotions throughout which helps make this movie 4.5/5. Simply put, Source Code is one of the best movies to be released in 2011 and is worthy of adding to your collection.     Video Quality   The level of detail is excellent. The aspect ratio of 1.85:1 will fill your entire HD screen and in my opinion this was a good route to go for this particular film. The movie opens up with an areal view of the city of Chicago and the detail is breathtaking. For the most part the picture has a push toward a colder blue tinge that showcases excellent detail all around with good color accuracy. Close ups of faces are incredibly sharp as you could make out ever pore and wrinkle. The transfer even holds up really well in some of the darker scenes. There were times where the black level was a bit off and some minor aliasing issues, but those were the only negatives and was a rare occurrence.     Audio Quality   The DTS-HD audio track is near reference level. The bombing explosion of the train could be heard loud and clear with deep bass that shakes the room. Dialogue is pitch perfect and surround effects are used really well whether its a sonic explosion or in regular scenes where people are talking. This is a busy movie where a lot is going on at all times so even the littlest things can be heard throughout. The sound mix here is excellent all around. You may need to actually turn the volume down from time to time whenever the movie switches between the alternate world and the real world.
B004NWHVVC|5.0|I contended to my friend Keith that Bon Iver could not possibly have the Album of the Year as Connan Mockasin had just so happened to release the Album of the Year (at least in the US) in the form of Forever Dolphin Love. He scoffed insisting that how could an album with no reviews on Amazon be the Album of the Year?    Well, now this album will have at least one review so hopefully in his eyes it now qualifies ...    But on to the album ... this is one of those special and timeless works of art that comes around once every few years. It's not for everyone (B & C students need not apply) but for those with an ear for something new (yet old), different and exciting, this album is for you.    It's quite hard to sum up such a leftfield work as Forever Dolphin Love, so I won't even really try. Do yourself a favor and just download the epic title track. If you can't close your eyes and listen to that song and feel *something*, well, good luck to you in this world. For those that can, buy the album & enjoy.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|The Movie   Going into Limitless I did not know what to expect. I saw the trailer and kind of brushed it off as I thought to myself it was probably just another average thriller, but this ended up being a nice pleasant surprise. Bradley Cooper has the star roll and does an excellent job. In fact, this might be his best acting gig yet. His performance makes the movie very enjoyable and fun. Now onto what the film is about... its about a man named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) who is a depressed man that is a writer and struggles to make a living. His life changes when he comes across his ex brother in-law from about 10 years ago when he slips Eddie a pill named NZT that may or may not change his life forever. The purpose of this pill enhances the brains ability and capacity to 100%. Eddie of course takes the pill and he soon finds out that it elevates his ability to think and do things which opens up great possibilities for him.The Movie takes some twist and turns that at points I do not think it could even keep up with them, however this is truly worth watching if not owning then renting.    Video Quality   This is a movie that MUST be seen on Blu-ray. We have 2 different looks to the film. One look as a cold, dull, dark and blue look to it while the other has a brighter look with somewhat elevated contrast. The scenes that Eddie is off the pill have the darker tone to it and the scenes when he is on the pill has the brighter look. While the brighter scenes do pop and look excellent, that does not mean that the scenes that are darker look bad. Strong detail and black levels are both exceptionally good in both parts. Moreover, the reason I mentioned that this film must be seen on Blu-ray is because of everything I just mentioned. The mood of the film depends on what exactly Eddie's mood is and we sort of follow him through a maze throughout the entirety of the film so to speak. Simply put, the experience here is quite awesome.     Audio Quality   The DTS-HD track is exceptional. Dialogue for the most part is handled very well, except for a few scenes where I felt it was a tad softer. The score of the film is also very good. Music and other sounds throughout the film can be heard clearly. The sound stage does a nice job at whatever is thrown at it. I appreciated the parts that were \\"faster\\" so to speak with music and other sounds flying around the room.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Has Kurosawa ever made a bad film? I believe that he could have made a film simply about going grocery shopping and he would have made it a masterpiece. And, another thing, why is it that the colors in Kurosawa's films always appear more vivid than in other films by other directors?    Anyway, this film is a collection of \\"short stories\\" supposedly based on dreams that Kurosawa had over the years. All the stories, like all dreams, are surrealistic and, of course, based on Japanese life and folk tales. However, for once, there are no samurais monopolizing the film, which is unusual for Kurosawa. Even if there was no translation of the dialogue the visual aspect of the film makes it worth watching, like a painting in motion. Kurosawa was one of the greats, no question about it.
B004H4XLR4|4.0|Our son loves this new toy!  He won't sleep without it.  I love how you can see through the windows of the plane into the cabin area.  He can spy on his cars that he stows in there.  Big enough to put a few matchbox sized cars in.  Wheels on the plane roll and the wings are neat.  Wings are made out of a flexible plastic that is solid, yet won't break.  Good buy.  Son is 2.5 yrs
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This five minute video is essentially a preview for the movie \\"The King's Speech.\\" This can be quite useful if you want to know something about the movie before deciding if you want to add it to your collection.<br /><br />The video gives us clips from the film; clips of actors and crew working on the set both between takes and during filming--and more! For example, there are brief comments by Colin Firth who plays The Duke of York (who becomes King George VI) and Geoffrey Rush who plays Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist. Helena Bonham Carter talks a bit about the film and playing the wife of The Duke of York; and Guy Pearce also comments. Guy plays Edward VIII who abdicates the throne which forces his nerve-wracked younger brother, The Duke of York, to become King of England at a very dark time for their country.<br /><br />If you are thinking of getting this film, watch this and get a good idea of what it's all about. (And yes, there are extras on the DVD.)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Page turner. its good. Cannot not put down. better. How about &#34;You finish the series in a flash!&#34; Thats more like it! This series is so good i finished it in three days! Three days! I am hoping Suzanne Collins would make more!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers - the first two books were great, the third was okay at best.
0312600844|1.0|I saw somewhere that Franzen feels bad when readers find his characters unlikable. That seems to me the least of his problems. Unlikable characters can be interesting and can pull a reader into a book and through to the end. (Think Raskolnikov or Thomas Sutpen.) But Franzen's characters aren't interesting; they're dull. And, worse, they're not even believable. They're mere puppets created for his purposes, to do what he makes them do and to say what he wants them to say.  I gave up on The Corrections after about 100 pages. Freedom lasted little more than 50 pages before I tossed it aside.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I've been a Yes fan forever. I have absolutely everything they've released. In my opinion, this is their best album since Going For the One in 1977. Amazingly, Benoit David is a very worthy replacement for Jon Anderson. In fact, I think I even prefer him over Jon's singing on recent albums. Everything about this album is great: the songs, the arrangements, the playing, the production, the singing, the cover. And best of all, unlike pretty much all their studio albums since 1977 (with the possible exception of the studio tracks on Keys to Ascension 1/2) it is consistently good. I don't think there are any weak tracks at all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout!  It's a great 20 minute workout.  I use this dvd all the time and choose the workout depending on how I'm feeling.  Level 2 and Level 3 are equally hard for me.  I just wish the music was a little better.
0553801473|3.0|Remember when you were a kid in school and were forced to read some incredibly boring book because it was a 'classic'? And remember how you ploughed your way through it wishing that something, anything would happen to relieve the tedium of reading long winded exposition, description and dialogue?<br />Well I'm sorry to say that at times I found myself thinking the same thing about A Dance With Dragons as I did about Silas Marner. Not all the time and certainly not enough to make me want to throw the book to the floor screaming enough!.... but sometimes.<br />Don't get me wrong, Mr Martin can write and there were occasions when I was genuinely astonished and surprised by events, but, not nearly often enough in a book of this length.<br />It almost seems as if the author wasn't quite sure where he was heading with his story or as if he got lost and meandered around for several thousand words before he got himself back on track.<br />All of my favourite characters were there but some of the people just seemed to disappear completely, and some only made brief and very frustrating cameo appearances.<br />I'm enjoying the Arya arc and looking forward to seeing what the next book has in store for her, but judging from how some characters are treated in this book, there is a possibility that she may completely disappear, never to be heard from again.<br />Tyrian has been placed on a stationary bicycle, throughout the book he's pedaling, very slowly, and  getting nowhere. Dany has changed from the mother of dragons who won the heart of Khal Drogo to a lovesick girl, ruled by her hormones and damn the consequences. And poor Jon Snow, well, he's spent so much time on the Wall waiting for winter that he must be freezing to death.<br />And Cliffhangers?? they may be acceptable plot devices in TV shows or even films, but must we wait another 6 years to find out if '------- ' is really dead ? Unbelievable.<br />Note to Mr Martin ; I'm no spring chicken and at this rate I may not live long enough to read the end of the story so please, write faster and cut down a little on the length, my husband grew tired of letting me prop the book up against his back.
B0019M2ITY|4.0|It's a beautiful watch, has a delicate design and very feminine; eventhough it is a little bit shiny for daily use. In my opinion it looks better on picture than personally.
0439023521|4.0|Okay, I'll start with the part of the review that most people aren't going to agree with:    I don't think these books are appropriate for teenagers.  Too much violence and a very disturbing premise.  Had I been a teenager reading it, I would have been extremely upset by what I'd read and would have had a hard time getting it out of my head.  With that said:  I'm 40 years old now, and I expect the younger generation is far more jaded than I was.  If so, I do feel sad for them.  In all cases, I'll stand by what I said:  This should be considered light reading for adults rather than for teenagers.    But as an adult who likes science fiction/fantasy:  It's a really fun read.  Wish I'd gotten my copy the first day I arrived at the beach on my recent vacation.  This is the kind of engrossing page-turning wild-premise fantasy story that I enjoy when I've got lazy beach time.  I don't consider this \\"hard-core\\" science-fiction as it's spare on detail and the plot is uncomplicated.  With that said, it's really interesting with unexpected details in it.  And it's got some good themes:  self-reliance, fighting-back-against-the-system, etc.    As a total aside and because I'm reminded of it: My favorite fantasy novel as a teen was \\"Don't Bite the Sun\\" (Tanith Lee -- now repackaged together along with its sequel in \\"[[ASIN:0553581309 Biting the Sun]]\\").  Similar female narration style, similar weird dystopian future, similar fight-against-the-system theme, WAY less violence, overall more hippie mentality.  :-)     Thanks & I hope this is somewhat helpful.  If you're considering buying the book for your teenager, just be sure to read it first.  You may not agree with my thinking that it's too violent, but the safe bet is to just check for yourself.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the read regardless.  :-)
B0058P7KUA|3.0|I gave it three stars even though it does not run on my Xoom. Why three stars? Because it looks like a great game (I don't vote down games just because my device isn't compatible with it) but hey...it just loads a black screen.  Devs: please update and fix!!!

B0056NYMXC|5.0|From the arm pumping I'm Dat Chick to the sex driven Motivation to the sexy sly kitten Feeling Me Right Now, Ms Kelly is showing that at 30 she is a GROWN A** WOMAN. She does not stand in anybody's shadow she stands only in their light. She shows that not only can she sing but she is also a very sexual being. If you are to stiff to let yourself be free and enjoy the pure sexual freeness that Rowland gives you with this album then it is not for you. But if you want to go on a sexual journey then you need to get Miss Rowland's album. She is giving you everything you need self worth, the freeness to feel sexy and the ability to love even when you have been hurt by another.This album is a must have and while I may be biased because I have been a Kelly Rowland fan since her first solo album Simply Deep. She is a pure talent and if you have never heard her before then you should hear her now.
0553801473|1.0|I decided to read this series based on reader reviews of the first book, A Game of Thrones, as well as several descriptions of Martin as the \\"American Tolkien\\". I have been very disappointed. Not only does the series get progressively tedious, comparing it to 'Lord of the Rings' is insulting to readers of classical literature everywhere. I can tell you that this series will never become a treasure, will never be on school reading lists and is inappropriate for anyone under 18 due to the graphic sexual violence (and I mean very detailed descriptions of gang rapes, sodomy, incest and molestation) as well as equally detailed child abuse and spousal abuse (against men and women).<br /><br />In a series like this you do expect war related violence, awful crimes and terrible characters, but you also expect some good guys too - and you expect a point to all the madness. There is no Frodo in this series, no grand quest and few true moments of greatness from any character. I read books 1, 2 and 3 ... after that I tried book 4 and ended up skipping it after I read how pointless it was from other reviews. I didn't buy book 5 since the series was starting to turn my stomach. Instead I checked it out from the library, read 1/3 of it and gave up, returning it unfinished.<br /><br />If you are expecting another LOTR, don't bother with this series. In fact, if Tolkien had ever written anything like this he would probably been arrested as deranged and locked up. Seriously - it gets that graphic and frequently - less so in the first 2 books but book 3 starts the downward slide and Martin just does nothing to redeem the series after that.<br /><br />Just my thoughts - I wish it wasn't so, because this could have had been a great literary series with decent editing.
0439023491|5.0|I thought this book was excellent. In the beginning, Katniss deals with the fame of winning the games and the fallout from her fake relationship with Peeta. But it's not easy to let go of that relationship for personal reason (the nightmares at night) and the political reasons (their story is the reason they won the game). Nor it is easy for her friends at home - particularly Gale. She can't be seen in public with him too often and never emotionally involved. Instead, she's Peeta's girl...only she's not. And she's so confused about the two boys. Secretly she wants to start a rebellion and end the games. As she travels to each district for parades, she's aware of discontent in the districts and it's only a matter of time before a spark sets everything off and there's a full blown rebellion. However, President Snow's not happy with the ending of the games and he's made his position quite clear to Katniss. If he thinks going to make her marry Peeta and sit quietly while her friends suffer, he doesn't know Katniss. Before she can put any plan into action, the Hunger Game rules are announced. This year for the 75th anniversary, they will draw the contestants from the winners in each district.<br />Now Katniss and Peeta need a new plan - because they're going back again. This time they're each a bit smarter and craftier and they each have a hidden agenda. Can they outsmart the games a second time?<br /><br />I loved this book and it did surpass most of my expectations. There were things I wish Katniss had seen earlier and that frustrated me. Plus the first part of the book, there wasn't much action, except her comparing her feelings towards Gale and Peeta. However, once the games were announced, I was glued to the edge of my seat. I can't even begin to guess what will happen next and I'm desperately waiting for the next installment.
1416550550|3.0|This is a wonderful story but way too long and too confusing to keep up with everyone. You need a chart of all the characters to keep them straight. I too found myself flipping back and forth trying to keep up. This could have been told in half of the size of this book and still be enjoyable.
0385342039|5.0|Lara's life is crap. She just left her job to start up a company with her best friend who ran off while on vacation to hang out with a man on the beach. Lara's left to pick up the pieces of becoming a head hunter - which she knows absolutely nothing about. Her life is about to get...strange. At a family funeral for a aunt nobody visited, the body becomes a ghost that only Lara can see. Soon she's stopping the funeral with outrageous lies about murder. Sadie can't rest until she finds a very special necklace. She haunts Lara and guilts her into helping search and recover the necklace. Sadie, a lover of the 20s era, breaks through to Lara. She pops through on her dates, makes her ask out a perfect stranger, and forces her to wear flapper outfits. Lara just wants things to get back to normal but while uncovering details about the necklace, she uncovers some family secrets all while learning to cope with having a ghost for a BFF.<br /><br />I LOVE Sophie Kinsella books and this one was no different. She's so funny and puts her characters in impossible situations. SO FUN! I wish she wrote a few YA novels because I think they would also be excellent.
B001B0ZGC0|5.0|so glad I bought a good hardback copy! - not new but clean excellent copy. Although I buy many e-books a paper printing will outlast the kindle technology or possible destruction of the gadget along with the books.<br /><br />You'll want to read Tom Wolfe's enthralling tale of Sherman McCoy's fall from \\"Master of the Universe\\" as a highly paid successful bond trader on Wall Street who lives in a multi-million $ appartment in Manhattan. McCoy's ruin results from his own choices, through his cheating and unethical actions, one step at a time.<br /><br />But it's the way it's written that made me want to read \\"thoroughly\\", not to miss a thing! Yes, the story itself, but much more how Tom Wolfe paints a portrait of each charactr in vivid realistic color as they move from on going events to their consequences.<br /><br />The story begins with cheating. It's the old story of lies to cover up his affair with a younger woman. This leads to a hit-and-run car accident when he gets lost in the Bronx with his girlfriend - in Harlem's black gheto.<br />This story involves politics, characters of law - police, judges, a jewish mayor intent on being re-elected, all set amid a violent public racial conflict.
0553801473|1.0|I just finished A Dance with Dragons.  I gotta say it has been the worst of the series.  It meanders about with no purpose.  Martin introduced at least 8 new characters who play significant political roles, but had come out of nowhere.  No foreshadowing.  And almost nothing happened in those 1000 pages.  The ending?  There almost was no ending, really.  Reading this series is like watching Lost--the individual scenes are pretty good, but you wonder more and more with each new book/episode whether the writer has any clue where he's going with it all.  All in all, a waste of paper, if you ask me.
B000002KHB|5.0|This is a great album I had it a long time ago on 8 track all the songs are great but I bought it for never before great song I have a dozen or so purple albums I have never before live I like this version a lot better
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I'm not going to post a synopsis or anything nearing a spoiler as a lot of people have just been turned on to these books thanks to the HBO series.  If you're wondering how this book compares to the previous four in the series, it's good; just maybe not quite as good (at least early on).  This book started off slower for me than the prior installments did.  It's chocked full of details just like it's predecessors, but lacking a little in the action department as compared to the prior books.  I feel like this was done to set the scene for what's to come because the farther you get into the book, the better the story, the faster the pace, and a lot more action.  We do get some new character perspectives in A Dance With Dragons, as well as the ones that were so noticeably missing in A Feast For Crows.  Martin was smart enough to try to get at least one chapter in for all of the major characters in this one (I only noticed one that was missing entirely); probably because so many complained about the lack of certain characters in A Feast For Crows.  Are all of the questions we were left with from the previous book answered?  No, but he does at least give us a little more to go on and of course he leaves us with more cliffhangers!!!  One in particular left me a little stunned and a bit upset.  I'll be very surprised if that story line ends the way we were led to believe.  I don't think it will, but Martin has earned my respect by doing just this kind of thing, so you never know.
1423101499|5.0|As Kronos continues to gain power and attempt to take over Camp Half Blood and Mount Olympus, Percy and his friends are sent on a quest to try to stop Kronos and Luke.  To do this, the must go beneath the earth into the Labyrinth to discover its secrets before Luke can.    Along the way, their wits and bravery will be tested like never before as they face scarier monsters and are forced to look inside themselves to discover the paths and secrets of the Labyrinth.    The Battle of the Labyrinth is another great addition to the Percy Jackson series and kept me completely entranced the whole time I was reading it.  Humourous, sad, and exciting, this is one novel you can't miss.  For anyone who loves a good adventure story, not just children.
B003Y5H59W|5.0|I give this movie adaptation the highest rating possible the story line is spot on for the character even better than the original comics, the introduction of the cosmic cube so early on is a real bonus and I can foresee the return of the RED SKULL in the Avengers movie, the only thing that bothers me is with the re-imieagination of Thor I am willing to bet the cosmic cube gets written in as an lost Asgardian piece of super science and will likely dovetail into Starks last power upgrade from the last Iron Man movie where the ring was removed in place of the triangle. Mark my words 2011-07-27 lets see how close I get.    Back to this movie: It was hard for me to believe what a solid performance the former Human Torch Actor pulled off in his role of Captain America, I loved the inclusion of the Howling Commandoes too bad they did not put Tommy Lee Jones in the part of Colonel Nick Furry I rather think it was kind of assumed to some degree that the older fans would place him in that position anyway in our hearts.     Too bad they decided to use Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury once they did that it made it hard to go back to the original mold of the character. I loved the lead actress she looked just like the pictures of my Grandmother from the 40'.     The portrayal of the 40's was awesome they really did an excellent job of capturing the flavor and the feel of the times.     The character who played the Red Skull did a superb job. He was born for the role just like Arnold was born to play Conan.     All in all I really, really enjoyed this film and have already signed up to be notified when it is available for purchase.    The best Movie of Summer 2011!

B00192IV0O|2.0|As a huge fan of both \\"Elefunk\\" and \\"Monkey Business\\", I was a bit let down by the Black Eyed Peas' \\"The E.N.D.\\":  it sounded like Daft Punk produced a Black Eyed Peas album, and that meant a lot of generic, repetitive electronic beats.  I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk also--don't get me wrong; it's just that this particular genre mash-up simply doesn't work.  In the past the Black Eyed Peas have made bright, catchy funk-pop that's entertaining because it has some humor, warm vocals, and often times seems to celebrate music in the way it pulls sounds from older songs and reworks the musical themes, and all of that is gone here.  Where No Doubt managed to pull of a Dancehall album with \\"Rock Steady\\", the Black Eyed Peas somehow missed the chance to deliver. The strongest songs here are \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", \\"Meet Me Halfway\\", and \\"Rockin to the Beat\\", and in each of them you can hear the point where 'repetitive' gives way to 'monotonous'--it's that moment when you're ready for the song to be over and you've forgotten that the next track isn't going to be much different.<br /><br />If you disagree, and you really enjoyed \\"The E.N.D.\\", then you're probably also going to enjoy \\"The Beginning.\\"  Both are infected with repetitive blips and beeps that do very little to enhance the Black Eyed Peas' talent and in some cases really rob them of a chance to shine.  Vocals are often fed through a vocoder; when the BEPs get to sing (\\"Meet Me Halfway\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Party All the Time\\"), the soaring notes are weighted down by the redundant thud of bad nightclub beats.<br /><br />I wish the Black Eyed Peas hadn't chosen to go in this direction, and I'm hoping this style will END.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|When choosing a book these days, I pay more attention to the negative reviews than the positive ones. I decided to try \\"One Day\\" because of the upcoming movie.    I was pleasantly surprised, with a couple of caveats. It took awhile for me to get into the two main characters. Like the negative reviews, I didn't care for Dex. He was not very nice and the lifestyle he led, and the struggles of Emma in those early years, seemed fake. The book is English and initially about 20 year olds. I'm American and in my 50s so chalked it up to being a bit out of touch. I found the format difficult in the beginning, and a lot of the rehash at the end I feel could have been included earlier.    On the positive side, I LOVED the format as I got used to it. Because each chapter takes place a year apart, there are 10-12 months worth of life that have to be mentally filled in each time a chapter ends and a new one starts -- Is she still with whoever? Where is she living? Is Dex still with his last girlfriend? Have things gotten better between them or worse? The book requires the reader to fill in these gaps. The writer is skillful in providing enough information through careful writing. We are left to follow a trail of invisible bread crumbs and it does take a little work.    I nearly gave up early on. I read the Kindle edition and it took me to about 25% before I really looked forward to picking up the book. I did like it overall and would recommend it for those readers who like a little bit of a challenge. Both of the characters are unlikeable throughout most of the book, but I feel rewarded after reading the last word.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|I got this for free as the daily free app, and I'm happy to provide a positive review.  This game is most comparable to the classic \\"Tap Defense\\" on iOS.  In fact, the concept is nearly identical, with ghoulish creatures attacking in waves on various maps.  The graphics are vastly upgraded, however, and while that doesn't affect the gameplay, it does look nice.  The one drawback to this game versus Tap Defense and other tower defense games is a relative lack of tower variety.  I'd also say there's a slight balance problem, where you can easily be controlling a map only to have the attackers route change drastically and leave you entirely unable to defend.  I think this was included to add some variety, and for the most part it's a very good gameplay addition, but in some cases, it leads to an immediate failed game, since you can't predict how the routes will change.    A couple other nitpicks - the English translation is a little weak, and there is no way to tell how much a certain attacker will reduce your health.
B000EB73NC|5.0|I love how easy this was to mount on my bikes. Yes, even a girl can do it - without reading a manual. I needed the 2nd mount for my track bike so I could move my computer back and forth between my road bike and my track bike.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A gripping painful story needing to be told, not because it's new, but because it's it's real. I applaud the honestly and down to earth way Jaycee tells her story. The one thing you notice right way is this story is not told via the polished hand of a professional ghost writer and that's what I loved about it. Jaycee is telling her story, painfully at times, sentence by sentence and often repeating herself as in real time. I get the sense she wanted to stay as focused as possible in telling her story and it seemed she avoided adding to much emotion. I bought this book as a supportive tool but found I couldn't put the book down. Good Job Jaycee.
B0057A6GA6|1.0|Having played a ton of tower defense games this one is pretty boring. it does have decent graphics but that's about all I can say,  its too linear. Plop down towers on pads, upgrade, yawn. Very little.strategy needed, just quick fingers to.drop, upgrade and collect.coins.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|The genre is tower defense.  The music is good but repetitive.  The graphics are sharp and colorful on my 4\\" OLED.  I especially enjoy the dark and dead theme of the game.  Nice transition from all the space themed tower defense games on Android.<br /><br />It works great on my Samsung Fascinate.  Menus are snappy and there is a quit option to exit the game right from the in-game options menu.<br /><br />If you like TD games, I would recommend this one highly, so long as you aren't afraid of the dark.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I thought this was a really easy and fast read. I got it done in only 4 1/2 hours and thats including breaks here and there. I really enjoyed this novel a lot even though i knew a lot about the plot from the show. Im very excited for this series and cannot wait to read/watch more. Recommended to all!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I liked this movie.  Its great for all ages - kids love it, obviously, but there are many jokes that adults will get that will go over kids' heads.  Can't wait to see Cars 2!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wuthering Heights is timeless literature. I read this piece when i was about fourteen, and, although difficult to follow and differentiate between the Cathies and Lintons in the beginning, Bronte unraveled this work very thoroughly and revealed a ghastly and revealing story about two selfish lovers.    Heathcliff is truly the most despicable character imaginable, and for his feisty spirit he is one of my favorite characters.  Catherine is selfish and a character i feel a strong connection to on some levels.  Together these two complete a classic tale, which i would have fallen in love with no matter who the author. However, I am truly impressed with Emily's gal to have written this grizzly tale. For its time, this type of literature is a bold one, and for a women to write? Forget about it! That's a piece beyond the story I absolutely relish.    I advise anyone interested in reading this to pick it up and enjoy (possibly making notes, or just trudging through the beginning like i did, ha) But definitely read it twice over, at the very least, for a truly enjoyable (and understandable) read.  Anything below five stars for lack of clarity is no fault of the author, and is simply a problem with anyone reading the book. Yes, it is confusing sometimes, but there are pieces to that which complete the complex puzzle of revenge and human indecency.
B004GUSG4M|1.0|Some samples I've read draw me in right away and make me want to keep reading, but not this one.    The plot is a blatant rip-off of the movie Memento, except not written as well. The characters are boring and the writing style put me to sleep by describing all the routine tasks the character goes through. Doesn't seem very original or worth my time to keep reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next Collins series to appear, and I bet I won't have to wait long! Until then I'm looking for some other cheaper kindles like [[ASIN:B002R59EWQ See Night Run]] and freebies. No more paying $14.99 for kindles for me.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|I love this show. It is the best original series I have seen in a long time. Thanks USA for actually airing real shows and not crappy reality TV.
B0013AWVZS|5.0|I was buying this hoping it would be the perfect soundtrack and it was. As I listened to the music I could see the scene match so perfectly! This is truly the perfect soundtrack to the perfect movie. It is the perfect retelling of the final hours of Jesus Christ. May this soundtrack bring tears and joy to those who love the movie as much as I do!
B0002XMF62|5.0|The 1st and the best of the Tony Martin era. From it's great opening track The Shining to it's doom laden title track conclusion, this record delivers. The Shining, Ancient Warrior, Nightmare, and Hard Life to Love are my favorites, and Iommi provides some great and memorable riffs while Martin delivers some of his best vocals. The only true problem with this album is the absence of Geezer Butler, but Dave Spitz provides decent bass work on every track. Most Ozzy era fans will still overlook this record, but it's in my top 5 Sabbath albums. Black Sabbath is great band period. They are more than just Iron Man and personally I like most of the songs on this record better.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this in hesitation because I have seen how intense her other workouts can be. But I have to say I love this one! It gave me a great workout and I could keep up! I love Jilian Michaels and I highly recommend this dvd!!!
B003QSMC18|3.0|Walt Disney Pictures' 49th animated feature \\"The Princess And The Frog\\" is almost in the vein of classic Disney films (including the 2010 release \\"Tangled\\"), as it has everything going for it, from a fairy tale as source material, beautiful songs written by Academy Award winner Alan Menken, excellent animation, terrific voice casting and pitch-perfect comic moments. But there is one thing that prevents it from joining the ranks of \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Beauty And The Beast,\\" \\"Aladdin,\\" \\"The Lion King,\\" \\"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs,\\" etc. as a classic: the voodoo. I understand that Disney was being historically and culturally correct, as the story is set in New Orleans, but that element was way too heavy for a children's film. Bear that in mind when viewing this film. Rated G, but a PG rating would have been more appropriate, due to the voodoo.
0385738757|4.0|In The Scorch Trials, all of our favorite Gladers are back. Having successfully figured out how to escape the Maze and pass Phase 1 of the trials, Thomas and company unwittingly find themselves as pawns of WICKED yet again. Solving the Maze was supposed to be the means to an end with no more puzzles, no more variables, and no more running. Of course that would be too easy wouldn't it?<br /><br />Fast forward to book 2, the Earth has been torched by erratic sun flares which have virtually turned the global climate into a desert wasteland. For the most part, governments have disbanded and along with them any real sense of order/law. However, the sun flares have caused much more than just turning the Earth into a wasteland; they have also turned many of the surviving humans into blood-thirsty monsters known as Cranks looking for their next human meal ticket.<br /><br />So what do Thomas and company have to do? Well, they only have to pass yet ANOTHER trial from WICKED, in which they must cross nearly 100 miles of the Scorch, one of the most flare-damaged portions of the world where bloody-thirsty Cranks and all sorts of new dangers introduced by the Flare await them at every turn. If they make it to this \\"safe haven\\" at the end of their journey, they might find out more than just rumors of what is really going on and just how the nearly impossible trials of WICKED are supposed to do anyone any good in defeating The Flare and its horrendous affects on humanity. Readers are taken on a ride and fascinating questions are raised throughout The Scorch Trials such as WICKED's true purpose in all of these trials. Is WICKED really working for the greater good of humanity like they say? If so, why all of the hellacious trials? What purpose could running a group of adolescents through mazes and scorched earth possibly serve? Does WICKED have a much more sinister purpose and perhaps the Gladers are just mere pawns in a sick and twisted game without any end in sight?<br /><br />Characters are put through tests and allegiances seemingly shift overnight in some portions of The Scorch Trials. Perhaps the most intriguing character as from Maze Runner is the evolution of Thomas and the sense that a much greater purpose awaits him than any of the other Gladers. What is Thomas truly destined for and will he figure it out in time in Death Cure or will the Scorch Trials all be for naught?<br /><br />The answer to these questions are only partial towards the end of The Scorch Trials and overall are held at a tantalizing distance to be continued in Death Cure (book 3). Yet, it wouldn't be much fun if Dashner gave us all of the answers and we were left with a hollow and useless 3rd book this October. Sadly, Death Cure is still a little over two months away but if it's anything close to the first two books of this trilogy; I can't wait to pre-order it before then!<br /><br />-Travis S.gh tests and allegiances seemingly shift overnight in some portions of The Scorch Trials.

0470901071|4.0|Based on the recommendation of a friend as well as previous reviews on Amazon, I purchased the 7th Edition of the book, noting how badly organized the information was in the 6th and hoping for an improvement.<br /><br />It was not to be - information comes up at time randomly in chapters that don't make sense.  Chapter 5 has been particularly vexing as the errata completely screws up the learning process.  The review problems and answers at the end of the chapter suffer the same issues.<br /><br />I have read on Mr. Lammle's forums that this is Wiley's fault - please publish an errata list with corrections and I will consider raising my rating.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Mr. Lammle contacted me via this review within 24 hours to point me in the direction of the errata sheet.  I've raised my rating from 2 stars to four stars as a result, as students have the ability to contact the author and deal with him directly and receive immediate feedback.
0553801473|3.0|This review will provide hints about the book that some may consider spoilers.  If you don't want ANY plot information about the book before you read it, you will not find this review helpful.  It is meant for fans who want to know what they're getting before they decide whether or not to invest time and money on this long-awaited novel.<br /><br />So, it's finally here: the excruciatingly-awaited fifth installment to George R.R. Martin's \\"I eat  'epic' for breakfast\\" A Song of Ice and Fire series.  I am sure that most fans of Martin's previous books in the series will already be familiar with the \\"Meereen knot\\" that was largely responsible for delaying this book all these years.  What those fans will want to know is whether Martin was able to solve that problem.  (For those who do not know, the \\"Meereen knot\\" is a reference to how many characters he -- apparently unwittingly -- sent to Meereen instead of sending Dany to Westeros.  Getting them all out of Meereen and over to Westeros was apparently a big problem for him.)  Unfortunately, the answer is a firm NO.  He spends this entire 900+ page tome pulling diligently at its strings but in the end, Dany, while admittedly no longer in Meereen, is still not demonstrably closer to conquering Westeros than she was in her last series appearance, and she finds herself in a much weaker position to do so than at the end of [[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)]].  In addition to that disappointment, several of the myriad random characters who were on their way to Meereen because of Dany and/or the dragons by the end of [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]] don't even make it to her.  So their stories still have to be straightened out and untangled and who knows how long that will take.<br /><br />Meereen and the doings there (or leading up to getting there) take up about half of the book and about a third is devoted to Jon Snow.  His actions at the Wall are exciting to read, as he makes extremely controversial decisions in order to prepare for what will obviously be an epic battle with the Others.  We don't learn anything new about the Others, unfortunately, but the pieces are in place for that battle, when (and if) it does come.  And his final chapter is the biggest cliffhanger in the book.  Sadly, there are a couple of obscure hints about his real identity but no solid information.<br /><br />Beyond these two main prongs, the last fourth of the book is filled with a few chapters from old characters whose stories give us a brief glimpse of what is happening north of the Wall and far to the south of it, with a couple of chapters peeking in on Arya in Bravos.  Fans will be pleased to know that Bran finally gets where he's going, and even if he doesn't do anything much of interest when he gets there the \\"people\\" he meets make for the most interesting additions to the ASoIaF world yet.  (Sadly, no positive ID on Coldhands though.)  One token Jaime chapter gives us a major clue about Brienne's cliffhanger ending in AFFC, but he himself doesn't do anything except mend some riverland fences.  Cersei's two chapters are satisfactory though they don't answer any major questions about her ultimate fate and we even get a one-chapter look at what's happening in Dorne through the eyes of our old friend Areo Hotah.  A left-for-dead character takes us through most of what's happening in the North without a Stark in Winterfell, and we also get Asha Greyjoy as a POV character for the first time.  We even get an answer to the question of whether that really was Davos whose hands and head were mounted by the Manderlys.  The one major missing puzzle piece is the Vale.  Sansa Stark doesn't appear at all, and there isn't a single character who sheds light on what Littlefinger might be getting up to or how his plots will ultimately impact the rest of the story.  And one character we've heard of but never formally met in anyone's narrative getshis own POV to introduce a new major character who is either a big red herring or a complete game changer.  Martin has already dropped hints that this person is just a red herring, so it's unclear why he chose to bring this guy in so late in the series and what his puzzling introduction will ultimately accomplish that actually benefits the main story.<br /><br />So on the whole, is it worth reading?  Absolutely.  If you're a fan and you haven't given up on the series despite the delays, you'll want to read this for sure.  And if it hadn't been for the long wait between books, I don't think there'd be QUITE as many naysayers for this novel.  It's not bad, by any means.  It's a little disappointing because of what is left out and because of what does NOT happen, but as long we don't wait five more years (or more!!) to get those questions answered, I think it's an acceptable entry into the series.  (And an acceptable second \\"half\\" of [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]])  The finale is being framed for us, but all we can see so far is a chunk of sky here, some red and black blurs there -- nothing that gives us a real hint of what the finished jigsaw puzzle will look like.  Based on Martin's own interview comments in the months leading up to this book's release, he is well aware of the dangers of not providing a satisfactory ending to a series.  I don't think this book is any reason for fans to lose hope in his ability to ultimately deliver a satisfying conclusion with the seventh book.  It's engrossing and filled with great scenes.  But as the fifth book in a series of seven, it is responsible for laying the final major pieces in place as we start ramping up for the conclusion.  At this point, it's impossible to say what all of those pieces are.  Only Martin knows for sure and his fans will know that even after five years, they can still trust him to do it right.his own POV to introduce a new major character who is either a big red herring or a complete game changer.

B00001X590|5.0|Originally, I picked up this album when I was in Vietnam, played the heck out of it over there and played and re-played that vinyl disk here at home.  I really liked the lesser known songs, like 'Change in Louise' and 'Marjorine' and 'Sandpaper Cadillac'.  Rock, rhythm and blues are well-covered bases on this album or CD, as it now is...

B004A8ZX28|3.0|This film is too much like \\"The Bourne Identity\\" in it's premise - a person who loses their memory and the reasons why, who they work for and what they really do.    It's even copied \\"Bourne's\\" location - Europe and and just like \\"Bourne\\" features a European woman Gina (Diane Kruger) helping 'Dr. Martin Harris' (Liam Neeson) through working out who he is and what he's meant to be doing.    It has good action and its own little plot twists, but otherwise this film is known to anyone who's gone through the \\"Bourne\\" series of films
B004ZT9QVQ|1.0|I love Dr Who, but not uncritically-- which you would have to do to enjoy this stinker. Seriously, there are so many plot holes and idiocies in this one, it ranks right up (or rather, down) there with the classic Star Trek episode \\"Spock's Brain\\". Don't pay for this ep unless you need a Dr Who episode to watch with friends and shout at the screen, &agrave; la MST3K. Given how much episodes cost to produce, it saddens me that they wasted an episode on this drivel. I've seen better written fan fiction, not that that's setting the bar very high.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Got this as one of my first Blu-Ray discs and it did not disappoint.  If you thought this movie was visually stunning before, wait until you see it on Blu-Ray!  I was blown away by Avatar again, and while the story and acting might leave a little to be desired, the real point of this movie is the visual experience, and it fires on all cylinders.  Have not had a chance to dig into all the extras yet, but the family audio track is a nice touch, if you buy Avatar, buy it on Blu-Ray.
B004PGW2PG|5.0|I perform engineering at an aviation related facility, and most of my daily activities are encircled around computer based activities. I often times find myself listening to Sirius Satellite radio through my HTC mobile, and happened upon the Sirius book channel some weeks ago. Over the last few weeks of intent listening, I found myself growing increasingly impatient when Jennifer Eketta's reading ended, and I was forced to wait another day to hear more. I am not a Harry Potter, Twin Towers fan per-say, who finds great delight in the supernatural, or that of infinite magical powers, however as I began listening to your audio book, Jennifer's encroaching, yet detailed reading encompassed ever fiber of my soul. Her manner of capturing, expending and accentuating the members of the read throughly brought me into the story. I found myself listening intently, day after day, never wanting to put down my Ipod, even becoming increasingly annoyed when I felt hunger pains or the phone rang. As the story began to end, I felt a strange sensation of disappointment this afternoon, as I realized the story was ending without knowing the ending, and I longed for more.     I of course immediately Googled you, and found this site, thankful to see that another part of the story will hopefully unfold in 2012. As my thoughts anticipate the arrival of the next chapter, I hope that it will come before December 2012 in time for me to finish the read before the world ends (chuckling to myself) as Nostradamus and the Aztecs have secretly foretold. I look forward to the next segment with tasteful anticipation. This has been my very first audiobook, and what a book it was. Riveting and bone chilling all the while magnetic and ominous....
1439102813|5.0|Alice is a phsycology teacher at Harvard when she starts experiencing memory loss and disorientation. Alice first writes it off as menopause, but after  visiting a neuroscientist, she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease. Being only 51, she feels alone in her situation. Her husband is too scared to spend much time with her, araid of seeing the disease at work. There are no therapy sessions for the patient, only for their loved ones, and all her colleagues keep as far away from her as possible, uncomfortable with her situation.   As Lisa Genova writes about the rapid decent from top proffesor at Harvard to the mother who doesn't know her kids, she gets as far into the mind of Alice as possible. Many times while reading this touching novel, I would completely forget it was written in third person. I would be reading or two hours straight, leave the book for a few minutes and come back shocked to find she's and her's where I thought I had been reading I's and Me's. I also  liked how at the end of the book, near the end of Alice's painful trials, there is peace. Yes, Alice does not know who her daughters are, but there is no panic. Just an exceptance that, although she does not recognize these people, they are nice, and she likes them.
1594744769|5.0|This book is a great buy. It is an easy read (I finished it in a little over a day), and it is greatly entertaining. Although it does have two minor typos, the grammar and cohesiveness of the text is great given its primary demographic. It is disturbing without being grotesque. It is mysterious without being annoying. It provides a great balance between love, conflict, war and the supernatural. All around amazing book that I plan on reading many more times in the future.
B003UESJF6|4.0|Megamind is a breath of fresh air and humor.  It has the perfect combination of drama and comedy that easily keeps an audience surprised and riveted.  The actors portray the characters perfectly, I do not believe they could have done a better job with casting.  There is a lot of emotion in the movie and it causes the simple plot to be more complex.      When a young alien is shipped to earth by his parents, he has only the people around him to learn from.  While being raised in a prison, this isn't ideal.  While on the other hand, Metro Man lives a life of perfection; He has parents that love him, friends that adore him and adults who dote on him.  Megamind, knowing only bad and rejection, decides as a child he will be an evil villain.  When grown, Megamind has an evil plan to rid the world of Metro man.  By kidnapping Roxanne Richins, the supposed girlfriend of Metro man, his plan seems to be going well.  Metro man, attempting to save Roxanne Richins, fails miserably resulting in his death.    With the world at his fingertips and all of Metrocity under his control, Megamind thinks he has it all.  Until, he realizes he has no purpose without a hero.   What will he do?  So in true villain spirit, Megamind decides to create a new superhero.  While working hard on this project, Megamind has time on the side to woo Roxanne Richins in disguise.  When everything is said and done, what will Megamind choose?  Villainy or love?    This movie is very humorous and keeps ones attention.  Though there some elements that indicate an older audience, this movie is suitable for all ages.  I think that all should watch this movie.  Highly recommended!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|so i bought this because i needed something cheap and decent. the mic is built good the only thing that sucks it that the cords will tangle if you dont wrap it up properly (i know some people are too lazy to wrap up and organize their cables). the sound quality is good but it sounds great with some bass roll off and some raised in the 1k through 10k (i have a preset set up on my laptop to help me bring presence to dialog). i would definitely recommend these to everyone as long as they understand sound.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|OK, I can live with the majority of the effects updated for the original trilogy, I can even live with the addition of Hayden at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" but the one change that George Lucas made to Episode IV: A New Hope grates me to the point that, rather than be excited about this Blu-ray set, I am not ordering it and will not purchase it. I am of course referring to the Greedo shoots first scene (OK, the Jabba scene is also cringe-inducing). The reason the scene grates me is not simply because it changed a scene from the original trilogy but because it changes the character of Han Solo, specifically his endearing recklessness and shoot-first ask questions later personality.<br />I know we will never see that scene released on Blu-ray or even properly on DVD (the theatrical versions on the 2006 DVDs are cut from the LaserDisc transfer). Give the advances in branching technology the last decade there is absolutely no reason not to include the option to see \\"A New Hope\\" with the original non-remastered scene intact.
1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's is one of the best things I've read in a long time. It surprized me. I'm a lifelong reader so I've seen all sorts of plot twists and clever gimmicks, but this story built around old photos was fantastic and refreshing and smart. I felt for Jacob and Emma and the children and cared about what happend to them. Check this one out.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Unfortunately, at least on my Motorola Droid, this keyboard is anything but swift. I am a relatively fast typer on the virtual keyboard, and I can see where the keyboard recognizes each individual key that I have typed (because of the key being enlarged, acknowledging the keypress) but the actual text input does not actually do anything more often than not. Very frequently I have found myself having finished typing a word, hit the space bar while the app shows the correct word highlighted in the 'choose me' bar, and instead of inserting/keeping the word, it completely erases the word.    I give this app a 2 star rating instead of a 1 because it appears that the typing style recognition part of the app does work quite well, but I could not possibly suggest anybody spend money on this app. I got it as a free app of the day, and want to take it back because I don't feel the developers deserve anything from this. This is a bug ridden and unreliable keyboard replacement.
0316044695|5.0|This is a great read in understanding how our Navy Seals are trained and operate. And how backwards our media and Congress is in fighting wars. Excellent read.
0765324849|4.0|Like most, I ordered this novel because of my love for the Bioshock games. However, this work could stand on its own as a solid dystopian novel. Fans of the game will be immediately hooked when they read Andrew Ryan's opening monologue and hints about a \\"secret project\\". For those unfamiliar with the game, it might be initially tedious, as the first few chapters lag somewhat under a bit too much exposition. I especially enjoyed how the author was able to blend the narratives of both Bioshock and Bioshock 2 (especially considering that the story in B2 seemed slightly out of place). Additionally, the contrast of Ryan and Lamb's competing views of the ideal society were fantastic. Especially since McDonagh is used as the \\"everyman\\" character who gets caught in-between those two competing views. While I had some issues with the first 40 or so pages, \\"Rapture\\" was a story that I couldn't put down once it started to get its sea legs (forgive the pun). Hopefully it will find success outside of those who are fans of the game
B0028O9W50|5.0|great movie, and it was used but not a scratch on it. very cheap.the movie is just plain epic. its not one of those movies that replaces good plot with half naked girls like the mass majority of movies now, it is actually quite a decent story. i believe about 80% of america has seen it so why am i telling you lol. i rarely buy movies, but for fight club i decided i had to own. highly reccomended
0553801473|2.0|Like many fans of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, I devoured the first three volumes with relish, even re-reading them in preparation for each new release. However, I found the fourth installment a bit disappointing, a not-uncommon reaction. While the writing was up to Martin's usual standard, I felt the book failed to advance the story meaningfully, focusing instead on minor characters, sub-plots and disappointing developments concerning a few beloved actors from the previous volumes. But nothing much really happened. That book was largely criticized, and fairly I thought, for failing to deliver the goods.  So I picked up A Dance with Dragons in the hope that Martin (or his editor) would have seen the error of his ways and bring forth a more satisfying meal in the fifth installment. Alas, that was not to be the case.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of so of the book takes place contemporaneously with A Feast for Crows, and consequently concerns itself primarily with events and characters not covered in that volume. And a dreary 600 plus pages it turns out to be. Part travelogue, part wearisome character \\"development\\" and part fantasy food porn, what one mostly gets from this part of Dragons is a sense that somewhere in the infinitely labyrinthine and twisting plot, the story was lost completely. There are just enough shocking revelations to make the more speculative fans of the series sit up and take note, but none of the hinted-at developments in the plot  ever seem to get around to happening. It's pot-boiling for pot-boiling's sake, and it makes a lot of noise and steam, but there's nothing there to eat.<br /><br />Towards the end of the rather heavy volume the timeline catches up to the end of A Feast for Crows, but even that is something of a mixed blessing. Many characters appear for a chapter or two, do something of little consequence, and die or fade back into the background. New characters are introduced for reasons the reader can only guess at, because they certainly add nothing to the story. Numerous plodding and painful chapters are taken up with the tale of an army stuck in the snow, or the utterly un-interesting story of a would-be conqueror pirate with a penchant for human sacrifice.<br /><br />In the final chapters, Martin does see fit to jolt one or two of his most frustratingly indecisive actors into actually doing something, which is a welcome change of pace. Ultimately even that is insufficient, because by the time I reached the epilog I'd ceased to care what happens to any of them. A Feast for Crows was forgiven its many shortcomings partly because of the highly unusual way it was edited. That was six long years ago, however, and such excuses will not suffice for A Dance with Dragons. Martin needs to stop foreshadowing, promising, and hinting at the momentous events to come, and start showing them, if indeed it isn't already too late.

B00095NX9G|5.0|I'm still a beginner but I practice to several belly dance videos per week.  I absolutely love this DVD, even if much of it (most of the second disc) is too advanced.  I nearly always open and close my workouts with her yoga sessions even if I don't do her drills and switch to another BD disc.  The instructor is pleasant and the moves are clearly explained for beginners.  I do my best to keep up with this fun yet challenging workout.  Even if the workout/drills may be too difficult for some I would recommend the yoga sessions to any belly dancer, beginner or advanced.

0439023513|3.0|note: This book was very difficult for me to process--in fact, it has taken me months to write this review because I honestly had no idea how to rate it or discuss my true feelings, but I will try my best:<br /><br />The HUNGER GAMES series as a whole is fantastic, and since I read them all back-to-back, the first two books were still very fresh in my mind. With that in mind, I delved into MOCKINGJAY. I didn't stop until I reached the very end, which was a good sign. The book had plenty of plot twists, heart-racing drama, and intense action sequences.  Suzanne Collins paints a vivid portrait of the importance of the use of propaganda and images within the horrors of a war, and how Katniss has virtually become a pawn of the government all for 'the greater good'. One of the themes of this novel is the destruction and horror caused by war, and there is plenty of that for all: literally no one in the book is *not* affected by a loss in the war.<br /><br />That being said, this book took a sharp turn in tone from the previous books; it is much more grim and with less hope. You can feel the PTSD seeping from the pages. For some reason, this made it harder for me to enjoy the book. The feelings and emotions of Katniss and the other characters felt too textbook for my liking. There was so little hope or joy in the book that it just didn't feel right. I understand this is the way Collins wrote the book she wanted, yet it didn't sit right to me. Anyways, read the book and think about the themes and what the author is trying to tell you.
0545259088|3.0|Well, I had a feeling about Mrs. Stiefvater. She writes beautifully...but after Linger, and after Lament, I had a hunch. That she was one of those authors who try to prove a point by NOT giving the audience what they expect, and would rather give an unsatisfying ending then be perceived as predictable. Turns out, in my opinion anyway, I was right.     I just finished this book and want to chuck it out the window. I wish I had stopped after Shiver, because though Cole and Isabel were amazing characters and I enjoyed them, their ending sucked too.  ***SPOILERS AHEAD***    So...we spend three books hoping Grace and Sam  get some kind of resolution, only for them to get absolutely none. And Cole and Isabel? Nada. Unless Mrs. Stiefvater has a book 4 planned, this was a cruel blow to her diehard fans. This is young adult fiction!! It's OK to have your characters end up somewhat happy!! Do I mean 'Breaking Dawn' happy where the author abandons her established rules of her universe and turns the series into a parody of itself? NO! BUT perhaps more like The Hunger Games Trilogy-where the ending is YES sad, and emotional, but there is resolution and some sense of closure because the protagonist did, after all, find true love.    Anyway, I won't rehash the plot because I am just to disappointed and it's been done in countless other reviews. But, as a fan of the characters, I feel this book ended  on a cliffhanger-but with no book to follow. Not sure what to do. I love the author's writing style, but her conclusion left me so disappointed I don't know if I can keep investing myself in her books.

1250004349|2.0|Listening to Kristen Scott Thomas on NPR yesterday, I wondered how I hadn't heard of Sarah's Key so I cranked up my Kindle and started to read. At first the book had promise ... good story, dual narration ... and then it began to fizzle. I stuck it out to the end; it was a fast read for many of the reasons that other reviewers have enumerated.     What I was left with when I finished was how a story with good bones could wind up so disappointing. I know I'm parroting others when I state that the characters are poorly developed and shallow. Well, they are. Also, the book appears to have been written and edited in a hurry. It has no flow. Frankly, it's poorly written. The story of the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup deserves better treatment than the author gave it in this book.     I wish I could say that it's worth reading but, having touted books over movies my whole teaching career, I think this is possibly an example of a movie that might overshadow the book. Ouch, did I really write that?
B004WJRF6C|5.0|Impossible to believe but this little slice of nostalgia holds up. At the time of its initial release, I thought Paul was dogging it; the lad was not living up to his potential. His old partners were swinging for the fences.  John had Plastic Ono Band and George was releasing all his pent-up creativity with All Things Must Pass. So what does Paul do? He creates Get Back, Pt. 2. It was certainly not the Solo Interpretations to follow-up the much maligned Let It Be, rather it was a true DIY offering that in its current incarnation reveals the depth of artistry the young man possessed. Plus, the new sonic upgrade emphasizes what it must have sounded like in his own head.<br /><br />I bought this item because I had some cash and it was reasonably priced at my local Big Box Discount Retailer. I did not own a CD copy of these recordings, so I thought it would be a nice addition to the Band on the Run (Archive Collection) CD re-issue I had purchased not too long ago. Up to that point, I didn't own a CD of BOTR either. Plus, I had purchased the John & Yoko latest re-do of Double Fantasy and that double dose option was a clear winner.<br /><br />The bonus materials in the Archive Collections found in BOTR and the McCartney CDs are not absolutely essential, but they do flesh out the work that Our Young Hero was putting forth. In retrospect, this was a very productive period and while it is not the confessional offerings of a Lennon or the spiritual blast of a Harrison, it was prime Paul and worth every moment I have spent with him.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Just fair to my mind. So much went into this, it had so much potential, yet somehow still fell flat. And as a result it was something to view once and never see again, since it was all plot with little or no story.<br /><br />But...BUT...what if the creature had been revealed to be Gary, from the 60's Star Trek episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\": Kirk's \\"old friend\\" from Star Fleet Academy, the one who was endowed by that same energy barrier with the god-like powers, the friend who Kirk then attempted to maroon on an unihabited planet to protect humankind, failed, and then apparently killed and left for dead...?<br /><br />What if Gary had somehow survived?<br /><br />Imagine Kirk's astonishment when the creature's face appeared, reverted to its original form of Kirk's old friend Gary, and then he/it said to Kirk in that same dry, bitter, ironic tone, \\"Hello, old friend....\\"<br /><br />Now THAT alone would have made up for so many lesser scenes in this movie.
B003XSSR4W|4.0|This is an exceptionally nice recording of a near great CD from a sorely missed and unjustifiably over-looked band. At the time of its initial release, many folks considered these guys to be The Beatles Lite or McCartney Jr. Both views were, and continued to be, unfair and stigmatizing. They were the perfect band to reproduce McCartney's demos and they had the pop instincts of the Beatles, when those guys were at their poppy best.<br /><br />If only Badfinger had been able to break away from the preconceptions and wishful projections of their audience. This is a very worthy attempt to move this excellent band toward \\"their masterpiece\\", which proved unachievable. When taken with their other near-great album, No Dice, Badfinger produced what could be regarded as two independent halves of a whole, almost as if what the \\"The White Album\\" would have been like if it had been issued as separate volumes. This is not the equal of either disc in \\"The White Album\\", but this a very worthy listen.

B0046ECJBY|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who does not know much about China and would like to get quality information, understanding, history, and perspectives.  There are many blanket statements about China and this book gives you a much better perspective.  Henry Kissinger is probably the most knowledge individual about China and its diplomacy in the Western Hemisphere.  He had very close and personal relationships with many of the colorful characters we read about in textbooks.    One of the most profound things I learned from this book comes at the very end.   I won't spoil it for you, but basically I totally agree with the viewpoint that nuclear weapons are meaningless in this day and age.  No RATIONAL leader will resort to using nuclear power for their personal agenda, which basically means that the value of nuclear weapons are now null and void.  Notice the emphasis on the word rational. Diplomacy is the new secret weapon, which is the way it should be.    As an investor I am also able to get valuable indirect insight into how things are done in China.  GREAT BOOK!!

The bonus tracks just do it for me.  For a Britney collector, it's a definite must-have item.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I don't really purchase apps, so if it weren't for Amazon's free app of the day program I probably never would have given this app a try, and I would have been missing out on a lot. After labeling your applications (very easy to do), you can add widgets to your home screens that show only apps for a specific label, and there are a number of ways to show them. My favorite is showing just a few and adding a folder link which shows as the last icon that, when clicked, shows all the applications for that label in a scrollable list. This is extremely useful if you have a lot of applications and find it to be a chore to locate the app you want to use at any given moment.    After having used this app for over a week I can say that it's a must have and would wholeheartedly recommend purchasing it.
B003Y5H59W|4.0|There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in \\"Captain America\\" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his \\"Captain America,\\" before and after the transformation.<br /><br />As summer blockbusters go, \\"Captain America\\" ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.<br /><br />And the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.<br /><br />Joe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.<br /><br />Likewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.<br /><br />Recommended for all Marvel fans.e viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.

B004JHYRP4|5.0|It's been several years since I last read this book though I will likely read it again now that it's available for the Kindle. Isaac Asimov wrote The Gods Themselves during the period in time when he had stopped writing science fiction stories and before he adding to the foundation series and other earlier series like the robot stories. It seems that he took pride in the fact that he didn't write aliens into his books and he claimed that one of the reasons was that in most science fiction the aliens were little more than humans in different forms and that it would be very hard to imagine a truly alien culture but that it could be done. One or more of his friends (possibly his publisher) challenged him to write a story that included a truly alien culture. Because he felt trapped, he wrote The Gods Themselves.     I don't know if it was his best book but I do know, in my life I've read most of his science fiction books more that once and at this time of my life it's likely the only one that I would read again.

The oft-revived WOLF songbook of lowdown laments includes THE RED ROOSTER and SITTIN' ON TOP OF THE WORLD, covered by THE STONES and CREAM repectively; these are injected with a modern twist from ERIC CLAPTON, STEVE WINWOOD, BILL WYMAN and CHARLIE WATTS, with THE WOLF out front sounding almost as menacing as he ever did. WANG DANG DOODLE, HIGHWAY 49 and I AIN'T SUPERSTITOUS are also exhumed, although no new revelations accompany the flash treatment; however, a short tutorial from a weary sounding WOLF on how best to record ROOSTER is interesting to absorb.

0385720920|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk certainly has a way with words that I don't think any other contemporary American writer matches. Each and every line seems laden with sardonic wisdom and while reading the Tao of Pooh book at the same time, I saw a lot of similarities in Palahniuk's philosophy with the philosophy of accepting reality as it is, not as you want it to be. Palahniuk's books all seem so similar in theme and style that you can almost see the connection between this one and Fight Club. The tone of the books is the same and it's anti-materialistic, anti-Western collectivist, nihilistic themes are easily identifiable. Choke is much more satiristic and ironic than Fight Club, and I think in some ways that makes it a much more intelligent book. It's filled with subtleties and the surprises Palahniuk stories seem to depend on isn't really all that important in the end. What is is the motivation of it's main character: Victor Mancini.<br /><br />Victor is an entirely compulsive character whose main addiction at the moment is sex. He surrounds himself with other addictive personalities, mainly his friend Denny, and other women sex addicts to avoid dealing with reality. Standing in complete contrast to Victor is his mother, Ida. Ida's life, as we learn through flashbacks cleverly paced and sprinkled throughout the narrative, is consumed by the pursuit of destroying the symbols that society has created that bar us from seeing reality. We see how she desperately tries, but fails to impart this wisdom on the young Victor, who wants more than anything to just have some stability in his life, and to feel needed. The whole story, while extreme in plot and situation, bear strong resemblance to the lives of probably every modern American who has not devoted their life to being a hippie or naturalist, and there are at times moments of painful self-revelation and discovery as you read through the story of Victor's life.<br /><br />Beyond these strong thematic and satirical elements, Choke is a fun read. Palahniuk certainly knows how to turn a phrase and pace his narrative with just the right amount of repetition in structure to reveal subtle differentiations with each iteration. This book was intelligent, funny and greatly philosophical.Palahniuk certainly knows how to turn a phrase and pace his narrative with just the right amount of repetition in structure to reveal subtle differentiations with each iteration.

Ondaatje is clearly talented and his writing reflects that talent. However, this seemed to be more than \\"a. . . web of dreams.\\" It seems to me to reveal a weakness in the author. After reading, I feel like he just sat down and wrote whatever came to his mind and in the beginning that was great. He established a beautiful yet tragic setting that ultimately reflected the characters interacting within. He also built characters that seemed very complex and for awhile everything seemed to be running smoothly. Then somewhere in the middle of the book everything became stagnant for quite a while, until the end where I felt like everything went crazy and the ending was ultimately rushed.
B003W9I9JU|5.0|In this episode Dr Who finally understands the crack in the wall that has been following Amy and himself for such a long time. The crack was created by him from the Tardis. The Tardis was destroyed from an explosion and that explosion is destroying the entire universe. Dr Who's mysterious friend, River Song, leads the Doctor to the famous Stone Henge during to height of the Roman empire. He finds a huge mysterious box called the Pandorica. The Doctor latter understands that Pandorica is a trap for the Doctor and Amy was key to his trap. This is part one of a two part episode.    This is a very cool episode. I love the reveal where all of the Doctor's enemies teamed up to trap the Doctor. I also loved how his enemies used Amy Pond for the trap. Finally, I loved that Rory comes back from the dead but as a plastic android. For once, I finally understand why the screenwriters put the crack theme in all of the other episodes.
0143038419|4.0|I tried to read this book a couple of years ago and I didn't make it very far. I decided that since it was decent enough to be adapted for a film starring none other than Julia Roberts herself, I should give it another try. However, I found myself preparing for the worst when I read some of the reviews.<br /><br />I was surprised to discover that I really enjoyed reading this book. I think I was finally in the right place in my life where I could relate to the story. Elizabeth has come to a place in her life where she is really miserable and doesn't know where to go with her life. She goes on quite a journey searching for happiness and a relationship with God. I wish I could be well-off enough to take a journey like that myself. I appreciate that Gilbert includes histories and descriptions of each place she visits. I felt myself growing, at least in knowledge with Gilbert. The way she describes her experience with meditation is inspiring. Now I may even try meditation myself.<br /><br />It may not be my favorite book but I wouldn't mind buying a copy for my personal library
0553801473|5.0|GWWM does it again by subverting all genre expectations. Pretty much everyone fails to be heroic. Even the simplest actions get mired down in muck. Seemingly nothing gets achieved.<br /><br />For many, this can only be disappointing but I loved it because once again, the strength of the writing shines through - characters are well-written and deepened, situations feel real (except for a couple of coincidences that seemed too good to be true) and the background events get filled in more revealing that the present can never be free of the complicated past.

1416589473|5.0|As a long-time fan of the Guild Wars series, but never really into the \\"lore\\" aspect, I came into this book differently. Most of the time, I am not someone who cares about the lore of a game, background plots, things like that, but I decided to make Guild Wars my first-time trying to, and I'm glad I did.    This book is beautifully written, and I honestly cannot think of a single negative thing I could say about the book. It goes at a very steady pace, and the character development of the book goes from beginning to end. While some parts of the book were a little obvious of what would happen next, there were also others that completely surprised me. The simple method of detailing, descriptions, and the way the book is written feel like you're actually there in Ascalon City with Dougal Keane and his posse.     If you're a Guild Wars 2 seasoned veteran such as myself, or a newcomer to the game preparing for the sequel, I highly recommend getting Ghosts of Ascalon,you won't be disappointed.

I want to support Ewan and love it etemally.  I put love from Japan and tell you.  I think that eyes and the smile of the Ewan are really beautiful.

030716327X|5.0|My mom kept telling me to get this book for my son, and I finally did. He enjoys chewing on the little bunny doll while I read the book to him, and it's fun to have him touch and interact with the book as I read the story. It's a good one to add to your baby's book collection.
B004XQO90O|5.0|i was somewhat iffy on this movie i bought it mainly because im a fan of all the main actors in the film as in the four of Gyllenhaal, Monaghan, Ferminga, and Wright. this is one of the few orginal movies to come out in a while this is a great 5 star movie the acting in this movie is great this is a thiller at its best its a must buy for all real movie fans
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Delivers exactly as promised, including the option to wake with a gradual crescendo, and the ability to set and maintain multiple alarms throughout the day and week.  Terrific!
0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is a new author in the Fantasy scene, and the best one in a long time.  I am an avid Fantasy reader, I have read The Wheel of Time, Farseer Trilogy, Thomas Covenant Chronicles, (Of course Lord of The Rings) and A Game Of Thrones.  This book and series can be considered equal or greater to all of the books I just named.  Rothfuss does a wonderful job of beautifully detailing his world and characters, so much so It's like you are wandering The Four Corners.    As many others say it is original, it may borrow from the whole \\"Character is poor and is down in the dumps, then comes back and becomes a hero\\" While that may relate to this story, he does so wonderfully that you don't even notice.  It is like a behind the scene of the Hero's life.  And it is just a great adventure to read.     I highly recommend this book, and it's sequel The Wise Man's Fear.  A series that once it's complete, no one will forget.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|While it would be tough for any adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to stand up to the quality of the BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, this production does not even come close.  The quality of the casting and the liberties taken with the story line made it difficult for me to even stay to see the end of the movie.  Very disappointing!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I like the integration of the shopping list. The recipes are easy and the video segments are very helpful. I would definitely recommend this app.
B004T6OEHG|5.0|First of all the box: very well put together and organised with 2 discs full of stuff to enjoy, written essays and Rory's hand-written lyrics and musical ramblings. Really well presented, very glad I went for the deluxe edition. The music itself is different to Rory's raw style of hard rock blues: There's lots more piano for one thing an all in all a much fuller sound to the recordings; sounding as though there is alot more musicians involved here. Every song is great, the likes of 'Rue the Day', 'Overnight Bag' and 'Persuasion' are a treat for anyone not just a Rory fanatic. I've always loved Rory's style of music, his voice and his comand of the guitar and in no way does this record dissapoint. It's a must for any Rory fan and a great album for anyone with bluesy taste in music that likes to let the music take them away for a while.
0345529057|1.0|Terrible book quality. Missing pages, issues with binding. Worst of all, the first book has pages 300-370, twice. Was reading through it and realized that it went from 470 to 310 - 370, back to 570. annoying and probably the worst printing of a book I've ever seen.
B001TNGOXY|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was not great, but was pretty good.  It was soft, and really didn't look like a modern high-def movie.  I give it about an 8.5 on a 10 point scale.  It was plesant to watch, but could have been better.<br /><br />The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack was adequate for a mostly non-action movie.  The surround sounds were subtle.  I wasn't paying attention to the sound during the one action part.<br /><br />The movie is worth watching (it is wonderful).
B00518HBD0|1.0|I love(d) 3dd from the first time I heard \\"here without you\\" almost 9 years ago. The 17 Days album that followed was original and interesting. It had some terrific tunes, rounding out the 3 Doors Down style. It made me wonder if they could go from popular to truly great. Landing in London, for example, is one of the most stirring singles I've ever heard. And its not much like anything else that any other artist or group has put out.     The 3 doors Down self-titled album that hit a couple years later showed some nice evolution, although some songs did sound a little like the work that had come before it.     But this new album is really, really, tired. Besides a few not-heard-before chord progressions in \\"When You're Young\\" there's nothing new under the sun (or away from it) here.     I love you guys, especially you, Brad, with your hauntingly soulful redneck-in-distress crooning. But I'm disappointed. Actually, I'm ticked off. You guys sat around for four years and did what with your talent? You did nothing! There's no excuse, part of being an artist is managing your own evolution.  And if you don't evolve, you get real boring really fast.      Sorry it had to come to this.

B004TTZHBK|4.0|It's working fine on my terrible cliqxt running cm7, not even setting off watchdog, so it's not using large portions of my small power. Seems like a well thought out actual self-contained app, rather than the poorly designed website link or wrapper that a lot of other recipe apps are.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|this app has a great interface and a decent selection of recipies, i just wonder if they will update and push new recipies over time or if the ones on the app now are it.  either way the videos and the way the app is set up makes this worth the cost.    rated 4 stars only because of the question of new recipies

B000PC0U1W|5.0|Disc review:  I ordered this bluray in used condition thinking the package might be scuffed up some but it wasn't. The bluray itself is excellent condition and I'm happy I bought it used. I have it on HD-DVD but instead of whipping on my HD-DVD external drive for my Xbox 360 I wanted to use my PS3 instead. It was easier to buy this used on amazon than to use Warner Bros. trade-in for blu program (and about the same price if not cheaper.)    Movie review:  V for Vendetta has been probably one of the most influential films in the past 10 years. It has a very \\"anti-government\\" theme that resonates with many people; conservatives and liberals alike. Released during the second George W. Bush administration, this movie depicts the fascist state that England becomes if the Nazis had won WWII. It stars Hugo Weaving as the shadowy avenger known only as \\"V\\" and Natalie Portman who plays news reporter Evey Hammond. Evey and V meet when Evey is attacked by some of the state's henchmen. If you've already seen the film you know the rest and if not.........watch it! You won't regret it. ;-)

Maybe there is and I can't find it BUT if I find it or its added my rating will be 5.

B000003CMB|5.0|The original line-up of The Allman Brothers Band was THE best band of all time, and this recording captures the band firing on all cylinders. We've all heard of \\"desert island\\" albums, and this is one of them. Every record collection should include this album. It is truly amazing that two of the best guitar players on the planet (Duane Allman and Dickie Betts) walked out on stage together every night, and they were joined by a fantastic rhythm section (Berry Oakley, Jaimoe, Butch Trucks) and an under-appreciated singer/keyboard player (Gregg Allman). If you like Rock and Roll, the Blues, etc., BUY THIS ALBUM!! You won't be sorry.
B000VL9XE2|4.0|ire works is an interesting album. it ranges from mediocre mainstream to extremely technical mathcore. switching back and forth throughout the entire album. i enjoyed the more mathcore type sounding stuff, but was not a big fan of the songs that just reminded me of linkin park or some other mainstream band. i'd give it three and a half stars. if it wasnt for those songs, it'd be a 5 in my book.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a grat app. Loads of delicious sounding recipes, with step by step instructions and photos. I haven't had any issues with it. It is a large but storage on phone is minimal, almost everything installs to sd which is great for older devices with little storage space like mine. I love Jamie's cooking and this app.
030745455X|5.0|This book was much easier to read than the first one. Lots of suspense, action, twists and turns. I look forward to reading the third and final book.
0767836286|5.0|I hadn't even heard of this movie before I watched it, and I really wasn't expecting much.  I was so surprised that such a fantastic movie could be so 'unknown'!  This was a well written, well acted movie that was gripping from beginning to end.  If you're looking for a non-stop all action movie, don't get this.  This is a deep, thought provoking film that you'll be thinking about for days afterwards (well, I was anyway!).  It also has far and away the best ending of any movie I've ever seen.

0142000663|5.0|This is a novel that generated many varying reactions from me, and although I enjoyed reading it, I have mixed emotions about it.<br />The book is undeniably well written, with Steinbeck alternating a chapter of narrative that focuses on the Joad family with a short chapter about the migrant movement of the thirties as a whole. The chapters about the migrant movement are almost poetry. Although some leave something to be desired others simply soar with excellence. At first I was annoyed by this organization, as I was drawn into the story of the Joad family and hated being taken from it, but then as the novel progressed I got used to the alternating chapter focus and I began to like it. After finishing the text I can't imagine the novel without it.<br />The novel's strongest point is the characterization of the Joad family. Mr. Steinbeck has a wonderful gift of creating stark full characters with an economical use of prose. He \\"shows\\" us these people, he does not tell us about them. It is almost like you are peeping into their minds and lives, and accordingly there are many moments where much is left unstated. But Steinbeck has created such textured characters you know what has been left unsaid and have already filled in the blanks.<br />I loved the character of Ma Joad and her simple philosophy of life. She swings from the heights of authority to the shadows of self doubt with such fluidity and simplicity that she reeks of reality, and personally I found Steinbeck's first description of her (on page 74 in the centennial edition) to be some of the finest character writing I have come across in a novel.<br />Many readers are irritated by Steinbeck's overt socialism in the text, and I admit it is obnoxious at times, but I was not so bothered by it that I had to stop reading. I am not even sure that Steinbeck is extolling socialism as much as he is preaching the \\"golden rule\\".  Rather, what I was more bothered by was his lazy characterization of people with money. If you are a banker, or a corporate farmer, or someone with money you are bad, period and nothing further need be said. Contrasted with the rich characterization he did with other characters (specifically the Joad family) I was annoyed by this lazy attempt at one dimensional characterization. It takes away from the humanity of all people, which I think is counter to one of the book's prevalent themes.<br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an astounding text, and one that I found to be gripping and human. Despite some flaws it's themes of the resiliency of the human spirit and the strength to be found in family is needed and relevant. I was so wrapped up the in the last 150 pages of the text that I had to keep reading. What I was reading was wonderful and terrifying at the same time, and this epic (almost Biblical) tale merits your attention., or a corporate farmer, or someone with money you are bad, period and nothing further need be said.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book very quickly.  It was easy to read but hard to read.  I can't believe what that poor girl/ woman had to go through!  Prison is too easy for that pig and his wife.  It's really sad that a sex offender (or anyone for that matter) was able to get away with this especially with law enforcement checking in on him.  So sad.  Glad that she made it out alive and with her girls.  I think she has a hard road ahead of her (her girls too) but she seems to be doing great and have a good head on her shoulders!!  Good luck Jaycee!!  I'm glad you survived!  You are a Survivor for sure!!!

B004XWMXX8|3.0|I bought the CD for my daughter who just turned 12 years old and has Selena Gomez as her idol or musical icon.  Now she is going from Hanna Montana to Selena, I guess she is growing up and this CD seems to be the proper for her, I haven't heard the CD and I just hope to hear some good comments from my daughter once she opens the package.  Will see.  I read good critics from different sources, but some times kids don't care much about the critics; they have their own take on the music itself.
B0014BQQYS|2.0|BLU-RAY review<br /><br />No matter if you consider this film the last big studio western or maybe the first of numerous post-westerns to come, this still is one of the funniest, most entertaining movies to come out of Hollywood!

B004TTZHBK|4.0|Droid X, Gingerbread    When I first downloaded this app, there were some technical issues that appear to have been resolved.  The app no longer force closes and I was finally able to download the additional 80mb of content without receiving a licensing error.    There are ten categories with several recipes under each.  This is not going to be the one app you can go to for any recipe, but there are several videos to teach you basic kitchen skills and it's a great way to get started when you're sick of Cup 'O Soup or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

1416955070|4.0|If you're into Teen Fiction Romance books, this one will be perfect for you. It has a great combination of action and romance that made it so fun to read, I literally finished it in one sitting. The characters are all unique and have very distinctive voices. Often times with Teen Fiction everyone sounds the same. I loved the world the author created, it sucked me in from page one. Definitely recommend if you're into this kind of genre.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|had no problems opening the application.  It has a very pleasing interface and is pretty easy to use without direction.  has nice features like a shopping list right in the appropriate so no need for back and forth when you have it in a store.   I can find use for this.  thanks for the opportunity to get it free!
0439023521|2.0|I'm giving this book 2 stars because the ending literally ruined the whole book for me. I thought it was such a great book until the author decided to set it up for a sequel, and rather poorly I might add. She created these fantastic characters and really nurtured the bond between Peeta and Katniss, giving Katniss an actual arc! But she made the whole thing moot when she made Katniss so cold to Peeta in the end. It came out of left field, it made her unlikeable, it made the whole book a waste of time. It was so obvious that the only reason why she did it was to set up some kind of love triangle with Katniss, Peeta and the boy back home. Not interested. So forced!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|First off, I chose to download the additional content later.  This app is terrific. The layout is impressive. There is so much this app has to offer. The videos are helpful, the recipes are easy to follow and my favorite part is the apps ability to create a shopping list for the meal of your choosing. So glad this was the FAOTD; instead of ANOTHER game. Lol
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app has got a nice presentation to it and the recipes look really nice.  I look forward to trying some of them.  it appears to have installed correctly and runs without issue

B004TTZHBK|3.0|Update: it does not work on my transformer. It rotates and force closes, completely unusable.     When the prompt asks you to download media just say later. Then within the app you can download with no issue.    This is a great app    Samsung vibrant and Asus Transformer work fine

B000EMGAGW|3.0|so many people were hatin Mobb Deep when they signed with G Unit but this album wasnt bad at all...there's one or two tracks that arent all that great but for the most part is was solid...the beats were bangin and the lyrics were still grimy...Daydreaming is the gem of the cd no doubt...good cd to ride and bang to..i give it 3.5 stars
B0006GAO5Y|4.0|Seeing this again for the first time since it was in theaters 35 years ago,<br />I realized  this is a very odd film.  A strange blend of low budget 1970s<br />street grittiness and realism, and low-brow Hollywood fantasy and clich&eacute;.<br /><br />I appreciate the bittersweet ending, much of the writing, and some of the<br />acting (Burgess Meredith), as well as the very well done fight choreography.<br /><br />But other moments come off as amateurish improvisation, over the top<br />performances, and old-fashioned hokum (e.g. Talia Shire's absurd<br />physical transformation from over-the-top uber-nerdette, to sexy young love interest).<br /><br />Still, enjoyable and fun, if not quite the great film I remember it as.

B0043RSE2M|5.0|Let me start off by saying, I don't understand the reviews that say the 3D isn't the best.... This movie jumps out of the screen.  Granted, i have heard that the quality of the 3D does directly correlate to the screen size, so if you are trying to watch this on anything under 50\\" then yes, it might not seem as exceptional as it really is.  personally i have a 106\\" screen and there are multiple times throughout this movie where i feel like i can reach out and touch characters and items while sitting over 10' away.  Now as far as storyline, it's a very touching film and Gru is perhaps my favorite all time villian.  I highly reccomend this movie to anybody looking to add to their 3D collection.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|So far,  I have had no issues with force close.   Smooth.   I cook a LOT and this looks like it may have some great recipes,  even for my picky kids!
B0040JHF28|5.0|German composer Richard Strauss had an affinity for the voice throughout his entire career.  Among his earliest works are some very lovely songs, including one for soprano, horn and piano, and his final work is the glorious Four Last Songs.  He composed 15 operas and a large number of individual songs.  Some forty of these songs were either originally composed with an orchestral accompaniment or arranged from piano originals; it is from this body of work that this Virgin Classics CD draws its repertoire.  And what a repertoire it is--beautiful, heartfelt works, many written specifically for the composer's wife, Pauline--each a miniature masterpiece seldom heard in concert.  For those who can't stomach an entire opera, these are perfect bite-sized morsels--the longest song on this CD is only seven minutes, and only one other is as long as five minutes.  While many people think of Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, as the king of long-windedness, yet here is an entire body of works each as beautiful and compact as a diamond.<br /><br />Soprano Diane Damrau is a young German artist, an operatic lyric soprano who is primarily drawn to Mozart, and unsurprisingly, Strauss.  This is her fourth recording, and I look forward to many more.  I can't praise her singing highly enough--her voice seems literally created for these songs.  She exhibits a rare combination of delicacy that the texts so often call for matched by the strength to balance a full romantic orchestra.  Her sense of musical line, her phrasing and sensitivity all place her in the highest rank of Strauss interpreters.  Those of you who have read my previous reviews know that I am a stern critic and do not easily lavish such praise, but I find nothing to criticize about this disc other than the lack of information about the singer!  Listen to Dream in the Twilight, for a lovely example of Damrau's perfect control.<br /><br />The majority of songs Damrau has collected here are either delicate love songs or nostalgic songs of loss and longing--sometimes both in a single song.  The aesthetic and tone of Strauss's Four Last Songs is noticeably present throughout, although those specific works are not included.  But a couple of songs are more dramatic, even operatic, in nature.  The best of these is Lied der Frauen, or Women's Song, portraying women at home worrying about their men at war, at sea, in the mines or in a storm.  It's a spectacular work, and praise must also go to the 'accompaniment' by the Munich Philharmonic, conducted by Christian Thilelmann.  This CD gets my highest recommendation!s and longing--sometimes both in a single song.

B00006BNDI|5.0|This album surpasses all metal and has not been matched since.  Four lengthy songs in a symphonic ambient black metal style takes metal to its highest point in evolution and beyond.    This one-man band orchestrates with a thematic narrative that puts the listener into a dreamlike state.  Simple riffs are layered to create epic structures and are ambient in tone resulting in a range of moods while maintaining a trancelike effect.  Shifting harmonies throughout these themes creates a journey of intense emotion and heavy realizations.

Ideological impact is the key to this albums power as songs drive forth with outstanding passion and sincerity.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|I would have kicked myself if I saw this app having been free and not snapped it up. What a wonderful way to approach cooking instruction. Your cookbook is your shopping list is your cooking show is in your pocket. This may actually qualify as something new, something original. I have never really followed mr Oliver, but I can already tell that some of these recipes will be my favorites.<br />So, the review... You get a cookbook, with lots of step by step recipes. You get a shopping list with easy add, that you can whip out at the store, then pop back in your pocket. You get lots of tasty pictures. And!  You get videos on how to do the common steps, but with the techniques of a master to practice. All of this, and it's organized in such a way that you'd think there were lots of examples of similar products for it to pull from. But there aren't. This app will be a shining example of what value added, interactive,  instructional,  media will become

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw an episode of My So-Called Life. This series rang true with so many teens in the '90s, myself included! I fell in love with the characters without even trying. I'm still not sure if I had the chance to see all the episodes before it was cancelled, because, to be honest, this show was so larger than life for me, I was happy to watch Angela, Rayann, Ricky and Brian in any episode over and over. I recently caught part of an episode, and was immediately hooked again. I ordered this DVD set, and, as soon as it arrived, I sat in my bedroom and watched 6 episodes in a row! My husband thought I was silly, but was happy to indulge my little trip down teenage memory lane. Over the following days, I watched the remaining episodes and the DVD extras. My daughter and I will hopefully sit and watch this set together as she reaches her teen years, to help remind her that I can relate to her, as I once dealt with the angst of being a teen too. I highly recommend My So-Called Life: The Complete Series! I must have for any teen of the '90s and beyond!

0061784788|4.0|I've read several of James Rollins' action-adventure novels, including some earlier entries in his SIGMA series and at least one of his stand-alone novels.  This is another fun thrill ride, typically Rollins, which might be good or bad depending upon how you feel about this previous output.<br /><br />If you're a fan of very fast-paced adventures peppered with historical, scientific, and religious influences, you'll find this fun and distracting for a couple of days. There's nothing new in this seventh entry in the SIGMA series, apart from the rather bold decision to stage the entire story in North America as opposed to the globe-trotting adventures found in previous SIGMA books, including the most recent \\"The Doomsday Key\\" which took place in England, Rome, and other locales.<br /><br />In this seventh volume of the ongoing series, the SIGMA characters are as well established as they will probably ever be, and there is a bit of personal development for the two male leads (Crowe and Grayson), and the plot is traditional Rollins - secrets traced back to the founding fathers, lost science, and religious myths clarified or debunked.  Good fun and more entertaining that Dan Brown's All-American adventure, \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"  Recommended.

B0057A6GA6|5.0|I have always disliked tower defense or any sort of strategy game, but something about the good graphics and zombie story-line (ZOMBIES!!!) pushed me to try out this game and BAM! I am a complete convert. I absolutely love this game, the graphics are crisp and look beautiful on my large DHD screen, the story line is engaging (ZOMBIES!!!) and those waves keep me on absolute edge hour after hour and the weapons, my god the weapons! I want more more MORE, I seriously hope the devs are coming up with a sequel SOON. SOOOOOOOOOOOON! We want more ZOMBIES!!!    The only thing I wish the game had was the ability to sometimes pause the game and be able to look at the gameplay so I could map a better defense, but I guess it would be too easy then, but sometimes you're on the last few levels and you'd sacrifice a few humans from your tribe to the zombies just to have that power! I hope maybe the devs can put it in as a power or something similar.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|ALL of ABBA's albums plus singles and rarities in one collection? There has got to be a catch, right? There isn't.     Not since the time I went on an obsessive splurge to buy all twenty-odd albums of the enchanting Ofra Haza have I felt so happy to receive a set of CDs. ABBA are absolute legends. If anyone deserves a comprehensive collection, they do. From the mini-vinyl jacket slips to the detailed photo booklet, this is a stylish set.     More importantly, it's all here: the hits, the obscurities (\\"Lovelight,\\" \\"Happy Hawaii,\\" I'm talking to you), the big singles not appearing on any CD that you simply couldn't live without (\\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\"); the odd quirky choices (\\"King Kong Song\\"...what was that?); the sublime melodies you'd sell your soul for but they never appear on greatest hit albums (and yes, I'm talking about \\"The Piper\\"). Yes, they overlooked \\"I Am the City\\" and \\"Ah Vilka Tider\\" along with some truly obscure recordings, but mostly every song ABBA ever recorded is in here.     This is it, people. The evolution of one of the greatest pop acts of all time in a box. With a big electric blue sign on the cover inviting you to the disco.

B003Y5H59W|4.0|I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations for the Captain America movie. They're tried to adapt it twice before and... well, it was ridiculous. And I'm not just talking about the costume.<br /><br />So it came as a pleasant surprise that this latest comic book movie is not only better than the previous adaptations of Captain America's story, but is a robust, action-packed thriller in its own right. \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" has an earnest, idealistic tone mingled sometimes poignant realism -- exactly what it needs to have.<br /><br />The time: World War II. Scrawny asthmatic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) desperately wants to defend his country, but he's too puny to enter the army. Dr. Abraham Erskine sees the goodness and courage in Steve's heart, and enlists him in a top-secret experiment to create a super-soldier. Within minutes, Steve has superhuman strength, speed and big shiny muscles. HOORAY!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the army seems more interested in using the superpowered Captain America as a mascot than a fighter. Are you really surprised? This is the GOVERNMENT we're talking about.<br /><br />When Steve learns that his best buddy has been captured by the Nazis, he singlehandedly invades an enemy base and rescues dozens of soldiers. But this brings him to the attention of the Nazi super-science division Hydra, and its malevolent leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) -- who is the only other man as strong as Captain America.<br /><br />This summer has had a lot of comic book movies -- some were horribly disappointing (\\"Green Lantern,\\" \\"Priest\\") and some were wonderful (\\"Thor\\"). I wasn't entirely sure which kind of movie \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" would be, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well-written and solidly-plotted it was.<br /><br />There's also a lot of gritty, smoky action with flying bullets (and shields), fiery explosions, and speeding trains carrying machine-gun robots. But the writers don't neglect the human side of Captain America's story, whether it's his friendship with a fellow soldier or his budding romance with an icy sharpshooter.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is the MacGuffinness of the subplot MacGuffin, which really doesn't do anything except also be an unnecessary deus ex machina. Really, was there ANY reason for the Odin cube to be in this?<br /><br />As for the cast, they're uniformly solid. Chris Evans plays Steve as earnest, sweet and loyal, but with iron-clad determination and plenty of courage, and he's backed by excellent performances by Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and a steely-nerved sharpshooting Hayley Atwell. And Hugo Weaving is AWESOME -- this guy can play a Nazi in a red latex mask, and still come across as insanely scary.<br /><br />\\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is a lot like Captain America himself -- robust, action-packed, with a good earnest heart at its core.

0552555592|5.0|First published in 2010, \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" is set on the Discworld and is Terry Pratchett's fourth book to feature Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men.     Tiffany, still only fifteen, had been brought up on a farm in an area on the Chalk and - after a lengthy training period - has now returned home as the area's witch. Tiffany was inspired to follow the path's she's on by her Granny Aching, who'd always said it was important to stand up for those who have no voice. However, the Chalk's a wide area to cover, and there are times she has to push herself beyond her limits. Still, she wields a mean frying pan, is very good with cheese and, very luckily, she has the Nac Mac Feegle on her side. (The Feegle are a Pictsie race who were thrown out of Fairyland for being drunk, disorderly and rebellious : an extremely fast and strong race, their main hobbies are fond of fighting, stealing and drinking).     The book opens at the Scouring, a three-day fair held at the end of the summer. Most of the Chalk are there, but Tiffany feels pretty much alone. Now that she's \\"fully qualified\\", Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg are leaving her to it and people tend to avoid getting too familiar. (There's the respecct that comes with the position but, thanks to the fairytale image of malevolent old hags, there's a touch of fear too - an image that's dying, but hasn't fully gone yet). The isolation Tiffany feels is a little more pronounced, in that she's the Chalk's first \\"official\\" witch - although Granny Aching has fulfilled the role for the area, she'd never actually gone through the formal training and worn the hat. Things have even gotten frosty between Tiffany and Roland, the Baron's son. Roland is now engaged Letitia, an exceptionally wet, dreary streak of handwringing misery. It had been widely expected that Tiffany would have been Roland's intended - in fact, it was something the old Baron himself had wanted.     The old Baron has been on his last legs for some time, and Tiffany has been helping him deal with the pain - much to the annoyance if his nurse. Sadly, there's nothing she can do to prevent his death - though, tanks to her help, at least he dies happily. With Roland and his fiancee in Ankh-Morpork, Tiffany herself makes the journey to break the bad news. Having beaten the Elf Queen, danced with the Wintersmith and seen off an Hiver, Tiffany has now attracted the very unwanted attentions of the an evil spirit called Cunning Man - and she meets him, face-to-face, on the journey. He despises witches, and is bent on reiniting the fear, mistrust and hatred that once led to witches being burnt at the stake. If he succeeds in beating Tiffany, the temperature will once again rise.     Like everything else I've read by Pratchett, this is an excellent book. It's easily read, features plenty of likeable characters and there are plenty of laughs. On the down-side, I've never read a book by Pratchett that's felt so much like an ending - although Pratchett's personal circumstances mean there won't be too many more books, the thought of no more Feegle makes me a little sad. Absolutely recommended, naturally - though it's probably best to read \\"The Wee Free Men\\", \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" and \\"Wintersmith\\" first.

B0045U9WPU|3.0|Love and other related emotions are eliminated by a \\"cure\\" in this dystopian future.  The main character, Lena, is set to receive her cure on her 18th birthday and meets a boy, Alex, prior to doing so and her world is changed.  This is an interesting concept, but I found the book to be a little on the slow and boring side.  It felt like the book itself was missing emotion as well.  Delirium is on ALA's 2012 Best Fiction for Young Adults Nominations.  It must be because dystopian romances are big right now, but I'd suggest others before reading this one.
B004BLTNJI|5.0|If you liked the movie \\"The Others\\" then this is your type of movie.  This is an excellent adaptation of the novella and Stephen King would be proud to have written the book.  In animated movie form, it is simply outstanding and the 3d version is possibly one of the best 3d movies available.  Most of all, the movie itself is outstanding and very interesting. It felt original, somewhat old-school fairy tale from back when fairy tales could be pretty dark and definitely an interesting story with an ending that isn't obvious from the start of the movie.  I highly recommend this movie for adults and children and especially the 3d version.

While I really liked Sabriel, I didn't fully appreciate the world-building until I started Lirael and walked through it again.

B004XZ99LO|2.0|Not sure why troupes like this don't just release videos of their shows.  This is an odd movie of the life of a man from embryo to old man illustrated in some of the Cirque du Soleil dance and acrobatic (and aquatic) routines.

142311339X|5.0|Oh, how happy I am that Rick Riordan is back with some more Greek mythology stories. I've missed percy Jackson since he finished his quests, saved the gods on Mt. Olympus, and completed his prophecy. Although he is not in THE LOST HERO, other than just his name being mentioned, he still plays an integral role. I loved being taken back to Camp Half Blood, and some familiar characters, as we met three new demigods who we learn are incredibly important to the world as the gods have set it up now.  THE LOST HERO has it all: adventure, battles, comedy, friendship, family drama, mythology references, saving the world urgency, excitement, mystery, and a little teen romance thrown in for good measure all in a quick read book.<br /><br />In THE LOST HERO we meet Jason who doesn't remember who he is or where he's from - he just pops up one day on a school field trip. He's sitting next to Piper, who has her own issues because she keeps stealing things to get her famous father's attention and also thinks Jason is her boyfriend. Sitting near them is Leo who brings most of the comic relief to the story. When the monsters attack, we come to find out that Jason can speak Latin and refers to the gods by their Roman names. When the three are rescued and taken to Camp Half Blood, we meet up with lots of familiar characters and hear a new prophecy, and find out the parentage of the three new characters and what their quest will be. Along the way we meet new minor gods and goddesses, lots of mythological animals and people, and go along on their journey to building the friendship of Jason, Piper, and Leo and saving a major goddess.<br /><br />The thing I really love about Rick Riordan's writing is that it's pretty straight forward and written at a great middle grades level.  That means it will be easily accessible/readable to all of my eighth grade students; however, as Percy's fans have grown, so has the size of the new series of books - this one tops out at 553 pages. The beauty is that because of the excitement and pacing of the story, I never wanted to stop reading it or put it down.  Another change that was made for this series, that I really enjoyed, is that it is actually told from three different character's points-of-view.  The book is written in third person, but when we first meet the main characters, we're reading from Jason's perspective, then after two chapters we move to Piper's, and then after another two chapters we get Leo's.  I liked that the timing of the change was consistent throughout the book allowing me to know what was coming, but also each chapter was titled the character's name from whose perspective it was written.<br /><br />This book nicely sets up the larger premise for this new series by Rick Riordan - but I won't give that away here because I don't want to spoil the story!  Luckily, we'll be getting new Rick Riordan books every six months alternating between The Kane Chronicles series and The Heroes of Olympus series - with the next heroes book, THE SON OF NEPTUNE coming out in a year.<br /><br />THE LOST HERO is a must-read book for everyone who loved the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series: The Lightning Thief, Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, Battle of the Labryinth, and The Last Olympian.  You won't be disappointed and will be so happy to be back in this world again.

Today the Jamie Oliver app is free, so i installed the Amazon app store clicked on \\"get app\\" then it tells me i need to enable 1click payment, \\"OK\\" i say so i enable it on my account, but still cant download it because i don't have a payment method on file, which i consider to be retarded since the app is being offered \\"free\\" so once the screen came up to put credit card info on the website on my phone i decided its really not worth the hassle, so i uninstalled the amazon app. If i wanted to buy and app i understand asking for my Credit card info but if its one of the free apps then dont. Really! its time consuming and complicated especially if im on the go, or even if i were just laying at home in bed its still retarded, free is free don't ask for my CC info if its \\"FREE\\".
0525422943|5.0|I finished this book over a month ago (and I lost sleep because I was up reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore), and I'm still in awe of the genius writing of Gayle Forman. When I first read IF I STAY, it was because I had heard so much about it - little did I know what I was in for. Gayle Forman has a unique ability to draw a reader into a book and grab at your emotions and twist and turn them until you feel so caught up in the character's journey that you would do anything just to give the character a hug or a helping hand. Her books are not ones that you can put down. It's an emotional journey to read IF I STAY or WHERE SHE WENT, but one that you must take! But make sure you read them in order!!! (and if you haven't read IF I STAY yet, why the heck not?!?)<br /><br />WHERE SHE WENT takes place three years later and switches view points from when we had insight into Mia's thoughts in If I Stay to now seeing Adam's anger, heartbreak, and despair. Adam is now a big rock star and his band has hit it big and is heading off on a European tour, but Adam is devastated, and as the reader, you feel it from the first pages. The Adam I loved in the first book is still there somewhere, but he's been beaten down and lost himself when Mia broke up with him. The writing is straight-forward, but pulls you in instantly. This is contemporary realistic teen fiction writing at it's best. This book very much has the feel of a \\"one night in the life of\\" kind of story. It's takes place in New York, it includes chance encounters, it flashes back to Adam's perspective of what happened with Mia and her family, and it shows us where Mia is now.<br /><br />The thing I love the most about Adam and Mia is the way they are always looking out for each other. They are such a great, honest couple because they truly want the best for the other, but they've been through such grief and tragedy that they need to resolve those issues before they can be happy and hopeful together. The journey that Adam and Mia have to take to understand each other, forgive each other, communicate their true feelings, and hold on to each other is wrought with emotion, frustration, and love.

0439023513|5.0|* This review will not discuss any major spoiler plot points*<br /><br />Have you had the experience with a book where...you get to the end and realize that you read the book so fast because you couldn't wait to find out what happens that you actually want to reread it so you can savor the story the second time? That is what reading MOCKINGJAY was like for me - it's just one of those books.  If you haven't yet read the first two books: The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, you must!  Now that I've seen where Katniss' journey was ultimately headed by the end, I'm so glad I went along with her!<br /><br />From \\"The Ashes\\" to \\"The Assault\\" to \\"The Assasin\\" the plot of this story kept me on the edge of my seat flipping pages as fast as I could to find out what would happen to Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Finnick, and Prim next.  It was action-packed with twists and turns I wasn't expecting, although with one major one that I saw coming but was hoping for, that kept me guessing as to where the story would end up, but always hoping Katniss would find her way through. It was like uncovering the windows to see a view into the hidden worlds of Panem that I couldn't image in District 13 and the Capitol. It was honest, hopeful, gruesome, empowering, soul-searching, and heartbreaking all at the same time.<br /><br />It was truly Katniss' journey to hurt, heal, discover herself, and ultimately find hope in the world she lives in and the role she's been forced into. I really enjoyed the development and growth of the stories of the secondary characters in this final installment.  However, this story is all about Katniss and how she must move past the horrors she's seen in two Hunger Games and to discover who she is meant to be and what kind of person she wants to be and how to become that person, do what's right for her, and help the ones she loves. All of this while dealing with carrying the weight of the entire citizenry of this country at war (which in reality has been at war for 75 years) on her shoulders. Many people talk about Team Peeta or Team Gale, and there is a satisfying conclusion to that piece of the storyline, but really, this series is not about a love triangle at all. It's about growth for these characters, these children, who have to mature and work out a world they've been thrust into, growing up faster than they should ever have to, and the mistakes they make and the way they find their way through.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins crafted a page-turning story throughout all three of the books in the series that constantly surprise the reader and leave a sense of hope and rooting for for those that survived. This third one was an emotional journey, but I would say this trilogy is one of the best YA series out there!<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendshoulders.

0525423842|4.0|I've like John Grisham's adult books, so I was really intrigued to read this one.  There's just something about series books that are obviously intended to be a series from the start so the ending feels a little incomplete that throws me off sometimes, and this is one of those.  Overall, the story was cute with Theo and all of his knowledge of the law and his ability to be in with the judges and other court workers when a big trial is starting. There is quite a bit of law speak in this book, but it is explained pretty well. The plot kept moving fairly well and kept me interested. Overall, I think this is a book for those students who like to watch the procedural shows on TV and would be interested in trial stories and a new series.<br /><br />Mini-Review originally posted at Heise Reads & Recommends

0545259088|5.0|Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommends<br /><br />I fell in love with Maggie Stiefvater's writing when I read SHIVER, the first book in the trilogy. Of course, the fact that I had heard Maggie speak at a conference, and her personality engaged and entertained me from the start, helped me realize that I needed to read her writing. As soon as I read it, I knew I loved it - and promoted it to all of my students as better than Twilight (and for 8th grade girls, that was a big deal!) The things that I loved most about the start of the series was the unique mythology of the wolves, the plotting of the building tension of the book, and the beautifully lyrical way in which Maggie writes - along with the sweet honesty of the love between Grace and Sam.<br /><br />I feel as if this is a bittersweet review for me because I've so loved living in the world of The Wolves of Mercy Falls, so I'm sad to leave them, but I feel good about where things were left in the end. However, I do have to say, the end of the book is a little open-ended. Things are all wrapped up, but it's not necessarily a happy ending for all, nor is their entire future certain. The overwhelming feeling I had at the end of this final book was one of peace with each main character's place in the world and satisfaction with the choices they had made to get to where they were. And hope for their futures. There was a sense of each character knowing themselves better by the end - who they wanted to be and who they really were and how they could be happy.<br /><br />There were twists in this book and with certain characters who acted differently than expected, but in a good way. It's ultimately a love story - a sweet, tragic, complicated, deep, meant-to-be love between Sam and Grace. It's a love between Sam and his adoptive father Beck. It's a love between Cole and his bandmates. It's about these characters fighting for their loved ones and struggling to find a way out of the mess that is the wolf hunt, in order to save those they love - all written in Maggie's beautiful, lyrical writing. There is a subtleness to the story, in the everyday descriptions and events taking place within the bigger context of the plot. There is also a ticking clock in the back of the reader's mind as the hunt gets closer. I have to say that I think Cole is one of my favorite characters, mostly in his interactions with Isabel, but also for the journey he makes to become the person he is at the end. There is a sense of redemption to this story for all of the characters as they face up to their mistakes in the past and figure out a way to face the future head on. The plot keeps moving and kept me turning pages. When I saw Maggie at her signing she said that she started writing in order to make her reader's cry, and you might just shed a few tears over certain characters, and the ending of this beautiful series. If you haven't read any of it yet, go get the books now, and if you haven't read this final one, do so soon!they love - all written in Maggie's beautiful, lyrical writing.

0545140323|5.0|Sometimes I really want a light-hearted book without all the angst and drama of a lot of the popular YA books/genres out there right now, and to get a good girl-power message - even better. That's exactly what I got with Elizabeth Eulberg's debut novel, THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB, plus I got a little Beatles nostalgia along with it. I was drawn to it as soon as I heard the plot summary, but of course, the cover sold me on getting it in hardcover - it's so fun!<br /><br />This book is a story with an independent high school junior girl main character who gets treated badly by a boy she's had a crush on for a long time. The girl - Penny Lane (a Beatles song of course since her parents are huge fans) - decides she's not going to deal with one more boy treating her badly, so she swears off dating for the rest of high school. Thus starts the lonely hearts club (inspired of course by the Beatles' Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band). Once word gets out, other girls decide they don't want to deal with immature boys who treat them badly either, and they see how much fun the girls in the club are having, so the club gets a reputation around the school.<br /><br />There's a really important message coming out of reading this story - it's not just about not dealing with the boy drama, but it's more about what it means to be a good friend to the girls around you.  It's about keeping your friends honest, being there for each other, and not letting boys change your priorities. The club's rules say that a girl can't change who she is for a guy, she can't ditch her friends for a guy, she can't let a guy take over her whole life and forget about her friends - what a great message to send teen girls who need to remember that when they get to high school and boy drama and pressure becomes so much more of a part of their lives.<br /><br />I think the highlight about this book for me was that even though it deals with the typical boyfriend drama of high school girls, it's done in a unique way in which the girls still get to be strong characters. I do wish some of the secondary characters had the chance to be developed a little more fully because they had the potential to really add to the story more than they were able to with the length of the book, but it was it will be an accessible book for many adolescent girls - and it doesn't cross the line into mature content. I loved this book for it's light-heartedness, great message, and fun story (with a Beatles twist) and am glad I found it.<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendsirls still get to be strong characters.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|I have MetroPCS' Samsung Galaxy Indulge (no rooting).   I did two simple searches, &quot;Sebeka&quot; and &quot;Mounds View&quot;. It didn't just get the location of the towns correct (Minnesota), it have me way more information I could ever hope for on my best day on Yahoo, Google, Bing and Ask, COMBINED! That was enough to convince me. The reviewers that complain it's not Google must really like wasting their time changing and rephrasing their parameters to TRY and get ANY INFORMATION that even REMOTELY RESEMBLES what they are looking for.  I didn't do any complex math equations yet, I figured the plethora of testimonials to that was convincing enough.  HTC Thunderbolt users, GET A CLUE, IT FORCE CLOSES YOUR PHONE! Adoy! Unless the developer fixed your particular issue and you want to let the other Thunderbolt brainiacs know, then THAT is acceptable.  Whiny reviews about how it doesn't work on your phone are absolutely worthless if you have DONE NOTHING to try to get a resolution from the developer. Tech support weighs heavily in my opinions.
1423113381|4.0|THE RED PYRAMID is the first book in The Kane Chronicles, a great new series for anyone who liked Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, here is a new one to keep you going on epic quests. Just like Percy, Sadie and Carter Kane are on a journey of self-discovery and learning about a world they didn't know existed hidden behind their own regular world, but this time it is the Egyptian gods and goddesses. As they didn't spend much time together growing up, they are building their brother/sister relationship throughout the book. They somewhat remind me of Dan and Amy from The 39 Clues series - a great brother/sister team who look out for each other.<br /><br />Although The Red Pyramid book is longer, and takes a little longer to read due to being mostly unfamiliar with Egyptian mythology (unlike the Greek gods and goddesses who were familiar in Percy Jackson), it is still well worth your time to read. It is written at a level that is appropriate for middle school students, and has enough excitement and action to keep one interested, although you have to pay attention to the explanations of the mythology to follow along with what's happening in the story.<br /><br />The story starts off when Carter and his dad, who have been traveling around the world for his dad's work as an expert, come back to London for one of their visits to Sadie, who lives with their grandparents after their mom died.  Dad takes Carter and Sadie with him to the history museum, and when they witness him unleashing gods from the Rosetta Stone, and he disappears, they don't know what to think. Luckily, the next day their Uncle Amos shows up to take them to the U.S. where they learn that they are actually descended from a line of pharaohs which makes them magicians. Along with this knowledge, and the dream visions they start having, they learn that some other magicians aren't too happy with them and that's when the attacks start.  Ultimately, they need to face Set, who is trying to unleash chaos, so they can bring the gods and magicians together to keep chaos from changing the whole world.<br /><br />One thing that is important to note when reading this book is that it is told through the voices/points of view of both Carter and Sadie. Make sure to look at the chapter headings and the tops of each page to keep track of which character is the \\"I\\" in each chapter. Although, it is one of the things I like best about this book because you do get good insights into the whole story because you know things from both main characters, it can be confusing if you're not paying attention.<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendsthey can bring the gods and magicians together to keep chaos from changing the whole world.

0061726826|5.0|It's been a few days since I finished reading DELIRIUM, and I can't get Lena's story out of my head. It's a haunting story about love and trust and opening one's eyes to the world around you. Disclaimer: I love dystopian novels - there's just something about stepping into a world that is like ours, but has a different view on something that drastically changes how people live. In this case - love. Love is seen as a disease that can kill, so they've created a procedure (basically brain surgery) that eliminates the possibility of any form of love from those 18 and older. Everyone has the surgery because they're scared not to because they've seen how crazy love has driven others. They believe the world is a better place this way, and Lena believes what she's been told as she is ninety-five days away from her procedure when the book begins. What she doesn't completely see is how unengaged all of the Cureds are. DELIRIUM reminds me a bit of Matched meets Uglies with a little Hunger Games thrown in. And if it reminds me of three of my favorite dystopians, you know I loved this one, too.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Oliver since reading BEFORE I FALL in which her writing and story arc made me grow to care about a character who was dislikable in the beginning - and that takes quite a bit of talent to make one feel so strongly one way and then be able to guide them toward another through the course of a book. She has a beautiful writing style with descriptions that grab you and heart-wrenching moments and a way that makes you live in this world and care about these people. She makes you want to jump right in and grab them sometimes and cry when they cry and fear when they fear and love when they love. Lauren Oliver's writing is a sophisticated writing style with a literary feel to it. It's writing that makes me really feel for the characters and what they're living through, while feeling fully engaged in the story and the world that she's created. This novel deals with the idea that if you can't feel pain, you can't really live and love - it's all a part of the same emotion.<br /><br />DELIRIUM was a long book, but a page-turner. It's starts off more subtle, but leads to heart-pounding chance scenes. Following Lena and her discovery of living in a world of lies, a world ruled by fear, made me frustrated at times, brought tears to my eyes at others, and made me want to push her in the right directions as she started to make her own choices and live for herself as she discovered who she was for herself. I almost liked the secondary characters, Alex and Hana and Gracie (there better be more of her in the next book!), more than Lena for many parts of the book; although Lena was the most fully developed character. It became a race to the finish, a ticking clock to beat a deadline, and a hope that friendship and love would win out in a world that doesn't believe in the goodness of love. And the end, oh the end...while feeling resolute also left me really wanting to know what happens in the next few minutes after the book leaves the scene. It's really the end that I can't get out of my head, and the choices made by Lena and Alex, and how they fulfill their hopes and dreams, and how they feel about them that sticks with me the most.<br /><br />It's going to feel like a really long wait for book 2, PANDEMONIUM, in 2012 and book 3, REQUIEM, in 2013.<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendst if you can't feel pain, you can't really live and love - it's all a part of the same emotion.

0142418471|4.0|First of all, I need to say, these two authors are both amazing in their own right, but put them together and you get an explosion of awesomeness. However, they definitely don't pull any punches with their writing - it's very mature (in content and theme), intelligent, and in your face. The pacing never lets you put the book down as you first wonder how the two Will Grayson characters are going to meet and then, once they do, how this epic high school musical is going to be pulled off at the end and where that will leave all of the various relationships.<br /><br />This collaborative novel is written in alternating chapters between the two Will's voices. Stylistically, the two Will's are distinguished not only by their uniquely strong voices, but also the format in which his chapter was written (Will #2 does not use any capitalization or quotation marks and writes in an instant messaging style for dialogue). They are fresh, honest, confused, damaged, conflicted, real teen voices. One is gay, one is straight with a gay best friend. I appreciated so much that it just was that way-it didn't feel forced or put in to preach about-it just was. Another aspect that I appreciated was the way in which Will #2's depression was handled and explained. I think it's important for teens to see this in characters they read about and to better understand it for themselves and how they handle friends that may deal with it. It's more than just feeling down, it's being depressed mentally, and Will explains that really well.<br /><br />The characters are dealing with relationships (friendly and romantic (gay and straight)), truth, peer pressures, and figuring out who they really are and how to honestly be that person in this world. It's a wonderful coming-of-age story set with the backdrop of Chicago while taking place in the classrooms and halls of the high schools, the homes, the computers, the phones of these characters. The cast of characters are all well-written, engaging, entertaining, multi-dimensional, and real. It's humorous, it's serious, it's frustrating, it's enlightening, it's wonderful. It's about love - both romantic and platonic - and the ways in which we can show that to others and help support and stand up for those we love. The ending will make you want to stand up and cheer for these characters you've grown to adore.<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendssional, and real.

0525423273|4.0|ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS takes me back to my visits to Paris - the city of romance - and this book certainly has that.  Young adult romance books are all about discovering who you are, what you want, who you want to be with, and how that impacts everything you think about yourself and your path in life. They're great for escapism and hope and entertainment, and this book has all of that. In her debut novel, Perkins has tapped into the adolescent hope and drama of first loves and crushes and developing relationships in a realistic way. It's a cute book that takes place in a great setting making me want to go back to visit Paris and see all of the specific places the author mentions along with just the feeling of being there in that city - it's like a guidebook for living in Paris and makes me want to do so. It is a book with real characters who have highs and lows and family problems and friendship problems and relationship problems and screw things up and have to work to fit it all back together again. It's a book with light-heartedness and some deeper emotional issues all wrapped up in a fun book. It's a book that deals with adolescent hopes and desires and fickleness and friendships and changes and confusions and first loves and kisses - all while remaining appropriate for a wide audience - who will be able to read it and relate to the realness of the emotions and communication breakdowns and misunderstandings of these teens.<br /><br />Anna, a great and entertaining narrator, is sent off to boarding school in Paris for her senior year of high school. She has a crush and a best friend and a brother and mom back home who she doesn't want to leave, but her father isn't giving her an option. When she gets to school in Paris, as the new girl (who doesn't speak a bit of French) in a senior class of only 25, she feels lost and lonely. Then she meets some key people and starts to make friends, and develops a major crush on the cute English/American/French classmate, accented and cute, Etienne St. Clair. Only one problem: he has a girlfriend. The book's story unravels over the course of the school year as Anna and Etienne grow to become really good friends through long talks about things they may not share with anyone else. There are starts and stops and near misses along the bumpy road of their developing relationship, ending in a climatic moment on top of the Notre Dame Cathedral where all of their truths come out.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and taking this journey with Anna, Etienne, and their friends.  Although some events throughout were a bit predictable, the setting and the deeply developed characters adding a unique aspect to this story that kept me engaged. The book portrays the realistic young adult \\"does he like me or not\\" drama of so many adolescent thoughts. I appreciated that Anna and Etienne were both complex characters who developed a true friendship as they fell for each other - instead of just a love at first sight thing that didn't make any sense. In the scenes when it was just the two of them talking, it was easy to see why those conversations led to the deep relationship that developed for the two of them.  It's ultimately a book about being honest about your feelings and knowing that it isn't as important where you are as much as who you are with that matters the most in making you feel at home.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the two companion books that Stephanie Perkins is writing: Lola and the Boy Next Door (Fall 2011) & Isla and the Happily Ever After (Fall 2012)<br /><br />Review originally posted at Heise Reads & Recommendscute, Etienne St. Clair.

It is very well written and the story moves swiftly and smoothly. I don't usually rate books, but this one has been exceptional. As I said, I am halfway thru, and am going to start re reading it tonight...it's that good!!  I don't want to finish it... frankly because there is such a wait for the next one!!

B004XQO90O|5.0|I like this sort of stuff. I always will. I'll buy the DVD and it will sit alongside Saboteur and all four versions of the 39 Steps. It will reside on the same shelf as Nick of Time and Narrow Margin, squeezed in beside that similarly themed actioner with sci fi undertones, Déjà vu. The tale is more or less the same as usual; hero saves the day and claims the prize, whatever that might be. If the writers can make the task seem impossible, that's great, give the hero some self doubt or something else to overcome, even better, if they spend a bit of cash on stuff blowing up, I'm there with the popcorn. If they can cast the movie with decent looking humans who do their best to say their lines with conviction, I'll grab a spoon and dig in to that Jelly. I'm not bothered about the technicalities of time travel, body swapping, alternate realities or any messages about the state of the world or who I am in it. If the tale moves swiftly from A to Z without me having to take notes I'll salute that flag. In short then, and to summarize, it ticked all my boxes.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|I'd heard that Shutter Island wasn't that great but I was really surprised at just how weak it really is. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshall in the 1940's sent to `Shutter Island', a facility that houses the most unmanageable of the criminally insane. His objective is to investigate a patient who's gone missing. DiCaprio's character brings along a tremendous amount of baggage being haunted by his witnessing first hand the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp and the subsequent slaughter of the guards as well as the death of his wife from a pyromaniac. The main problem with the film is its total lack of subtlety. DiCaprio is driven up to the prison gate to blaring strings as if it were the climax of the film and the movie rarely lets up. When DiCaprio has one of his nightmares featuring either memories of the concentration camp or his dead wife or some woman who killed her three kids it's all handled in such a ham handed way that it's more laughable than shocking. When DiCaprio is stricken with a headache Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) describes a migraine to DiCaprio's partner as being akin to having your head cut open, filled with razor blades and then rattled around. As someone who's suffered migraines even I think that's way over the top and why would he need to describe a migraine. It's a rare person who's never had or known someone who has migraines.<br /><br />As I was watching the movie I kept thinking that the problems were clearly the fault of the director. The pacing was off, the scenes failed to deliver what they were trying to convey and the suspense felt overly forced. It had the feel of an inexperienced director trying way too hard. As I watched the closing credits there appeared the name of Martin Scorsese. I totally forgot that Scorsese was the director and by and large I've enjoyed sometimes loved his movies. I have no idea what happened but I know that I am not the only one who thought this movie failed. In one scene DiCaprio is interviewing patients about the disappearance of the inmate and sets off one by continually scratching his pencil on a notepad. The guy goes absolutely ape[you know what] for no apparent reason. It wasn't THAT annoying. It's like Scorsese wanted DiCaprio to come off as a master of manipulation but to me he just lucked out and found a guy who was extraordinarily sensitive to pencil scratching.<br /><br />One place where the movie succeeds is in casting. The thing about Leonardo DiCaprio is that he has such a high likeability factor that it's easy to become emotionally invested in his characters. When you care about the character it becomes much more compelling when he's in danger even if the movie is silly. Ben Kingsley is excellent as Dr. John Cawley and Mark Ruffalo did a great job as DiCaprio's partner in the U.S. Marshall's. Max von Sydow and Jackie Earle Haley had small but well acted roles. The movie also has a high quality look to it although the sinister prison for the mentally insane with possible dubious rehab methods seems eerily similar to other films I've seen but I guess as the old saying goes \\"there's nothing new under the sun\\".<br /><br />What kept me watching the movie was the mystery but the ending telegraphs itself about half way through and the conclusion makes the rest of the movie seem highly unlikely. I would not call this a terrible movie but I'd call it a poorly executed movie. I'll bet a lot of people enjoyed this movie but it just didn't work for me. One last aside; I like Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor but he really needs to quit trying to grow facial hair.

B004G6TD66|5.0|In my mind (and to my ears) this is the best remaster of the best album in the ELP catalog.  There is no clipping during Tocatta and the music sounds rich, full and crystal clear. What a nice change from the dreadful 2007 Shout remaster which is so compressed it may well damage your home speakers. As another reviewer pointed out, \\"drums don't ever sound like that.\\" This version is a little louder than the 1993 Victory remaster but a smidge less bright, though this point is very subjective.  (You may find them equally bright or this one slightly brighter).  A little more lush than the 1996 Rhino remaster, though that is a very solid remaster as well with a great booklet.      This edition contains a seven-page booklet with new sleevenotes but it's no big deal, certainly not as substantial as Shout's 24-page booklet.  Shout got everything right with the packaging (with the exception of cropping the album cover too tight) but missed terribly on the remastered sound. Sony gets the remastered music right but goes the economy route on the packaging.     Sony recently purchased the band's back catalogue from Universal (footnote: Classic Rock presents Prog, issue 15, page 108) so everything has been remastered and repackaged on the Sony UK/Legacy label (including this release). According to that same article, Sony may release Tarkus & Pictures at an Exhibition on their Legacy label which will come with new 5.1 remixes, extensive sleevenotes and bonus materials.  If that materializes, I've got to believe they would go all out as well, even more so, for Brain Salad Surgery. We'll have to wait and see.     The only other remaster of this title I might recommend is the 2004 edition on the Sanctuary UK label which I'm betting is very similar to this in terms of sound quality.  (I haven't heard it but they did an incredible job on the Black Sabbath remasters, first six albums, and the Kinks Singles collection). The upside of that remaster is the cover artwork is probably reproduced on the disc itself.  The downside is the low price is (currently) $15.00 so you will pay a lot more than necessary for this music.      If you don't own a version of this disc you're happy with, this release is for you.  Sony/Legacy does a meticulous job of remastering album classics and this edition of Brain Salad Surgery is no exception. Highly recommended.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|it looks interesting but force closes when it tries to download the 80mb media download.  I will probably uninstall it.
B000UH8BTK|5.0|Great collection, this is a lust for everyone who loves fusion jazz.<br />I had this music years back on vinyl, but now finding this collection for such a price is a revelation.<br />Weather report was for me the continuing story of Miles Davis but only more funky. i even used it as a DJ and had quite some succes with it, along with the Hancock lp's from the same period.<br />One little point however, I would have loved the first acoustic \\"Weather report\\" in the collection.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I freaking love this app it always wakes me up on time in the morning when I need it too. Way better than preinstalled junk Galaxy s 4g tmobile
B004EBZX6W|5.0|allows me to pinpoint the best hotspots while traveling as well as find low signal problems on home networks. one of the most useful free apps I have ever downloaded .
B004TTZHBK|5.0|If you are a naked chef fan, this app may be right up your alley.  Extremely media intensive, this app is 14.5 megs, there is an 80 meg media download and during the app there may be additional downloads. An example is during one of the steak recipes there is an option to view a 10 minute video on \\"Cooking the perfect steak\\". In it Jamie gives you some of his tips for creating a perfect steak (don't let the steaks TOUCH and preheat the pan are 2 little tips). This little guide is an additional download although I assume you would only do it once!    If you have a large SD card, jump right in.    The typical naked chef repertoire is here and the recipes are standard JO fare.    That said, it's a decent port of the superior IOS app with excellent production values, superior videos and an engaging host.It is especially useful for couples who are tired of halving everything because most recipes are for 4 people.    You can't go wrong.    UNLESS........   of course you are a horrible sad pathetic little thing that hates anything that isn't macho (JCovington, remember, macho man was sung by the village people, enough said there) OR  you write a review NOT based on your experience with the app but based on other IGNORANT comments!! Way to go Richard Einstein (review entitled So) or  You, in your paranoid delusions, believe that any good review is a phony review, missing the irony that a review about NOTHING is a phony review! (Genius's again!)  You, in your paranoid delusions, believe that any good review MUST be from the developers, which you hate so much because it gets your frilly panties in a bunch!  Are a major whiner and complainer and miss the fact that you whine and complain like little girls (with apologies to all the little girls out there who will never act as foolish as those losers!) while you call others girly-men! J-Cov again!  Thank You
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The problem with a \\"greatest hits\\" album from an artist as varied, inspired and (sooo) prolific as Neil Young is - what do you leave out? This album could have been a 4 CD box set and still people would gripe about gems not chosen. On this single CD release, the compiler (I'm guessing Neil himself) used \\"record sales, airplay and known downloads\\" as the criteria for inclusion, and I must say it works pretty well.   Personally I'd hate to have to boil down the career of Mr.Young into 16 tracks, although I don't think I would have devoted almost 20 precious minutes to two long and similar tracks from the first album with Crazy Horse (\\"Cowgirl in the sand\\" & \\"Down by the river\\") whilst ignoring material from the \\"Zuma\\" and \\"Ragged Glory\\" albums (to name but two) - but there you go.   This aside, this is a great overview of the career of one of rock's great innovators - it's all here from the plaintive, fragile introspection of the \\"Goldrush\\"/\\"Harvest\\" era to the hard rockin' Crazy Horse material with a little bit of CSNY thrown in for good measure.   What grabs me about Young (apart from his unique voice and demented guitar solos) is his ironic, almost subversive take on life, \\"Rockin In The Free World\\" for example, a song released around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the old Soviet empire, ostensbly sounds like an anthem for Republican cold-war warriors, when in fact the verses reveal the darker side of life in the good ol' western world. With Neil Young what you see isn't always what you get.   To concude this is a wonderful album and a great place to start/update your Neil Young collection.
0596805527|5.0|This book has delivered exactly what I was hoping for, an in-depth look into modern day JavaScript.<br /><br />I rarely use JavaScript nowadays in my day to day job.  I have been lucky to avoid the messy browser applications it is usually a part of the past few years.  That was my primary reason for buying the book.  Although I may not like it, JavaScript is here to stay, and I need to keep current with it.<br /><br />The book is broken into 4 parts.  Core JavaScript, Client-Side JavaScript, Core JavaScript Reference, and Client-Side JavaScript Reference.<br /><br />The book has chapters on Lexical Structure, Expressions and Operators, Statements, Objects, Arrays, Functions, Classes and Modules, Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions, JavaScript Subsets and Extensions, Server-Side JavaScript, JavaScript in Web Browsers, The Window Object, Scripting Documents, Scripting CSS, Handling Events, Scripted HTTP, The jQuery Library, Client-Side Storage, Scripted Media and Graphics, HTML5 APIs, and then continues on with the Core JavaScript Reference and the Client-Side JavaScript Reference.<br /><br />The downloadable code is very well organized and usable.  All the code in the book, and there is a ton of it, is available.<br /><br />The book is very well written and makes for a really good read as well as a great reference.  It is in depth and very thorough.<br /><br />All in all I think this a great book.  It will be on my desk for the next few years until I need to replace it with the 8th or 9th version.<br /><br />If you are a web developer, you need this book by your side.
B000VJ271A|2.0|The production works against the score.  That said, I like the production, but I prefer the score.  Dessay is a very fine actress, but lacks the control and finesse in the voice-- less voice, more silver.  And Villazon is just a disaster! To roar out Ah, fuyez.... is to make a mockery of great French music and great French singing.  He belts as if he were a Mongolian shepherd. To have heard the style from Thill or even Villazon's Spanish compatriot, Aragall on the Myto recording.. would put Villazon to shame.  I am so disappointed.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is what programs should strive to be. Organized and well executed. May be slower on older phones due to its graphic nature, but i had no problems with it. Only real complaint is the lack of total number of recipes, especially due to the ridiculous size of the program, but I suppose one must also look at the &quot;hands on&quot; approach of this program.  Overall, very well done, but absolutely would not purchase for $8. If there were more recipes, possibly, but for this variation, $2.99 is a much more reasonable price point.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|What I can see looks good but as one other reviewer said it force closes after a few seconds. Had to restart the phone to clear it so for now it's unusable.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|they fixed all the bugs and it looks real clean and iPhone looking this is how I want all android apps to look.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Most agree that the first three books where wonderful. In my view those were the best fantasy had to offer. While writing the last two books GRRM got involved in too many other projects. This is quite evident in the long long years he took to complete them and in the quality of the work. The writing is still excellent, but the pace of the plot has come almost to a standstill. This is the work of an author with too many other things on his mind. His work on ASoIaF is interrupted by dealing with other inferior works. I would still be quite happy with this book - seen as a preparation of the field for a grand finale - if I could believe that in about two, or even three years, the next installation will be served. But with all the additional projects GRRM took on himself, I believe he will die before finishing the series. Looking at the example of the late RJ and his work being finished by BS, I fear that the excellent, distinctive prose of GRRM could not be duplicated to the same level by any other author. The only solution: GRRM needs to regain his pride as the author of what can still be the greatest fantasy masterpiece, put aside any other projects and finish the work before it is too late. No anthologies, thank you;  lay Wildcards to rest;  write Dunk and Egg when a rest is required from the major task and leave the HBO screenplays to other professionals. If not, all is most probably lost.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Every track of this album is great  Blows away everything else I have heard this year  Very musical and they have put a lot of work into this album  Buy it!

B004TTZHBK|5.0|Works great on my Evo.  The interface is great and I have had no problems with it.  Get this while it's free.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|The app is buggy, but the worst part is probably an amazon glitch. It thinks I dont have a license for the downloads.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is quite seriously an amazing Android keyboard. It is incredibly accurate despite quick typing and is super easy to use. Thank you, developers!
B0028I9IIW|3.0|Like any self-help book.  It basically tells you what you already know.  It is just reassuring to see it in print and repeat it to yourself.  Practice makes perfect after all.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|turned on my wi fi, then i had no problems with the download!  Very cool app!! would definitely recommend especially for free today!
B0054DFIIM|5.0|Kaiser Chiefs are a britpop/indie rock band, and it sounds like great britpop/indie to me.  I don't see how someone wouldn't like this record if they're a fan of such, and especially if one is a fan of Kaiser Chiefs previous releases.  If you enjoy a good britpop record, you'll definately be happy buying this.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|I really liked this movie, narration and all.  The real question of \\"what would you do?\\"  just begs to be answered, and yet not many reviewers have answered it.  I for one, would be very tempted to try NZT, fortunately I would also be too chicken!  But wouldn't it be nice to have be ability to access everything just some of the time.  If you don't get too nitpicky about details, you will enjoy this movie.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|It's like having a cookbook on your phone. The problem is, if you're cooking, you're probably at home or at a friends house, and if this is the case, you probably have a better option than this anyway - the internet.    Instead of being spoon-fed a limited number (60) recipes, why not use that phone (or better yet, laptop) to go to allrecpes, where you can even get reviews on the tens-of-thousands of recipes they have. (Heads up: Not all the recipes in this app are for everyone).     Also, from a developer perspective, there really isn't a good reason to waste 80 Megabytes of storage with the videos, which, by the way, are a required download. Most other developers would have spent the extra couple hours making the videos optional. And lastly, if you don't know how to use a whisk to beat eggs & milk, this app probably isn't for you anyway.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|this is a great app that is receiving a lot of bad reviews for the force close issue. I also experienced the force close issue initially, but fixed the issue by simply clicking &quot;Download later&quot; when given the option to download the recipe images later. there are a lot of cool features in the app, like the ability to add all the ingredients you need for a recipe directly to a shopping list. and for people who are new to cooking (like me) there are plenty of instructional videos. I know i will be getting a lot of use of this app!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Awesome app. You get recipes &amp; videos. You can make shopping lists, get equipment &amp; pictures of how the meal is supposed to look.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Same as everyone else. Force closes when trying to update, can't use. Keeping in hopes of update. I'm using on the HTC Thunderbolt.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Amazing app! Don't be discouraged by bad reviews because of force close. when it asks you if you want to download the 80 mb, just say later then go in and download through the menu. Very clean, simple, easy to follow app!

B001AQT0OU|3.0|Say that someone decided that the aspect ratio of the Mona Lisa should be tampered with.  Are you going to reward such behavior with money?    I think I'll stand firm on this one and wait for the studio to finally get it right.  The disrespect shown to Kubrick should not be rewarded, on principle.  Kubrick fans should protest this release.    I remember back when MGM did releases of Ingmar Bergman films and for no reason took Persona's 4:3 ratio and changed it to 1.66:1.  After people raised a fuss, they corrected that situation.  The same idea can and should apply here.    They need to go back and put this in 1.66:1 as Kubrick specifically intended, and put the black bars on the sides.  I don't see what's so hard about doing that.  1.78 aspect ratio is catering to philistines.   The picture doesn't need to fill up the whole TV screen.  If that principle applied, then 2001:ASO would have to be cropped to 1.78 to 1, which would be ridiculous.  But this *is* a matter of principle, so the black bars are just gonna have to go on the sides.  This is how the perfectionist, detail-obsessed Kubrick would have wanted it, yes?    (5 stars for the film, 1 star for the release, averages out to 3.  Would you shell out money for a 3-star product?)
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Installed and running with no problems on my Incredible. App flows smoothly (swipes between steps in recipe, for example), and I like the general organization and method behind the interface. I can't speak to the quality of the recipes yet, but if they're as good as the app, I'm looking forward to trying them out.     The only cons I've noticed thus far are that there are some less-common ingredients, and he tends to be pretty specific about equipment, but on the up side of that, he at least details the equipment separately, so that you don't get started and then realize that your turnip twaddler's not up to par.
0156034026|5.0|Skillfully written and a fascinating read. The point of view is first person narrative as told by the main character Changez, a Pakistani. Changez has spent 4+ years living in the U.S, attending Princeton University then finally getting a job in N.Y. at a management consulting firm (the letters of whose name also are U.S.) He chances upon an American on the street and invites him to sit down in an outdoor cafe to have some tea. There he spends several hours talking to the American while the two of them share tea and then a meal in an outdoor market place in Lahore. We never find out the American's name or occupation nor why he is there in Pakistan. He is dressed rather formally and seems to have a bulge under his suit jacket (a gun?)<br />We also do not hear any of the words spoken by the American man but his reactions, questions and answers are revealed by the narrator.<br />(Paraphrased)<br />Changez: \\"I went to university in New Jersey.\\"<br />(pause)<br />Changez: \\"Why yes you have guessed that it was Princeton\\"<br />(pause)<br />Changez: \\"Oh yes, I liked it very much.\\"<br /><br />  It is a very unique method of telling a written story.<br />From the conversation we see that Changez, at first, loves his new life in the U.S. feeling fortunate to be a part of such a modern and progressive and forward thinking world. A world where nearly anyone can be successful. He even has the fortune of falling in love with a beautiful American woman. He seems happy. His job takes him around the world, where he is proud to be mistaken as an American.<br /><br />Then while away on a trip in Manila he is watching the TV as a plane flies into the Twin Towers on 9/11. Returning to N.Y. he begins to notice that Americans, who have previously admired and befriended him, begin to act suspicious of him. He notes that the citizens of New York begin to rally around their flag. He feels like an outsider.

The character in this story professes no religious fervor. Because of this I don't think this is about religious fundamentalism. I believe the \\"fundamentalism\\" here is about ideological belief in an established set of basic principles regarding modern political and social mores.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|First, I have this loaded on a Samsung Infuse and everything is working fine. The videos are nice and clear, if not quite HD quality.   The steps are clearly laid out with pictures for each step - not quite sure of the added-value of this but I'm not a beginning cook. For those cooks, though, this app meets cookbook is going to become your best friend, especially if you're interested in learning the basics and furthering your cooking skills. The shopping list function is great since you can add all the ingredients for any recipe (in the app) in one go - haven't played much with this function, though.  All in all, a super app for the beginner cook but little added-value for those of us who aren't.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|After reading rave after rave on this site from viewers around the globe, well, let me add my two-cents worth.      I was passing through the airport in Taipei, Taiwan, last week when a song piped out the terminal speakers.  I immediately stopped in my tracks and said, \\"WHO the hell is this woman?\\"  At first I thought \\"Dusty Springfield\\"?  I tried to get an answer.  Finally a friendly Chinese sales clerk told me in her charming accented English -- \\"Oh, it's Adele, she's singing 'Rolling In The Deep\\".  BINGO!!  After months and months of hearing about this artist, it finally kicked in -- at an airport terminal of all places.    I finally realized what ALLLLL the fuss has been about.  I purchased the CD on the spot and the entire disc kept me company for the 12-hour flight from Taipei to L.A.  On the plane with my Sony disc player, I laughed, cried, smiled, and was blown away by this spectacular CD.  Each time the disc reached the end, I instantly hit 'Repeat' and I was immediately transported back to Adele's world of heartbreak, pain, and loss -- with some joy and celebration thrown in.      I could relate to almost every song on the CD, having traveled down the path that Adele has traveled.  Obviously this amazingly talented young woman is writing and singing from the depths of her soul and she sings about experiences that everyone can  relate to or has experienced themselves.  It's hard to believe she's only in her early Twenties!  She does remind me a bit of her British elder counterpart, Dusty Springfield, but Dusty never had this much vocal firepower.    If there is any justice, \\"Adele 21\\" deserves to win \\"Album of the Year\\" at next year's Grammys.  My guess is with its sales records and the \\"Rolling\\" single still being played around the world, Adele should pick up a few more Grammys to add to her collection.  \\"21\\" is an amazing aural sensation that any serious music lover should get to feel and experience.  It will move you and hit you in the gut when you leastexpect it.  I have not been blown away in many years as I have with this CD.  As much as I love Gaga and Katie (they've each been bashed unfairly on this site), Adele is just on an entirely different level.    Adele manages to cross racial, age, gender, and other barriers in her  ability to move.  Now isn't that what music is all about?  Amazing!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Everytime I try to install the app I receive an error message. Hopefully this issue is fixed soon because it seems like it would be a great app to have if it worked.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is obviously written from her heart. It's her story and told how she wanted to tell it.  Jaycee did an outstanding job of retelling her horror in an honest and authentic manner.  One day, this beautiful little girl was on her way to school when true evil in the form of Phillip Garrido and his evil wife, Nancy, entered her life.  This set her on a course of 18 horrible years at the hands of these two sub-humans.  Shame on anyone who criticizes this author.  Unless you've survived this horror and then had the courage to recount it, hush yourself. This book should be read with the understanding of the amazing courage it took to write it.  Jaycee tells her story as she remembers it...no one needs any more details of the bad things that happened in that yard.  Jaycee is a survivor, she is smart, and a person of hope.  She never lost hope of making he way back to her beloved mom.    Jaycee, you did an excellent job in telling this personal story.  You deserve nothing but support for how you managed to survive, and come out of this a beautiful soul with a good heart. As a mother, you make me very proud.  You remain now and forever in my prayers.  I wish your days to be full of light, love, freedom, and joy. God bless your beautiful soul.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|games are of very poor quality as you may expect from this sort of product. You must beat a high score in each game to earn points so you may unlock others, some of the high score challenges are very easy but others are frustratingly hard I found myself playing an easy yet unlikable game over and over to get enough points only to unlock another game that is no fun. disappointing download, I'd recommend you avoid this title.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|I will give a higher rating when fixed. Til then the app is very informative. A WiFi connection or 4g a must due to the video downloads etc. Videos contain great details and his theories on cooking. I wish I could give a higher rating but I almost and I suspect others have given up on the app due to bugs which appear to be corrected after a reboot.
0670022411|3.0|I enjoyed this book, and I will likely read the next title in the trilogy.  That said, it was a bit drawn out and actually felt like several stories stitched together.  It read very much like an adult version of Twilight.  The characters were more developed and the protagonist is a bit more respectable, because she considers more than just the romantic part of her life.  An acclaimed scholar she continues her work throughout the book despite the life altering experiences that continue to happen to her.  The story also weaves reality in to the fiction and reminded me a lot of The Physick book of Deliverace Dane.  I did find the whole romantic relationship a bit strange.  \\"I will love you forever and would kill my own son for you, but I have really only known you for a few weeks.\\"  I also thought that Diana's relationship with Matthew's mother was strange and a bit unbelievable, and their very open public displays of affection in front of her and the house keeper equally strange. (who heavily makes out with their significant other in front of that person's parent?)     Overall, if you are looking for a romantic fantasy young adult novel written for an educated adult audience this is a great read that will get you through until that book your really waiting for comes out.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Will not download additional 80 megs of information, it asks me and when I select now it does nothing then force closes the app. I can get download quied then nothing else.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|This is like a cornicopia of good Pit!  Excellent mix.  Good variety.  Can't stop dancing.  Pit ROCKS!
B002ZG975Q|5.0|First saw this movie coming back from Ireland, I enjoyed it so much that I had to have it on DVD. I would recommened this movie to any and I have talked about it with the people that I work with.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|This is a wonderful app but i did have some issues with it force closing like others did.   I dont know how to report it.   Overall great app but DO wish they would fix that problem
B004TTZHBK|2.0|there's some kind of auto rotate problem that really makes this unuseable. sorta works, never forced close just couldn't stabilize it's orientation after certain selections.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|App works like a charm on my stock D2G, videos, etc.  Would be nice if I didnt have to rotate the phone back and forth, however.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Works on HTC incredible.  Most professionally done I've seen. Has with all cooking, having the ingredients on hand is what takes the most effort.  Hoping the add to shopping list app feature will help with that. Did initially FC, perhaps server was down.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This little machine can do so much.  If like data and you want to \\"get to the numbers\\" on your running, this watch will do it for you.  You can analyze your speed, pace, miles per hour, heart rate, elevation, and cadence.  You can set up intervals, set up routes, create custom workouts and categorize them.  I got this for my birthday in 2010, and it is one of my favorite gifts.  It's pricey but worth it.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|This is a really good movie. You can feel the heat and sultriness of South Louisiana. Since I do like Alec Baldwin as Dave Robicheaux in \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\", I wasn't sure that I would like Tommy Lee Jones as Dave, but he was outstanding. Tommy is a terrific actor who gets better with age. He fits the Robichaux character to a Tee.     Also, the movie follows the book by James Lee Burke and the story is outstanding.     The filming and scenery is beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, and/or enjoys the South.     I bought this movie from Amazon.com and the service was great.
B005EF1EX8|5.0|Aaron Paul as Jesse is really given a chance to shine in this episode.  We really get to see the complex layers in his personality.  In one scene he is the cool party guy with lots of money to throw huge parties every single night.  In another scene, the girl whose son he saved realizes he was the one who left her a huge wad of money to get a better life in a better neighborhood.  But best of all, we see him falling apart, still not able to deal with having killed someone to save Walter's life.  It is an all out masterful performance.<br /><br />Not that Hank and Walt are just idle in this episode.  Hank is amassing huge chunks of rocks from his ebay buys as a mineral collector while he makes minute progress in physical therapy.  His attitude has not improved a whit. Walt decides buying an untraceable gun from an arms dealer might be the way to go in solving his problems with Gus.  This might be viewed as comic relief, he is so bad on handling a gun.
0783226004|4.0|This was a really good film that surprised me.It is all about people who are extraordinarily smart and the mastermind group that they compose. I was really cool to see all of them combine their talents to get the job done. I think this movie was very character driven.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|There have been many, many movies about the holocaust, but none I can recall that takes such an unusual, yet respectful view of the result of the Einsatzgruppen insanity.  I bought the indie movie on the strength of a preview I saw on another DVD.  For the first thirty minutes or so, while the characters were developed, the movie meandered significantly.  Although mildly interesting, I was beginning to question my purchase.  Then in the dark as the lights are turned out for the evening's sleep the grandfather says they should help the boy (don't lose the significance of that artistic moment).  From that point the movie slowly and beautifully pulls together to the poignant illumination of the title.    \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is a slow-paced movie that leaves enough time for your emotions to circulate with each heartbeat.  Basically a Ukrainian roadtrip with a perfect music soundtrack, you generally feel like you've traveled the countryside in the car with the four occupants.  Finding the mood for that cross country measure of time best suits the mind for this movie.  \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is a nice addition to anyone's collection if holocaust movies fit your genre tastes.    For those interested, the DVD transfer is very sharp and the music score is exceptional.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|The interface is easy to use and the instructions are clear and step by step. Not very many recipes though.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a wonderfull app. so many books to choose from. Even have great free books. I would recommend this to anyone that loves to read.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Took the advice of previous posts and chose &quot;download later &quot; option for demo videos.  It does allow you to download the videos individually,  which is nice.   App working well,  and it's simple to use.   Love the &quot;add to shopping list&quot; feature,  as it even sorts by store aisle!   Nice intro by Jamie,  and I'm looking forward to trying out the recipes!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Going into this I was just expecting another game for the casual game player on android.  I was expecting another angry birds or something of this sort, but i was sure wrong.  Its an incredible game.  Lots of variety, challenging puzzles, and quick gameplay.  I recommend this title tenfold.  I'm happy I saw what the fuss was about.
1878424114|3.0|This is great information, but I have heard it before in other sources.  Probably best for those who are unfamiliar with Chopra's work.

B004TTZHBK|1.0|Same as others force closes when trying to download 80MB of media.  HTC Inspire.  Second time in a week I've had issues download additional files for an app.
B000OEZ88G|5.0|The book is excellent--thorough in its research, and reasonable in its conclusions. Unlike other authors, Collins and Porras went above and beyond in their research.
B000LAZDQA|1.0|My professor showed this film in class today and I was disgusted! (The class is sexuality and eroticism in global perspectives) I'm an anthropology major and this class is classified as anthropology so I took it thinking it was about sexuality in different cultures.<br /><br />I was totally and utterly disgusted by the sex in this film. Sex is supposed to be an intimate thing between a married man and a woman who love each other and want to show it, not public! Do not watch if you're offended by public and animalistic sex. There was even oral and anal sex in it, which to me is not human!
0553801473|5.0|At long last, we have DWD in our hands, ready to be read. Fortunately, the book was worth the wait.<br /><br />Some initial criticisms of the book have centered around the lack of resolutions given and the fact that most of the book is setup. Well, guess what--its a 7 book series. The book is not going to resolve anything. Martin has never written his books in an episodic fashion and he has used cliffhangers before, so I don't know where the hate is coming from.<br /><br />There are significant things that happen in this book, though I won't give away what. One is a big reveal/plot twist that I honestly never saw happening and it will definitely change things in Westeros.<br /><br />For specifics, the book focuses primarily on Jon Snow, Daenerys, and Tyrion. The weakest chapters are the ones focusing on Daenerys, as her character is mired with all the difficult choices that she faces. Her chapters aren't a pleasure to read, but I believe that's because Martin designed them that way--we're supposed to be frustrated by how Dany is handling things, just as we were supposed to be upset by Ned Stark's death in book 1. Most of the book is preparation--things are moving into place, setting the scene for the grand finale. In this sense, it is definitely a middle book.<br /><br />Martin's writing in general is very strong, other than his \\"must needs\\" quirk and the annoying \\"'It is known,' 'It is known'\\" saying. It really is just a pleasure to read, to see how he deals with characters, dialogue,and setting. In fact, I'm willing to say that within fantasy there isn't an author our there currently that can match him in that regard.<br /><br />In short, my clumsy, haphazard review is this: go buy it and enjoy it.
B004US4K2C|5.0|My Samsung Mesmerize used to have horrible battery life - 6 hours of medium level use. I read a post on the Mesmerize Facebook page where someone with a similar problem suggested switching to Go Launcher Ex. I installed and it worked. I now regularly get 14 hours on a single charge. Plus I really like the launcher, too. It's updated regularly, the app drawer is amazing (folders and the ability to hide apps), the transitions look amazing, you can resize widgets, your home screens can auto-rotate, and there's no shortage of themes.  Definitely worth a try!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Opened application it stated it needed to download like 80MB of content then when I clicked on it fc,  if it is fixed then I will related it.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|looks like they fixed it working on thunderbolt. you can get application now and download videos and pictures later :-)
B004TTZHBK|5.0|everything installed and extra stuff downloaded fine for me (htc incredible 3g connection not WiFi)<br /><br />I did what someone else mentioned and clicked no on the window that pops up asking you about the extra 80MB and did it later
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Well done and organized app....Great recipes with good production values.. but beware.. Because it's video intensive, it requires an additional 80 meg of media files....  The original 14.5 meg file as well as the additional media files go directly on the SD card...    If you like the naked chef...... and have lots of room then don't hesitate...    EDIT: I put back the star I removed because of how large it was... Because of the quality of the app and the fact that it automatically loads itself and files to SD card made me reconsider... Sorry for the confusion!
0545259088|1.0|I have never written a review on here before, but this book made me so mad that I had to write.  I was really looking forward to the 3rd book in this trilogy, only to be sooooo disappointed in the ending.  It's HORRIBLE.  And FRUSTRATING.  It's like the author was falling behind on her deadline, so just submitted what she had written without a proper ending.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|No problems on my Galaxy S running Froyo.  Great-looking, simple to prepare meals.  The shopping list feature is helpful.  I'm looking forward to trying some of them this week.  Hey, haters.  Review the app, not your inadequate phone!  Don't downgrade the work because you can't load it.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|Selena Gomez puts her talented voice into this record that has your head bobbing constantly. I listen to it frequently and can't get sick of it. Well job done! Thumbs up!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|What I remember of Yes of the eighties was their memorable video for \\"Rhythm of Love\\". Of course, they've been around a lot longer than that. This new album from Yes has everything, beautiful orchestration, great lyrics, beautiful voices (even for old guys), heck even the CD casing is gorgeous, with wraparound artwork that cries out for the old vinyl album sleeves.    These days I'm more of a Steve Howe fan (of whom many of his recent beautiful jazz guitar CDs are available at Amazon as I write). So I kind of come to Yes as a backwards fan. Not knowing what to expect, the album was a pleasant surprise. There's only one song I don't like, but with this many great tracks, that's still worth five stars.     When I consider the auto-tuned static that fills radio airplay in 2011, these guys show how it's done. Being older doesn't mean you're obsolete, it means you know what you're doing. And they still have a few tricks to teach the younger generation. Okay, enough with the old comments. I'm getting older too, and this CD makes me feel young again. Get it!    DELUXE EDITION: Worth the slight increase in purchase price is the 'making of' DVD, sort of like all those 'Behind the Music' rockumentaries that VH1 makes. As I watched the band go through the concepts of the album, I became familiar with the overall sound. So when I listened to the CD afterwards, it all sounded familiar. A great way to experience an album for the first time. I recommend getting this version to fully immerse yourself in the Yes experience.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|\\"Love you like a love song\\" is my absolute favorite track. It's on repeat constantly! The entire record is spectacular. It is all energy and a lot of fun!
B004TTZHBK|2.0|I can't view the videos after downloading them. I have the samsung droid charge. Says video starts downloading and finish, video shows green to play and I try to play it and it gives me. Video cannot be played.
