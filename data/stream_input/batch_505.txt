B00005JNBQ|4.0|Many people have commented here on the film itself, but I want to say that it's not so much the film, it's the whole experience (that a few people have touched on) that makes Napoleon Dynamite worth watching at least once, and maybe more than once. <br /> <br />This movie is much funnier when remembered and quoted the next day.  My children are still quoting this movie many many weeks after having seen it, and I suppose that some of the funnier lines will become a part of their standard vocabulary.  We have all spent hours laughing with tears in our eyes from quoting various lines (there are WAY too many hilarious quotable lines to even start listing them), and it is surprising how many of them are applicable to life's everyday circumstances; just try to have a bad day after someone hits you with a Napoleon quote, it's hard not to laugh, especially if both of you have seen the movie.  Monty Python movies (particularly Holy Grail) are the only things that come close to Napoleon Dynamite in the \\"quotable\\" category. <br /> <br />As a movie, it's not great, but as an experience that you can share with others and continue enjoying long after having seen it, it's virtually incomparable, and that's why this movie is SWEET!
B0002EXH5O|3.0|Last March, i decided to borrow my uncles original copy of Rust In Peace since most of Megadeths albums were out of print at the time. boy was i sure glad i did!!! the whole album itself was perfect, with the only thing i didnt like about it was that it has low volume so i had to turn it up loud to hear it good. 2 months later i found out that Dave was going to remaster a majority of the Megadeth catalog and i just HAD to get my hands on a fresh copy of the remaster of this album. The time finally came and i put in the CD into my CD player... <br /> <br /> <br />i have to say that the first two tracks sounded better remastered, though i thought Dave overdid the drums in this remix <br /> <br />so far, so good, until... <br /> <br />i listen to Take No Prisoners and i hear that THE VOCAL TRACKS WERE RERECORDED!!! i was shocked and was also shocked to find out that HE RUINED THE BASS SOLO IN THE SONG ALSO!!!! this goes for Five Magics too, as he totaly rerecorded all the vocals for it (now the low voice in the latter part of the song sounds like a happy retard!!) as for the rest of the album, all the backing vocals for tracks 3-9 have been rerecorded!!!!! the \\"hey\\" in Lucretia sounds gay as do the new vic rattlehead vocals in Rust In Peace...Polaris. i was overall dissapointed that Dave could do this. Im 14, and now kids my age who are gettin into Megadeth are going to think THIS is the real Rust In Peace, and that really upsets me. and the new track My Creation is cool, but weird. the only reason this remaster gets 3 stars is becuz of the demos, which include Chris Poland on guitar, and for the MINOR improvement of the musicianship. Dave couldve just turned up the volume and make it sound clearer, but NNOOOO, he HAD to rerecord it. BUY THE ORIGINAL, ITS THE DEFINITIVE VERSION!!!!!
B00005A46T|1.0|wow slipknot are a horrible band, they are not really angry, they are selling you that they are angry. They write lyrics just to piss ur parents off, so that u buy them. I'm no old man when writing this im 15. Slipknot, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Limp Bizkit, they are all the same. Just acts to make u think they are hardcore, and feel like a rebel when listenin 2 em, but too bad people think you are just an idiot lisenin 2 em.<BR>    If u want angry music:foo fighters, system of a down, metallica, distillers, sex pistols, heavy music: metallica, slayer, alice in chains, pearl jam, nirvana, GOOD MUSIC: The Who, Neil Young, Led Zeppelin <BR>DONT LISTEN 2 SLIPKNOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I purchased this CD after hearing several of this bands songs on the radio - and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />I put it on when I want to work out - the songs have a great beat, and tend to get you \\"pumped up\\" - and the time just seems to melt away (since I don't really like exercising, having this music is a big help).<br /><br />I'm not really sure how I would classify this music - rock? - I'm just not sure...  I'd suggest listening to some of the songs through Media Player to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Overall, I give \\"Fallen\\" 2 thumbs up!
B0006L16N8|1.0|i gave this album a chance because of it's \\"Rave\\" reviews and i wish i hadn't!!!! this is typical Coldplay, nothing different! this band gives british music a bad name!! i wish i could have gave this no stars! <br /> <br />DONT BUY THIS!
B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails is one of my favorite groups (artists? I know it's only Reznor on the actual albums). And I was not disappointed with Reznor's latest. Right up there with The Mars Volta's second and Chino Moreno's side project, Team Sleep, as one of the best recent releases. <br /> <br />With Teeth is definitely more mellow and poppy than the others (it recalls the feeling of the instrumental tracks on \\"The Fragile\\"), but of course than tends to happen to most artists as they get older and mature. <br /> <br />I especially love \\"All the love in the world\\" (track 1), \\"Every day is exactly the same\\" (track 6), and the title track \\"With teeth\\" (track 7). \\"Only\\" (track 8) and, of course, \\"The hand that feeds\\" (track 4) are the singles on the radio now.
B000005HLV|4.0|There are just simply not any bands that are like this one, they have members who killed themselves, one another, and random people. Only one oringal member is alive and he is in prison for murder and church arson. The music is fantastic with blazing guitar and vocals straight out of the pit it seems, this band is rewarding for anyone into Black Metal.
0671004107|4.0|This is a passionate book that seems to be the sum of everything that Sagan cared about. I've always loved it. <br /> <br />Has anyone else figured out the origin of Ellie's name? It's an anglicization of \\"Arouet\\" which was Voltaire's original surname. There are several references in \\"Contact\\" to Voltaire's writings, especially his \\"conte philosophique\\" Micromgas.
B000088E6D|4.0|Michael Buble is, without question, a gifted singer, whose voice belies his age.  I have never heard \\"Moondance,\\" \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" covered by a more accomplished and self-assured singer.  Buble is a modern crooner who, with just a few albums, has already achieved the status of a master of his genre.  But this is why he needs to be especially prudent and choose his material carefully, because too often this kind of music, sung this way, can descend into kitsch and lounge, and Buble does not deserve to sound like a Vegas act.  For example, while \\"Moondance\\" works wonderfully, \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" does not. It's not Buble's fault; rather, the song was horrible when it was released and no amount of effort can improve it.  In sum, this album is a must hear.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|<br />I've watched this four times (twice in the theater).  It is absolutely hilarious, perhaps the funniest movie I have EVER seen.  My wife loves it too.  It's a brilliant work of true parody: it manages to both entertain and to make some important and subtle critiques of both \\"sides\\" on the war against terrorism.  This kind of approach has been lacking in such unsubtle works as Fahrenheit 9/11 or ridiculously earnest action flicks.  It's about time we have movies like this! <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|On their debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" the instant thought that entered my head was \\"this sounds really familiar\\". I wouldn't pronounce this CD garbage, because it's fairly decent with it's mix of 80's twist of modern music. On the other hand, the group familiarize themselves as Rooney, Franz Ferdinand, and even a little of Modest Mouse. It's key to have independence among the music now, especially broading category of \\"rock\\" because I've heard it. Give me difference, and something unique!  <br />    The CD captures catchy tunes like \\"On Top\\", \\"Andy, Your a Star\\", and so forth. It's a great CD, and yet can be highly annoying after the first few songs.  <br />     Give it a shot, maybe you'll find a sense of \\"ear candy\\" among the tracks somewhere between the lines.
B000002I2I|2.0|I discovered The Doors three years ago and have been listening ever since.  Yesterday I purchased Morrison Hotel, and I was disappointed.  Yes, Roadhouse Blues is a gem, as is Peace Frog and maybe Waiting for the Sun. But the rest of the album is really uninspiring. The lyrics aren't as deep as Strange Days and the instrumentals aren't as good/catchy as their debut album. It feels as though this album was created by four guys who ran out of ideas. An album created out of contractual obligation rather than creative drive.  If you already have Roadhouse Blues on another compilation purchase LA Women. THAT'S a good album.  One of their best.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I am a musical theater major from Point Park University who felt compelled to speak my mind after reading the other reviews. Most of the people offering advice in their reviews are missing the point of the show...and the story behind it. \\"Cats\\" is written by T.S. Eliot, one of the most masterful poets in history, through a series of letters. While he was travelling Europe he mailed these letters to a young, child friend in London. Each letter told a story of a different type of cat that Eliot had encountered. There is no plot. There isn't supposed to be a plot. The whole show is a series of poetic letters adapted to music. (And quite literally adapted, I believe that in the credits inside of a copy of the soundtrack it states that ALL lyrics, minus \\"Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats\\" are unchanged from T.S. Eliot's Poetry Book \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.\\") As fas as the music is concerned, I have a personal theroy that Andrew Lloyd Webber made a deal with the devil so that he could write the world's most brilliant melodies. The songs are repetetive, they are supposed to be. It's a melody. I must admit that from both a perfomer's standpoint as well as an avid theatergoer, you lose something of the magic of the show by not being able to see it live. There's just something about how the energy travels through the air when you're in the theater...alas, the show is closed until Webber is bored with life and chooses to revive it. Frankly, \\"Cats\\" is poetry (no plot), set to the most brilliant melodies (which are supposed to be repetetive), brought to life by amazing dancers and singers, on a stage made COMPLETELY out of pieces of trash (that's a fact), is the longest running Broadway show in history until Phantom of the Opera topples it somewhere between Dec. 2005 and Feb. 2006 and is a solid piece of musical theater history. Knowing that, do you dare risk being embarassed by your family and friends by saying you've never heard or seen it? (Check out Andrew LloydWebber's website for short music and video clips: [...]
6302732778|2.0|Someone who knew I loved Blade Runner gave me a sealed dvd of the Director's Cut. Guess what, its still in the package and will never be opened in my house. The original Theatrical Release is the one and only Blade Runner. You cannot imagine how Harrison Ford's narration adds depth to this movie. The Director's Cut is such a let down and I'm can't beleive Ripley Scott took it off the video versions. When will the Theatrical Cut be released?
B0002MPU1K|4.0|After I heard the eponymous first album I had to listen to \\"On The Moon.\\"  I was not disappointed.  While Mr. Cincotti is still somewhat weak as a singer and a songwriter (for example, \\"He's Watching\\" I wanted to like because my father had also died, was not memorable), his ability as a jazz pianist continues to amaze me.  Listen to \\"Cherokee\\" and \\"St. Louis Blues.\\"  They are arranged and played by a truly gifted musician.  What a breath of fresh air in this age of American Idol and Janet Jackson and her clones!  I look forward to his future albums, confident that he will continue to dazzle us.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one of the most well told tales i've ever had the pleasure of experienceing. Essensially it's a story of how this little girl learns how to overcome adversity, at the same time learns how to care for someone. This movie will tug at your heart strings. A masterpiece for all ages to enjoy.
B000063COX|5.0|This is an awesome debut album; it isn't hard to believe that the band who came up with this would be writing epic songs like 'Hallowed Be Thy Name', and 'To Tame a Land' within three years.<br /><br />This album features the largely unfamiliar lineup of Steve Harris on Bass, Dave Murray/Dennis Stratton on Guitar, Clive Burr on Drums and Paul Di'anno on vocals. Only Murray and Harris will be familiar to avid Iron Maiden fans, though Clive Burr did manage to survive until 1983.<br /><br />This lineup produced an amazing debut though; forget the usual stigma about debut albums; its unwarranted here. Iron Maiden from the get go, knew how to write a good song. Most of these songs are unsurprisingly by Steve Harris, in fact the only one that doesn't have Harris involved at all is Charlotte the Harlot, which is pure Dave Murray. Yet Harris does not monopolise the album totally; Dianno and Murray have a few credits (interestingly, the ones with DI anno are probably the most 'punkish', like Sanctuary and Running Free; though of course Remember Tomorrow has Di anno involvement and that isn't 'punkish')<br /><br />There isn't really any filler on this album; personally I find it better than Killers, the follow up. The weakest songs I find to be Running Free and Sanctuary, but they certainly aren't bad songs. I do wish Maiden didn't always insist on playing them live though; they've written much better songs they could have at the end of a set (they probably do it for nostalgia purposes, since these were two of their earliest songs)<br /><br />The album opens up with a great track in Prowler; evidently about a guy who likes flashing women in parks or something...it makes me wonder where Steve Harris got the inspiration from? Perhaps I don't want to know...<br /><br />Remember Tomorrow and Strange World are two 'cleaner' (i.e. non distorted) songs. I love Strange World; its a very unconventional Maiden song in that it never becomes distorted, (except for the solos) and the solos are great fun to play<br /><br />The highlight of the album for me is Phantom of the Opera; at 7.20 this is a long song, and it foreshadows Maiden's ability to create epics (specifically Harris' ability to do that...). It's a great song, with (i'm told) very skilful bass riffing, that cemented Steve Harris' legendary bass playing status<br /><br />That being said, there aren't any low points on this album really. It's a great debut from a band that were to define metal music as we know it. Not their best album by any means, buy definitely worth picking up. Be warned, it's perhaps slightly 'punkier' (I said slightly) than their later efforts.d the solos are great fun to play <br /> <br />The highlight of the album for me is Phantom of the Opera; at 7.20 this is a long song, and it foreshadows Maiden's ability to create epics (specifically Harris' ability to do that...).

B00008OWZC|5.0|All live albums should be this good.       On \\"How the West was Won\\", Led Zeppelin has been captured at their peak - raw, loud, swinging, and downright awesome. For those of us who were too young to see this powerhouse quartet play live, this album is about as good as it gets.      Unlike some live albums, the band sounds great here. The production is great and the playing is tight as can be. It's Led Zeppelin at their very best, without the studio sheen, playing many of their biggest songs: \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Going to California\\" (that's merely the first disc) and many others. It's a truly awesome compilation of an incredible live band.      \\"How the West was Won\\" captures one of the greatest bands ever at their artistic peak. This album is essential listening for any music fan. Don't be frightened by the twenty dollar-plus price tag. This collection is worth every penny. Pick this up today.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is sophisticated plot illinearity that would have made William Faulkner momentariy confounded. I loved everything about this film--the two incredibly beautiful and talented leads, the moments of \\"what the heck was that?\\", and the whole stlylish L.A. vibe. I think I might even like this better than Lynch's Blue Velvet, which I watched four times, one night after another, when it first came out in 1986. Mulholland Drive, however, I've only watched once on video, and just recently. I'm giving myself a while to see it again, kind of savoring and anticipating--savoring the impressions, anticipating making sense of the second viewing, knowing what I know now, that which occurred during those last thirty minutes.    Wow! Creepy, mind-blowing, surreal kind of stuff. And I loved every confusing moment! I liked this film so much, I might have to rewatch Bergman's Persona (lots of comparisons have been made) to see if I was originally too harsh in my contempt for it.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Michael Buble has already proven himself as an accomplished, mature crooner with just a few albums.  As I mentioned in my review of his first, eponymous album, his voice is flawless.  However, especially in this genre, his choice of material is crucial to his success.  As in his first album, he succeeds wonderfully with some songs and he falls flat with others.  \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"You And I\\" are gems; I have never heard them sung better.  However, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" goes over the top; it is pure lounge and kitsch, and it does not succeed.  Covering a Beatles song is daunting in itself, but doing so in this manner is just silly.  But even though all the tracks are not impeccable, I highly recommend this album because most of it is first-rate.
B00005JLCE|5.0|Well, what can I say about this movie? It's one of my absolute favorite comedies ever since I saw it for the first time like about 15 years ago. I was a child back then, but I still love it the same! The most important thing for me is, that Madonna acts in this movie. And I think she does it well. And on top of it, this movie also provides good music (4 tracks are by Madonna). It's one of these movies I just can't get enough of. I always have to watch it again and again, over and over... And that's why I'm really impatiently waiting for it to finally be released on DVD!! I recommend it for everyone who loves to smile and to laugh...
0786856297|5.0|This is one of the more original fantasy books that I've come across in a while.  It takes something that most people are interested in (mythology) and puts an updated fantasy spin on it.  The premise is that the Greek gods are still active and up to their old tricks (including having children with mortals), and that our hero Percy is the child of one of these gods.  Unfortunately, the gods' children don't have it easy and often have to fight off monsters that can sense their demi-god status.  Because of this, there is a camp for them where they can receive special training that might just help to keep them alive.  However, when Percy gets to the camp there is a great deal of unrest in the community because some of the gods are fighting, and shockingly enough it appears that Percy is being blamed for causing the problem.  This is a fast read that will keep you looking for more.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If you're a huge fan of Coldplay, you'll find this album more of an amalgam of different musical influences.. I think somehow, in a subtle way, Coldplay has tried to input some of the styles in Brit pop music like the 80s and a bit of U2 guitars.. Lyric-wise, i believe it's got a lot of ironies and cliches that Chris MArtin wants to impart to the listeners.. One great thing about Coldplay's music is that you'll never get tired of listening to its melodies.. Surely, this album deserves to be in your CD collection..
0451196716|5.0|It really make you think about what a world that would be to send your kid to his own death, for a prize, would it be that honorable?  When i read this book,I woundered could human being at this time think about doing that to there own child for a quick rich sceme?  I took a long walk my self, I thought to my self it would be the most unbearble punishment of a life time, sometimes is wounder if they would put this to a law in this time, sending convict for a walk, kind of a march to your own death or a new form of terrorist punishment, hmmmmmmm. Well any ways, this is an excellent book, I was in awe, if any one out there deside to take a good long walk, read this book, it will make you think diffrently about that walk.
1400032717|4.0|This book clearly outlined the literate mind of autistic individuals.  Not only that, but it shows similar behaviors with other types like ADD/ADHD/bipolar (sure many others).  This mind is like a computer.  It completely erases the emotional factor in the equation.  Sooo logical it's scarey.  Can anyone clearly define when the lack of emotion becomes nonfunctional in society?  Or how about somewhere else on that emotional scale?  What is normal anyway?  As you can see from the book, parents of emotionally handicapped children are really challenged daily.  It's a full time job.  I'm surprised the character lived given the experience he had.  If a family was \\"perfect\\" with the same daily routine for their entire lives, an autistic child would thrive, but that's not reality.  It's an adventure.  Every variation from day to day living is a major obsticle which involves critical thinking.  Toast today instead of a waffle?....why?...How can I eat that?...What's on it?......How do I cut it?....It can drive you crazy!!!  Believe me, I know.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I am astounded by the number of bad reviews this DVD has received.  I have to highly recomend it if you have some good audio equipment.  I first saw it playing at Ultimate Electronics as they were pulling out of the Texas market. I was provoked to buy Klipsch series 7 speakers and subs as a result. It has unusaully strong bass for a concert DVD.  I was blown away by the raw sound power this concert produces.  You are drawn in by that great voice and subtle piano and then attacked with low cord grinding guitar and bass ridden drums.  I was not a \\"huge\\" Evenescence fan before seeing this.  I enjoyed listening to the more popular songs on the radio but never purchased a CD.  This DVD completely captured me.  The surround mix is excellent with the full frontal assault and crowd screaming from the rear.  The reviews about the video being edited and jumping from one thing to another are correct.  I found this to lend to the extreme energy of the CD.  Not for the old, faint of heart, or weak audio systems.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|napoleons grandma was riding a four wheeler and flew off the top of a sand dune. that was the one funny part of this. my friends told me this movie was hilarious. while watching this movie, i just sat their watching the screen blankly. i was comletely bored. i love stupid comedies. everything from dumb and dumber to eurotrip to freddy got fingered (probably the stupidest comedy movie of all). each one of those were juvenile, but very funny. this was unbearable and i am glad i rented it and didn't buy it. this is one of those movies that you are either gonna like or hate and i am in that second group. for me a movie has to have a plot and from what i gathered, this movie didn't have a coherent one.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|For anyone who has been longing for a fresh and catchy metal release, this album is it. If Iron Maiden, Helloween and the Gothenburg sound are your thing then this CD might just be for you. Anybody who enjoys blistering guitar solos, emotional lyrics and catchy choruses will love this release. I was never the biggest fan of their old sound. They could have been lumped in with any of the Bleeding Throughs, Atreyus or As I lay Dyings but with this album, they have carved out a niche for themselves. Just listen to those guitar solos. When was the last time a new American band sounded so European? The sound has some elements of 80's punk but for the most part it's a mix of the sleaze scene (Faster Pussycat, Love/Hate) and the Euro Powermetal scene (Gamma Ray, Helloween). I personally like the singing over the screaming so to me that is a plus. With the oncorporation of an orchestra and keyboards, this album is tops so far in 2005. Hopefully they won't lose to many fans by the change in their sound. It is for the better.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Unlike most people who are hopelessly in love with Michael Buble, I am neither a fan of Josh Groban (gag me, please) nor Charlotte Church (who cannot enunciate for her life).  So when I heard about this Buble-fanaticism, I was skeptical and predisposed not to like him.<br /><br />However, Michael Buble caught me when I heard his song, \\"Home.\\"  His voice has such perfect intonation and clarity, and I was duly impressed.  Although a few of his songs cannot compete with the originals (How Sweet it Is) or even remakes (such as Ray Charles' version of \\"You Don't Know Me\\"), this boy has promise.  His co-written song \\"Home\\" is by far the best on the album, with \\"Feeling Good\\" a close second.<br /><br />As a singer myself, I feel that Buble is a truly talented young man for his age, and I would recommend this album.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Writhing up through the topsoil in all their animated brilliance, the Gorillaz (Damon Albarn, Jamie Hewlett, Miho Hatori, and newcomer Danger Mouse) dump a dirty layer of alt rock, Brit pop, and hip hop into their official sophomore effort Demon Days.  Too disillusioned to be completely sober and too hopeful to be apocalyptic, lead singer Damon Albarn depicts a shadow-riveted space opera played across a dancefloor littered with broken glass and burned bridges--an incredibly visual soundscape to say the least.   <br /> <br />Some tracks certainly stand out as strong singular efforts--the undeniable craftsmanship of \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" begs to be mentioned--but Days is best suited for a full playthrough, beginning to end, no skipping, no rewinding.  The lurking-in-the-dark mythos unfolds like cigarette stained origami, offering glimpses of blinding light to showcase a masterful glint off the teeth of that 800-pound gorilla in the corner of the room.  Sometimes playful but more often menacing, every track rides a storytelling narrative of danger and disguise, brutal honesty and beauty, slipping into a paranoid place between solace and solitude.   While Albarn refuses the limelight (his obvious stratagem in becoming fully animated) this is the work of a reborn writer coming to terms with his craft.  Anonymity is certainly an empowering factor in Albarn's world, and recruiting underground wunderkind Danger Mouse to spin gritty beats keeps things concrete. <br /> <br />The Dawn of the Dead intro dims the overheads from the beginning, creeping over the surface of the album like an eight-legged plague, and standing in stark contrast to the choral finale tracks.  Days plays more like a movie score than it does a music album, appreciating like a slow burn in the back of your psyche, scrolling through desolate landscapes and zombie-bred rhythms that aim directly at the heart of a glossy-eyed MTV generation.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Relative to their past glories (OK Computer and Kid A)this album feels half awake.  It has SOME of the intelligence of the past ones, but fewer good melodies, hooks and peaks.    After I sucked the goodness out of the excelent: 2 + 2=5, scatterbrained, sit down/stand up, sail to the moon, it felt a bit empty.      And frankly, there are really boring stretches of music here.    Granted, relative to all other popular band music, it fares better.  And it's not realistic to ask a band to change the world of pop music 3 times.    But this album is mostly for Radiohead fans.  For the fairweather Radiobrains fans, stick with the aformentioned albums.
0316776963|3.0|Good short stories from a talented writer. Only a few stories in the book were true page turners. I enjoyed the book for what it was but wouldn't read another book from Sedaris. He may be a best-seller but for me he doesn't quite fit.
B000069HK2|3.0|If you enjoy a lead singer almost yelling into the microphone the lyrics, you should enjoy this CD. I don't like lyrics that are screamed out. However this young Brittish alt rock band shows alot of promise and with two hit songs in the offing on this album 'The Taste Of Ink' and 'A Box Full of Sharp Objects'is passable. The two songs I mentioned were the standout hits and this CD is also enhanced with in studio video clips and a song video clip of 'A Box Full Of Sharp Objects' which wasn't half bad. The rest of the songs are not memorable and most of the lyrics are stressed out by the comical voice of lead vocalist Bert McCraken. This album is for only the hardcore heavy rock fans and those who need moshpit songs for parties and concerts.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has done it again. BIGTIME. The raw passion, emotion, and heartfelt energy and music CONNECTS on a level that FEW bands today can achieve. This band is pure GENIUS.  Every track on this CD is STELLAR, but if I had to pick my standout favorites, I would say 'White Shadows' (my absolute fave here), 'X&Y', 'Speed Of Sound', and 'The Hardest Part' do it for me.  The rest of the cuts are icing on the cake! I hear welcome elements of The Church, XTC, U2, New Order, The Fixx, etc.  But with Coldplay's distinct signature of course.  Easily one of the best releases of 2005 thus far!
0345442970|4.0|Don't get me wrong, Anakin is still my all time favorite Star Wars character (Even as Vader). But it was interesting to read a prequel book without him in it.  <br /> <br />This book focused on Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan. Well, Mostly Qui-Gon. I like it because I thought Qui-Gon was such a good character and an outstanding Jedi that I wished I could learn more about him. <br /> <br />Supreme Chancellor Valorum is under a lot of pressure...he's just too much of a nice guy and gets pushed around a lot. Little does he know that some of his \\"friends\\" are conspiring against him- Antilles, Adi and of course, his best friend Paplatine. An attempt was made on his life..well not really, they were just trying to scare him. Luckily, Qui-Gon and another Jedi were around.  <br /> <br />Qui-Gon is determined to find out who the assasin is and chase Cohl (gangster, pirate, thug...etc) around the galaxy against the wishes of the Jedi Council, of course. <br /> <br />We also see the beginning of some important events, such as the Trade Federation's pact with Sidious. At the end of the book, Gunray and his associate realize that they have bitten off more than they could chew. <br /> <br />Another attempt is made on Valorum's life, on a grander scale. Valorum knows he is danger but refuses to back down. Cohl led Qui-Gon on a wild goose chase and set a trap for them on another planet. Of course they realize what is going on and arrive at the summit in a knick of time to save the chancellor. After that, the chancellor is faced with unfounded alligations of corruptions and it is clear that his term will soon be over. <br /> <br />I like this book because I like Qui-Gon, I enjoy see him defy the council (\\"exasperate us, you do\\" (Yoda))to ultimately follow his heart and instincts and do what is right. Obi-Wan is his usual boring and uptight self and still has a lot to learn from his master. They are as different as night and day, but compliment each other, the same way that Anakin and Obi-Wan complimented each other. Anakin has a lot of Qui-Gon's defiance in him. I wish more books were written about him.  <br /> <br />This book did get boring in a couple of places, but is still worth the  read.
B000008HPE|3.0|In the 1980s and 1990s, the music landscape has taken on a \\"regional theme\\".   We've heard references to the \\"L.A. Scene\\" (hard rock), Seattle (grunge), Arizona (Alternative Rock), and many other places.   In 1984, San Francisco made it back on to the music map with a breakthrough album by Huey Lewis and the News called \\"Sports\\".   This would be the third album by Huey Lewis and the News.   \\"Sports\\" provided a unique mix of pop, rock, honky-tonk, new-wave, and retro sounds that made it one of the 1980s most successful albums.  As Huey Lewis and the News would prepare to release their follow-up to \\"Sports\\", they would face what many breakthrough artists face - the pressure of having that successful follow-up.    The follow-up album would be the band's fourth album - appropriately titled \\"Fore!\\".   While \\"Sports\\" is a landmark album for the 1980s, \\"Fore!\\" falls short.   Despite falling short, \\"Fore!\\" does have some moments.  In fact, it's the lesser commercially known songs that shine. <br /> <br />One thing that \\"Fore!\\" lacks is the unique flavor that \\"Sports\\" brought to the table.    The unique mix of sound that \\"Sports\\" had doesn't really exist on \\"Fore!\\".   The one positive area is that \\"Fore!\\" does continue the retro sound that \\"Sports\\" had - this is something has become a staple of Huey Lewis and the News' career.   This retro sound is highlighted by Johnny Colla's saxophone.  On \\"Sports\\", I felt that \\"If This Is It\\" was one of the weaker tracks.  I felt it was too \\"pop\\" sounding.   Unfortunately on \\"Fore!\\", Huey and the boys seem to try to build a sound more geared toward pop audiences. <br /> <br />Here is a song-by-song synopsis: <br /> <br />\\"Jacobs Ladder\\": This is a Bruce Hornsby penned song.  It would later appear on Hornsby's \\"Scenes From the Southside\\" album.  Huey had worked on Hornsby's debut \\"The Way It Is\\" album, so these guys had a working relationship.   Huey does a very good job (although the Hornsby version is superior).  Huey's vocals carry this song.  In fact, I consider this \\"San Francisco Sound\\" meets \\"Virginia Sound\\". <br /> <br />\\"Stuck With You\\": This was a very successful commercial song from the collection.   This song does have touches of those retro-sounding vocals, but to me this was always just an average song that was put in place to be played on commercial radio.. <br /> <br />\\"Whole Lotta Lovin\\":  This has a very 50s retro-sound.  The first 20 seconds are a cappella, then it takes on a Blues song.   This is not a bad song. <br /> <br />\\"Doing it All For My Baby\\":  Johnny Colla's Sax bits and Sean Hopper's keyboard will highlight this song.  I put this song in the same category as \\"Stuck With You\\".  Decent song, but an average one that seems geared for commercial radio. <br /> <br />\\"Hip to Be Square\\": This is one of the more catchy songs.  I would say it's good, but not great.  Huey and the Boys break the mold on this song as they seem to try a different sound.  The title says it all as it basically tells the story of a \\"60s renegade\\" who has grown up and now dabbles in \\"Real Estate\\" and \\"watches what he eats\\".   Johnny Colla's Sax bits midway through the song is a highlight.  There are some terrific background vocals - especially toward the latter part of the song.   The surprise is that these background vocals are performed by several members of the San Francisco 49ers.  These members include Joe Montana, Dwight Clark, Ronnie Lott, and Riki Ellison.  Surprisingly, the players do a great job on the vocals. <br /> <br />\\"I Know What I Like\\":  This is a song that got some attention.   This might be the most underrated track on the collection, but probably is the strongest track on the collection.   This song is highlighted by some great guitar work by lead guitarist Chris Hayes.   Huey gets a major assist on the background vocals by the San Francisco 49ers again.   On this song, Huey and the 49ers really blend nicely.  When Huey sings \\"Well What About You\\" - it reminds you a bit of \\"I Want aNew Drug\\".    It is worth noting that Hayes and Lewis are the songwriters on this song, so they really designed a song that fits their styles well. <br /> <br />\\"I Never Walk Alone\\": This is another lesser-known song.  It has a very 80s sound.  Once again - nice song, but not a great one.  Sean Hopper has some very nice keyboards again in this song.   While it's The News doing the retro sounding background vocals this time - it still has a very nice sound. <br /> <br />\\"Forest From the Trees\\":  I put this song in the same category of many of the other songs.  Good - but not great.   You'll hear touches of the retro sound throughout this song.  This is highlighted by the part \\"And if you're not afraid to open your eyes...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Naturally\\": This is a classic Doo-Wop a cappella song done by Huey Lewis and the News.   This isn't something that would be played on commercial radio, but it does have a terrific sound.   You won't hear instrumentation on this track - it's strictly vocals all the way.  They deserve a lot of credit for this song. <br /> <br />\\"Simple as That\\":  This might be the strongest song from a lyrical and musical standpoint.  Although Huey Lewis and the News didn't write this song, they do it justice by delivering a very strong performance.  Once again they find a way to integrate the retro sound in perfectly.   This is definitely one of the band's stronger numbers - and one of their most underrated songs. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics, musician, and production credits.   As mentioned above, this album isn't as strong as \\"Sports\\".  It doesn't have any bad tracks, but most of them fall into the category of \\"average\\".  The deep Huey Lewis fan will appreciate this collection.  Borderline fans might find some moments on this collection.  Overall, this album is probably worth getting for the lesser-known tracks.
B000002UVX|5.0|In honor of African American music month, I give my great thanks to the spectral and awesome Jimi Hendrix.  With his supreme power and unbelievable skill he reinvented the Electric Guitar and at the same time reinvented rock music altogether.  His live performances, like the ones captured here, bring out the true epic style of his playing with sky scorching, fuzzed electric solos and deep soulful vocals of peace and harmony.  Yes, the best guitar player of all time was an African American.  A close second is Jimmy Page.

It has seen its day and will soon be reckoned a thing of the past.\\" --  Eberhard Dennert,  At the Deathbed of Darwinism, 1904. <br /> <br />101 years later and nothing has changed for the anti-evolutionists.  I laugh when I see them claim that more and more scientists are rejecting evolution.  Such claims are a blatant lie.  Go to a university library and spend and afternoon browsing the science journals.  You won't find any articles in which scientists argue that evolution never happened.  They argue how it happens not whether it happened.  Nobody cares if you can get a scientist to sign an anti-evolution statement.  Show us the articles he has published in the scientific literature that demonstrate evolution is false.  Data is all that counts in science, not petitions or school boards.

When trade routes to the small planet of Naboo are cut off, an agressive act even by Federation standards, two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn & his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, are sent to peacefully resolve the situation. Jedi Knights are guardians of peace & justice to the galaxy. They believe in the power of \\"The Force\\", an energy force that combines the galaxy together.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the Jedi, Gunray is secretly in league with an evil Jedi, known as a Sith Lord, named Darth Sidious. Sidious commands Gunray to an all out invasion & ultimate control of Naboo with the planet's ruling Queen, Padme Amidala, being forced to sign a treaty between the Federation and her people. If Amidala doesn't sign the treaty her people will meet ostrication.<br /><br />Sidious also makes a move to kill the Jedi & upon their arrival on board Gunray's Federation Control Ship, the Jedi are attacked by Federation battle droids & are forced to quickly come up with their own battle plan.<br /><br />Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan sneak aboard a transport ship to Naboo's surface and with the help of the floppy eared, IQ challenged, aquatic Gungan, Jar-Jar Binks help Queen Amidala to escape from Naboo, aboard her royal starship.<br /><br />The plan is to get Queen Amidala to the city planet of Coruscant & to the Republic senate. There she can confer with the Naboo senator, Palpatine, & find out what is going on with Naboo, whose behind the attack, & why. The Jedi's plan runs astray while escaping from the planet, as Gunray attacks the Queen's ship, destroying their hyperdrive (a device that can get them to their destination in a quarter of the time).<br /><br />After an emergency landing on the sand planet of Tatooine, Qui-Gon & the Queen search for suitable replacement parts, & have a run in with the junk dealer Watto. Watto informs Qui-Gon that he does have the part but the money the Jedi has is no good. But hope isn't all lost when Qui-Gon meets Anakin Skywalker a young boy who works with Watto at the junkyard & is Watto's slave. Qui-Gon senses an extreme prescence of \\"The Force\\" in Anakin & comes to the conclusion that he might be the chosen one who can bring balance to \\"The Force\\", as well as, peace to the galaxy. Through the art of gambling & a little usage of \\"The Force\\", Qui-Gon gets the much needed part & frees Anakin from Watto.<br /><br />Finally, making it to Coruscant, Queen Amidala confers with Senator Palaptine & the Senate & receives a shock. The Supreme Chancelor, Valorum, decides that Naboo is to be under Federation control until proper measures can be taken with the Senate. Amidala fires off a vote of no confidence and Valorum is replaced (through a Senate vote) with, to the surprise of all, Senator Palpatine as the new acting Chancelor.<br /><br />But, Amidala decides not to sit by the sidelines and watch her people suffer & decides to lead the attack, with the aid of Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan, to take back the planet of Naboo & free her people. She also gets help from an unlikely source.<br /><br />With Nute Gunray unable to retrieve Queen Amidala, Darth Sidious sends out his own Sith apprentice, Darth Maul, to retrieve the Queen (to sign the treaty), kill the two jedi, & take control of Naboo.<br /><br />All bets are off as the battle for Naboo commences with the Jedi & the Sith facing off for the first time in over a thousand years.<br /><br />\\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\" is a great film, but, can't quite measure up to the first three \\"Star Wars\\" films (I personally rank this Episode last in the overall saga).<br /><br />Watching the first three films a million+ times over it was really odd to watch a \\"Star Wars\\" film without hardly any of the classic characters.

1591396190|2.0|First, there doesn't seem to be anything here besides, don't try Peter Druker's \\"fustest with the mustest\\" strategy.  These authors have some \\"tool\\" called a \\"strategy canvas\\", but it doesn't make sense at all.  It's a line graph, and they say that if the line goes up and down a lot, you don't have a coherent strategy.  The trouble is,  a line that goes up and down a lot can be turned into a line that makes just one transition from down to up by resorting the items on the x-axis, but they never really define how the x-axis should be ordered.  Go with the original Druker book instead.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I was originally going to give \\"X&Y\\" 3 stars, but then I listened to it again and liked it more than I did the time before, and I think with a few more listens it will settle in as a great CD.  There's a lot to discover here, and certain aspects of the musicianship start grabbing your attention after a while. <br /> <br />I agree with some of the other reviewers that Coldplay takes a bit to grow on you-- I also had the same experience with the other two albums.  Still, I feel it is safe to say this CD is not as striking as \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" but it almost like a softer, more ambient continuation of that album.   <br /> <br />Seems the synth and \\"filler\\" sounds are more prevalent on \\"X&Y\\", which detracts some because I really enjoy Jon Buckland's shimmering, prominent guitar sound on the previous album.  On \\"X&Y\\" the guitar is kind of buried at times under other swirling sounds-- if Coldplay has an edge, it is softened on \\"X&Y\\".   <br /> <br />But this is still the Coldplay you know and love, so the songs still deliver the gentle, soaring melodies we have come to expect from them.     <br /> <br />Highlights for me include \\"Fix You,\\" which is a nice slow-buildup from mild to anthemic tune, \\"Talk,\\" which does feature Martin following Buckland's guitar lead, and my favorite, \\"A Message,\\" which is a great acoustic to swirling atmospheric gem.   <br /> <br />Overall, this album will not disappoint Coldplay fans, and if it is your first Coldplay listen it will definitely draw you in to explore their other work.
0790732254|5.0|Others have detailed the genius of Edward Albee's play, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" I would only add that for those of you who doubt that Elizabeth taylor was once a superb actress, watch this movie!  Ms. Taylor shines as does Burton, Segal and Dennis.  Be prepared to be totally drained when the crdits roll.
B0007PALSE|1.0|1. Use a storyline that has been done to death. Machines taking over mankind. Gee where have we heard this before?<br /><br />2. Over-dependence on CGI<br /><br />3. Will Smith. This guy is the same character in every movie, a smart arsed be-atch who needs an attitude adjustment. What a punk.
B000008J3I|4.0|Like most compilations for just about any artist, this sampling of the works of multi-instrumentist Mike Oldfield falls short in its attempt to cover the artist's best works. A good example of this is the fact that it only provides a \\"taste\\" of the \\"Tubular Bells\\", only including 4:18 minutes of its opening, when it was his most transcendental work, one who earned him a grammy, boosted him into stardom and helped turn Virgin records into a prominent label.<br /><br />An attempt is made at covering bits and pieces of his work from most of his periods, and some listeners may end up being dissapointed by what they encounter (or by what they miss) here. The truth is that Mike Oldfield reminds me a good deal of Alan Parsons. Both have been outstanding artists who rose to fame for something great they did in the mid-seventies (Parsons' most famous landmark being his participation as Engineer for Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"). But both have also had their times during which they put out music that wasn't up to the expectations of those who idealized them. At the end of the day, the balance in the album tends to be less than optimal, but mostly due to its limited selection more than anything else.<br /><br />While not a bad album, I probably would recommend getting his originals or shooting for his box. There are definitely at least a couple of songs that do not belong in here, but it's mostly the missing songs the ones that you are not getting if you get \\"Elements\\".
B0002858YS|3.0|\\"Hot Fuss\\" is a fairly solid modern take of a band trying to sound like the best of what the new-wave 80's had to offer.  I think it starts out pretty well, with \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" (which is my favorite song but sounds like it came straight out of a Flock of Seagulls catalogue) and \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" being the strongest group of songs (and the obvious radio releases).  But then it kind of gets mired down in average-sounding minor-key semi-goth-synth.  I agree with many of the other reviewers in that the original influences are much better.  If you didn't have the Cure, Depeche Mode or the Smiths playing at your high school dances, explore some of that music-- early Duran Duran (\\"Rio\\"), or the \\"Best Of\\" Flock of Seagulls album will give you a good idea where the Killers got some of their ideas.  Still, not bad.
0790729652|2.0|I was very excited in 1989 when this flick came out; my best friend and I donned our brand new Batman shirts and went to see the picture. There was a good buzz about the film. Naturally we thought we were going to see the REAL Batman from the comics, not some goofy jokefest as in the 60's TV show (although, I admit, I enjoy the campy fun of that series, but it's NOT Batman).<br /><br />I can't tell you how disappointed we were with Tim Burton's film! Yeah, the costumes, sets, cast and cinematography were great (hence my grade of \\"C\\"), but the story was unrealistic, goofy and, worst of all, dull; in other words, it sucked! Tim Burton is outstanding with visuals, but he didn't take the Batman legend seriously and he failed to incorporate an interesting story. What good is a BORING film that looks great and doesn't take its subject seriously? This is a quintessential example of style over substance.<br /><br />Most of the high ratings of this film are from people who saw it when they were kids and they're just nostalgic. If they viewed the film objectively as an adult, with respect to the true Batman of the comics, they'd have to admit that it siphons.<br /><br />Oh, I suppose it could be enjoyed on some level as a sort of an ALTERNATIVE Batman; a friend of mine who's in the comic business stated that this was the only way he could enjoy this '89 \\"Batman.\\" But if you want to see a REAL serious Batman flick, true to the legend of the Dark Knight, catch \\"Batman Begins,\\" it blows this overrated soporific movie out of the water.<br /><br />GRADE: C
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Quite frankly, I was extremly disappointed. The Phantom of the Opera is my absolute favorite musical and I was looking foward to seeing the movie. I have seen the Phantom on stage and loved it. I also own the Original Cast Recording which is absolutely phenomenal.  <br />  Gerard Butler was miscast as the Phantom. He doesn't have the voice to have a lead role in a musical. He sounded like he had a horrible cold the entire movie. He couldn't reach the high or low notes and barely held those in between. The acting was mostly bland and some scenes were way too creepy for my taste. Raoul looked ridiculous and Christine seemed awfully stiff and rigid the whole movie. Did she ever change expressions? <br />  All in all the movie just didn't live up to my expectations.
B00006879E|5.0|Wow, this CD is awesome.  XM Radio Channel 22, The Mix, has been playing songs off this cd. I finally had to purchase it.  They guys have soul, funk and they ooze talent. The cd has been out for 2+ years though, why did it take us so long to discover them?  <br /> <br />They sound like no other group I have heard before so it's hard to determine who influenced their sound. It's a funky, r & b, rock kind of sound that's very easy on the ears and gets ya singing along.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Mezmerize continues to blow me away every time I listen to it.  There are so many adjectives to describe this album and band--unique is at the top of the list-- but SOAD delivers its message with the precision of a laser-guided bomb, aimed directly at the space between the listener's ears. <br /> <br />I am not a metal-head, and I personally do not agree with some of SOAD's views.  But with these guys, that is beside the point.  This is a sonic assault that challenges not only the way you think but the how you listen to music.  This is not random ravings and noise.  SOAD has crafted-- and I mean crafted because everything here is intricate, from the guitar play to the tempo changes to the harmonizing melodies-- a superb album that ranges from Metallica-like guitar chops to polka sounds, from screaming rants/howls to the sweetest of melodies.  It's totally whacked out at times but absolutely amazing, and when taken in total makes a lot of sense.   <br /> <br />Out of this seeming chaos emerges a smart, engaging mix of a lot of things, all of which combine to pummel you with challenges to sense and thought.   <br /> <br />This album is not for the faint of ear or for those easily offended by lyrics and music including sex, drugs, rock'n'roll-- or politics.  Nothing is safe from SOAD's lyrical and musical cross-hairs, even Tony Danza (?!).  And you are either going to be able to handle it or not.  Keep an open mind and really listen-- you may find yourself toe-tapping to this-- then wonder how you could when the song is about violence or destruction.  <br /> <br />My only, and very minor, complaint is that it is too short, although the material is a lot to swallow on a complete listen.  I am looking forward to the other half of this album, whenever it comes out. <br /> <br />And it seems irrelevant to me who takes more or less of the vocals-- both Serj and Daron combine and compliment each other for excellent effect. <br /> <br />And one more note-- I thought the Red Hot Chili Peppers had the market cornered on conjuring up imagery from their sound of my old and lost hometown, Los Angeles.  But the simmering closing track, \\"Lost in Hollywood,\\" brings you down to street level amongst the crazy hopeless crowd.     <br /> <br />Superb album.
B000068IEU|3.0|This \\"B\\" movie I guess was the big rage back in the early 70's because it was not afraid to show things that had never been explored...violent rape, humiliation, disembowelment and a unique form of castration... That list of things in a movie really does not appeal to me or I would hope most people. What I did find emotional about Last House was the total feeling of sorrow I felt for the murder victims. The scenes of there final demise was a great feeling of hopelessness of society's attitude towards violence as if is was nothing to kill someone...I don't know if that was the director's intention, but somehow those scenes with no soundtrack just dead silence really got to me.. <br />The rest of the movie was okay with some interesting ideas on revenge.
B000000W71|5.0|Gary hits the notes with a rare intesity and emotion, and it gives all the songs an added dimension. Soulful, melodic and powerful compositions, they get you into the 'ballads & blues' mood straight away, if you are already not into it! This will be a worthy addition to any music collection. Go for it. I had bought a cassette of this in my college days about 7 years ago, and the songs have a very special appeal to me 'cos they also gave me hope in my personal life.
B0009IW88A|2.0|The weak \\"main theme\\" (a recurring theme heard most especially in tracks 5, 12) for Batman Begins is taken/lifted from the combination of the main themes from the brooding soundtracks Memento and Shawshank Redemption.  2 of my all-time favorite soundtracks.    I really like Hans Zimmer, especially his work on Black Hawk Down, but this Batman Begins soundtrack lacks originality.    Listen to Thomas Newman's the Road to Perdition soundtrack...add some clangs and synthesizer to that soundtrack and you basically have the same soundtrack for Batman Begins.    Also, too much use of the synthesizer and drum machine, makes this soundtrack sound cheap.    With Hans Zimmer working on this, I expected better...definitely a much stronger theme...    The soundtracks for both Batman Begins and the Road to Perdition leave you feeling a sense of inconclusiveness...  These \\"weak\\" and anticlimactic scores can't stand out alone, and will never be considered \\"classics\\" like Elfman's original score is.
B000957O82|5.0|Okay, Hitch is not a masterpiece of thought prevoking comic genius by any means. What it is is a great romantic comedy with impecabble timing despite its typical premise...boy meets girl, loses girl...with something of a twist. It's the moments between Will Smith and his fellow actors that make this a real joy to watch. Will has such a personna and way of making the comedy work with his mannerisms you can't help but laugh. He turns ordinary dialogue into great comedy. Rent this just to have a few laughs. A very enjoyable experience.

0618001905|4.0|Very interesting book, about a very interesting time.  I like the writing style, and the research is credible.    Hochschild details the exploits of King Leopold of Belgium, as he sacks Central Africa in search of fame and fortune.  Mercenaries are used to collect 'the Rubber tax' and do so through the kidnapping of wives and children.  Hostages are mutilated or killed if the father fails to deliver.  Africans are literally worked to death, like old horses.  Tons of ivory are collected, and thousands of pounds of rubber, at the cost of 8 or 10 million lives.    A particularly interesting feature of this book is the diplomatic maneuvering of Leopold.  Belgium does not have the ability to seize this territory by main force.  So Leopold manipulates the media and creates a series of front organizations to give cover to the sack of Central Africa.    Part of what makes this book so interesting to me; is that Leopold is a man out of time when he does this.  This kind of thoughtless brutality is much more typical of the Western World before the reform movements of the early 19th century.  Asian and African tyrants are routinely this bloody, right up to the present day.  But Westerners were supposed to have stopped this sort of thing in about 1830!  In that sense, it is a glimpse of the previous era.  It allows you to look into the time when man packed slave ships and worked people to death in the sugar plantations of the Caribbean.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|For those of you who were disappointed with the cd after hearing no surprise, which is supposed to be the best song on the album, its too bad you weren't smart enough to realize that their style doesn't change throughout the cd. The song no surprise isnt much different than the rest of the cd so i don't know exactly what you were expecting. Anyways i think the cd is pretty damn good. This is good listening and so what if they sound a little like nickelback. Now we've got TWO bands that sound the same (like this is the first time). I would recommend this cd for nickelback fans but dont think its a \\"clone\\" because they definitely are much different and a little harder than nickelback.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw the stage play four times and loved it.  When I saw the movie last December I was absolutely thunderstruck.  It is truly a visual and audio feast.  Now I have the dvd.  I so love it.  The two disc version has many terrific extras.   The history of the Phantom of the Opera includes snippets of performances from the early stages of the play and tells some of the changes that were made.  I found that very interesting.  The Making of the Movie was even more fascinating with a focus on how the cast was selected and the technical aspects of the film.  There were interviews with the cast and an hilarious cast and crew sing a long.  One of the highlights for me was the new song, Noone Would Listen sung by Gerard Butler.   <br /> <br />The acting is superb in this tragic love story, especially Gerard Butler who portrays the Phantom.  He is darkly mysterious in the beginning but as the story progresses, he descends into madness.  In the end he will break your heart.  His voice is a rich and beautifully expressive rock and roll tenor that soars on its own but also blends perfectly with the other two leads.  Emmy Rossum was born to play Christine.  She has a beautiful voice and is a lovely actress.  Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul in a role that is much expanded from the stage play.  Minnie Driver is wonderful as Carlotta and Miranda Richardson creates a compassionate Madame Giry.   <br /> <br />I loved this movie and highly recommend the dvd.  One viewing is definitely not enough.

B000001C6M|5.0|This record is timeless. This is a turning point in what was concidered \\"heavy\\" metal. When Slayer came to the scene, they left other bands in the dust. More evil than Iron Maiden. Better and faster than even Metallica. Seriously this album is insanely fast! Maybe not in the same way as Reign In Blood, but for 1983 this the speed of the riffing and drumming is unbelievable. Slayer became a household name for themselves in metal....Hell Awaits, Seasons In The Abyss, God Hates Us All...all Slayer records are great in their own way but this one takes the cake as far as content and overall classic value. No need for a track run because its all good through and through. If you can find it, get the restless records version of Show No Mercy w/ the Haunting The Chapel e.p. on it! 13 classic Slayer cuts. If you listen to heavy metal you must get this and Bloodbath's Nightmare's Made Flesh. Stay sick.
B000002UAO|5.0|'Rubber Soul' was the first cd i ever purchased when I first started spending my own money. I grew up on The Beatles since my Dad listened to them when I was a kid. He had most of their records, but it's a shame he didn't buy them past 'Magical Mystery Tour' and 'Sgt. Peppers'. He never had 'Rubber Soul' for some reason. I wanted to get into more of their music starting off, so I bought 'Rubber Soul' because it contained the song Michelle which I really liked and It wasn't on any of his Beatles studio albums. Basically the song Michelle is what got me into the CD generation. Funny, because it wasn't originally on CD.<br /><br />Since 'Rubber Soul' I bought 'Revolver', 'The White Album', 'Abbey Road' etc... then I started buying the albums my Dad already has on vinyl. I haven't yet bought the really early albums though.<br /><br />As for 'Rubber Soul' it's a great album put out by The Beatles with great songs like 'Girl', 'Michelle', 'In My Life', 'Run For Your Life' and especially the beautiful 'Norwegian Wood'. This album, like many people say it, is The Beatles turning point to becoming a really awesome band in the late 60's.<br /><br />My top 5 favorite Beatles albums are:<br /><br />White Album<br /><br />Abbey Road<br /><br />Sgt. Peppers<br /><br />Revolver<br /><br />Rubber Soul<br /><br />So, if you are not into the Beatles yet i suggest the later years, because that's when they were at their greatest, then again who wouldn't be into the Beatles yet...<br /><br />Since buying this album I also got into the stones, zeppelin, the who, floyd, hendrix, deep purple and even good ol' 90s rock as well. A wide variety of rock and roll! From classic rock, psycidelia, blues, hard rock, metal, industrial, country rock etc.<br /><br />Thank you Beatles for inspiring so much great music.
B0006213H6|4.0|Take Loveless (my bloody valentine), add in Amnesiac (Radiohead) and a little modern classical music (I suggest Black Angels by George Crumb), and you get Von. This is more the soundtrack to your worst nightmare, you know, the one with the flesh eating teddy bears and that evil cheshire cat from Alice. But nowhere in this album does it even sound remotely similar to Sigur Ros' other albums. <br /> <br />Like (), the album is split into two halfs. This time, however, the split is more monumental-there's an 18 second intermission of pure silence. Trust me, you'll need every last milisecond before you plunge into the brooding second half. <br /> <br />The album begins with some kind of hellish ritual, with some kind of percussive glass, demonic laughter and agonized screams. More than music, it sounds like the effects to a movie about the apocalypse. After 9:47 minutes of intense fear, you are thrown into some sublime chorus. Still no discernable melody, but a welcome release from the satanic imagry. About 2:30 minutes into Dogun, the album's second track, we're back to creepy atmosphere. <br /> <br />In fact, there's no tune until Hun Jora (3), and in comparison, it sounds like some rock tune from heaven. Sigur Ros breaks out the electric guitars and jams through to the intermission in music that all but shouts \\"Loveless!\\" <br /> <br />The second half is much less interesting, sounding a bit more like the dull () than the first. The epic 12:00 Hafssol is very unique and brooding, and actually referrences the later \\"Olsen Olsen\\". However, I can't help but feel the album falls apart at Von, which sounds a bit too much like sappy acoustic/synth new age music. <br /> <br />The second half has it's moments though. Syndir Guos features an agonizing scream at a perfect G# which makes up the melody with the bass in a truly original moment. However, even this gets old after 7:42 with a repetitive \\"Olsen Olsen\\" bass line. This is followed by nearly 5:00 of complete silence, which is more of a joke than a calm moment. <br /> <br />If you like creepy ambience, I would highly recommend this album. The first half more than makes up for the bizarre second half, bringing it up to 4 stars.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Hey guys!  Are all of you peeved with the MGM North American DVD of \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" which eliminates the Eurythmics contributions to the soundtrack in favor of the Dominic Muldowney-only score?? <br /> <br />Well, I have good news for you.  The British DVD from MGM features the Eurythmics/Muldowney score as you fondly remember it!  In my opinion, the slip cover art and menu design on the British MGM DVD is also far superior to MGM's North American release.   <br /> <br />The only catch, however, is that the British DVD release is of course in Region 2 PAL format, so you will require a DVD player which supports that particular region-coding and PAL format (I bought a multi-region DVD player from an online vendor over a year ago for under $100 and it works like a charm!).  <br /> <br />The differences between the North American and British MGM DVD releases of \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" are as follows: <br /> <br />* The North American MGM DVD is widescreen with an anamorphically enhanced 1.85: 1 aspect ratio; the color is brighter and more saturated. <br /> <br />* The British MGM DVD is also widescreen with an anamorphically enhanced 1.85: 1 aspect ratio; the color is desaturated to give the movie a decidedly gloomier tone. <br /> <br />* The North American MGM DVD features 20 chapter stops and runs 110 minutes in total. <br /> <br />* The British MGM DVD features 16 chapter stops and runs 106 minutes in total (I did not notice any cuts or scenes missing from the movie itself, perhaps the shorter length on this DVD is simply due to fewer credits tacked on at the beginning and the end).  <br /> <br />* The North American MGM DVD has only one audio track: original English-language with the Muldowney-only soundtrack in MONO.   <br /> <br />* The British MGM DVD includes an option of FOUR different spoken-language audio tracks to choose from: the Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack is featured on the original English-language and French-language audio tracks; it uses theMuldowney-only soundtrack for the German-language and Spanish-language audio tracks.  All audio tracks on this DVD are MONO.  <br /> <br />* The North American MGM DVD includes optional English, French and Spanish subtitles. <br /> <br />* The British MGM DVD includes optional English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Portuguese, and Turkish subtitles. <br /> <br />* The theatrical trailer on the North American MGM DVD is more subdued and features the soporific Muldowney score with a British announcer advertising the movie. <br /> <br />* The theatrical trailer on the British MGM DVD is flashier with the Eurythmics song \\"Sexcrime\\" blaring throughout and features an American announcer advertising the movie as \\"coming to a theater near you\\". <br /> <br />You can purchase the British MGM DVD from www.amazon.co.uk or any other online vendor for a reasonable price.

B00005JMYI|4.0|Anchorman is my kind of movie. It gives you lots of great laughs, and has a good cast and awesome cameos. The movie's about Ron Burgundy, the # 1 and beloved anchorman in San Diego. He loves his dog, women, and scotch and life is perfect for Ron. But then a woman whom he finds very attractive wants to be an anchor. Ron and co anchors are infuriated because it's a man's job and it's anchorman and not anchorwoman. Ron's obviously got some new competition on his own news station and of course also has competition with all of the other news stations. (That have lead anchors Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller) The reumble between all of the news stations a la West Side Story rocks! Ron's co anchors all also neat and funny especially Brick, a very \\"special\\" weather man. (You'll have to watch to find out)  The movie's plot is simple and it's quite stupid but is just absolutely hilarious. The motorcycle/ burrito scene with Jack Black is the best but this movie's got loads of laughs. If you want some good laughs in your collection, this one's a good choice. Also the special features rock with Ron Burgundy at the MTV awards, and auditioning for ESPN. And lastly, there are a lot of hilarious deleted scenes. This one's worth your money.
B0001A79JO|3.0|The Horrorpops are still finding their way musically.  This is a good thing, except that they have a few veterans in their band who should already know the dusty back roads to psychobilly-ville.  But okay...  The weak tracks? \\"Kool Flat-top\\" and \\"Ghouls\\".  The former because it sounds like filler and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The latter because of that totally annoying ska pentameter.  The sad part about \\"Ghouls\\" is that the chorus is very good --it's just wrapped up in a crappy song. <br /> <br />Overall, the songs are quite good. <br /> <br />\\"Psychobitches Outta' Hell\\" is pure and perfect for those of us who want a female vocalist for a change from the plethora of Elvis-sound alikes or fake-country-accents in the scene --something I refer to as the Green Day, or Madonna effect (regarding phony affectations). <br /> <br />Horrorpops' lead singer is a little bit restricted in her vocal range and the album as a whole has some rough spots.  But cut them some slack.  Musically they got it.  This first complete album is a good effort.  Hopefully they'll improve on it by puting their focus on what works.    <br /> <br /> <br />   <br />
B0002F6BRE|1.0|This movie was supposed to be a good holiday movie and I watched it actually right around Christmas and expected to enjoy it. Boy, I really didn't. Personally, it was one of my least favorite movies I've ever seen. The plot is simple and cute, being about a human that's adopted as a baby by Santa Claus to work with other elves. But when this human realizes that he's different, Santa sends him to the real world to find his real dad. Sure, it sounds cute and everything but I found it to be just terrible. It delivered no laughs and was just way too babyish and weird. I like Will Ferell on Saturday Night Live and in Anchorman but not in childish stuff like this. I also find this movie to be too simple and stupid and immature for toddlers to watch. Whenever I hear the name elf again, I'll be sure to take cover and hide. This was a dissapointment and a letdown to me.
B00064X3FE|5.0|A review of the SACD reissue.<br /><br />Regarded by many of Elton's ardent fans as a masterpiece, alongside his absolute classic [[ASIN:B0000PCUDK Goodbye Yellow Brick Road:Remastered SACD/+DVD]], &#34;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&#34; is a journey all on it's own. The album is biographical with all of the songs detailing Elton and his longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin's struggle during the early days of their career. Containing the hit single &#34;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&#34; and the classic closing track &#34;We All Fall in Love Sometimes/Curtains&#34; this album is a must for anyone serious about the music of Elton John who may also want to know a little of the story behind the success. Now on to the SACD re-mix/re-issue. What a fantastic job Greg Penny has done remixing the album into 5.1 for SACD. Anyone who owns Elton's back catalogue may do well to start replacing the 1995 remastered issues with the far superior SACD sound. This edition also has the bonus tracks included on the 1995 re-issue making it even more value for your dollar.
B00005JKCH|5.0|While this movie isn't as good as its sequel, it still is awesome. The movie does a nice job of telling the stroy of Spiderman. For those of you that don't know the plot, this movie is about a nerdy photographer named Peter Parker who lives with his aunt and uncle. He has a huge crush on Mary Jane Watson, his neighbor, but she probably doesn't. But, he suddenly changes once he gets bitten by a spider. He acquires superpowers and do wrestling to win money to buy a car so that Mary Jane will like him. He wins but the boss refuses to give him the amount that he owed. Spidey then doesn't stop a robber to make his point towards the boss's lies but he has made a big mistake. The robber then kills Spidey's uncle and then he gets revenge and becomes Spiderman. From then, he fights crime and then must fight a new vilain named the Green Goblin.  <br />The movie is so good because it introduces the nerdy and weak Peter Parker and it then shows his developpment into a superhero. The visuals are gorgeous and the fights are awesome. The acting is also great with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe perfect for their roles. A must see.
B000059XUP|1.0|Before reading on, please note that I only give this movie 1 out of 5 stars, but Amazon won't display it correctly for some reason. Anyways, carry on.    After the huge success of \\"The Crow\\", one automatically assumed that a sequel would soon be in the works. However, due to the tragic death of the original film's star, Brandon Lee, there was some doubt as to whether or not a new film should be made. In the end it was decided that each new Crow film would feature an all-new character taking over the avenging mantle.    This decision didn't set well with some fans of the original. Many of them felt that continuing the series without the presence of Brandon Lee would be trampling upon the memory of his performance. Personally, even though I do agree that Brandon Lee portrayed the best version of the Crow, the idea of changing out the main character every time suited the franchise perfectly. Not to mention, the original film didn't exactly leave an open ending for the return of Eric Draven. So, even if Brandon had lived, I think this was the proper course for the series to take.    \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" is set in a city resembling a completely depraved version of Los Angeles. Slowly destroying this city one life at a time with a highly addictive drug is the sick and twisted Judah Earl (Richard Brooks) and his gang of deviants. One of their latest victims, a man named Ashe (Vincent Perez), who was brutally murdered along with his young son by the gang, has returned to avenge their deaths. Joined by a mysterious young woman named Sarah (Mia Kirshner) and the mystical crow, Ashe begins his mission of revenge. However, will he be strong enough to stop the evil that destroyed his life?    Despite the assurances from screenwriter David Goyer that this film would rock, while paying respect to the first film, and above all, please even those fans of the original that felt it was tantamount to sacrilege to continue the series; in the end, this sequel just does not work. So, how could this happen when it seemed that the movie had so much going in its favor?    Well, for starters the story written by David Goyer (\\"Batman Begins\\") is even darker, more twisted, at times sadistic, and utterly weak that it can't help but pale in comparison to its predecessor. The original film was dark, and featured some undeniably twisted characters for villains, but they never reached this level of depravity. Even in that film's darkest moments I didn't get the sense that those times were simply being included gratuitously to push the envelope of edginess in film.    For instance, there were numerous occasions where rather than include some much needed character or plot development the movie opted to show more sadistic and/or perverse imagery. Typically this was done at a time when Ashe was soon to be encountering one of the gang members responsible for his murder. Obviously these scenes were to make us hate the villains even more than we already do. The problem is that these moments occur far too often in a single 90 minute movie. Plus, it was a lazy way to convey the evil inherent in a particular villain, so that when Ashe dispatches his brand of justice the audience will be completely on his side. This was unnecessary because only the coldest of viewers would not completely hate characters willing to kill a father and his son. So, to go to such extremes just to give us these extra tidbits of incentive to root for Ashe was irrelevant.    I for one don't want to be force fed in such an obvious fashion via these demented sequences that this gang and its leader are evil incarnate. Find some compelling way to tell the story, and over the course of the movie reveal these various criminal activities or dark traits to me. You don't have to beat me over the head with this crap in an almost non-stop manner for me to understand the sheer malevolence on display. I'm not so dense that I can't pick up on plot points and character development spread out over the course of a movie.    Beyond the degeneracy on display from the completely one-dimensional villains, the two \\"good\\" characters Ashe and Sarah were uninteresting and boring compared to any of their forebears from the original. Their moments together were intended to showcase them as star-crossed lovers, plus give us some insight into their characters. Ultimately though, there was no real spark between the two of them and I never really got to learn much more about them either. Part of me believes this is due to neither performer really giving their all in the scenes, on top of the fact that the script was paper-thin.    Honestly, if it wasn't for the obligatory flashback sequences filling us in on what happened to Ashe and his son, we really wouldn't know much about him or care. Truth be told, the only reason we even remotely root for him to succeed is because of the unbelievably heinous nature of the criminals he's hunting, which again is due to the repeated usage of disturbing imagery and the flashbacks of the murders.    As for Sarah, there were several unanswered questions surrounding her character. Such as, what exactly is her link to the mystical crow and how did it come about? Plus, is she on the run from her memories or just can't stand being in a single location for too long? Maybe her whole backstory is a combination of the two or neither. Whatever the case may be, screenwriter David Goyer managed to mishandle virtually every single aspect of this film's story from start to finish. This meant that no matter how incredible the director or actors and actresses may come across, the movie was destined to fail from the get-go.    It is due to weak points in the story such as these that led this sequel to feeling like some half-hearted, under-developed attempt at cashing in on the previous movie's success and perhaps even the memory of Brandon Lee. Thankfully, in the years since \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" David Goyer appears to have fine-tuned his writing skills, and has crafted many a terrific screenplay. Perhaps it was just an off day for him when he wrote this drivel or the studio and/or director hamstringed him during the filming and editing processes. Who knows?    Speaking of the film's director, Tim Pope, this is as far as I can tell his only feature film work to date, otherwise he's typically a music video director. I will grant Tim that he was straddled with a shoddy screenplay full of sickness and disgust, so the task of making this film even remotely entertaining was daunting. Although, he is apparently a fan of rocker Iggy Pop's, who also happens to appear in this film and Iggy is one twisted individual from what I can tell. So, maybe this movie wasn't a challenge to work on after all, except for the whole \\"make it entertaining\\" part. Hmmm...    Anyways, I should give some credit to Tim and his crew for creating a very eerie atmosphere for the movie. Where the original film seemed to borrow heavily from Tim Burton's influence, this movie featured a distinctive tone all its own to set it apart from not only the previous movie, but any comparisons to other darker heroes as well. Beyond that, I don't have anything really good to say for Mr. Pope, because he doesn't appear to be all that talented of a director in my estimation. Every scene featuring the criminals felt repetitive, as did scenes of Ashe riding his motorcycle or talking with Sarah. Nothing about this movie's visual style, beyond the look and atmosphere, stood out or was exciting in any respect.    Finally, we arrive at the film's cast, or as I think of them, the last remaining weak links in this already fragile chain. To begin, new lead star Vincent Perez (\\"I Dreamed of Africa\\") was a poor follow-up to Brandon Lee's superb performance as Eric Draven. Now, I didn't set out to compare the two actors' performances, but being a sequel a comparison is inevitable and in my estimation, warranted. Vincent never seemed to possess, or at least be able to convincingly convey the rage of his character the way Brandon did with Eric. With Vincent, he always seemed uneasy and when he did begin to cut loose in a possible fit of rage, he wound up looking goofy. Plus, his character seemed too effeminate much of the time, so I was never really sold on him being the avenging type, which would be the key for Vincent to really sell this character to the audience.    Portraying the only returning character from the original film, Sarah, although this movie is set several years later in her life, is actress Mia Kirshner (\\"The Black Dahlia\\"). Mia as shown in various other projects, both in film and on TV, is a very capable and talented actress. Yet her portrayal in this film, as I touched upon earlier, is incredibly disappointing and uninspired.    Maybe her reasons for not appearing as committed to the role as I felt she should be is due to her character's bizarre, unexplained traits and lame story arc. I mean, if I were in her shoes, and given a character that is exhibiting odd abilities and seems to be on the run from something in her past (which doesn't make sense given how things were looking up for her at the closing of \\"The Crow\\"), then I would probably find it difficult to get into the role. So perhaps the blame cannot fully rest with her, but must be laid once more at the feet of David Goyer and his script, or director Tim Pope.    Rounding out the main characters of this movie are actor Richard Brooks (TV's \\"Law and Order\\") and rock star Iggy Pop (\\"Snow Day\\") as the film's primary villains. Actually, I must correct myself, if you looked at the movie's screen time for the various characters, you would make the assumption that these two villains were the only main characters of the story, and that Ashe and Sarah were ancillary roles rather than the leads. Anyways, I digress.    As the leader of the gang responsible for Ashe and his son's murder, Judah Earl, is Richard Brooks. Much like Mia Kirshner, I know Richard Brooks is a capable actor in other roles, but even though his actions are despicable and steeped completely in all things evil, he as a character was never menacing. His performance just never really sold me on Judah being this man that commands the respect of all these deviants that he surrounds himself with, and that he would be in control of an apparently vast drug empire. I just don't see how he would have risen to such a powerful role compared to some of his underlings, in particular the most immoral and wicked of the gang, Curve played by Iggy Pop.    Speaking of Iggy, his portrayal of Curve was over-the-top, twisted, and had an underlying streak of insanity running throughout. Out of the entire cast, Iggy's was the only performance that was interesting, if for no other reason than that I wasn't sure what exactly he was going to do next. So at the very least he proved to be an intriguing presence, even though his character takes part in seemingly every vice conceivable by man. That being said, he also is given numerous ridiculous lines of dialogue that are so bad it's laughable, and many times he seemed to be overacting which made his performance amateurish at best. It is with those thoughts that make the fact that his was the most memorable performance of the bunch, all the more sad and pathetic.    You know, it's a shame that such an excellent movie could kick start what should be a promising franchise, only to have said franchise begin to falter with the first sequel out of the gate. But, that's what happens when your follow-up is plagued by a horrible script that is bogged down by the sickest and most twisted individuals one can conceive of, uninteresting performances for the most part, and repetitive sequences that show zero creativity or imagination. If you enjoyed the original movie, but never got around to this particular sequel, feel free to skip it. Trust me, you haven't missed anything.    \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" is rated R for violence, language, and pervasive sexuality/nudity.
B000069HZP|5.0|When I saw this movie last year, I wasn't eager to see it at all. I went into it with no expectations because I hadn't see any other work by Fincher. But, afterwards, I thought that this movie was just great. The plot is very original, the acting is wonderful, there are many well made and developped creepy elements, and the conclusion of it is very unpredictable. The movie is about a frustrated banker that is remembering his father's suicide because it's going to be his 48th birthday and on his father 48th birthday, he had committed suicide. But when his younger brother gives him a very mysterious gift to play \\"the game\\", everything goes awry. The game has no rules and he doesn't know who he can trust. That's all I'll say so that I don't give away any spoilers. The movie develops perfectly and the acting is great by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. The movie also develops thanks to many creepy elements. The flashback of the father's suicide is well made and everything in this movie clicks right. A definite must see.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Just so you can make a fair judgment on whether you should buy this album or not, I am not one of those DIE HARD COLDPLAY FANS! <br />Rush of Blood was a spectacular album from start to finish.  Easily one of the best albums of the decade (or millenium) so far. That's why we and I and you and everyone was looking forward to this album. Probably the most enthusiastically welcomed followup since OK Computer or Slim Shady LP. <br />But, to be frankly honest, I was disappointed. <br />Here's why: <br /> <br />-It is soooo obvious that this was overproduced and glossed over.  Not the worst sin for a record unless you are a musical purist.  But the bands just plays like it is trying hard to make every beat and vocal line fit in.  And they compensated for that by writing some songs that wander to nowhere. <br />Now, there are a few good ones, \\"White Shadows\\" has that familiar backbeat and a great chorus. <br />\\"Speed of Sound\\" is their tread to the previous album's \\"Clocks\\" <br />But it gets less catchy with every listen. <br />\\"A message\\" is a good lyric-melody combo and \\"Talk\\" sounds like <br />something Brian Eno might do - a cool song. <br />But the rest just are sort of blah.  \\"X&Y\\" and \\"The Hardest Part\\" are real pretentious. Read the lyrics for goodness sakes! <br />\\"What if\\" builds up to absolutely nothing.  <br />By the time \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" you just wanna scream to Martin to stop playing the same song over and over again. <br />Hey but this album will sell so what.. <br />They seem to playing it too safe and I loved Rush when they took chances and made a unique, driven song.  You don't find it here. Sorry.  Wait till it comes out in the discount bin in six months for 6.99. <br />
B00003CXC7|5.0|While I do prefer psycho over this one, Rear Window still is a masterpiece of one of Hitchcock's best. The cast has two greats in Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, the music is classic, the suspense is fanastic, and the plot's perdect. The plot is centered around a photographer played by Jimmy Stewart who is sidelined because of an accident. He thus is in a wheelchair and lives life by inspecting and observing everyone in the neighborhood. He has his binoculars and learns that one person might be an opera singer, and another might be a writer. That's what he does the whole day. What's so fantastic about this is a study of people and their hobbies and jobs. The photographer has nothing to do and can find out dark secrets of some neighbors even. When he is convinced that the wife of one neighbor has dissapeared, he inspects the husband, convinced he has killed her and burried her in her garden. He then sends his girlfriend over to the man's apartement to inspect. His plan is dangerous but absolutely brilliant. The movie itself is brilliant with a great score, one hell of a neat plot, and a great finale. The suspense is great and Hitchcock once again has proven himself to be a legendary director.
0060234814|5.0|I have read this book a few times before, but this time, I have come to notice new things that I had never seen before, which truly showed the brilliance of Lewis in weaving the reality of life in a fantasy story.   The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe continues from The Magician's Nephew where the wardrobe that Digory (who became the Professor) made a wardrobe out of the tree he had planted from the core of the Apple (which was used to heal Digory's mother) from Narnia.  Aslan, the Lion, is the parallel of Jesus Christ, and the With parallels Satan.  In this, shows the epic struggle to save the life of Edmund who had become a traitor. <br /> <br />One area that jumped out was the parallels between sin and the Turkish Delight that Edmund ate.  When the witch asked what Edmund wanted, he told her that he wanted Turkish Delight, and that desire for Turkish Delight was already in Edmund, just like the sinful nature of human beings.  The Witch just fed the sinful nature, and it was written of the enchanted Turkish Delight that \\"anyone who had tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go one eating it till they killed themselves.\\"  When we feed our sinful nature, we would keep craving for more, even though we feel the ill effects of it (like Edmund did), and soon become enslaved to it that we could even consume it till it kills us.  This is one of the profound truths that Lewis was communicating through the story. <br /> <br />Also, the way Edmund reacted is so much like that of one who did not know the Savior, like how he had reasoned that the Witch was not so bad and the others may actually be the enemy, but all the time being enslaved to the need to have more Turkish Delight.  The bondage was so strong that the taste of a good and decent meal was not satisfactory, as his mind kept thinking of the Turkish Delight.  Also, when the 4 children were told of Aslan, Peter, Susan and Lucy felt positive things, but Edmund felt \\"a sensationof mysterious horror.\\"  In light of the sin that Edmund had committed, being in the presence of Aslan would send a fear because of the reality of judgment for one's sin. <br /> <br />Another area that was brilliant reveals our mind set towards the spiritual (for this case the world of Narnia) where Peter and Susan did not belive Lucy even though she was the honest one.  The discourse with the Professor was a similar logic that can be applied to Jesus Christ, that if Jesus is telling the truth, then He is God, and if not, He is either a lunatic or a liar.  Historically, He was not called a lunatic or a liar, so Jesus has to be God! <br /> <br />This is a story brilliantly written, and I would likely pick it up some years from now to have a read again and see what gems Lewis had hidden in his writings.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I'm always watching films like this from a designer's standpoint (and as entertainment too, of course!) and honestly the more I see this thing the more it wows me. There's a lot of thought and depth here and it's not going to be immediately apparent for those accustomed to the in-your-face design work done in sci-fi/fantasy today. Go ahead and shoot me but Hollywood designers back then were better than now. These days you're seeing plenty of CGI, new materials, new lighting, and whatnot but you're not seeing too much that's as impactful, and magical, as, say, Robbie the Robot in this film or the entire saucer landing sequence. If I had about sixty pages I could explain why that's so...and what went wrong. I'd say these days we're just better at filling a screen, replacing stimulating content with, well, just stimulation. <br /> <br />Current designers have a real problem creating truly alien technology and images. Compare the Alien spaceship from \\"Planet of the Vampires\\" with its update in the already ancient \\"Alien\\" (effectively the remake). Giger's work is certainly creepy (bones and spines always are in the near-dark) but there's no real sense of alien-ness to the sets. It could be a scene in a straight horror flick or something about Hell. <br />Now think of that scene in comparison to anything since. Yep, that was about as good as it gets nowadays and just about everything since merely echoes it. <br /> <br />Now look at the Krell technology in this film. Brilliant--immense underground works that defy analysis. Stuff's clearly going on, important stuff, but you have little idea what it is. Then dig the holographic generator (they didn't call it that back then, of course). Better than the Princess Leia bit in the original Star Wars. Much better. Pay close attention to everything about Robbie; he was one of the most elaborate and expensive film props of all time. Everything about his design and function is stunning. Note the lack of \\"eyes\\" and ask yourself how and why he works as an effective design without them. This is the highest level of imaginative deign work and it's in a fifty year old movie. <br /> <br />I'm in awe of nearly every detail in this flick and I always find more with each viewing. <br /> <br />So that's a promo to watch it for the visuals. Otherwise it's a fun story that really vibes on WWII vintage guy culture and that's great fun too. Walter Pidgeon is wonderful as Morbius and it's fascinating how he breaks with film dialogue tradition of that time (and even now) and ums and ahs his way through his lines. It makes his somewhat pompous character human and infinitely more believable. He brought a lot of depth to a great role. <br /> <br />The print on this DVD is OK and just barely. Plenty of scratches and the color looks a hair faded. If any movie of this era deserves the full remastering treatment (Hello Criterion) this would be it. I'm sure the current owners just see it as another way to make a buck and little more, so I doubt they'll get around to it. Sad, ain't it? My guess and hope is that eventually, as the film industry runs more and more out of ideas to steal and hits rock bottom with shock and sensationalism, recycling the old films themselves might be an option. Last movie I went to see I watched probably 20 cars total get wrecked, 4 or 5 point-of-view projectiles, and too many things dropping out of the skies or exploding in the various previews. It was almost laughable--there was more creativity evident in last season's Hallmark Card line. There's only X number of ways one can do awful things to people and stuff you know, and sex and naked people get boring real fast. Real fast. Even the dullest must be getting tired of this stuff. <br />
0345457684|3.0|This isn't a bad book.  Morgan takes a fairly cool idea and instead of exploring the idea of where it leads you from a society POV or from a possibility POV, he pre-generates the societies and then tells a sci-fi noire story of a new age special ops detective.  The idea is good, the writing is ok, and the worlds are great.  I personally found the violence in this book brutal, yet fascinating.  It started in the prologue and even from the first few pages, the \\"shock and awe\\" had me looking forward to the rest of it.  And it was there through the rest of the book too.  There's some pretty vivid sex in this as well, though, I found it took away from the story as opposed to making it better, for a guy who was special trained for being self-reliant and a hard case, he fell into sex traps a lot.  Anyways, just what I thought.   <br />I found this a long book and after 2/3's? the way through, I was getting fairly bored with it.  The start had me racing, this was pretty cool, and the violence was \\"wow, that's harsh\\" kind of stuff, things you shouldn't enjoy but you do.  And the story was interesting as to everything else that was happing, but the base investigation of a suicide was ok (no plot give aways here).  After 2/3's I found I thought the events were still interesting, and a good way to clue things up, but the fascination wasn't there anymore.   <br />It was a strong start and an ok end.
B000002J09|5.0|Ok lets look back on Led Zeppelin's career before Led Zeppelin IV/Zoso/The Runes Album/Untitled whichever you prefer and see that Led Zeppelin's success was bown to occur. Led Zeppelin debuted in 1969 with their 1st self- titled album and in almost 3 years they were the biggest thing ever to hit the street. I mean look at the damn album, you have Rock and Roll, Black Dog, When the Levee Breaks, Misty Mountain Hop, and then there's Stairway to Heaven. Honestly this album would of never been so successful if it wasnt for Stairway to Heaven. Its a stupid and obvious thought in the most part but we all have to know what song was in the driver seat and which ones were enjoying the ride. The one thing I absolute hate is how people at the time in 1971 and 1972 felt that Stairway to Heaven was too prefect to be human and they had to of done something to get it. Maybe sold there souls to the devil in return, BULL**** because I mean if I was in the entertainment industry or whatever I would be jealous too for Led Zeppelin's style, creativity, success, and character because they did it on there own. So duh this album is worth every penny that you have because its an all- time classic thats 22x Platinum! Michael Jackson's Thiller album is now 27x and thats all pop music. Okay so with the 700 and whatever reviews about this album are very mixed with lots of 5's and many 1's. Honestly, this album is a 5 because this damn thing is great and needs to be in everyone's collection because I wish I could of been around to hear these songs when they were fresh on the  radio.  <br /> <br />- Also I remember some time ago some guy what completely ripping on a lot of the great rock bands such as Led Zep, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Van Halen, old Metallica saying that they all suck lol. Plus I remember him saying about Led Zeppelin IV: \\"I'm glad that there not around anymore.\\" I knew he wasn't going to last long and I'm glad all his horrible reviews are gone because he does not now what music is.
0811828697|5.0|From the synthetic \\"Dewback skin\\" cover to the authentic looking field notes and sketches, you'll realize from the instant you pick up The Wildlife of Star Wars that it is something special. Author Terryl Whitlatch has really hit it out of the ballpark with this one.<br /><br />The drawings are beautiful, the information is interesting, and the creativity found throughout is mesmerizing. Even though I am not a big fan of Star Wars, I did recognize a few of the creatures in this book and was amazed by the vast array of animals that George Lucas has inhabited that galaxy far, far away of his with. The drawings are detailed and in beautiful color, and I really enjoyed the grimy style used to make the drawings appear as if they had been out in the field with a researcher.<br /><br />One downside is the fact that the content of the book only covers animals from the first four episodes of the Star Wars series, meaning that creatures  found in the last two movies are nowhere to be found (and believe me, I'd love to have seen those beasts from the coliseum scene in Episode 2) A minor gripe, but something the author really can't be blamed for. I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel.<br /><br />Overall, I would really recommend this book to anyone , even if you are not a huge Star Wars fan. And if you think it is nerdy to buy a book about the wildlife of a fantasy galaxy, then you are right, but embrace that inner geek and go ahead and buy it! You may not understand all of it, but the drawings alone make it a spectacular addition to the library of anyone, Lucas fan or not.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I went and saw this movie in the most open of minds. I knew i was probably not gonna like it but i was still leaving the door open to being pleasantly surprised. when i came out i wanted to kill everyone at my school for recommending this movie or for chanting in unison \\"gosh!\\" or \\"your mom goes to college.\\" I know that many people cannot be mentally challenged, then again they did recommend this movie. a waste of time. I hate this movie, I'm glad i didn't pay to see this crap. The only funny part of this entire movie was when they shot that thing right in front of the school bus. Now that was funny, rest of the movie not so much. avoid at all costs. TOO LATE!
B00008PW2D|4.0|This season is quite different from the others, in part because of its brevity, and also because of the tone of the season. As has been noted, the show had to work around Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy, but they managed to handle it O.K. I actually like Season 5 a lot more than Season 4 or 6. Miranda seems intelligent again, after being pathetic for so long, and her baby-raising lines are hilarious. Charlotte is at her best, alternating between her sweet, charming demeanor and her attempts to recover from her disastrous marriage and Bunny. Samantha seems too aged in this season, though, and Carrie annoys me, as always. In general, the season is more \\"grown-up,\\" but Carrie is still by and large self-absorbed.   <br /> <br />My favorite secondary characters from the entire series were introduced in this season: Harry Goldenblatt (endearing in an awkward sort of way--he and Charlotte have great chemistry) and the cute, witty Jack Berger (who turns weird in Season 6). My favorite episodes are \\"Critical Condition,\\" which captures the atmosphere of New York in a way that, IMO, had been missing in most of Season 4. There is a scene at a market, with a cameo appearance by Heather Graham, that seems so light and airy.  <br /> <br />Every season (and really, every television show) has some moments that challenge believablity. The episode \\"The Big Journey\\" is a little odd to me because Carrie and Samantha go to San Fransisco for a \\"book tour\\" without stopping anywhere between the coasts. I am no best-selling writer, but I have usually heard of book tours consisting of many stops, rather than a cross-country journey for a single location. Why does she not go down to L.A. or make appearances in the Midwest? It just seems like a moment when the writers were not being very realistic (there is a similar moment in Season 3 when Miranda gest braces for TMJ, which is supposedly related to a tongue-thrusting habit that is causing an imaginary open bite--ask an orthodontist about THATone). There is also a strange bachelor party on the train, but honestly, most of the men seem more like people I have met than most of the \\"New York men\\" who are depicted throughout the series. Anyway, the one perk of this bizarre \\"Journey\\" episode is the appearance of Chris Noth as Mr. Big, who always exudes coolness.  <br /> <br />The other really funny episode, along with \\"Critical Condition,\\" is \\"I Love a Charade,\\" which features the Hamptons wedding of Nathan Lane, who ironically is marrying a woman.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think this season is entertaining, and the four main characters seem to develop a deeper bond throughout the season. I especially recommend this season to women who have recently given birth or to their friends. The baby situations are so funny. Also, there are plenty of great guests, most notably those listed above but also Amy Sedaris and Molly Shannon (both hilarious). <br /> <br />The price of this season has dropped substantially, and for those who took issue with the initial high price, as I did, it is now quite affordable and a worthwhile purchase. I do agree that the packaging could be better than the cheap plastic fold-over thing. The plus to it, though, is that the SATC seasons take up very little space on a media rack. One final note: I always get annoyed by TV show DVDs that do not have an option of playing all the episodes consecutively. There is no \\"Play All\\" option, so you must keep the remote control handy to select each episode individually. This is especially a pain with half-hour TV shows, which I tend to watch while I am cleaning or doing other work around the house.
B00005JMJG|5.0|this is one of the two best movies I saw in all of 2004, the second one being KILL BILL V.2. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The look on the actor's faces, they just kill me. the soundtrack by Jon Brion another notch in the excellent belt. The acting, directing, the script is top notch. One of the most sincere, honest, and most hearbreaking and romantic I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. This movie just floored me. I knew Jim Carrey could act (Truman Show, why didn't they nominate him?) but nothing could prepare me for this performance. He looks nothing like the usual Jim Carrey persona. He looks pained, lonely, desperate. His voice is so quiet and frail. Kate Winslet, her hair, her talk, everything she does in this movie is incredible (should've won the oscar!!!) not to mention the hurt in Kirsten Dunst's face and the disbelief. This movie is spectacular. I don't know how it wasn't nominated for best picture. I mean RAY was nominated when the best thing about that movie was Jamie Foxx and the music. Why did they not release this movie during Valentine's Day? Why didn't this movie make money? why is the world so cruel? Just watch the movie and you'll know. Unless i'm delusional which wouldn't surprise me. Highly recommended.

0385720920|5.0|The book CHOKE by Chuck Palahniuk is a classic of inventiveness, creativity and sheer mastery of one's craft. But what is Chuck Palahniuk's craft? Is it writing grotesque, pseudo-hipsterish, generation no one, psycho babble of the worst kind that somehow finds itself published? Or does he write fables about the narcissistic american psyche and then fills them with all the above? I don't know the answer nor do I pretend to understand all the meaning in Palahniuk's satiric limericks but I greatly appreciate their inventiveness, outlandishness and the entertainment value they provide. I have read this book three times now and I still don't understand it. What does it all mean, i want to ask myself. Surely there must be an underlying meaning to all this debauchery. I would be happy either way. Knowing full well that if the text contained the cure to all the planet's woes or it was just what the book told me nothing more, that my enjoyment would not be disminished one bit either way. find whatever meaning you want but please read this, you'll be kicking yourself if you don't. Highly recommended.
B000003S0K|5.0|I still have a hard time explaining this album to others.  \\"Dead Finks\\", \\"Needles in the Camels Eye\\", \\"Some of Them are Old\\" or \\"Blank Frank\\" always end up on a random compilation I make for a friend.  They always say, \\"I really liked the Brian Eno song...I thought He made ambient music?\\"  I hate the fact that his ambient stuff overshadows this album.  I enjoy the \\"Music for Airports\\" series, but this album is just fantastic.  The remastered version sounds crisp but keeps things muddled when they still need to be.  The above listed tracks are my favorites, but I can listen to the whole album through with no complaints.  His time with Roxy Music definitely informed these recordings.  Like all good rock'n roll(and this is rock'n roll) the music sounds loose with alot of groove in it.  I always suggest this to friends who are looking for something different.  I mean, \\"Dead Finks\\" is somehow as funny as any good Frank Zappa song but also as menacing as any Bauhaus.  I think this album originally came out in 1973 and it still somehow sounds contemporary.  Read the rest of the reviews.  You'll see.  It will fit just fine in your current collection.
0805076476|4.0|Fight Club, the book and movie, have been discussed feverishly by people who truly have no lives. Some people hate the book and movie while others claim them to be masterpieces. The book is different than the movie especially the ending. Those expecting Chuck Palahniuk to write I heard the Pixies in the background while all those buildings blew up will be somewhat dissapointed. I have to say that the best part of the book for me is the sheer amorality of the whole affair. The book seems to be written without any regard for common decency which is a quality that I seek out in pretty much anything. Palahniuk's description of a future world as seen by Tyler is truly frightening and beautiful at the same time. the only major flaw i have with the book is that in the last part of the book as the plot kicks into high gear, the author pretty much throws away all the insight from previous chapter and just starts repeating these from earlier in the book for effect. I found this technique more endearing in his later books but here it just doesn't work. But overall a great read and a tremendous achievement for Palahniuk.
B0001906O0|4.0|For me, finally having decent versions of \\"Exploding Boy\\" and \\"Breathe\\" make this compilation worth the price of admission.  There are lots of other great B-sides here, but I've been waiting for good versions for these two for years now.  I still can't figure out why \\"Exploding Boy\\" never made it onto the \\"The Head on the Door\\" album.  The packaging is also well done.  Rhino seems to have a real knack for this.  I would assume that anyone who was around during the early days of vinyl 12 inches have their own favorite B-sides.  While there are a few things missing, I would still suggest this as an addition to anyone elses collection.  For those that are new to The Cure and may not have had the chance to hear these B-sides, you are definitely in for a treat.  Again, a solid compilation that is well worth its price.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I readily admit to being one of those \\"shallow\\" movie fans, who would probably prefer to watch a badly acted, formulaic action thriller to a timeless classic if given the choice.  Needless to say, I was not expecting to enjoy (or for that matter, even sit through) Finding Neverland when my wife popped it in the DVD player last weekend.<br /><br />What followed is one of the most imaginative and artistic movies I have ever seen.  While inspired by the story of J.M. Barrie's authoring of Peter Pan, Finding Neverland is really more fantasy than documentary.  The movie is visually captivating, taking place both in the \\"real world\\" and in J.M. Barrie's active imagination.  There is at least one scene that brilliantly crosses the two over, but I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it.  Needless to say, those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about, and those who haven't will understand as soon as they see the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the style of the movie is a bit reminiscent of Big Fish, another movie that I enjoyed despite expecting that I wouldn't last through the whole thing.  Needless to say, those with active imaginations who generally enjoy fantasies will love this movie.  Those expecting a historical piece will probably be disappointed, which perhaps explains some of the negative reviews I have seen.<br /><br />Johnny Depp's performance is outstanding, although in watching the movie, I remembered a conversation I had with a friend about Robin Williams' performance in Dead Poet's Society.  He told me, \\"yes, Robin Williams is a good actor, but this movie is really about the kids.\\"  In many respects, Finding Neverland is the same kind of movie.  Johnny Depp turns in an Oscar-caliber performance (although I won't argue with the Academy's selection of Jamie Foxx in Ray), but is in many respects outshined by the children, who are so central to this movie.  Kate Winslet, never one of my favorites, turns in a serviceable performance: think Titanic, and not Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.ble performance: think Titanic, and not Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  <br />
B000002504|5.0|Some people like Freehand or In A Glass House better. Those are great choices. However, on this album, they mix their complex style with pop hooks most effectively. Each song on here, except for think of me with kindness, is almost dauntignly complex with dozens of counterpoints and melodies. However, each counterpoint, rhytmn, and melody oozes pop catchiness. So, each song on here is comlex while retaining a catchiness that makes them stick. On this album, perhaps the definitive gentle giant style was being formed, even though they changed with each album. This album, to put it another way, has 4 and 5 minute songs that have at least 8 minutes worth of song ideas crammed inside of them. The resutling insanity reminds one of frank zappa perhaps.
B0006L16N8|4.0|At first, Cold Play do sound a bit like a band that could not be bothered with the way they sing, perform or play their music; however if you hear them over and over again you might find the subtlety in their music or maybe not.<br /><br />This holds true for all their albums so far, from Parachutes to A Rush of Blood to the Head including their current offering X&Y. Some critics & music fans seem to think that their latest album is a shift in their musical style but I fail to see that. There might be a slight inclination towards a more mature feel, yet it's not that evident.<br /><br />Travis, Keane and Snow Patrol among others share the same style & sound as Cold Play but I guess the latter do it better. This Coldplay-ish style does have a knack of growing on you just like \\"Yellow\\", \\"Clocks\\" & all the others did.<br /><br />This album has many tracks to listen to but not many to fall in love with. Had this been their debut album; reviews would have been different. We would have loved them & hailed them as the new saviors of Rock music but alas it's not & hence they are not. But overall it's good.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites is definitely \\"Fix You,\\" which is a brazen schmaltzy song with Martin delivering words of encouragement \\"Lights will guide you home & ignite your bones etc...\\" another one I like is \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" & their current single \\"Speed of Sound\\" where a vivid introduction makes way for a sentimental performance from Martin, which is perfectly accompanied by a definitive yet urgent rhythmic showpiece from Champion. As for the others I have yet to play them over & over again for them to have an impact. I am a 60 second person, if a song does nothing for me in the first 60 seconds I move on to the next. Harsh but necessary? 3 minutes of my life is far too valuable to waste on a lousy song. Its 3 minutes I won't get back.<br /><br />It's a shame their current single did not make it to the top of the charts in their native UK where they have been beaten by a cell phone ring tone called \\"Crazy Frog - Axel F.\\" that has been number 1 for quite a while now!!!<br /><br />Verdict: If you have money to spare & an empty slot in your CD rack then go ahead & buy it as for me I'll just buy/download the two singles I like.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars for quality, words & music, one extra star for Martins' unambiguous support of Fair Trade.UK where they have been beaten by a cell phone ring tone called \\"Crazy Frog - Axel F.\\" that has been number 1 for quite a while now!!! <br /> <br />Verdict: If you have money to spare & an empty slot in your CD rack then go ahead & buy it as for me I'll just buy/download the two singles I like.  <br /> <br />Rating: 3 stars for quality, words & music, one extra star for Martins' unambiguous support of Fair Trade.  <br />
B0000024ZC|5.0|Phil Schulman had an idea for this concept that he had actually experience first hand. Three Friends grow up, get different jobs, move apart because of the differences in their lives. Pretty simple, and effectively covered in 35 minutes, even if there could have been more. Phil said it would take a fairly large opera to get all he wanted in to the album. <br />The sound of the album? It's a little less cluttered than earlier albums. On this album, melody reigns supreme. More than their other albums, this one is about sonic beauty. And you can hear that in the end of the title track, which is teh end of the album. The band never recorded a piece of music that was so purely beautiful ever again. But the work is pretty connected, almost symphonic. Can almost be considered one long work, and if the lack of a long song in gentle giant's catalog bothers any prog fans, they can take this as one!
0975991477|5.0|This is a very compelling book. It is written for the layperson in a stile that brings humor and academic depth together in a manner by which the reader is able to visualize the subject matter with a great degree of understanding. I would make this required reading for all students of the life sciences as well as theology students who are [really] interested in life's mystery. This is a holistic approach to putting one in thecenter of his own life. <br /> <br />L. Allan Jandro
B000002R0R|5.0|Not their best album but one of their better later albums. The first five songs aren't in the typical gentle giant style; so what? They're great songs. two weeks in spain is an energetic fun opener, i'm tuning around is a good ballad, betcha thought we couldn't do it a funny punk parody, and who do you think you are is a good attempt at funk. and mountain time is a very solid pop rocker.  <br />The second side is just as good, and in spots better, than anything on interview. the band should not be ashamed of this album because some giant fans are too narrow minded to appreciate good quality pop music, which this is in parts. Buy it, think of it with kindness.
B00005AQGH|5.0|I bump this CD on the regular and it never gets old. Although it doesn't match the length of All Eyez On Me, it certainly kicks its ass on subject matter. This is Pacs most thoughtful work Since Me Against The World and shouldn't be slept on as the beats are some of Pacs best and the lyrics surpass anything he done in years. From track 1 to track 12 this hits hard and will stay a neccessity in a hip hop collection. <br /> <br />1. Bomb First (My Second Reply) - 9/10 - This is a brilliant way to start a classic album where Pac and The Outlawz verbally tear the East Coast apart. Pac's verse is the best (as always) but the Outlawz sound like they're trying to hard let the song down. I would've gave this song a 10 but the Outlawz really get on my nerves. <br />2. Hail Mary - 10/10 - This is one of the best songs on the album as it gives a kind of creepy feel to it which you can't help replaying. Pac's lyrics are outstanding and the beat makes this quite eerie at times, but the same as before, The Outlawz let it down but I still give it 10 because Pac's verse fades the Outlawz' verses. <br />3. Toss It Up - 10/10 - Great pick for a single as it is kinda radio friendly and the singing from K-Ci & JoJo and Danny Boy give the album a different feel as this is non-existent on the rest of the CD. Good beat but better lyrics. <br />4. To Live & Die In L.A - 10/10 - This is a classic ryder track to cruise to. The beat helps Pac's laid back lyrics about his love for L.A and the singing for the hook is very catchy. This is a unanimous classic that I've never skipped once. <br />5. Blasphemy - 10/10 - This is ANOTHER classic track that is also eerie at times. Pac's lyrics really stick with you because they are so focused and real. This track is about life in the ghetto's and how niggas in the ghetto really don't care for religion. The Arastifarian hook works well with the theme of the song. <br />6. Life Of An Outlaw - 10/10 - ANOTHER classic! for once the Outlawz don't dissapointthe track and work with pac's lyrics. But obviously Pac has the best verses and the beat helps him and the Outlawz shine. This track is about exactly the name of the song. A classic anyway. <br />7. Just Like Daddy - 10/10 - ANOTHER CLASSIC! When will it stop!? lol. This is one of my favourites on the Cd as it is quite deep and is about the ladies, recorded in the 'Keep Ya Head Up' vien. Shouldnt be slept on ever because its so deep. <br />8. Krazy - 10/10 - My favourite track on the album because Pacs lyrics are some of his most focused and mature in years. The beat is very laid back too and works effectively with the lyrics. This is something you could chill to and ride 2 which makes it a pure classic track, which should NEVER b slept on. <br />9. White manz World - 10/10 - ANOTHER classic track about us black peoples struggles in the world and how most white people exploit our achievments and put stereotypes on us. Pacs lyrics are some of the realest ive ever heard and stick with you. One of my favourite tracks ever. Utter classic. <br />10. Me & My Girlfriend - 9/10 - Great track but not a classic. The lyrics are okay but sound a little unfocused but the beat is very good and shouldn't b slept on but isn't really a standout track. <br />11. Hold Ya Head - 10/10 - Classic track where Pac gets deep again rappin about his homies in jail to hold there head up becuase things'll get better. This is one of my favourites on the album and rightfully so as it is very deep and heartfelt. <br />12. Against All Odds - 10/10 - Another East Coast diss which is truly amazing. Its a classic diss track where he disses everyone from Nas, Mobb Deep, P. Diddy, Jay-Z to Haitian Jack (who wasnt a rapper). The beat is brilliant too. This is a hard hitting way to end a classic album and shows 2Pac's thug to the fullest. <br /> <br />This CD is a classic in all senses of the word and NEVER gets old for me which is the mark of a timeless album. Al tracks have a message to them and Pac explains the messages very clearly and doesnt hold back on the diss tracks at all. If you are a 2Pac fan, I highly suggest you pick this album up because I can garentee you you wont be dissapointed.
B000850IHW|5.0|Like Mr. Paul Minot (yesfansrule) this was never my favorite giant album. not because it was too poppy or anythign but because the songs simply didn't stick with me at first listen. Maybe it wasn't poppy ENOUGH hahaha. <br />but, when i got the remaster and listened man oh man. This is tied for their greatest album with octopus. Like that album, complex playing melodies and arrangements smash into pop hooks in a way that makes this album completely and utterly original fresh and fun. On Reflection is the best, but every song rules. A must for all prog fans, and the remaster helped prove that to me.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Dave Grohl and company have returned with a smashing double cd combo!  The much anticipated and hyped up \\"In Your Honor\\" lives up to much of the accolades that it has received.  In terms of sticking to the tried and true formula of the Foo Fighters, this album does not disappoint.  In terms of being a classic rock album it is ultimately forgettable when placed alongside other rock greats such as Physical Graffiti for Led Zeppelin. <br /> <br />The rock cd is pretty good.  The title track, \\"In Your Honor\\", is a solid song but is not nearly as good as some of the other tracks on the album such as \\"Best Of You\\" and \\"DOA\\".  The band was quoted as saying that the rock album was comprised of the \\"...heaviest stuff [we've] done to date.\\", but I do not feel that it is true.  On past albums such as their last release, \\"One By One\\", and one of the greatest rock albums of all time, \\"The Colour And The Shape\\", the Foo Fighters reach the apex of their heaviness.  Songs such as \\"Monkey Wrench\\", \\"Low\\", \\"Overdrive\\", and \\"Breakout\\" are much heavier than the songs on \\"In Your Honor.\\" <br /> <br />In terms of lyrical content the rock album does not disappoint.  The band touches on deeper issues and hit some really reflective points with the lyrics.  In terms of heavier lyrical content the album is definitely much deeper, darker, and heavier than past albums. <br /> <br />Referring now to the Acoustic album on the second disc, it far exceeds any expectations that I could have had for it.  Every song is well crafted with each part flowing in harmonic unison.  Even Dave Grohl's vocals are nearly flawless for the songs.  By far though, my favorite song is \\"Over and Out\\" on the acoustic album.  It is to acoustic Foo Fighters songs what \\"Everlong\\" is to electric. <br /> <br />So, if you are new to the Foo world then \\"In Your Honor\\" is a great place to start because you get the best of both worlds and can see what the band truly has to offer.  The only problem I have is with something Dave Grohl said about the album.  He said that someday when his kid asks him what album he should get from the Foo Fighters, that he would tell him to get \\"In Your Honor.\\"  He said that \\"In Your Honor\\" is the quintessential Foo Fighters album.  Unfortunately, I am forced to disagree.  In thirty years when my kids ask me if I've ever heard of the Foo Fighters and what album to get, my answer is, was, and always will be: \\"The Colour and the Shape.\\"
B000001FW9|5.0|this is a quantum leap over the debut in complexity and strangeness. The band's signature style was put into place here, but the band was never really able to get this kind of atmosphere again, this creepy, paranoid, almost claustrophic feel that they get on this album. You can almost feel the walls closing in. Surprisingly, a lot of the album is quite happy. But the sound doesn't reflect it. Wreck is a highlight, though Pantagruels Nativity is probably the best. A must have for prog fans.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I just got this 10th anniversary edition today and I LOVE it!  The additional scene with the beautiful love song \\"If I Never Knew You\\" brings the movie all together and it makes much more sense with the scene.  For years I had heard that there was a 'missing scene' in this movie, and I remember thinking how the original scene in the teepee between Pocahantas and John Smith seemed so abruptly cut short and terribly truncated.  About 5 years ago on ABC, The Wonderful World of Disney showed Pocahantas with this 'deleted scene', but it was not complete.  At the time it featured 'live' animation of the view of the hole through the top of the teepee, and stills with voice-overs from Mel Gibson and Irene Bedard. The big deal at the time was that it featured Mel Gibson singing, and I remember seeing an interview with Mel at the time saying (sic) \\"I got to sing a love song but they cut the scene!\\"  But the funny thing is that I could swear that I read that this scene was complete at the time the original was released, but cut just before the release. (Anyone know about this?) I guess it doesn't matter now because the Disney Co. finally restored this very touching and beautiful song to this anniversary version, and it makes the story so much more real and compelling.  There is also a reprise of the couple singing the song just before the end and it is the icing on the cake.  I'm not always pleased with Disney DVD releases, but this one they got right! Also, they had the sense to release it in the widescreen ratio so you get to see the whole, beautiful product in all of its glory!  (They should do this with all their releases!--How about a widescreen special edition of MoonSpinners? Hint-Hint!)   <br /> Also, you can watch the original theatrical release on this DVD, but I don't know why you'd want to!  <br /> P.S.  Mel sings beautifully!
B0009NZ3BO|3.0|I want to give this album a five for the music, but the remastering job was botched. It is official, on blazemonger.com/gg on the whatsnew section it says they're goign to replace it. But it's almost inexcusable to release an album like this. I ordered mine for 7.99 before I was told about this. however, i believe that it won't be bad because i think they're selling that cheap because they're going to be replaced soon, free of charge. at least i hope so. <br />Any ways, this album features some of the band's most complex songs, and isn't my favorite album, but it is definitely really good and worth buying. Sorry for short review, but I can't think of much else to say about it.
B000957O7S|1.0|I can't say that I hated this movie. In fact, I can't summon any strong feelings about this movie at all. Writing a nasty review of it would be like finding a piece of cardboard on the street and writing your congressman about it. There is nothing relevant to say, as far as I can find. It wasn't interesting enough to be bad - it had all the daring dialogue of a yoplait commercial, without the interactivity (SHOULD I buy the yogurt? Should I not?). Will Smith smirked, some fat white guy couldn't dance, and some chick was hard to get. What a waste of film - what a waste of people - what a waste of life! Don't people have better things to do with their time than slurp garbage like this down their gullets? If you're going to go to all the trouble of setting up a film crew and hiring actors, if you're going to haul all these slobs into the movie theatre to sit in the dark, letting your pictures flicker across their slackened faces, why don't you at least try to say SOMETHING? ANYTHING - c'mon. Give me charging buffaloes, or an impassioned speech about the misery of lower back pain. SOMETHING. Not this - this is nothing. This is the kind of movie that no one will remember seeing in 6 months. Sure, sure, it's full of all kinds of awful presuppositions, but I don't even think the director is aware of those, so there's no sense in smacking him for it. It would be like blaming a pig for having hooves.<br />Where is Ed Wood when you need him?
B0006L16N8|1.0|I wish Chris Martin would consider a gospel track with Bette Midler on his next CD. That is what this album needs is a track with Bette Midler, it might have sold more copies. Coldplay has come a long way since their song on The Bodyguard soundtrack, which was subpar.
B00004W52U|5.0|There is nothing else i have to say. This is my favorite cd ever!!!!!!
B000002H97|5.0|Firstly, I have trouble understanding how some people consider this album to be a \\"sellout\\". This album has the greatest raw emotion of any of their releases, while having the cleanest production. I feel that the death of their former bass player in a bus crash after their previous album \\"And Justice For All\\" was released added to the emotional power of this album. <br /> <br />To me, Metallica's music was on a steady rise and kept getting better with each album up to this one, where they reached their ultimate peak. Sadly the albums that followed, Load and Reload, were barely mediocre, while I could hardly force myself to listen to St. Anger to give it a fair chance it was so bad. <br /> <br />The Black Album is one that, over the years, always seems to find its way back to my current playlist. There is not a single song that is bad on this album, and I never feel like skipping any of them as I listen. I also still go back to their older works which are amazing in their own right, but this one is the pinnacle of their career and one of the greatest albums to be released by any musical group, period.
0783226837|4.0|Generally, I hate when studios issue 3 or 4 editions of any given film. There are exceptions of course, when the extra material is voluminous or when the film transfer is improved. I feel the time has come for an all-new Snakeoid Edition of this one. For one thing, the current dvd is NOT anamorphic - that should definitely be taken care of, with a fresh widescreen remaster and Dolby Digital EX 5.1.  A commentary track would also turn this into must-buy status. Come on, Universal - this is a NO BRAINER!!!
B000001EXB|5.0|Elton John's commercial success picked up in the late 80s and into the 90s, but more importantly, his music improved.  Elton appeared to become comfortable with writing and singing his music rather than music that might be commercially successful.  The result was a series of albums that were artistically excellent, with modest success compared to his 70s albums.  \\"The Big Picture\\" is an example of one of these excellent albums.<br /><br />This album opens with the mellow song \\"Long Way from Happiness.\\"  The combination of electronic effects with acoustic instruments reminds me of some of Madonna's music.  I also compare how the music surrounds and keeps Elton's voice to the front of the music to the way some of Madonna's music is produced.  The effect is marvelous, and shows a musical maturity and comfort appropriate to Elton's mastery of his art.  This song is perfect as the introductory song for this album.<br /><br />The next song is even better than the first.  \\"Live like Horses\\" contains Taupin lyrics that are poetic and marginally unintelligible.  Thus, these lyrics are exactly like those of the songs of the duo's early years.  However, unlike many of those early songs, this song is finely crafted and produced, and Elton's soaring voice is awesome as it supports the wish to be able to live free.  This song is but one of the numerous excellent songs on this CD.<br /><br />It just seems that each song on this CD gets better than the last.  \\"The End Will Come\\" is the best yet.  This song combines the power of Elton's voice with the strongest instruments and best lyrics yet on this CD to make a song that I think could have been released as a single.  The closest stylistic comparison I can make, though inadequate, is to \\"Believe\\" from \\"Made in England.\\"<br /><br />\\"If the River Could Bend\\" sounds much like the music from \\"Songs from the West Coast.\\"  This song has a strong blues flavor, and occasionally reminds me of the style of the music from \\"Madman Across the Water.\\"  However, the music and style of this song are refined and sophisticated in comparison to that much earlier album.  Perhaps surprisingly, I consider this song, which is good, to be one of the weaker songs on this CD, which merely shows how good this CD is.<br /><br />The next song is mellow and slow, and would be an excellent song for many artists, but in the company of the other songs on this CD it is one of the lesser songs.  \\"Love's Got a Lot to Answer For\\" is a quiet song with relatively simple lyrics in comparison to the other songs on this CD.  This song is what I would call mood music, and other than being a quality song, has little to distinguish itself.<br /><br />\\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\\" was the B-side of \\"Candle in the Wind 1997,\\" the famous tribute to Princess Diana.  This song contains everything I like in an Elton John love song.  Elton enjoys this song, and he powers the song with his voice.  This single went to #1 on the charts, and became the biggest selling single in music history.  I found one reference that noted that \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\" did not chart as high on the Hot 100 Airplay chart as \\"Something in the Way You Look Tonight,\\" which could indicate that this song was part of the success of the single.<br /><br />It seems to me that Elton enjoys singing the title track.  I hear a smile in his voice as he sings this powerful love song.  The placement of this song is perfect next to the previous song.  \\"The Big Picture\\" has a big sound that I have always enjoyed in Elton's music, and following the previous song with this song helps the transitions through the album.<br /><br />Things quiet down a bit with \\"Recover Your Soul.\\"  This mellow ballad was released as a single, reaching #55.  I like this blues-flavored song, but there are better songs on this CD that I think would have reached higher in the charts.<br /><br />The following song is quite a change of pace.  \\"January\\" has some dramatic moments that provide alot of contrast within the song and with the previous song.  This love song is far from mellow, using Elton's powerful voice to accentuate the refrain; the changes in pace and vocal intensity increase the interest level and enjoyment of this song.<br /><br />Keeping something great for near the end, \\"I Can't Steer My Heart Clear of You\\" is an awesome love song that I think ranks with the best that Elton and Taupin have ever created.  This song contacts beautiful orchestration and soaring vocals that create an intensely enjoyable aural experience.  Elton's entries into each verse and exit into the refrain are interesting, ramping from a vocal taxiway to a launch into vocal flight.<br /><br />The final song is \\"Wicked Dreams.\\"  This song ends the CD on a positive note.  This song is one of the faster songs on the CD, and the lyrics are nicely constructed.  While the song is one of the lesser songs on this CD, the orchestration and vocals make this a fine, nicely performed and produced song.<br /><br />If there were any doubts that Bernie Taupin and Elton John could create beautiful music, this CD proved that in 1997 they still could, charting at #9.  This CD and \\"Songs from the West Coast\\" are so reminiscent of the music that the pair created in the 70s that comparisons are hard to avoid.  But this sound is more assured and more mature.  I would buy another hundred CDs like this.  Elton fans and fans of beautiful music need this one.ts that provide a lot of contrast within the song and with the previous song.

0790737345|3.0|(Genesis 4:25).  For centuries, men have wondered and theorized about the nature of angels and their relation to us.  From Martin Luther to John Calvin to modern-day Dr. David Jeremiah, these ethereal creatures sometimes hold more fascination for us than God.  The premise of City of Angels is intriguing.  It seeks to answer some of our questions about angels, life, and death.  Yet I was not turned on by the film until the end, which I will not reveal.<br /><br />The main reason I was turned off was because the main character and angel, Seth, came across as a huge dimbulb.  Assigned to watch over heart surgeon Maggie (Meg Ryan), Seth (Nicolas Cage) falls in love with her. Here is where the movie begins to be laughable.  Seth comes across as an escaped mental patient who is stalking Maggie.  He stares at her, makes no sense when he talks, and appears anywhere she does.  Instead of treating Seth with caution and fear, Maggie proceeds to boss him around and be increasingly mean to him, even physically assaulting him at one point with a weapon.  In the Bible, angels' appearances to men have been received with awe and fear.  Maggie whips Seth like a dog.<br /><br />Dennis Franz is the breath of fresh air in the film as an angel who has chosen to \\"fall\\" and become human.  Like the Little Mermaid, an angel who falls can never go back to the \\"sea.\\"  The angel loses all his angelic powers such as understanding all languages, never feeling pain, and being able to travel at the speed of thought.  But why would angels give up who they are and the incredible powers they have for base senses like taste and touch?  Angels are curious about humans, that is true.  But they are curious what it is like to be on the receiving end of salvation.  Not to become obese by eating junk food, or to learn what it is like to have a woman treat you like sh**t.<br /><br />The cinematography in this movie is great.  The scenes of the silent angels on the beach at dawn, the great overhead bird's eye views of L.A.  Truly terrific.  I also have no problem with Meg Ryan's performance, even if her character was a witch.terrific.  I also have no problem with Meg Ryan's performance, even if her character was a witch.

B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is an old-fashioned love story with the subject of Dementia thrown in to heighten the tear jerking experience. The movie opens with James Garner telling a story (from a notebook) to an elderly woman played by Gena Rowlands. She appears to have a memory problem. The story is about a summer romance, a tale of love between a society girl (Allison Hamilton) who meets a young mill worker (Noah Calhoun) at a carnival, June 6, 1940. They are both 17 years old. Allison's (Allie) parents don't approve of Noah, because of his social standing (meaning, he doesn't have one). Young Allie's heart is broken when her parents try their best to split them in two. After their summer romance is over, when Allie is sent off to college in New York and Noah has to enter the military and World War II in Europe, you would think that there would be no way for this uncommon romance to get back together. However, true love has no boundaries.<br /><br />The performances by James Garner (old Duke) and Rachel McAdams (young Allie) are outstanding. The screenplay is based off of the Nicholas Sparks heart-warming book. I'm not normally into romantic movies, put this movie was so well put together that I had to give it 5 stars. If you miss seeing the old-fashioned Hollywood love stories, then you must see this movie.

B000089RVX|5.0|Growing up, I only listened to hip-hop and pop. Rarely did I find a rock band I enjoyed to listen to. But when I first heard \\"Bring Me to Life\\", their first hit single, I was drawn to it. Their music takes me away, and enables me to view my true emotions. I was quickly addicted to Evanescence. I went out and bought \\"Fallen\\" after they released their single, \\"Everybody's Fool\\", which I must say is my absolute favorite song on the album. There is not a song on \\"Fallen\\" that I do not love. It is hard for me to love a band as much as I love Evanescence. It's hard to find a CD where I can listen to it repeatedly and not get tired of it. The band has a tremendous amount of talent. And Amy Lee's vocals are the perfect touch to the great band. Her vocal strength is rare, and can send chills up my spine. The lyrics to the songs are strong and meaningful. Unlike much of today's music about drugs, cars, money, and girls and their asses. \\"Fallen\\" is a masterpiece and I reccomend it to everyone. <br /> <br />The Better Songs: <br />Everybody's Fool <br />My Immortal <br />Imaginary <br />Taking Over Me <br />Hello <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />

0767812387|4.0|I just love this film, and not as a guilty pleasure either.  The emotions conveyed in this film are real, at least real enough for me.  This film is loads of fun, simply glorious fun.  I bought the love story hook, line, and sinker, and was willing to \\"work with\\" the aspects of the script that were obviously unrealistic.  In the end they don't matter, and it would be nit-picking to harp on them.  Vanessa Williams and Chayanne are about as hot an on-screen couple as existed in the 1990's, and Kris Kristofferson's performance is real, supportive, and meaningful. <br /> <br />A film that can capture the innocence and purity of love, as well as the dance and music that are such an integral part of it is a treasure.  And this film is a treasure, a gloriously uplifting gem very badly needed these days.  Everyone involved in this production should be very proud.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Without an ounce of hyperbole, this show was the best thing on television in the last thirty years. <br /> <br />Better than MASH, Hill Street Blues, Cheers, Seinfeld, Buffy, ST:TNG, Sopranos, West Wing...anything. <br /> <br />Because this show takes ALL those shows...all the great aspects and beloved moments of those shows...and mixes them into an altogether original and completely satisfying entertainment. <br /> <br />It's a little sci-fi show that has heavy Western (as in John Wayne, not as in hemisphere) elements, an elegant juxtaposition that brings the future and the past together in a way that makes is, funnily, remarkably current and fresh. <br /> <br />The drama part of the show leans towards the romantic (like \\"thirtysomething\\") and the medical (like \\"ER\\").  <br /> <br />The action is more \\"real\\" and less \\"lasers\\"...the science fiction part of the show is not about aliens or the \\"weird\\". It's about how in the future, people would either speak English or Chinese, both with equal facility. The fact that their cursing and other interjections are \\"spontaneously\\" in Chinese comes off hysterically funny. Plus it adds realism by avoiding \\"bleeps\\". The violence is not cartoonish at all. <br /> <br />The cast, seriously, is a joy to behold. Nathan Fillion, as Captain Malcolm Reynolds, is a find. He brings a swashbuckling smart-ass quality as the group's leader. Adam Baldwin, as the swaggering, dim but aggressive Jayne, adds loutish humor to his well-played menace. Gina Torres, as First Mate Zoe, is a terrific character. Black, smart, beautiful, capable, loyal, intense and female. The type we need more of on television, whether you're paralyzed by political correctness or not. <br />Zoe is married to Alan Tudyk's pilot Wash, who is the \\"funny guy\\" on the show, but his function is not only to be funny. The two of them add fun sexy moments to the ensemble. <br />Sean Maher, as a young trauma surgeon (hooray!) and Summer Glau as his mysterious, odd sister River mix perfectly with the others. River's storyline adds a whole \\"X-Files\\" conspiracy thread, and having a surgeon on board allows for all sorts of medical crises that elevate suspense and tension. In the 14 episodes, everybody gets shot or stabbed at least once. <br />Ron Glass, as the incredibly cool preacher, Shepherd Book, clearly has a past that is hinted about, but due to the cancellation, is never fully revealed. But his character allows for the entry of several theologic and religious ideas that broaden many of the plots in ways you could have never expected. <br />Jewel Staite, as the adorable mechanic Kaylee, is an irresistible creation. Cute and sexy, fallible, vulnerable, but a whiz with the ship. <br />And finally, Miss Baccarin as Inara. Is there any male out there who saw this show and didn't absolutely melt whenever she came on the screen? She's one of the most unexpectedly beautiful women I've ever seen. She plays a \\"Companion\\"...a courtesan of sorts...who generates blinding sparks with the Captain.  <br />Palpable heat. Your TV set WILL get warmer. <br />It's the classic situation...they can't fall in love, but you know they already have. <br /> <br />The scripts are impossibly funny, unpredictable, exciting...never boring or routine. Whedon, Minear and friends lead you down a path that feels familiar, and suddenly, you're in a place you never considered. Blissfully. <br /> <br />The acting is top-notch...THIS is the best ensemble cast of recent memory. Better than the West Wing. Better than the Sopranos. <br /> <br />And I LOVE those shows... <br /> <br />The special effects are nicely done, and the cinematography, in combination with the digital effects, adds startling immediacy to the proceedings. \\"Hand held\\" shaky shots of a landing spaceship? Things slightly out of frame. Fast zooms to a ship out in the atmosphere...it's a brilliant idea perfectly executed. It may be impossible to describe, but once you see it, you'll know what I'm trying to describe.<br /> <br />After regretfully finishing the last episode, I found myself angry. <br /> <br />I wanted more. I was disappointed with myself that I didn't support the show when it was on the air. I was disappointed that it was cancelled abruptly. I was angry that HBO or somebody didn't take it over... <br /> <br />...it goes without saying that I am now unbelievably excited for the movie this year, but had not been before seeing this show. <br /> <br />My only hope is that enough people see the movie, to make some ignorant network bigwig thing, \\"Hey...we should turn this into a TV show!\\" <br /> <br />I love this show.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is one of those pieces most everyone knows about. Pretty much everyone has heard of the infamous shower scene at the very least, but this film is great for artistic value. <br />The original black and white is much better, because that was how Hitchcock intended it to be viewed, it made it more dramatic. Added to the contrast between light and dark, added to it's edge, and possibly creep factor. Made the shadows more dramatic. The film is excellent, no matter how it's viewed.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Let me start by saying I am a huge CLUTCH fan. I have every CD, follow the bands every move and after seeing them live five months ago, I like them even more. Although, I must say this CD, Robot Hive: Exodus, isn't as good as Blast Tyrant, Clutch's most creative and well written effort. Every song on BT is great and sounds better every time I listen.  <br /> <br />However, i want to make it clear that this cd does have it's high points. Stand out tracks are \\"Gravel Road\\" and the Howlin Wolf cover, \\"Who's Been Talkin\\". Proof positive that Neil Fallon can really sing the Blues !!!! MY GOD !!!! I have not heard such soulful vocals in a very long time.  Tim Sult's guitar work just gets better and better. I think anyone who plays would agree.    <br /> <br />This disc is great don't get me wrong.  The songs are solid and of course well written and the organ is an added treat for us Clutch fans. Again, I am not blown away, but go ahead and try to find something better, I bet you won't.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|1.0|WHOA! What have we here? When did Pink Floyd unite with Audioslave and U2 and call themselves Dream Theater? Come on you guys! Where the hell are the odd time signatures? What's with the 24 minute Pink Floyd acid rock song? I mean, when I want listen to U2(which I don't) I will listen to U2. When I need to here Audioslave(which I never will), I'll listen to Audioslave. When I'm in the mood for Pink Floyd, guess who I'll listen to. When I want to here Dream Theater, I'll listen to...I don't know now but apparently it won't be them. This album sucks!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I loved this movie. It was so dreamily real in a way that only the talented Coppola could portray. Johannsson was perfect. Murry was hilarious. To shorten things, if you can handle a movie that runs this deep, go swimming! It is fantastic and absolutly beautiful. Lance Accord (potography director) at his best. This one got to me, and it's never felt so good.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album, in reality, I'd rate four stars, but I'm giving it a five here to counter all those mindless one and two star reviews. <br /> <br />I'm not going to lie, out of every Dream Theater album I own (Images and Words, Awake, A Change of Seasons, Scenes, Train of Thought and this), Octavarium is probably my least favorite, but in no way does that make this a bad album.  <br /> <br />When I'm listening to it, I love it, but when I'm not, there's something about it that makes me avoid it, and I usually end up only listening to the first and last tracks. <br /> <br />The album starts out with 'The Root of All Evil,' a song which took the most time to grow on me, but is definitely one of the best moments on the album. I was a fan of Train of Thought, and I was glad that one of the better parts of 'This Dying Soul' got to make a second appearance in the AA series. The chorus in this song ('Take all of me..') has to be one of my favorite parts on the album. Classic Dream Theater. <br /> <br />Following the obligatory Dream Theater hard-hitting opener is probably thier softest song to date, The Answer Lies Within. This song is a prime example of how the band toned down on the shreds (as mentioned in an earlier review) and focused more on the song, and I think this one came out very well. <br /> <br />These Walls is somewhat difficult for me to approach. I really like the song, but there's something about it that, when looking back on it, makes it seem worse than it really is. It's hard to explain, but not one of the most memorable tracks on the album. <br /> <br />I Walk Beside You.. Probably my least favorite on the album because it sounds like another band or what have you, but also because there are significant weak points. It has it's moments, but as a whole the song is not very memorable, and whenever the song reaches the bridge ('Oh, when everything is wrong, when hopelessness surrounds you..'), I just want to skip to the next track. <br /> <br />I'm glad they decided to immediatly follow the fourth track with a song like Panic Attack. This is a good song, but it's another track that really makes it hard for me to review this album. When I'm listening to it, I love it, but it just doesn't leave a huge impression on me in the end. <br /> <br />Never Enough is probably one of my favorite tracks on the album. LaBrie does a surprisingly remarkable job here, and the lyrics are really great, and show that Portnoy isn't afraid to speak his mind. The third track on the album that leaves a big impression on me, and another good reason to get this album. <br /> <br />Sacrificed Sons, another difficult one. Probably the worst lyrics on the album (though LaBrie's lyrics later in Octavarium during 'II. Medicate (Awakening)' more than make up for this), but a good song as a whole. I'm listening to the track as I'm typing this, but I know that when I'm done with this review I'll just view it as another song that wasn't as memorable. <br /> <br />It's hard to explain why some of these songs didn't leave lasting impressions on me, but I'll try to, anyway. <br /> <br />In Train of Thought, nearly every song was over ten minutes long (except for As I Am which was nearly eight, which is long enough anyway, and Vacant, which was used as a transition to Stream), and it really made each song solid. Each song was an island of it's own on the album, and was as hard-hitting as the last, and there was no filler to be found. However, on Octavarium, as you can tell, half of the album disappointed me, one of the first seven songs actually being over ten minutes, so I'm just going to conclude that this album, as a whole, just didn't come off as strong as past DT releases. On Train of Thought, every song gave me a full experience, but on this album, half of the songs for me seem to fall flat. But to end this review on a good note, I'll go over the title track, which makes this album a keeper in my book. <br /> <br />While not being as perfect A Change ofSeasons, Octavarium does take a smoother approach. The song begins with Pink Floyd-esque synths fading in and Jordan Rudess demonstrating the abilities of his Haken Continuum Fingerboard (one of the coolest instruments I've ever SEEN). I've heard this intro being described as 'painfully long,' but if this kind of thing is something that seems to bore you, then I'm surprised you had the patience to get into Dream Theater in the first place, my friend. The entirety of this track is amazing, and never lets you go once it begins. <br /> <br />After the Continuum fades away at 3:50, synths take the lead role and bring this song from out behind the fog and lead it into the first part of the song. It opens with an acoutic guitar and a flute, setting a perfect vibe for the track, but as soon as the flute goes away, a more eerie tune begins, playing off the vocals very well. The song then becomes more upbeat, and as soon as part two starts, the bass comes from 'out behind the fog,' and provides for a very good transition to part two. The vocals now sound more clearer as if the vocals are speaking to you directly rather than 'a voice from the past' effect used in the first part. The lyrics here, as mentioned before, are very, very good. <br /> <br />As the song moves on, it becomes faster and heavier, containing a countless amount of 'nuggets' including a reference to Pink Floyd's The Wall just as 'Full Circle' is starting. The 19-minute build-up finally reaches it's climax when you hear James screaming 'Trapped inside this Octavarium!', and then follows the grand finale. This song is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br />Now, I don't expect my review to have helped you very much, but if only for the title track, buy this album. After reading around at various Dream Theater communities, I realize I'm one of few that felt this way about Octavarium (just as I was one of few that really enjoyed Train of Thought), so I'm pretty sure you'll warrant different feelings. Buy this album; as a whole, it's not as amazing as other DT releases, but it does have it's moments.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|My 3 year old son loved this movie. We saw it in the theatre and he has asked to see it over and over again. There is a lot of action and the characters are great. I have been waiting for this to come out on video for months so that he will stop asking to go to see it again.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I've been a Coldplay fan from the very (humble) beginnings, I saw their 2nd US concert ever, in February 2001, when they toured behind \\"Parachutes, just released a mere months before in the US. The growth/transformation of the band has been astonishing. When the \\"Rush of Blood\\" album came out, I said in my review Coldplay could be \\"the next U2, if they want that\\". That has been answered loud and clearly, yes they want to be!<br /><br />\\"X&Y\\" (12 tracks plus one \\"hidden\\" track, 62 min.) is a long way from the intimate \\"PArachutes\\" album, but it does offer a lot. From the opening track \\"Square One\\", the sound is arena-sized, even with the quivering emotions from front man Chris Martin.  A lot has been made about \\"Talk\\", the song that takes the riff from Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\" (it supposedly was the last track to make it on the final ablum set track--Chris Martin lists Kraftwerk as one of his all-time fave bands--as it is one of mine, by the way). It's a good track, but when you listen to \\"Speed of Sound\\" (the lead-off single), it struck me how similar both tracks sounded in their soaring music. \\"The Hardest Part\\" is the most early-Coldplay like track, and a beauty. The \\"hidden\\" track is \\"Till Kingdom Come\\", a nice quiet song, although not sure why it was not officially listed on the song track.<br /><br />When all is said and done, \\"X&Y\\" is better than, say, 90% of the music that is put out today, hence my 4 star rating. It is not my favorite Coldplay album, though. \\"Parachutes\\" is so much more adventurous and unexpected, and I would urge anyone new to Coldplay to seek it out.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Q:  Take a rock `n' roll band with horns, mix it with a mystical funk group and what do you get?<br /><br />A:  A sparkling new concert DVD combining the music of two classic horn bands-Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire \\"Live at the Greek Theatre.\\" (Shelf date:  June 28, 2005)<br /><br />In the show taped in high-definition at the conclusion of their 2004 summer tour, the two-band powerhouse has the Greek Theatre crowd on its feet for most of the three-plus-hour concert.  The show was originally recorded for a pay-per-view concert that aired on cable systems in early 2005.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD set opens with the groups hitting the stage en masse-complete with six horn players, two drummers, three percussionists, two bass players, three guitarists, et al., launching into Chicago's \\"Beginnings.\\"<br /><br />\\"When we open and both bands are on stage, people are like agog,\\" Chicago founding member and trumpet player Lee Loughnane said during the 2004 tour.  \\"They're like `oh my God, you guys really are playing together.'\\"<br /><br />Putting two bands on stage at once is often a train wreck in the making.  A muddy sound mix can plague the effort or whole sections of one band or the other get left out.<br /><br />Instead listeners are treated to a sparkling mix and interplay among the horn players that only adds to the classic tunes.  Clearly the sum is greater than the already exceptional parts.<br /><br />Next is EWF's majestic \\"In the Stone,\\" cross-pollinated with Chicago's \\"Dialogue.\\"  Like a club DJ, the bands somehow mix the two songs together with stunning results, using an a cappella bridge.<br /><br />After some friendly banter-and a coin flip-between Chicago's Robert Lamm and EWF's Philip Bailey about who should play next, Chicago leaves the stage and Earth, Wind & Fire launches into a funk-filled set - mixing in classics like \\"Getaway,\\" \\"Boogie Wonderland,\\" and \\"That's the Way of the World.\\"<br /><br />Chicago's Bill Champlin returns to the stage and takes over lead vocals on the EWF hit \\"After the Love is Gone\\" - a song he penned before he joined Chicago in the early `80s.<br /><br />Given that a DVD mixes sight AND sound, EWF is the more entertaining band visually.  Verdine White is a special effect in his own right, prompting some to call the lanky bassist the \\"Energizer Bunny\\" of the band.  The man absolutely never stops moving.<br /><br />Motown-like moves and cajoling of the audience to dance and sing along play into the party atmosphere that marks an EWF show.<br /><br />While the members of EWF are better entertainers than their counterparts in Chicago, both bands are peers musically.  Earth, Wind & Fire are just more fun to watch.<br /><br />Starting on disc two, Chicago powers its way through its own impressive catalogue of hits, stringing together \\"Make Me Smile,\\" \\"Colour My World,\\" \\"Saturday in the Park,\\" and \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\\" as part of its set - mostly focusing on their early hits.<br /><br />\\"Let's get lost in the 70s,\\" says keyboardist Robert Lamm to the cheers of the audience filled with graying baby boomers, as he introduces \\"Call on Me\\" and \\"Alive Again.\\"<br /><br />The bands again swap vocalists on \\"If You Leave Me Now,\\" with Bailey and his soaring tenor making the ballad sound better than it has since Peter Cetera left Chicago two decades ago.<br /><br />The two bands claim combined sales of more than 150-million records and albums.  Both have collected their share of Grammies and American Music Awards.  EWF was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.<br /><br />But despite their credentials, it is not a pairing that immediately evokes the same sort of  \\"that's a great idea\\" response as the \\"Piano Men\\" tours of Elton John and Billy Joel in past years did.<br /><br />During their heydays in the 1970s, Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire were the yin and yang of the pop music world-both with dominant horn sections, but radically different approaches to their music.<br /><br />When Chicago formed in the Windy City in 1967, members came together with the idea of being \\"The Beatles with horns.\\"<br /><br />As Maurice White started pulling together EWF in 1969 - also in Chicago-his musical vision included Afro-centric themes, astrology and black pride wrapped around a tight funk base, spiced with hints of Motown and gospel.<br /><br />The real fireworks of the concert come appropriately during the six-song encore - both bands fully energized and on stage together again. It's an impressive closing set.<br /><br />Trading hits, the tour de force powers through: \\"September,\\" \\"Free\\" with dueling sax solos by Chicago's Walter Parazaider and EWF's Gary Bias, \\"Singasong,\\" \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" \\"Shining Star\\" and a free-for-all version of \\"25 or 6 to 4,\\" with each of the three guitarists taking a turn on lead.<br /><br />During last summer's pairing, EWF drummer John Paris said, \\"We seem to bring out the best in each other.\\"<br /><br />The chemistry is obvious as both bands, energized and challenged by each other, far outshine their previous DVD concert performances.<br /><br />And the fans agree.<br /><br />\\"There's a reason bands like Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire are still around after all this time,\\" said Roberto Fernandez, who drove six-hours from Jacksonville, Fla. to see the July 11, 2004 show in Atlanta.  \\"It's called talent.\\"<br /><br />The pairing was such a success that both bands will tour again together this summer, starting June 24 in Chicago and not wrapping up until late September.s with horns.\\" <br />As Maurice White started pulling together EWF in 1969 - also in Chicago-his musical vision included Afro-centric themes, astrology and black pride wrapped around a tight funk base, spiced with hints of Motown and gospel. <br />The real fireworks of the concert come appropriately during the six-song encore - both bands fully energized and on stage together again.

B0007Y08QA|4.0|[note: approximately one hundred words cut from review due to Amazon length requirements.]<br /><br />The Machinist (Brad Anderson, 2004)<br /><br />I have never been as blown away, and as ultimately satisfied, by a film as fundamentally flawed as El Maquinista.<br /><br />Forget the one-hit thriller wonders. There are guys wandering around the planet who managed to direct one truly great thriller, and them immediately began a downhill slide. But they've traded on that one great thriller for a multi-hundred-million-dollar Hollywood career. (M. Night Shyamalan, please pick up the white courtesy phone.) In some cases, it's not even a downward spiral, it's a plunge off a cliff. (There's a Mr. Christopher Nolan calling for you.) It's gotten to the point where I see a truly great thriller from a director I have not previously encountered, I leave the theater both amazed at how wonderful a film I just saw and immediately thinking that the next film the guy directs is going to suck rocks.<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen of the world, Brad Anderson is back with the next film. And it blows the competition away.<br /><br />Anderson, who was responsible for what may be the creepiest piece of atmospheric horror in the past decade-- Session 9-- met with such resounding apathy in Hollywood upon its release that he ended up packing his bags and heading off to Spain to make film #2, El Maquinista. It is a mark of Hollywood's continuing resounding apathy, and perennial stupidity, that the similarly Spanish-financed and American-acted Jaume Balaguero film Darkness, which was, to be blunt, a completely un-scary piece of dreck, was released on Christmas Day 2004 in America on thousands of screens, while El Maquinista toured the U. S. film festival circuit, then opened in painfully limited release (at its height, it played on a paltry seventy-two screens two weeks before Darkness opened on seventeen hundred) and slid back into the obscurity that, in the world of American mainstream film, is reserved only for truly great cinema. In this film, Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznik, who is, not surprisingly, a machinist. His co-workers have noticed a change in his personality. His landlady still seems to like him, but is somewhat nervous in his presence.  Trevor's life, we begin to realize, is really a tightrope, and the slightest nudge could send everything spiralling out of control. A new worker, Ivan (John Sharian, recently of Calendar Girls) starts at the plant, and Trevor gets nudged. The question we're left with is-- what is it that's caused everything to go so horribly wrong for Trevor?<br /><br />Before we get to the movie's many, many strengths, I'll get the one weakness out of the way. The first (roughly) thirty minutes or so of the movie are horribly paced, the work of a rank amateur rather than a guy who directed the pitch-perfect Session 9. If you find yourself getting bored by the setup, persevere. Fast-forward if need be, though you're likely to miss a few important details if you do. That's the unfortunate thing about the awful pacing in the first segment of the movie; there's way too much going on for you to just skip it. El Maquinista will put the viewer in mind of such movies as The Usual Suspects, Jacob's Ladder, or, of course, Session 9 in that the visual cues will be coming at you hard and fast, but you'll have no idea what they're about until you finally get to the big twist at the end, where that question above in answered. And, like the three movies mentioned in the last sentence, it's a devastating twist. The whole thing starts to fall into place, and the viewer is left either utterly confused (in which case, keep watching it over and over until you get it) or stunned at the audacity, and the brilliance, of Anderson's vision (one wonders whether it's also scriptwriter Scott Kosar's vision, as Kosar's other three released/in production movies are all remakes, so we've really no way of knowing). This is why I'm more than willingto forgive some crappy pacing, but really, I thought to myself more than once, \\"this is from the guy who directed Session 9?\\"I stopped after things picked up, though (things pick up when Trevor and Ivan have their first meeting).<br /><br />Something like this can't be carried off without the actors. You don't have The Usual Suspects or Session 9 without those great ensembles. Here, the whole batch turn in excellent performances. Bale's has gotten a great deal of attention for his record-setting loss of sixty-three pounds for the role (if you pay attention to the Post-It notes in the movie, you'll note he probably lost a few more pounds during filming), which is all well and good, but it tends to overshadow the subtlety and excellence of various other members of the cast. Michael Ironside is his usual scenery-chewing ham-handed self, but Ironside has a deft eye for choosing his spots, and like most of the other places he appears, he makes his character work here. Jennifer Jason Leigh turned in a performance that should probably have been worth an Oscar nomination. The always-reliable Reg E. Cathey doesn't get much screen time, but what he has smolders. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (I'm Not Scared) is not a familiar name to American moviegoers, but is a heavy hitter in her native Spain, and it's entirely possible you'll be seeing a lot more of her over here in the near future.<br /><br />There is a great deal more to be said about how brilliant certain aspects of this movie are-- the cinematography, the sound mix, other technical details that enhance the atmosphere perfectly-- but I'm already at a thousand words (the magic Amazon limit), and thus I'll just say \\"see this movie. If you get bored in the first half-hour, keep watching. 'Better' does not even begin to describe what this movie gets.\\" **** ½than willing to forgive some crappy pacing, but really, I thought to myself more than once, \\"this is from the guy who directed Session 9?\\"I stopped after things picked up, though (things pick up when Trevor and Ivan have their first meeting). <br /> <br />Something like this can't be carried off without the actors.

1400032717|3.0|On one superficial level this is a pretty good book. I say this because it is a real heart-wrenching bit of story telling. I really felt for the family and the kid protagonist here. Also the story has several very clever manipulations surrounding its construction. The author throws in antidotes left and right, filling out an otherwise very simple tale. I have to say that as I put this book down I was thinking hard about what it was that got to me here. And in the end I came to the conclusion that Mark Haddon had really offered up nothing more than a well-concealed story that was really insultingly gimmicky.<br /><br />I was a little offended at Haddon's willingness to time and again delve into the surefire treasure trove of movie of the week catch-alls. What could have been a pretty good off kilter mystery if he had gone a different rout with the story becomes a Black Stallion style triumph of the will. The story line is no more complex than any of the four or five Rocky films or a 6th grade level reading book. Maybe Haddon did intend his audience to be a slightly older school child, but his subject matter I believe is best contemplated by an adult with empathy.<br /><br />Ahh, this is a jumble of conflictions here in the book. I was not a big fan of the books resolution or its over all plot direction as you can tell. But to give Haddon his props, this is a very well written character study. I would skip this book if I were you, there are several others floating out in the universe waiting for you to open them up. And quite a few will in the long run be more satisfying reads than `The Curious Incident.'
1593072937|4.0|Frank Miller, Sin City: The Hard Goodbye (Dark Horse, 1994(?))<br /><br />The Hard Goodbye was the first of the Sin City collections, retitled for its 2005 reissue that coincided with the film. Those of you who have seen the film, this is the story of Marv and Kevin. Those of you who haven't, this is the story of Marv, a two-time loser framed for murder, and Kevin, a shy, retiring boy who never speaks. In the world of the comics, it served more to introduce a number of characters we'd be seeing later on in the series (Nancy, the girls of Old Town, Lucille, etc.), but the story's a corker as well. Miller roared out of the darkness with this one, creating a series that remains to this day one of the most popular modern comics in existence.<br /><br />Why is it so popular? It's not just the impeccable skill of the drawing and the oppressive noir atmosphere Miller creates. It's not the many, many nods to forties and fifties hardboiled detective novels. It's not action that moves at the speed of a barrelling freight train about to derail. All of these things make the Sin City books a pleasure to read, to be sure, but what truly separates Sin City from the pack is Miller's characters. Miller is the Stephen King of comic writers; where most authors will spread getting to know the characters over the course of a number of issues in traditional comics style, Miller's characterizations tend to show up with a few well-placed lines and well-chosen words, allowing for the creation of minor players just as deep and complex as the main characters (Lucille, especially, is particularly well-rounded-- no pun intended). It all combines into a thick, meaty stew that's a true pleasure to the palate. ****
B0007CNXUK|3.0|I put my name on the list at the public library and waited patiently for my turn to view \\"Finding Neverland\\".

What we get are essentially one-dimensional stick figures. J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) meets four children and their widowed mother (Kate Winslet) in the park while walking his dog. Suddenly they all become inseparable, much to the chagrin of Barrie's wife (Radha Mitchell) and Winslet's character's mother (Julie Christie). For the most part, the adults (excepting perhaps the Christie character) are too busy being dignified to show emotion or reveal their motivation(s). Mr. Barrie maintains a certain stateliness even when playing with the children, often while wearing a three-piece suit.<br /><br />The result is a film which fails to hook the viewer, who is also unable to get emotionally involved. Hence the movie, while not unpleasant, is not especially memorable either. Despite an A-List cast, it seemed as though they were all directed to \\"act inhibited\\". Consequently, my delight as a viewer was inhibited as well. Let me point out that I'm essentially a minimalist who as a rule appreciates understatement and despises sensationalism. Yet despite that, there was just too much of something(s) missing from this effort.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time.  If you don't have it, go out and get it.  Fast!  Dark Side of the Moon is nothing compared to this.  NOTHING!  Syd Barrett was either a genious or tripping on a little to much acid.  Most likely a combination of both.  If you think The Wall is trippy, this will leave you scared and hiding under your sheats.  This is the greatest Pink Floyd album ever, and in the top 10 of greatest rock albums ever.  The only sad thing is that See Emily Play wasn't on it.  My sources tell me that on a certain printing of this album the drag queen ballad Arnold Layne was included, but I can't confirm it.  Either way, the cd could have gotten some bonus tracks(singles from the era), but still gets 5 stars on its own.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I'm a Melbourner who attended this concert and it's fantastic to see how perfectly the experience was captured on this DVD collection. Finally a DVD release from a band with a peerless catalogue which doesn't skimp on material - on Farewell 1, they give you EVERYTHING - I can guarantee you, that was played at this concert.<br />The sound is superb, the filming appears to have been done on HD which works fine; the look is filmy - not harsh like older video formats. This concert's material is perfectly chosen - I can't think of any track that I would have wished for - maybe 'Pretty Maids in a Row' but you can always run back to your copy of 'Hell Freezes Over' for that. Everyone is in great voice - it's nice to see Glen Frey taking his rightful place as band leader - he looks like he's having a ball - as if it's all new for him again. 'Take it to the Limit' is absolutely superb, even without Randy Meisner. You don't exactly miss Don Felder's presence although I think the extra 10% of having his wonderful touch on the guitars would've been the icing on the cake. They appear to be very unified without him though so maybe this is the only way it works for the band. Lots of terrific tracks from the solo careers - particularly Henly. Joe Walsh has a day out, playing crankin' solos and clowning around. 'Life's been good' has been needed sorely on DVD for years. 3 hours of vintage Eagles, beautifully played, very faithful to recorded versions, perfect harmonies - what more could you ask for? I was aware of some criticisms here of overuse of fiddle on the arrangements. I disagree. The arrangements are excellent and the fiddle is tastefully used and faithful to the feel of every song in which it features. Just purists who can't open their minds, even a little! If you like the Eagles, have no doubts about this one. Buy it.
B00000720W|1.0|Black metal, considered by many to be \\"different\\" or \\"underground\\",is some of the worst music ever produced, right up there with pop and rap.  And Mayhem is no exception.  Lame guitar riffs, offbeat drums, and some of the most laughable sounding vocals ever recorded are compiled here into 20 minutes of teeth-grinding garbage.  Listen, people!  Black metal is underground for a very good reason.  IT SUCKS.  It's some of the most annoying and unoriginal music ever made, and if you're listening to it because you want to be \\"different,\\" then get your hands on something that is genuinely good and original, which is definitely not Mayhem.  All these guys are are a rehash of a bunch of corny horror movies, satanic nonsense, and names stolen strait from the Lord of the Rings (HA!  Count Grishnackh!).  Seriously, though, these guys are real dorks.  They sit around all day in their mom's basement, writing silly lyrics about how they murdered dozens of people (when they never have and never will) because people made fun of them too much when they were little.  Whoa! I guess that really does make them evil, and not just a bunch of untalented pyschotic posers who took D&D too seriously.
1850893144|5.0|It's no wonder \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", \\"The BFG\\" and even \\"Matilda\\" are thrillingly outrageous stories, because the short pieces in \\"Kiss Kiss\\" also display Roald Dahl's macabre and unexpected thoughts. In this case he weaves them around seemingly real-life situations. \\"Georgy Porgy\\" is particularly disturbing as George ends up getting drunk and then going mad when he feels he's conquered his fear of women, while \\"Royal Jelly\\" shows Albert Taylor turning his baby daughter into a big human bee like himself. Then there's the birth of Adolf Hitler in \\"Genesis and Catastrophe\\" and his mother wanting him to live after the deaths of her three previous children - and the whole world knows what he did during the Second World War - while \\"Edward the Conqueror\\" shows Edward obstinately refusing to believe that the cat Louisa discovers is a reincarnation of Franz Liszt...before throwing the creature in the fire. In \\"Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat\\" it is clear that Mr. Bixby found out that the mink coat his wife pawned was given to her (by the Colonel) and he punished her by secretly giving it to Miss Pulteney, while in \\"Pig\\", vegetarian Lexington becomes a tragic hero by eating a piece of pork and then meeting a death in the packing-house as horribly cruel as it is for pigs. But my favourite story is \\"William and Mary\\". It is unnerving in that Mary is appalled by the idea of William's brain being kept alive, together with one of his eyes, after he dies, but when she goes to the hospital to see the conclusion of this experiment, she likes the sight of William's brain immersed in Ringer's Solution with the eye glaring at her, and is adamant about bringing \\"him\\" home with her. The experiment itself is also unnerving, as is the short film that Landy watches showing the Russian dog's head licking away food and watching people that gives him the idea for the experiment. It just goes to show you how imaginative, how remarkable and how successful Dahl was as far as allage groups are concerned during his writing career, and that even his adult stories are as macabre as \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" etc. Truly masterful.
0345475674|4.0|Having read 'Fatherland', also by Robert Harris, and having enjoyed it thoroughly, I decided that I may as well give another one of his books a read. I picked Pompeii because not only did the idea of a book about an engineer on the Roman Aqueducts at the time of Pompeii's eruption seem interesting to begin with- but it was also a refreshing change of topic from Fatherland. And that it was- in fact, in the end, I found it to be amazingly well researched, offering a picture of just how modern and ahead of its time Rome really was. Not to say that it doesn't get off to a slow start. After reading the first few pages, I thought I would be somewhat disappointed, but the book gets moving quickly- and once it does, you will find it hard to put down. There are occassional bits where you might lose interest or the story wanders off slightly, but everything comes together. With each new revelation coming from 2 different mysteries, both parts of the story come closer and closer together until they finally meet one another: perfectly. I won't give away too much, or bore anyone by carrying on, but the story of the young aquarius from Rome- Marcus Attilius- and the discoveries he makes just shortly after taking over as the engineer for the Aqua Augusta is an interesting one, and one that seems to indicate that I should perhaps have a look at another one of Robert Harris' novels sometime soon!
1582432678|4.0|I might have said \\"weird-O\\" ending but I enjoyed the book so much that I'd like to give the author the benefit of the doubt. But I can't let her off the hook that easily.  <br /> <br />This book is a horrifying and heartbreaking journey into the heart of a mother whose 16 year-old son,we are told from the outset, recently murdered many of his fellow students, a cafeteria worker and the teacher who \\"knew\\" him.  <br /> <br />We follow the malevolent little Kevin from his unpleasent infancy through a particularly destructive and cruel childhood (in this case, HE is the destructive an cruel party). Then we watch him develop into a cold, blisteringly mean-spirited, and ultimately brutal adolescent. <br /> <br />The narrator, his mother, is rightly tormented by what happened to her family -- to the boy himself, to her, her beloved husband and second child -- as a result of his very existence. <br /> <br />She speaks as a broken women, bereft of everything that had meaning to her; a lonely, desolate, but questioning and articulate narrator who sifts through 16 years of ongoing disaster that includes everything from a shrew in the garbage disposal to the ruination of a strong, good marriage, at the hands of a skinny-eyed boy who is obsessed with school murderers past and present. <br /> <br />There are some things that simply don't make sense to me. For instance, that a woman as intelligent and wise as this narrator; someone who sees this sneaky, cruel, manipulative, evil, deceitful child for what he is, didn't seek immediate psychological attention for herself. And what possessed her to let her husband give him WEAPONS as gifts? <br /> <br />Second, given \\"Kev's\\" merciless coup de grace at the end of the book, I am not at all convinced that her subsequent behavior is either plausible or possible. The ending brought me up short and left me annoyed, as in, \\"am I supposed to BELIEVE this? <br /> <br />The book, which is so well-written and empathetic, is a window into the possible life of the parents of the children who commit these unspeakable crimes, and for that I thank the author. In this respect she had done a wonderful job of making the mother \\"live\\" for us. <br /> <br />The father is inscrutable, however, and despite the narrators great love for him, there's a \\"DUH\\" here that will not go away.  <br /> <br />Throughout the book, the author has narrator torture herself about whether her \\"refrigerator mom\\" style of rearing this changeling \\"caused\\" him to be who he is.  <br /> <br />In the end, she more or less \\"breaks through\\" to him, even planning to keep a bedroom warm for him  when he gets out of prison after a few years. She'd better sleep with a machete. <br />  <br />\\"Kevin\\" has every earmark of a psychopath from birth to arrest. The book's notion that a bit of \\"cold mothering\\" as a cause for the creation of a psychopath is, as far as I know, purty far off the mark. Besides, his mother tries desperately to raise him with affection and attention, which he rejects and mocks at every turn, and Dad adores the little dissembling little creep. And he IS a creep. At no point do we doubt the mother's perception or take her side over dad's. <br /> <br />The idea that a few months in jail could produce an epiphany in this boy, much less an epiphany that would permit him to live among other human beings is so doubtful that it seems nor more than a device used to quickly tie-up a complex and disturbing narrative. I do not like the ending of this book and think  it cheats the reader of a conclusion as meaningful and true as the rest of the story. <br /> <br />That said, I couldn't put it down.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0975991477|5.0|I have for some time held the thought that the body and mind are so connected, but lack the advaced educational experience to explain why this is so to myself or others.  This book does a wonderful job of explaining it in easy to understand language.  I have also seen one of Dr. Lipton's DVD lectures entitled 'The Biology of Perception' and enjoyed that as well.      I am grateful for this book and as a Psych-K facilitator, I now have better words to scientifically explain why the work that I do provides such shifts for the people I work with.  Why changing their beliefs changes their EVERYTHING.
0975991477|1.0|Between the low-quality \\"rah-rah-go-team you can do it if you believe\\" tripe, and the overhyped, incorrect deductions about quantum theory, this book is of even less quality than \\"Dianetics.\\"  The AmWay-esque nature of the various reviewers giving their raves here I can only explain as a pack of christian frothers praying desperately to find some way to arrogate personal belief above genuine reality. <br /> <br />Bad news, kids, the real world still exists, and microbes will still gleefully eat you if you don't deal with them.  Tumors will still kill you, no matter what god you pray to.  A broken neck will still paralyze you, regardless of how \\"right\\" you've been living. <br /> <br />While a positive attitude most certainly has been evidenced to help the healing process, belief in and of itself is not a curative agent.  Didn't Mary Baker Eddy teach you all that when she died?  For those of you who are wondering, she's the founder of Christian Science - which is the religion that can claim ownership of this \\"Power of Belief\\" idea.  And for those who weren't aware, she's still dead.   <br /> <br />I will stipulate, as I have done in the past for similar attempts to spin this fantasy, that this book's contents are worse than simply false:  they are irresponsibly so.  Praying at an illness or injury, while it may enhance your attitude (and thereby assist you in a minor way), will cost you in the long run if you allow it to occlude seeking genuine medical attention. <br /> <br />Particularly if what ails you threatens to kill you. <br /> <br />But then, if it ends up killing you because you were foolish enough to ignore your illness...Darwin (and good old Watson-and-Cricke biology) wins.  How ironic.   <br /> <br />  T <br />
B000002MG1|4.0|With 'Automatic For The People' R.E.M. returns to the sound and style that made them so popular with their devoted following in the 80's. They strayed from this after 'Green' and I believe their catalog suffered greatly becAUse of it. On this album, R.E.M. is back in form. AFTP is their \\"clearest\\" album (those familiar with their earlier works such as 'Murmur' know exactly what I'm talking about) and also holds the important title on being the first R.E.M album on which the lyrics actually make sense!!!! HAHAHAHA. How I love 'Murmur' and 'Lifes Rich Pageant' but I'll be damned if I know what the HELL Michael Stipe and co. are talking about half the time. This is a fine album, and one that I believe any fan of the bands first albums will appreciate. No, its not as GOOD as their first 5 albums, but nothing will ever be that good again. They HAVE changed their sound permanently, but with AFTP they're giving us a little peek at what we'd been missing for 4 years. This is the last quality R.E.M. album, and the albums between this and 'Green' were also not R.E.M. quality and they havent delivered anything of this quality since. Good to have if one is an R.E.M. fan, but not essential
B00063MBU8|1.0|How anyone could consider this band even remotely mediocore is beyond my comprehension.This is a waste of plastic,money,time,trees,plastic,and human beings.Obviously a boy band with a nose ring and guitars,utter vomit considered music.Should be quaranteened
B00005JKJA|5.0|I didnt get the film the first time. ive seen it twice and had a class about it, and i still have my doubts. but hey, even though you cant understand everything, it keeps being a great film about identity, losing of inocence and personality and about evil and fakeness beneath the apparently beautiful life.  <br />We see the characters once, then they are the same actresses but the characters is different. we see how they lose their lifes, their identities (many times through the film, actually) and fulfil their dreams outside reality.  <br />Dont be satisfied with simple explanations: ok, the first part is a dream. But its not just that. if camilla is rita, why there are two camillas? if everything is dianes fantasy, why are there so many things that doesnt make sense? why is she dreaming with the director, why cant she control her desires, why she finds herself dead?  <br />I think that a lot of magic in this film is precisely in the fact that you can say the film is this or that. the film is this and that, but can never be just this, just that or entirely one of these. it wouldnt make sense. just keep in mind that is a puzzle, where some pieces are missing or we just cant put themselves together. and enjoy. the film is great even though you dont get it. trust me
B000268QB2|4.0|I took a shot at getting this album because I liked what I had heard, and was pleased to find the entire album is just as great. \\"Everybody's Changing\\" is indeed one of the best tracks, and the melody and emotion of it make it hard to shake from my head. This guys voice is an amazing instrument. \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" also deserves it's spot on radio, and I think \\"Bend And Break\\" could easily be another single. \\"Your Eyes Open\\" and \\"Untitled 1\\" are other favorites, however they're all good at the least. Like others, I too am impressed with how full the music sounds without guitar. This is simply wonderful piano-driven alt-pop, and as far as listening goes, I \\"Can't Stop Now\\".
B00003CX9S|5.0|probably if lynch had waited a bit to make this film, it would have got all the perfection it lacks. but who cares? this film is just GREAT. it puts you in the skin of merrick, the elephant man, a man who was put aside by society, and keept by a man whose only interest was to get admiration (by lynchs interpretation, i dont know if the real treves was like that). when merrick says \\"you are my friends\\" you cant hold a tear (i couldnt, really, and i usually dont cry at films. though i love the ones who can make feel like this one), cause he really has no friends, just people who stares at him. <br />what i really didnt like was the acting. i know many will desagree with me but i didnt believe everything. maybe the script too..... it lack a bit of credibility, not for the fact you have an elephant man in the screen but some things dont hold up well..... but maybe i'm overreacting.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A wildly exaggerated black satire delivered with a wink and a glossy black eye. Ed  Nortan's  corporate drone is the perfect  persona to set off Brad  Pitt's  wonderfully witty and outrageously  glam character Tyler Durhem  who lives life on his own terms.  A stylish and hip treatment of an age old dilemma:  How does one avoid being owned / controlled by corporations and losing one's  inner and outer self to plastic consumerism and wretched materialism.  Brad Pitt once again throws himself  (literally)  into this role with full throttle gusto and  is dressed so amazingly making Gaultier, D and G , Gucci and  Dsquared (all euro high fashion envelope pushers) proud as all hell. Helen carter Borham  is the single female presence and matches the fellas in her own delightfully twisted way, and has a bedroom scene with Brad that is as intensly violent as it is hilarious with a killer one liner. A  high concept  cinematic treat handled with twisted humor , high octane energy and comic book graphics .
B000077VR3|1.0|This film has nothing but hype and kitch. However I realize that's what the \\"average person\\" likes today, and why? Because it's easy. Hey, give me close to a hundred million dollars and a string of hit tunes, some popular stars and I am sure I could turn out a so called hit too. Let's face it, this film couldn't even deicide what it wanted to be, i.e. a pitifully stupid slapstick comedy, or a pitifully poorly written melodrama, with a \\"quasi-Mimi\\" would be bohemian heroine, who tries to make prositution into some kind of virtuous existance.       Hello mores for teenage girls! \\"The show must go on, even if you have to sleep with an old ugly producer, and scarifice your true love to do it. But hey you'll die a star\\". And boys, watch out for those whores! They are pretty, but don't fall in love with one. They will only break your hearts and then they die on you, leaving you to go insane.     The music, what can one say about the music. A total lack of originality. That is why I was quite surprised, because everyone was telling me this is so original; \\"Robert, you who loves musicals have got to go see this\\". I should have followed my insticts and not seen this, because these same people told me I would love the NYC production of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", three of the most painful hours of my life. Unfortunatlly, I was invited and could not leave during the intermission. However, There was one respite of hope in this trully tragic film. That was the number \\"Roxanne\\" it was trully well done. Too bad the director didn't opt to do just a video of that.       As for the so called original cinematography, did anyone in America, other than I, see the French film \\"Delicatessin\\"? Yes even the cinematography was plagerize in this film. What the heck everthing else was. At least the director's consistant.    Let's now sum up the so called very original \\"Moulin Rouge\\" The songs were all hits long before the movie saw the light of day: The script was a cross of La Boheme meets 42ndStreet, and the Cinematography, was straight out of mordern French trends for the cinema. The title was stolen from the night club. The comedy was poor Grocho Marx. The only thing original about this film is, that such a bad film won a Golden Globe. Usually, the foreign press exercises a little more discretion in it choices. It trully reminds me of the novel 1984 \\"Good is Bad and Bad is Good\\". Of course, there was a dumbing down of that society too. So it all fits.    If you want to see a truly creative, innovative, thoughout musical that has been recently produce pick up \\"Chicago\\" A brillant satire on the American \\"inJustice\\" System. And maybe one day some director will have the hustpa to produce \\"Sweeny Todd\\". Believe me if I had the money I would, and it would be a whole ot better than this thing.!!!        The only thing that this film honors is that our society is definitly  being dumb down, and most producers are capitalizing on that.
0975991477|5.0|This book explains what I've intuitively known for a long time. It's about how the universe works, one cell at a time. This book gives words and clear expression to how we (humans) are influenced by our preprogrammed beliefs. Knowing this gives the power back to us. We become powerful rather than powerless. We can be responsible for the outcome by being consciously aware of our responses to our environment. It enables us to become powerful agents in creating the life we have always wanted. When, together as a species, we begin to understand this principle and use it in a manner that reflects the integrity, community and cooperation that we all desire, the world will change. Thank you Dr. Lipton!
B0006A9FKA|1.0|This movie just plain sucks. I love british humor, I love zombie movies, but the two don't mix well. At least not here. The movie is not scary at all. It has some funny parts but not enough to keep you interested. I almost turned it off before the end but I stuck it out much to my disappiontment. \\"28 days later\\" I thought was OK. At least it was scary! It took us yanks to get it right with the new version of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" This is a scary movie! Entertaining and also funny at times. \\"Shuan of the Dead\\" is none of these that's why it's bad. Don't waste your time.
B0009AM5JA|1.0|I made the unfortunate mistake of buying Coldplay's X&amp;Y. Why? Because EMI has used their Copy Controlled technology to prevent people from legally ripping tracks from the CD. Even though the average knowledgeable user can easily figure out alternate ways to rip the tracks, the CD does not meet Philips Redbook Audio standards and is therefore not a true Audio Compact Disc. This is a disgrace. I will never buy another CD from EMI again.
0380789035|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. One of those books that you'll think about when you're not reading it, and look forward to when you can pick it up again. I'm more a student of Joseph Campbell, and found this book to be a real treat coming from that background.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0000027F8|5.0|Sometimes it takes a while for things to dawn on me. While working on my website I was compiling a list of my all time favorite albums ever. I came up with a few and quickly listed them and moved on. This CD didn't even cross my mind. <br /> <br />To make a long story short, my car was broken into and I was subject to reconnecting my old car stereo with just a cassette deck (the horror!), and in it was this tape. So off I go. And I sit there and listen... And sing along.... And listen some more. <br /> <br />George Michael was never thought of in my mind as being a real talent during his Wham! days. Careless Whisper had a pretty nice vocal track ,but nothing to write home about. I never really paid much attention until Listen was released. In those days (back when I was a fresh high school graduate on a serious budget heading into my college years...before) I had a 3 song rule before I bought a cd. But the songs that I heard from this CD forced me to buy it after just 2 songs. <br /> <br />This entire CD is an incredible tour de force for George. The power in his voice is so prevelent in so many of the songs. Yes, there are some songs that are haunting, but I think that is a testament to his skill as a musician. He makes you feel. <br /> <br />This is my favorite album...ever. Guess it should have been apparent when I realized that I had 4 copies of it!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Although I came to love Train of Thought in time, I remember that upon my first listen I was wondering why every song had to be 10-12 minutes just revved up to the max with heaviness, with extended guitar and keyboard solos.  Of course that is what I suppose we all expect from DT--expertise.  However, call it blasphemy if you want, but I have felt at times DT has put technical prowess ahead of feeling and emotion in their songs.  This is not a bad thing, as it's earned the respect of musicians everywhere.  But at the same time, I felt as if they continued doing the same thing, it would mark more a state of stagnation than the evolution of a \\"progressive band.\\"  DT has already shown they can write wonderful concept albums with SFAM and the second disc of 6DOIT.  There's no point to continue walking down that road again (see Rush after their Hemispheres days).  But this CD showcases a greater knack for melody, and playing within the context of the song and for the song.  In addition, the tracks are very diverse so that if you want to listen to a flat out incredible rocking song you can put on Panic Attack, or if you want to mellow out you can listen to These Walls.   <br /> <br />Although there has been criticism about Portnoy's and Petrucci's \\"simplified\\" playing, I feel it's a bold step to try to create a true song rather than a musical work.  Even the so-called \\"simplicity\\" of this album isn't all that simple at all, as there are still great performances and wonderful playing across the board.  Plus, it's a different story when you know a band can play incredibly and steps out in a \\"less complex\\" direction, compared to a band who simply plays easy stuff because that's all they can do.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a guitarist and love all of Petrucci's wonderful riffs and solos, but at the same time, if I wanted to listen to a guitarist who simply showcases his playing in a repetitive manner, I could pick up any Yngwie CD.  To me, Petrucci's playing has become almost orchestral on this album.  I like guitarists who are able to experiment and very their sound and style, both with their rhythm and lead playing.  In addition, Portnoy's toms came off sounding very good.  In the past, there have been times where they have come across sounding very hollow on some of the records. <br /> <br />And finally, finally I can HEAR John Myung!  My favorite bassist behind Geddy Lee, I was so glad to actually be able to pick out his bass lines for the first time.  The guy is so talented, yet he always seems to be buried way back in the mix. <br /> <br />The only reason I give this album 4 stars rather than 5 is that, I must admit, the lyrics are woefully inept at times.  The first time I heard Answer Lies Within I almost cringed at the simplicity and cliche of the words.  But I guess that's just because I've also come to expect expertise in that department from DT as well.  Overall, I'm very happy to add this to my DT collection.
0375701427|2.0|This is one of the most boring and purposeless yet highly acclaimed work of fiction that I ever read. A guy who had everything he could ask for in his youth (why, he was blonde, handsome and an excellent athlete) looses it all because he had a stuttering daughter who decided to blow up some thing to get attention.  <br /> <br />The writing is extremely self conscious with the narrator wanting to be clever and profound all the time. Why can't all these acclaimed modern authors deal with their interesting themes in an interesting way(the presumed theme in this novel is of class mobility, social integration and the associated loss of ethnic identity and sensitivities and all the guilt and misgivings caused by this).  The same theme could have been expressed in a Dickensian way with character carricature, a bit of comic exaggeration and human responses ranging from outright stupidity to outright genius. We would have got the same message in an entertaining way and we would have cared for the characters in the book and remembered their successes and follies even many years after closing the book. This book is a pain to read and I ended up with no sympathy for any of the characters or their plights.
B00097A5HW|5.0|1- En Tus Pupilas - Remminiscent of 70s French Pop.  Shakira's vocal performance is superb, using her voice in a sweet and charming way, uber-appropriate for this song.  The lyrics are as romantic as the melody. A+<br /><br />2- La Pared - With an updated 80s-ish production (keyboards a la Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams Are Made of This), and dramatic lyrics and chorus, this song is a small masterpiece.  Her voice is potent and the darkness of the lyric shows through her voice in a natural, honest way. A+<br /><br />3- La Tortura - This song shows that complex flourishing melodies are still \\"in\\", and fun and flavorful songs can be big hits.

B00005JNJT|5.0|Coming 8 long years after the debacle that was 1997's \\"Batman And Robin\\", the franchise with the man in the bat costume gets a new shot at life, and what a rebirth it is. The project brings back the integrity, dignity, and all around excitement that the first film, under the director of genius Tim Burton, brought back in 1989. While some people might consider it one of the two or both, this latest installment is neither a sequel or a prequel. Just as the title says, it's beginning anew. Something totally new, different, and something that is starting it's own seperate franchise. Director Christopher Nolan, with a script from David Goyer(known mostly as the man behind the \\"Blade\\" movies), brings the dark moodniess back to the dark knight, and makes it darker than anyone has seen on film yet. Bruce Wayne(now played by the excellent Christian Bale), is recruited by a man named Ducard(Liam Neeson), from a prison where he was kept for theft, and trained to be a warrior in the League Of Shadows. When he has fulfilled his training, Wayne heads back to Gotham City to clean out the trash, go home to trusted butler Alfred, and meet up with childhood sweetheart Rachel(Katie Holmes). Bruce takes on the disguise of 'Batman', which is explained in the film's early flashbacks to the death of his parents, and just why he chose bats as his symbol. As this new persona, he plans to take on the mob underworld, but gets a surprise when Scarecrow(Cillian Murphy), and a fellow villain, plan to release a poison to bring everyone's fears to life and ruin the city. As the new Batman/Bruce Wayne, Bale brings the character to life in ways that no one has ever seen before. I have a soft spot for Michael Keaton, but Bale is Batman. But better yet, he is Bruce Wayne. Bringing to full fruition the the dark, angry, and brooding side of the character. I liked Michael Gough, but Michael Caine just takes the role of Alfred as his own and he is the best Alfred anyone has seen. He is funny and warm, andthe relationship with him and Bruce is fantastic. The movie also boasts one great actor after another popping up. Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and Tom Wilkinson. Holmes does well with her role, but in the end, it becomes nothing more than a typical heroine. Cillian Murphy as Dr.Crane/Scarecrow is just fine, but there seemed to be less screen time for him to really have a solid impression. It can also be said his Scarecrow part can be pretty frightening for young kids. In fact, there are some scary/frightening things here that may not be well suited for young children. It is rated PG-13 after all. As with most Batman films, it's pretty dark. In the sense that it's hard to see sometimes, and you are not sure what you are seeing during some of the fights as well. While the movie is much more serious and darker, it does have a nice dose of humor to lighten things up a bit. The movie does a great job of explaining the origins of the character and just how he got to be who he is today. Not just as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne too. The movie may have the images and cool fights and all that, but this one is much more a character piece than any that has come before. I mean, why would a grown man dress up as a bat and capture bad guys?. The look of the film is magnificent. Gotham City is not the gothic place it was with Burton's films, or the comic book metropolis of Schumacher's films. It does have a distinct look to it tho. Like New York City a little bit in the future. The movie runs a longer than any other Bat film, and drags in some spots, but the end result is incredibly satisfying and entertaining. The way they structured it is perfect. You don't even see Batman until like 40 minutes or so into the movie. It breaks the comic book/superhero mold just by doing that alone, but also because it is not a typical comic book-y type superhero movie at all. This is not \\"Spider-Man\\", although I loved both films. Batman Begins is a brilliant, dazzling, and influentialfilm, and will no doubt raise the bar for future superhero movies. It's the best movie I have seen in a while. Let's hope next summer's \\"Superman Returns\\" will be just as worthy as this one.
B000002HK4|5.0|I am a HUGE Dream Theater fan. I picked up this EP not too long ago after hearing all of its hype saying it's Dream Theater's best song to date. Before I go into the songs, lemme go on the line-up. You got James LaBrie's soaring signature vocals, Mike Portnoy's exellent drumming, great bass-lines by John Myung YOU CAN HEAR, those amazing breath-taking guitar solos from THE John Petrucci, and nice keyboard effects from new-comer Derek Sherinian. IMHO, he is a very underrated keyboardist, just listen to his solo material. While not the songwriter like Kevin Moore was, and not nearly as technical as Jordan Rudess, he still is an amazing talent. Hell, DT even hired him, so that ALONE should be enough to convine you to buy this. Now I will go into the tracks....<br /><br />1. A Change of Seasons - 5555555555555555555555555555555555555/5 Hmmm......this is very hard to review as a whole, so I'll break it down...<br /><br />I. The Crimson Sunrise - Starts out with a catchy acoustic guitar riff, followed by Derek's sound effects, John Myung's signature bass-line, then gets into a heavy riff. This part og ACOS is an instrumental. Nice guitar solo. The best so far, but the best has yet to come...<br /><br />II. Innocence - Has the catchy riff from TCS and eventually gets slower. Also very good.<br /><br />III. Carpe Diem - \\"Carpe diem...seize the day.\\" While this isn't as good as TCS, this is slightly better than Innocence (not that Innocence is in any way a bad part.)<br /><br />IV. The Darkest of Winters - Also an instrumental. So far, the second best after TCS. Another good solo.<br /><br />V. Another World - Great song. I love the lyric \\"I'm sick of all you hypocrites.\\" Third best part so far.<br /><br />VI. The Inevitable Summer - The third and final instrumental. Nice solo from Derek.<br /><br />VII. The Crimson Sunset - Remember when I said that the best to come? The best is the sequel to the beginning...AND HERE IT IS!! Easily my favorite part of the song medley! The big finale sounds very similar to the first part, and it ends with the guitar riff that started it. The best Dream Theater song ever!<br /><br />2. Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding - 5/5 Meh, it's very good, but not nearly as good as its predesessor.<br /><br />3. Perfect Strangers - 5/5 A Deep Purple cover. Not NEARLY as good as ACOS, but I occasionally listen to this song.<br /><br />4. The Rover/Achilles Last Stand/The Song Remains The Same - 5/5 A live Led Zeppelin medley. I like LZ, but I actually like these songs better by DT.<br /><br />5. The Big Medley - 5/5 DT covers songs by bands that influenced them. I also like this song, but not nearly as much as the title track. Second best here.<br /><br />As you see, A Change of Seasons is my favorite Dream Theater song. The other songs here are good, but I'd buy it just for the title track alone. If you're a Dream Theater fan, you'll love this. I don't normally write reviews this long, but this (basic) song is long and flawless, so I guess it deserved a long, well thought out review.the first part, and it ends with the guitar riff that started it.

B0007OCG56|1.0|When this film finally ended, I felt exhausted. My head was ringing. Truly, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in years; you find yourself bewildered at what you've just witnessed: hysteria, over-the-top \\"acting\\", crying, yelling, communication breakdowns that become positively exasperating, etc. <br /> <br />Every single character is a stereotype - no one ever deviates from their stock-role: hysterical rich white woman; long-suffering husband; alcoholic grandmother with a sharp wit; children who are smarter than their parents and shockingly un-damaged by it all; and the coup-de-grace: the Mexican housekeeper who is noble, wise, and quintessentially feminine.  <br />This film falls apart all over the place - how can no one see this when it's being made?
B000002HPT|5.0|Why do people hate this album? Personally, I find thiss to be a great album, one of their best albums. True, it ain't SFAM, I&W, or Awake, but it still kicks ass. IMHO, I feel that John Myung (bass player) does his best work on this album, and on the opening song, New Millennium, he uses a chapman stick. Also, you get guitar solos from John Petrucci, great drumming from Mike Portnoy, soaring vocals from James LaBrie, and great keyboard effects from new-comer Derek Sherinian. Tell me, WHY is Derek so underrated? While not as talented as Kevin Moore or Jordan Rudess (sorry Derek), but he's still very talented (look into his solo material). Read on for my track ratings.<br /><br />1. New Millennium - 5/5 Like I said earlier, Myung uses a chapman stick on this song. It's a great way to open an album<br /><br />2. You Not Me  - 4/5 While lacking in the lyrical department, it's a good song.<br /><br />3. Peruvian Skies - 5/5 Great song, nice intro.<br /><br />4. Hollow Years - 5/5<br /><br />5. Burning My Soul - 5/5 Great music, but the lyrics aren't so good.<br /><br />6. Hell's Kitchen - 5/5 Nice intrumental.<br /><br />7. Lines in the Sand - 5/5 Second longest song. This is a great almost epic.<br /><br />8. Take Away My Pain - 6/5 Second best on the album.<br /><br />9. Just Let Me Breathe - 5/5<br /><br />10. Anna Lee - 5/5 Nice acoustics.<br /><br />11. Trial of Tears - 5555555555555555555555555/5 My favorite song on the album!!!! I love the bass in this song.<br /><br />So there you go. One of the most underrated albums of all time. Still, Dream Theater is my favorite band, they always will be. If you're a fan of DT circa Images & Words and/or Awake, you'll be disappointed. If you're a true DT fan, you can't go wrong here.
0765301598|3.0|I reviewed the first book in this series and really pounded it!  The second wasn't really any better.<br /><br />This book was actually bearable though!  Don't get me wrong, this is no Frank Herbert.  The characters aren't developed nearly to the degree his father did but there has been some growth noticible.  Erasmus actually developed by the end of this book.  If anything I would say Erasmus is the only character to have had significant growth at all in the entire series.  As evil as he could be I was actually concerned when it appeared his end was near.  Most of the other characters were still pretty wooden.<br /><br />The danger of unchecked hipocritical extremist religion is also accurately portrayed, and how it can brush asiide all reason and social order.  The Cult of Serena was well handled by the authors.<br /><br />The depiction of the duplicitous natures of politicians and religious leaders was well described.  It was also interesting to see how these leaders became what they were.  Truly power corrupts.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that Abulurd Harkonnen would have done what he did, but somehow the fued needed to start.  This could have been done better and more believably.  After seeing 2/3 of the human population eliminated by the machines I doubt he would have hesitated at sacraficing 2 million slaves to forever eliminate the threat of Omnius.<br /><br />Omnius will be back in the end, that seems clear.  The Thinking Machines are chasing the Honored Matres, or at least that is what happears to be implied by the end of this book and the end of the original series.  The method by which Omnius saved itself was pretty good.  I wonder though if that was really Frank Herbert's intent...<br /><br />Too many things were tied up with a neat bow by the end of the book.  The formation of the Guild, Mentats, Bene Gesserit, etc.  Not everything from the original series needed to be esatblished in the course of the 100 years coverred in this series.<br /><br />Overall the book and its writing is an improvement on the previous ones.  It is passable sci-fi and makes attempts to cover the deeper issues of the originals.  In that it is lacking, but judged on its own it was a good read.

B000002H97|5.0|This is probably my second favourite Metallica album (right behind Puppets). People acused them of \\"selling out\\", and I agree somewhat, they changed their style in order to make more mainstream music. But no one ever said this CD isn't metal. Songs like \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" or \\"Of Wolf And Man\\" wouldn't look out of place on earlier albums. The stuff here is still heavy and fast. This is still Metallica, its just toned down.  <br /> <br />But, \\"toned down\\" doesn't have anything whatsoever to do with how good the album is. Just look at the average user rating for this album. Is is a FANTASTIC album. IMO, it's better than Justice and Kill 'Em All (can't say its better than Ride, though) because EVERY song on this album is in its place and EVERY song is great. Metallica wrote ballads for then first time, but they are amazing heavy metal ballads that are among the best Metallica songs every. The Unforgiven is one of my favourite songs (not just from Metallica) of all time. Its a great ballad, but its not a slow love song, its a dark, heavy song. <br /> <br />Metallica are still Metallica on Metallica (*head spins*). This is still metal, and great metal at that. Load and Reload are the sellout albums. They're not metal, they bluesy alternative rock, but that said - they're still good albums. The metal fans that go \\"I hate my parents, I'm a sucicidal rebellious metal fan\\" say that this (and Load and Reload) are bad albums. I like all sorts of music, and I rekon that these \\"sellout\\" albums are \\"sellout\\" albums, but they're still good albums. That said, Load and Reload aren't my favourite Metallica albums, they're my least favourite (but way above St. Anger which is the worst album of all time). <br /> <br />I highly recommend buying this album, it's fantastic.

B00003CXA4|5.0|GANDHI is Sir Richard Attenborough's magnificent film biography of the incomparable Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who led India to independence in the first half of the twentieth century by employing Satyagraha (\\"truth-force\\") against the entrenched British colonial administration.<br /><br />Attenborough worked for twenty years to create this wonderful labor of love, which is David Lean-esque in scope and storyline and cinematography. Lean himself was inspired to craft several scenes of A PASSAGE TO INDIA, his 1984 swan song, upon Attenborough's work. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it is hard to say which director flatters which.<br /><br />GANDHI is so painfully close to being perfect that its imperfections loom larger than they are. By and large, these imperfections come about because of the vast sweep of this more than three hour film. Gandhi's entire adult life, from his time as a young, undistinguished barrister in South Africa to his death at the hands of Hindu extremists in his 79th year, is the subject of this film.<br /><br />As a result of embracing nearly six decades in some 200 minutes, the film tends toward the episodic. Many important personages and occurrences in the Mahatma's life are glimpsed in passing and are not deeply explored. For example, his very close lifelong friend and unswerving supporter, Hermann Kallenbach, a German Jew who later became a Zionist and a supporter of rapproachment between Jews and Arabs, appears in a few cameo scenes with only limited, largely meaningless dialogue. Gandhi's philosophy, an important element since it was so central to the man, his worldview, and his accomplishments, is spoon fed to us piecemeal and incompletely. We do, however, watch Gandhi evolving from a dapper, young, easily offended, even explosive, barrister to a wise elder who chose to live plainly in honor of the ideas he served.<br /><br />The nature of \\"non-violence\\" is such that no language has an independent term for it.  The Hindi term \\"ahimsa\\" means \\"(a) not (himsa) harming.\\" It is always defined in the negative, an indication of how rarified the concept is. There have been many nonviolent movements throughout history. Gandhi's was the first modern one, able to benefit from recording media and journalistic coverage. Martin Sheen plays \\"Walker\\" a composite character who reports on Gandhi over the years.<br /><br />The \\"Extras\\" disc has several historical newsreels of Gandhi addressing himself to the issues of his day. Also extremely interesting is Attenborough's Director's Commentary, which exposes the underpinnings of this project and Gandhi's profound effect on the man who made this picture.<br /><br />The irony of Nonviolence, of course, is that the targets of Nonviolence often respond violently---even to the point of irrationality---to its application, as the British often did. Daniel Day-Lewis in his first role, plays a South African street tough who threatens Gandhi. Edward Fox portrays General Dyer, who committed the terrible Amritsar Massacre upon a group of Indians peaceably listening to a Gandhian speaker. Dyer's intent, \\"to inflict a lesson that would be felt across the length and breadth of India\\" did just that; it ultimately turned Gandhi from a supporter of Home Rule into a supporter of Independence.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley (in his first major role) is nothing short of spectacular in the part of the Mahatma, slowly evolving his philosophy of non-violent non-cooperation with evil over decades, and bringing this incredible moral power to bear not only against the British, but against those Hindus and Muslims who would see India riven into two. Gandhi's campaign of nonviolence and fasting is well-known, but less well-known is his failed attempt to keep \\"Mother India\\" united in an atmosphere of universal respect.<br /><br />This is a Himalayan film about a truly Himalayan human being. This world would be far more sane if we all could adopt even a modicum of Gandhi's way.harming.\\" It is always defined in the negative, an indication of how rarified the concept is.

B000008M54|1.0|There's probably a fisherman in here somewhere, but somebody forgot to put in the blues.  I bought this album expecting to hear some good gut-bucket blues.  You know, searing guitar solos, distorted harmonica, twelve bars etc.  Instead I get some gaelic wimp whining about the ocean.  Newsflash: Its a bunch of saltwater with seaweed in it.<br /><br />Instead of this, why not check out a real blues album.  I would start with Muddy Waters' Hard Again.
0393057658|4.0|As a huge baseball fan and also a \\"stathead\\" (i.e. a baseball statistics geek), I read this book two years ago, when it first came out. In general, Michael Lewis is a tremendous writer with the ability to explain complicated ideas in a straightforward manner. In Moneyball, his writing shines with the underdog portrayal of the Oakland A's, the comeback story of Billy Beane (from failed prospect to successful GM) and the inspiring tales of Scott Hatteberg and Jeremy Brown.     Yes, hindsight is 20/20 and the A's are struggling this year with a miserable offense, but we have arrived at the point where we can take a critical look at what's become known as the \\"Moneyball draft,\\" a keystone event in the book. For the 2002 draft, Beane decided to go with the numbers over the scouts and the A's had 7 first-round picks. Of these picks, two (Nick Swisher and Joe Blanton) are now playing with the major league club; a third (Mark Teahen) served as trade bait. The others are yet to make an impact; and remember that the A's emphasize college picks, so the players from that draft are in their mid-20s now.     Is it pure coincidence that Swisher and Blanton were the two A's picks that, according to the traditional scouts' consensus, were legitimate first-round picks? This gets at what's come to bug me about Moneyball. Instead of synthesizing the best of traditional scouting and statistical analysis, Lewis attempts to replace one dogma with another. As any good statistician knows, a blind faith to statistics can lead to serious problems. At times, the talented high-school shortstop may be the best pick available, or the bunt may be the most appropriate strategy.     Let me conclude with a baseball tale of my own. Twenty-three years ago, a young shortstop from the Dominican Republic came up to the majors. He had tremendous raw talent with good speed and a decent bat, but a terrible on-base percentage in the low .300s. Today's Oakland A's under Beane would never consider acquiring someone like him, based on their philosophy that plate discipline can't be learned. Yet, over time, this player's walk totals started to rise, from 32 to 56 to 66 to 82. His plate discipline improved so much that even as some of his skills declined in old age, his ability to get on base made him a valuable bat in the lineup. Twenty-three years later, he's still playing today- at age 45. His name is Julio Franco.
0975991477|5.0|Just ignore any negative comments and read this for yourself. It is definitely worth your time and money, even if you should (and I doubt you will) decide you don't find it fascinating. His step by step word pictures of his road to these discoveries are amazing, and he didn't get there by belief, but by testing and retesting theories he just couldn't ignore. He was as skeptical as any mainstream scientist could be - but he was willing to be honest and report what he found - and continue to follow up on his discoveries. You may find yourself with a new perspective about a number of things! That's worth a lot. If you really pay attention, what is described in this book could make your life better and more satifying - for yourself and for those around you.
B000062XGF|5.0|I can sum it all up in one sentence: Nobody's as good as Catherine Zeta-Jones!!! <BR>But the movie itself is awesome! A lot of good plot twists and entertaining action throughout. Definately a movie you can watch more than once and still be entertained by (trust me, I know first hand!).
B00005JNQA|4.0|It is a worthwhile way to spend an evening.<br /><br />There is a plot, there is character development, there is suspense. Then there is New York City, swooping helicopter panoramic scenes of the UN complex along the river, and there are subdued scenes inside those buildings, from metal detectors to removing a cut circle of class from an enormous window. N.Kidman is dressed down the whole movie, in only a few places can her natural beauty shine through the fruminess, S.Pean is older, more chiseled face then i remember, the other cop a lady is entirely forgetable.<br /><br />Everything is sacrificed to the continuity and slow step by step incrementalness of the action. You are aware that some details are left out so that you really know more than you think you do, that information is flowing from several directions at varying speeds, all designed to suck you up into the action and make you only aware of it. This makes the director and the writers key, and they are good, the plot doesn't lack for believability (looks like it is about Mugabe and Zimbabwe), casting such a blonde pale  thin woman like Kidman as an African is excellent, the plot is sharpened and the irony heightened vs using a black women in the part. i'm sure it was controversial, it was a good choice.<br /><br />You can think about the politics, about the brutality of black on black violence that has been the news in Africa for 75(?) years but the movie doesn't push it, nor does it preach strongly, it uses it. What it ends up with, in contrast to where the action takes place (the UN) is a mild this is a human problem that needs to be solved by all of humanity, not a black African one. The street scenes of NYCity add to the conviction that different people can live together, maybe, kindof, well hopefully.<br /><br />I liked the movie, i didn't have the usual nagging regrets, it completely pulled me into it, the only problem is that S.Penn has such a history and such a past profile that i was never quite able to forgot that it was an actor playing a part.<br /><br />I would have appreciated more African music in the background, the end was spectacular and i wanted more. I would have appreciated more early information about who the two men where in the beginning but i realize now that it was a deliberate technic to heighten the suspensionable to forgot that it was an actor playing a part. <br /> <br />I would have appreciated more African music in the background, the end was spectacular and i wanted more.

6304698623|4.0|I've been reading over these reviews and was surprised nobody has noted the film's overt theme of female empowerment buried within Sara's message of \\"all girls are princesses.\\" The plot of the movie is not new -- riches to rags to riches again. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and writers Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler, however, infuse this traditional story with an overlay of female bonding that pushes Frances Burnett's message further than it could have gone in her day.<br /><br />This Little Princess for our time is as plucky as Buffy the Vampire Slayer without losing Shirley Temple's innocence. Burnett had the right idea but was restrained to the values of her day. Act like a princess and you will be one. Cuar&oacute;n must have had a strong mother or sister because his heroine shows her \\"princessness\\" with strength, honor and courage.<br /><br />And all little girls are born possessing just that.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I have read the graphic novels ''Hard goodbyes'',''A dame to kill for'',and ''The big fat kill'',and sure,the last one was the best comic I have ever read(and I'm a comic collector,so imagine),but I never expected this...I mean,this was just too good to be true.  When I saw the trailer,I thought Robert Rodriguez wouldn't do much to the film,since this is a straight adaptation from the comics.I sure was wrong.Robert's genuine raises this film into the highest level it could go.The scene directed by Quentin Tarantino isn't as violent as I expected(which I believe that it's a good thing),and surely not as other scenes in the film.Yes,the violence gets kinda freaky at some points,but never over the edge.  And the characters?Man,what a bunch of wonderfull characters!Marv is a good guy in a sinfull city,making his beast come out of him,but only on the bad guys.Never on the good guys.Esspecialy the ladys.Kevin is a phycopath,who only recognises one man as a friend,as a guide.All the others...he just wants to eat them.Justifying his terrible acts with the connection that he supposedly gets from God,he has no guilt for his victims.Dwight is also a good guy,trying to protect the girls of Sin City.A good guy who starts getting mad because of the sin all around him.Gayle,although she may seem like a woman full of anger,is really keeping this anger for the protection of the other girls.Overall,she would sacrifice herself for them.Jackie Boy is a typical hypocrite,doing some really bad things,and then telling himself that he's a good guy.Hartigan is the most innocent of all the men in the film,a man with honour and umbelievable self-sacrifice.Nancy is the most innocent girl in the film,a person that sees Hartigan as a father and a lover figure at the same time.  All those characters make the best film that I have ever seen 'till now.A comic book on screen.A film-noir to beat all other films.A legend.You will all recognise your character in Sin City.Your character might be Hartigan,might be Dwight,might be Nancy,Marv,Jackie Boy,heck,it might as well be Kevin!But you will find yourself.Because,as Marv greatly puts it:''Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything''.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Not that this needs another review, but...a lot of funny stuff here that would have been great at an R-rated level of grossness. The filmmakers could use a trusted friend who can say to them, uh, guys? This could still be funny and even a lot funnier (and to more people) if you'd just show an eensy-weensy bit of restraint. [...] It was a lot more than I needed to see. Similarly, the incessant F-bombs wear you out eventually. This is too bad because some of this stuff is hilarious, like the opening scene in which Team America \\"saves\\" Paris while destroying the Louvre and the Eiffel tower in the process, and the scene in which Kim Jong Il captures arms inspector \\"Hans Brix.\\" Although it's \\"ronery\\" at the top, as Kim points out, this film spends a little too much time in search of the bottom, and then digging deeper when it gets there.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've known about Muse for about a year now probably. A friend of mine in England told me to check them out and their sound was just amazing. I loved every song i heard from them but, like many other lazy people, I never bought the cd. Well, once they became popular in the US I decided to finally buy this album along with Origin of Symmetry(damn import cost more than I expected though.) <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite cds that I own. Great vocals, bass, guitars, everything. I just love the whole sound they create. I'm not much of a fan of Radiohead, like some of their songs but not much, so I don't know much about their similarities but I must say this surpasses everything I have heard from Radiohead. Actually it surpasses pretty much every rock band you hear on the radio today. However, I rated this 5 stars, but really it only deserves 4 1/2. I can't give this the same rating as Origin of Symmetry since I think OoS is even better. Next I'll probably check out Showbiz just to find listen to their first album.
0060925000|5.0|Although this book is almost 1350 pages long, it is an excellent story. Having the family tree included with the books is extremely helpful in remembering who is related to who and how they are related. Those from an Indian background will be able to relate to many things in this book. <br /> <br />The only negative thing about this book is I didn't like the political descriptions. The story itself is excellent and I can only hope one day it will be made into a movie. Though it's very long, it's one of my favorite books.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Ok, I bought this right after I'd bought Absolution. I'd known about this album but was put off by the fact that it was an import and therefore a bit pricey. Boy, I wish I hadn't done that. This is probably my favorite cd that I own, followed by Absolution and Clutch's self-titled cd. Seriously, it's just too much for words. It's perfect in my mind. I'm not sure there's ANYTHING you could add that would make it better. I hope to see a fourth album soon.
2266144340|3.0|This book is actually not too bad, anyone who really thinks it is blasphemous must really be a curtain twitcher with nothing else to do, probably the same people who picketed Mel 'Jesus Is My Homeboy' Gibson's Passion of The Christ when it was released.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code, reads like a bad episode of Knight Rider. The characters have no depth and are as stiff as an old gate, even when you solve the puzzle half way through you want to continue, as it is a real page turner, and also to prove yourself right.<br /><br />If you have a few hours to kill at say, an airport, or a beach this is a cracking read. If you are looking for an innovative, outstanding peice of literature, then please do not read this. It is a fun, fast paced book and best not to take it too seriously.<br /><br />It gets three stars as it has a good storyline, albeit let down by characterisation. Not great, but not particularly bad either.<br /><br />Go on, its worth a read.
0385334206|1.0|I guess this is why I am not a book critic, but \\"lucid\\" and \\"slippery?\\"  I'm sorry but that doesn't mean a thing to me, especially in the context of this book.  Pretentious comes to mind.  Vonnegut trying so hard to be a literary genius that he goes the way of Pulp Fiction or Naked Lunch and just tries to make sure it doesn't quite make sense or have a point.  Not impressed.  For context, I love the books Ishmael, The Fountainhead, The Wheel of Time, Venus in Furs, The God of Small Things...

B0007YMUZW|3.0|I just purchased the Ryan Adams & The Cardinals CD Cold Roses so I have only heard it through a few times but I'll agree with other reviewers that he might have finally found his style. Admittedly I haven't heard his previous album[s] so I can't relate this to that. After so many disappointing releases I just gave up on him. My feeling was sure he's a fresh breeze but he just won't settle on a style. So after ranging around for years he has finally struck a style and voice, although at times still borrowed, that seem to fit him.<br />I hate to review anyone by saying he sounds like someone else but that's just what I'm going to do-he sounds like, this time, The Grateful Dead and a bit of Gram Parsons. Well a correction he doesn't sound like Gram rather he reminds me of Gram stylistically.<br />Both he and Gram weren't strictly country but they certainly had/have a major country influence. Gram wasn't shy about letting folks hear and see that side but that didn't seem to be the case with Ryan.<br />His first few solo outings went from Rock to Folk to Country and back and forth, but now he has found a way to put all those  styles into this one basket.<br />On some songs (but certainly not all) the writing style is familiar in  its Grateful Deadish sound. Speaking of borrowed styles there even seemed to be be a bit of Neil Young style guitar playing that snuck in there on one tune. At no time in Ryan's past has he picked from anything but great styles to borrow from. (I have always contended that if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best.)<br />The recording is rather odd at times although well done. I can hear the very crisp and cleanly recorded guitars right up front with the vocals, but the drums have a very deep room sound. At first, this sound was difficult for me to listen to but it grew on me as the album did. The piano is well enough recorded with a mid room tone which is not disturbing at all to me (its not quite as deep as the drums yet noticeable.)<br />Almost nobody releases a double album these days-not only is it expensive to put out, but artists don't seem to have enough recorded material at that hand that they feel comfortable releasing. Mostly all Ryan's material sounds good to me, there are almost no throw aways. Scraps and filler material is unhappily in evidence most everywhere these days, which is I guess why those online downloads stores have so many \\"Extra\\" releases from a band. I guess it's only good marketing but...releases a double album these days-not only is it expensive to put out, but artists don't seem to have enough recorded material at that hand that they feel comfortable releasing.

B0006L16N8|2.0|I don't understand how people are so appreciative of mediocre songs that don't have a catch, and sound exactly alike. Chris sounds the same on every album, the music is the same. These songs could have been in any of their albums. This stuff is HIGHLY COMMERCIAL, riding on the same feeling that made people buy 'Parachutes'. They will never top that record if they keep recycling their music. Meanwhile, they think they're making the next 'Dark Side' or 'Computer'. Just look at the album artwork. These guys are full of themselves. Disgusting.
B00004XPPB|5.0|What?  No Oscar?  That was my reaction the first time I watched DONNIE BRASCO, a gritty true story about FBI agent Joe Pistone, who infiltrated the New York mafia, at the risk of his life and his family.  Johnny Depp gives a top performance in the title role as Pistone assumes the identity of Donny Brasco, a jewel broker who spends two years workingn his way into the confidence of Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino.)<br /><br />The best overall strength of this fine film is it's honesty in de-glamorizing mob life and showing the wise guys as struggling to earn, not having a fun-fun-fun crime spree.  Brutal murders and the equally brutal economy of late 70's NYC seem to compliment each other.<br /><br />BRASCO also has a touching soundtrack and interesting cinematography, which often mimics surveillance camera work.<br /><br />But the best element of this fine film is Al Pacino's role.  He turns Lefty, a mob soldier who has killed over two dozen men, into a rather sad and totally sympathetic character.  You'll quite possibly cry at the end.<br /><br />If you have any interest at all in the mobster flick genre, you must get this opus.  The DVD has some fine extra-- subtitles, deleted scenes, interviews, original trailers, etc.  Do order it!
B00000IAU3|5.0|The first half of Dido's \\"No Angel\\" is exquisite - in sequence, mood, voice, atmosphere, you name it.  The production and writing on songs like \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Hunter\\" and \\"Thank You\\" are stunning, and Dido's voice is smooth, creamy and relaxing - it is like warm nutritious food for these songs - and not a hair too hot or too cold.<br /><br />Tracks 7 - 12, though just as well done, didn't hold my attention nearly as well as the first six, which in my opinion, deserved a much better follow up.  Instead they seemed to water down what could have been released as a great, mood-enhancing EP.<br /><br />Even so, this album remains among my collection of faves.  And Dido's seemingly ego-less attitude is a rarity in the music business... she was lucky to be the target of sampling by Eminem and she knows it.  She talks about it in the press all the time, and for that reason alone my respect for her remains.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Thieves robbing thugs robbing crooks robbing etc. A first robbery and then a member of this first  team robs his team and then the victims of this fink recuperate their gold from him in a spectacular third robbery. From Venice to Los Angeles, from gondolas to cars, from canals to overstuffed streets, etc. The interest is not so much in the action which is simple and well dynamized by a good rhythm. Not so much in the plot and the suspense because we all know from the very start that justice will prevail, I mean that the first robbers will recuperate their gold no matter what. The interest of the film is in the details of the action. It all revolves around the use of hightechnology in city managing (here the traffic and the subway) and in security systems (here safes and the tools to break them without explosives). But once again this does not create any suspense because we know this hightechnology will not fail, except on order and command. The second interest is in the characters. They are simple and their psychologies are also very simple, but less simple than we could have feared. Hence they have some simple depth nearly like real human beings. A father who is absent, a father figure who is looming high and a man who comes into the slot and becomes the absent father who is no father any more but just a plain and desired male lover. This needs two rather good actors to imply and impersonate this situation in simple face expression and body language. The camera does the rest. In other words a good entertaining experience. By the way the fink looks like a fink from the very start : the way he walks, the way he smiles without smiling, etc. But why on earth was he given a slightly mexican or at least latin american look ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0375405380|5.0|this is a rare find! great story, great writing style, structure and plot. almost everything is good. very talented writer. will try to read back of his other two former works right away. thank you sir!<br /><br />as of today in july 2016, i've read it again but in slower spaces. the feeling is still the same, a great novel by a great writer. in lot of parts of this novel, it read more like a non-fiction, but most non-fictions won't be so interesting to read like this novel. all the characters in it are very complicated, they all have their own demons, the toughness and the weakness, especially the obsessions. the writing style is very charming and at the same time very cynical. this is the real-deal of how the ugly americans did to their own people and their neighboring countries in latin america in the name of democracy, anti drug and anti communism. in the end, it's just a big lie to the human civilization and its history.
B000005RQF|5.0|This 1986 release, the band's fourth full-length LP, may be the very best -- or at least \\"most REM-like\\" -- in their catalog. As has been pointed out several times, \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" represented a turning point in REM's sound, pushing both drummer Bill Berry and vocalist Michael Stipe to the front of the mix. The result is a punchier sound that strips away Stipe's mumbling to reveal his impressionistic lyrics. It's not always clear what he's singing about, but at least you don't have to struggle just to decode the words. Though there are moments and songs on \\"Murmer\\" and \\"Reckoning\\" that may supersede anything heard here, the accessibility of Don Gehman's production, and the catchiness of these songs (including Mike Mills' cover of The Clique's 1969 then-obscure \\"Superman\\") make this on of REM's most spinworthy releases.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Simply put, Aliens is one of the best films of any genre to ever be released. I wouldn't go so far as to say it \\"far surpassed\\" the original, but it is certainly a worthy successor to the sci-fi/horror classic. Under a new director, it is far more action-packed than its predeccessor, discarding the long, agonizing tension and fear of the unknown in favor of frenetic combat. Here, the lone alien is replaced by an entire hive of the creatures, including a massive, awe-inspiring Queen. The characters are still both lovable and believable, and Ripley, the series' heroine, gains a whole new, interesting dimension with the film's examination of her maternal instincts.  <br /> <br />This is the point where many fans consider the series to have officially ended. I believe that Alien 3 is also a worthy title, but I will agree that Resurrection should never have been given the green light. In any case, Alien and Aliens are by far the best of the Alien saga. <br /> <br />Aliens is a must-see for fans of action, horror, science fiction, or movies in general.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|I don't usually review films that I only saw by chance and then didn't like, but I'm making an exception here, as \\"Bridget Jones  - The Edge of Reason\\" is a true disaster all round. I saw the first movie and found it mildly amusing, so when this turned up I thought I'd give it a go, but I'm sorry I bothered.<br /><br />Basically, the Bridget Jones in this film is a total idiot, who messes up everything in her life including her pride, her love life, and her career. Not in a funny or endearing way, though, which would encourage sympathy. And not in a zany Lucille Ball-type way either, that would get you laughing. No, just in a totally stupid and pointless way that makes you want to hit her. Every embarrassing  faux-pas or misunderstanding the character stumbles through (and there are dozens) just makes you want to switch off and leave her to it. She messes up every single aspect of her relationship, her job, and her holiday by saying and doing the most brainless and unfathomable things, in ways that a real person would never do. Or if they did, they wouldn't have any friends...and certainly not Hugh Grant and Colin Firth fighting over them!<br /><br />Rene Zellweger playes Bridget as a totally unloveable, boring and socially inept loser...I don't think this is the actress's fault, or even due to the original charcter in the Helen Fielding novels, but more due to the terrible script and direction. Why does Bridget walk everwhere like a constipated duck, for example? Why does she laugh and sigh at every stupid blunder she makes, and just waddle on to the next stumbling point? Even when she's lost the love of her life, it's all summed up with a shrug and a rueful smile. Come on, girl, try and make us care! I sure didn't!<br /><br />If that wasn't bad enough, the last third of the movie almost made me shout at the screen...Dopey Bridget is duped into smuggling a massive stash of cocaine out of Thailand, and gets caught trying to board a plane at Bangkok airport. She then gets thrown into a Thai women's prison. This notoriously unpleasant predicament really doesn't belong in a (supposedly) frothy comedy like this is, but it just gets worse, as have-a-go Bridget gets all (and I mean ALL) the inmates on her side which results in a  huge sing-along scene and lots of laughing and hugging. Sorry, I don't think so somehow. This sugar-coated representation of the notoriously brutal Thai prison regime left a nasty taste in my mouth...not alleviated in the slightest when Bridget gets an anticipated (but blatently unlikely) full pardon and early release, just because her lawyer boyfriend pulls the right strings.<br /><br />The above illustration is the worst example, but I didn't find any of Bridgets other antics entertaining or affecting in the slightest either. She's somehow got a high profile TV reporters job, but she can't even do it. Everyone makes jokes about her weight and she just thinks it's funny. With a central and supporting cast of usually reliable performers, it's tragic how lame this film has turned out. There's nothing apparent to make you understand or care about any of the lead characters actions. And that means a waste of 90 minutes in my book. Make better use of your time and give this one a miss.She then gets thrown into a Thai women's prison.

B00003CXA4|3.0|Richard Attenborough has made a sort of \\"Lawrence of India\\" for those who know nothing about Mohandas Gandhi and the real life he lived. It's a glancing account, directed with a stately hand, set against the last gasp of the British Raj. Attenborough recounts the religious and political conflicts that preceded and followed it, opening and closing with the assassination of the founder of non-violent civil disobedience.    There's a disclaimer that what we are about to see can't possibly render with any certitude the life of this monumental historical figure, the only statement in it upon which historians and audiences might readily agree. The Mahatma gets lost in the Hollywood history lesson, which nonetheless may hold your interest much as a cobra might coiling up from a basket. David Lean, who directed truly great epics and was alive at the time, doubtless felt the snake had struck.    Revisiting this DVD, one also is startled by Muslims chanting \\"Jihad! Jihad!\\" and by the religious intolerance that still kindles India and Pakistan today. It has unknown Indian actors in major roles and uses famous non-Indians in small ones, some of them just bits (the young Daniel Day Lewis). Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley is as good a Gandhi as we're likely to get. But the ersatz epic he's in, which also won an Oscar, is rarely seen today. Too much homework is required of us.
B000002H97|2.0|Wow, Metallica really hit rock bottom with this one. No wonder it bombed on the charts. Grant it, it's better than everything they made before it (Master Of Puppets is their worst), but that doesn't merit any respect. Enter Sandman is a pretty good tune, and Sad But True is ok, but it all falls apart after that. The guitar work is simply nueasiating. Check out Megadeath for some true music. If you want a better Metallica album, check out Garage Inc. It's sad, but they're only good when they play other artist's songs.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This movie, like Being John Malkovich, does a good job of bringing surrealistic and experimental elements into a \\"mainstream\\" setting.  Before I realized that this movie shared directors with Being John Malkovich, I found a number of similarities and started to place it within the modern surrealistic framework.  However, if you found the latter movie interesting but a bit too esoteric, the somewhat tamer Eternal Sunshine may be a better choice.  I would say that it is a mixture of Being, Serendipity, and Weird Science.<br /><br />Of course, if you are more of a purist, then you may find this one too mainstream.  Personally, I found the ending a bit too neat and predictable and the story a bit too polished.  I really enjoyed certain scenes - great camera work, excellent editing, engaging acting - but these highs made the lows more stark.<br /><br />That being said, this is a fine movie to add to one's collection.  My slight reservations aside, this movie is far forward of much of today's pathetic fare.  There is enough here to excite the eyes and mind without traveling too far into the fringes to alienate most viewers.  Call it an introduction to surrealism, a crossover movie, whatever you wish - ultimately, I think that most viewers will call it an enjoyable and interesting movie.
B0007OASII|5.0|Luckily for us Americans, Kamelot is around to help us have faith in both progressive metal and power metal.  It's amazing to see how diverse metal genres have become, and it is a pure stereotype to believe that metal is about screaming or anything oldschool like Metallica.  Kamelot is one of the better power metal bands that show us that metal is also about art and melody.  This album proves to everyone why nu-metal is inferior in every aspect.
B000002KBU|5.0|`Blue' is Joni Mitchell's fourth album, first released in June, 1971, after the seminal and deservedly famous previous album, `Ladies of the Canyon'. Listening to `Blue' now, after 35 years, I am surprised that there is not a single memorable song on the whole album, compared to the five or more major anthems of the generation on the previous recording.<br /><br />And yet, everything which is so strong and so good about Joni Mitchell's songwriting is on this album, in spades. Contrary to the title's inclination, most of the album seems to be more about times and places than it is about colors or moods.<br /><br />The single strongest aspect of Mitchell's songwriting is her ability to evoke a mood by a great use of little details. Listening to the song `Carey' makes you look forward to spending some time at a place called the Mermaid caf&eacute; on some beach on the Riviera with the warm winds blowing in from Africa, as I contemplate going to Amsterdam or Rome.<br /><br />Blue should not be the first Joni Mitchell album you should buy, but it should be near the top of your list. The album also gives you the sense that you may want to bypass all the `Best of' collections and stick to simply collecting all the original releases, as you really don't want to miss any of Ms. Mitchell's great little three minute dramas.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I haven't heard anything this good since Toxicity.  Though Toxicity is their best album, this album is easily their second best album.  The songs on here are great.  B.Y.O.B. is my favorite on this album.  Sad Statue and Revenga are other great songs.  I think Cigaro is one of their funnyest song.  At first when I heard this song I couldn't believe what they had just said.  But after a few more listens i got used to this song and thought it was very funny everytime.  I love how SOAD makes every song on each album count.  Out of all the SOAD albums before this one there aren't really any bad songs.  This album is no different all the songs are great.  This is highly recommended.  Buy this album.
B00007FOMP|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever composed!  It's more than words to a beat. There is a message here, one of peace and love.  \\"Flying High in the Friendly Sky\\" is probably one of the most underrated R&B songs ever made.  \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" is perfection!  Marvin Gaye is the king of R&B now and forever.
B0008GNJZY|1.0|Wow, this movie was really going places.  I loved how Carter comes to be quite the hero in this flick.  It shows that there are more important things than our temporary activities.  It proves that one really needs to sort out what they need to do and take care of everything so they can make something of oneself -- So sad to say...  This really had it going on until our little side plot lovebird discovers his girlfriend has gotten rid of her child.  The reason why is because supposedly she learned how to deal with life and did what she needed to do to get on the right track.  So isn't that wonderful...  we learn that abortion is ok!!!  I'm sorry, this was a fantastic movie but that totally ruined it!  Promoting such a thing is horrible.  Especially since we see how influential media and other are on our society.  If that part were taken out this would be a 5 star rating.  A great moral was given, but one major wrong was impressed on viewers.  And just like the coach said, if one person fails the team fails.  This movie failed because one wrong was done.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|(4 & 1/2 stars) When I first found out that the Foo Fighters had a new CD coming out, I was so excited. Now that I've listened to In Your Honor and I've got a good feel for it, I have to say I'm really pleased with it. Some may think that the acoustic CD hinders the Foo Fighters that we're familiar with, but I think it shows their growth. You can't hold it against them for wanting to experiment a bit (with songs like, \\"Virginia Moon\\" for example.) Both CDs bring great aspects to the table and it's cool to have both the rock and the chill sound together. My personal favorites from the first CD are: \\"The Best of You\\", \\"End Over End\\", \\"DOA\\", \\"Resolve\\", and \\"No Way Back\\". As for the second CD, I was immediately drawn to \\"Another Round\\". I love the Harmonica solo; it has this wonderful reminiscant feel to it. Also, \\"Miracle\\", \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\", \\"Still\\", \\"On the Mend\\", and \\"Razor\\" are all awesome. There are a few songs I could live without, but all in all, a great CD to have in your collection; I'm so happy with my purchase.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|If you haven't bought it yet, run, don't walk to the store and get it. Prepare for a very similar experience to the last album. In fact, I find myself expecting to hear &quot;clocks&quot; start after the first bar or so of a couple of the songs, but that's OK. It's really that good.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Ever since Blue Velvet, not to mention Twin Peaks, David Lynch has been famous for the impenetrability of his films. I've seen them all, over the years, and this time Lynch out-Lynches himself. There are some great dreamlike scenes here -- especially the sequence in the Club Silencio -- and some great, eccentric characters, but as a total film, I never did figure out what in the hell was going on. Are Betty and Diane the same person? Or just the same actress? Or is Betty actually Diane's dream-version of herself? Ditto Rita and Camilla? Is Aunt Ruth actually alive or actually dead? Who is the guy who faints dead away in the alley? What's with the locked blue box? And the homeless guy? *sigh* Maybe I've just reached the limits of my patience with abstract film, but this one is too much for me. My wife doesn't like Lynch and wouldn't watch this with me, so maybe I just need someone to discuss it with. Or maybe Lynch has simply, finally, stepped off the edge.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I sat down the other day to listen to this album straight through.  I wasn't a Coldplay fan...I like Classic Rock and maybe some Red Hot Chili Peppers (sometimes).  But this album is fantastic.  Please don't pay attention to what some of the other reviewers on this site are saying about the album.  In my opinion, I think people were expecting a Coldplay ablum like Parachutes and Rush of Blood...so they probably think the CD sucks just because it doens't sound like the others. But I say why should the band continue to play the same style over and over again.  It's obvious Coldplay is trying to re-invent themseleves here, and for me it definitely worked.  I was thoroughly moved by listening to the album even though I hardly listen to Coldplay or respected their music before a few days ago.  If the album had sucked I probably would have blamed it on Gwenyth, but I feel like Coldplay has MASTERED the studio album with this latest release.  It's perfect.
B00023B1LC|1.0|Matt Damon is terrible. The cinematography is awful. The graphics are cheap. It's basically a movie version of CSI with a few more fight scenes.  <br />Terrible.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera is my all time favorite band. I've had the pleasure of seeing them twice (on their last U.S. tour actually) and they are simply amazing. So to say that my heart was broken when Dimebag died would be an understatement. A piece of heavy metal died that night because DIME AND PANTERA ARE F---ING HEAVY METAL! <br /> <br />With that being said, let's get to the review. This is Pantera in their raw and early stages. CFH certainly isn't my fav (it's a tossup between Far Beyond Driven and Great Southern Trendkill), but it's still a great album in it's own right. Straight-up, pure metal. This album, imo, also has Dime's best guitar work. From the extremely-catchy title track, to the thrashing \\"Hersey\\" and \\"Domination\\", to my fav. Pantera song, \\"Cemetary Gates\\", Dime's unique shredding and guitar playing is showcased best on Cowboys From Hell. I'd say, pick this up to hear some classic Pantera, but they certainly progressed through the years. RIP DIME 1966-2004
0141439807|4.0|Jane Austen's Mansfield Park is more Dickensian than her other novels. Our herione, Fanny Price, is treated abyssmally by her adoptive family, especially her horrible Aunt Mrs Norris. But, being an Austen herione, she is plucky and lives to have all her dreams of marriage come true. My only complaint is with how horribly pious and self-righteous Fanny is. The other characters are alive with complexities....Fanny, however, is portrayed as saintly.
B00006IUL7|4.0|In Halibut, Alaska, the Sun doesn't' come down at nights. During the summer, its light illuminates for 24 hours and those who are not used to live such a bizarre situation, can develop a real bad case of sleeplessness.<br /><br />Inspector Will Dormer is just one of them.<br /><br />Just arrived from L.A., the detective has been called to this fishing town to resolve a terrible crime. Alongside his partner Eckhart and the local rookie Ellie Burr, Dormer has to uncover the identity of a 17 year old girl's killer.<br /><br />A remake of the 1997 Norwegian film, Insomnia offer a detailed look of a cop's mind, whose moral has been corrupted.<br /><br />The lack of sleep works as an explicit metaphor about a human being's incapacity of live with a dirty conscience. The moral debate, the intrigue and tension are elements that help to invigorate the plot. The somber tone of the characters is reflected masterfully with the portrayals of Williams and Pacino.<br /><br />Insomnia lets us see that not everything in life is black and white. Our experiences, generally, are a mix of grays. It also explores the reasons and motives of villains, and the vulnerabilities of heroes.<br /><br />At some point, inspector Dormer defines his position when affirms that \\"his job is to assign guilt\\". To decide whether he should do it by taking a look to the exterior world or to him is the most critic crossroad of this wonderful film.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not \\"stars\\" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking \\"below deck\\" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!<br /><br />I would argue that ALIENS far surpasses its celebrated predecessor in almost every aspect. Obviously the sheer spectacle of what is basically a Vietnam war movie in space is particularly awe-inspiring - the impressive sets, the many excitingly-staged combat sequences, the aliens themselves (interestingly enough, although through fast cutting and appropriate camera placement it seems as though there are hundreds of aliens being blasted to kingdom come - or else picking off the gung-ho marines one by one - in reality no more than 6 aliens are ever seen in any one shot). But the human drama element of this sequel is also greatly heightened, primarily by the introduction of \\"Newt\\" (wonderful little Carrie Henn, in her only film role), who turns out to be the sole survivor of recent events on LV-426, becoming a kind-of surrogate daughter to Ripley, which leads to several touching moments and gives the story a surprisingly effective emotional core in the midst of all the otherwise pre-eminent carnage.<br /><br />The one thing that all fans of the Alien series notice about this movie is the glaring flaw at the very beginning of the film. The egg...how did it get on the Sulaco? An easy answer is the queen, but most people consider that impossible and refuse to accept it as an explanation. So here is my explanation (like it or not, I really don't care...I'm just doing this for fun): While Ripley was rescuing Newt, before Bishop started circling (you'll remember at the end of Aliens she thought he left her, when in fact he was circling because the platform became shaky and unstable), an alien sneaked onto the rescue ship with two eggs (yes, two, despite the fact that only one was shown at the beginning of Alien³, which explains how the face-hugger got two beings--two different eggs mean two different face-huggers), hid them, and immediately left the ship. Soon after, the eggs open and the face-huggers leave the rescue ship and search the Sulaco until they find the sleeping survivors. And there you have it, my simple explanation. Point is, they never explain to you what happened, so you have to use your imagination. And if you can get over the flawed beginning, it's actually a pretty good film. It's too bad about the scenes that were reportedly cut (see \\"alternate versions\\") though. They would have made a good movie great. Overall, not as good as its predecessors, but definitely worthy of being the third (and what should have been the final) chapter in the Alien series.<br /><br />Alien: Resurrection is the long awaited fourth instalment in the Alien series. Alien3, Alien: Resurrection's predecessor didn't do too well with the critics. And neither did this movie. But, in fact, I liked it. The script may be clunky at times but still planned well by writer Joss Whedon and the feeling of total unrealistic cheese is there sometimes, unlike the first two Alien movies where it really felt like it was happening. But, Alien: Resurrection is so irresistibly entertaining and full of energy that you can't really dislike it too much. It's entertaining, loud and unashamed of what it is - a good piece of Friday night entertainment. The atmosphere is incredibly tense and the characters all bring up plenty of surprises. Even if the performances aren't perfect and the story isn't oh-so-original, there is a thrilling underwater chase through a kitchen and some awesome alien effects and make-up, which make the movie cool enough for me to watch twice! Put together on an impressive DVD box set, this is essential science fiction entertainment.never explain to you what happened, so you have to use your imagination.

B00003CY6M|3.0|Sometimes, destiny creates accidents. We called them signs. Other times, those signs can bring us true love.<br /><br />Such an ultra romantic idea is the base of the film Serendipity, a tender fable that pays homage to New York as the city of romance and puts destiny in Cupid's role.<br /><br />John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are Johnathan and Sara, two strangers that meet in Bloomingdale's, in the midst of Christmas shopping. They like each other instantly and, after spending the night together, Sara is convinced that, if she and Jonathan are meant for each other, destiny will find a way to unite them again.<br /><br />The years go by and the couple goes separate ways. Just about to get married with different people, the signs appear again and both John and Sara keep thinking about the other one and the fact that they could be soul mates.<br /><br />A charming premise, although completely unrealistic, Serendipity takes us for a road full of incidents, magical coincidences, races against time and a complete faith in the triumph of love.<br /><br />Cleverly written, well acted and displaying beautiful NY sights, this is a very bubbly and sweet movie. For happy endings fans, it will be an obligation to see it. For the rest of us cynics, it will be a waste of time.

B0009MAP9A|4.0|Despite what you might hear from other reviewers, this album still touches on issues that rule the day even now.  The title track is easy to cite, but it really is on tracks like \\"With God On Our Side\\" and \\"Hattie Carroll\\" that time vindicates best.  For all the countlesss albums made by others that were specifically designed to make a strong political statement, none were able to distill the transient issues of the time into bigger principles, and to tie them to basic human issues like this.  Racism, political inertia, the economic struggles of the working class are all presented here in stories of their time, but not done in such a way as to be dated by them.  It should be recalled that Dylan did his political stuff in the early sixties; several years before the nation went that way en masse.  By the time the country became overtly politically charged, Dylan had long moved on, and was singing about Country Pie.  To accuse him of milking a trend is a joke.  If anything, he was criticized for not jumping back in when the country caught up with him. <br /> <br />The timeless themes here are not just a function of the subject matter, but also a function of the fact that Dylan always tried to use time-tested musical forms to tell the story...the folk songs of Ireland, the blues of the American south, even some of the free-form improv stuff of jazz.  He was a student of all types of folk music, and this album shows how astute his observations were.  He wanted his musical language to borrow from that which was proven by history, and he did it as well on this album as any. <br /> <br />I also want to suggest this album foreshadows the focus on personal relationships that would come to dominate the bulk of his career.  \\"Spanish Leather\\" is a story of a love in limbo - and ultimately in vain - that uses universal themes and his unique keen insight on it to great effect.  It's greatness is revealed by the fact that the song takes many many listens to reveal its full scope. <br /> <br />The remaster series, in my opinion, are more for the pleasure of audiophiles.  Dylan - especially in this era - never really spent a ton of time on the details of recording.  His decision to do so never negatively impacted fan's enjoyment of the work.  Adding more clarity to it now will do little to impact it positiively.  Get this CD so that the source will be as loud in your headphones as the other re-issues.  That seems to be the best reason to get it. <br /> <br />New Dylan fans should pick this up with Freewheelin' to get the \\"protest\\" era's best stuff.  After that, you will find his genius focused upon interpersonal relations, and he never really returns to the political with this intensity.  It is important if only for that.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie proves that not all superhero movies are good movies.  Other superhero movies usually something in common with the comic book they were in.  The Hulk does not do this.  Bruce Banner isn't the Hulk because his father did weird stuff to his mother.  And CGI Hulk was questionable.  They just couldn't make a suit that looked a hundred times better than CGI (see \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" ).<br /><br />  This is perhaps the worst superhero movie of all time.
B000957O82|4.0|I expected a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. Glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!<br /><br />The movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his never ending charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes...well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.<br /><br />What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. He just was!! The \\"date doctor\\" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top.<br /><br />The funny parts are hilarious...and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.<br /><br />I totally recommend this movie. And no, it is not a chick flick.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture isn't perfect.  Sure, it has all the cast from the TV Show.  Sure, there are action scenes (albeit a few).  But, the first of the Trek movies isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong.  I think the cast did a pretty good job.  It's the story that is boring.  Not to mention that 10-minute blackness of music at the beginning..I found that boring.  This movie has been a mixed bag for Trekkies.<br /><br />  This movie also stars Stephen Collins from \\"7th Heaven\\".
B000024D4R|5.0|While it is just a small step below Pink Floyd's previous masterpieces Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, Animals is nonetheless worthy of the great praise that it so seldom receives.  Like DSOTM and WYWH, Animals is a concept album, but it is much darker than any other Floyd Album, and beautifully summarizes the social, political, and economic horrors of 20th Century capitalism without seeming at all comtemporary.  Although it is loosely based on George Orwell's Animal Farm, it is still stunningly original and a mindblowing experience from start to finish.  Dogs is one of the greatest Pink Floyd songs ever featuring one of Gilmour's finest solos, and both Pigs and Sheep are infectious rockers that make this album much more aggressive than previous Floyd works.  And although they are easily ignored, Pigs on the Wing Parts 1 and 2 serve as an amazingly simple yet beautiful way for the album to start and end.  Strongly recommended for anyone whose level of thought exceeds MTV and sitcoms and would like to listen to a work of art that will undoubtedly change their life.

0345404475|4.0|I usually leave the Science Fiction reading to my husband, as the complex technical mumbo-jumbo often alienates me, so to speak.  But I've more and more warmed to books with an anti-utopia feel to them.  I started with Orwell's 1984 and stumbled into the world of Phillip K. Dick.  It seems, through PKD, I have found just the right mix of fantasy and philosophy to keep me interested.  This is the kind of Science Fiction novel I would write. <br /> <br />\\"Androids\\" takes place in a not-too-distant future on an earth that is enshrouded in a radioactive cloud following a third and final world war \\"Terminus\\" (you don't need a Latin class to understand what that means).  Most of the people have fled the planet to strke up colonies on other planets, like Mars, and almost all animals have become extinct or so precious that they are bought, traded, auctioned, or financed like rare automobiles or baseball cards.  People who can't afford to purchase a live animal of their own (even spiders are priced at over $100), can purchase a synthetic \\"electric\\" animal that fools no one upon cursory inspection, but don't make much for status symbols.  How ironic that today we view our homes and cars in the same way these characters view animals we slaughter or stamp under our shoes on a daily basis! <br /> <br />In a post-apocalyptic world, people who emmigrate to other planetary colonies get to take with them android servants that have been banned on Earth because of the fear that they could wreak havoc among human civilization (although the fact that they have 4 year lifespans should be enough to alleviate our concerns, but this is never addressed).  So Rick Deckard, our protagonist, is a Bounty Hunter with the charge of tracking down and \\"retiring\\" rogue androids who have escaped the colonies.  They are given polygraph-like tests to determine whether they have the human trait of empathy, which seperates the \\"andys\\" from the human beings. <br /> <br />The novel frequently makes philosophical arguments of what it's like to be human, and how it is possible that our very own creations have the potential to become just like us.  I also couldn't help but observe the fact that if these androids are escaping what they feel is a life of servitude and pain on another planet, then they must also feel empathy in some minute way- empathy for those who suffer far worse hardships.  Otherwise, they would never question their existence and just remain servile drones. <br /> <br />Anyway, there were a few flaws- the dialogue was empty and there was very little suspense.  Events ran smack-dab into one another and hardly allowed enough time for us to grasp one concept before heading into the next.  I also felt the whole \\"religious experience\\" ending was a bit muddled, but it came together perfectly by the end, leaving a feeling that perhaps things will be better for Rick and his wife, even if they still have an electric animal. <br /> <br />While not perfect, \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" has proven a perfect springboard for me to explore more of the Science Fiction world, and my next choice will likely be a Phillip K. Dick novel.
0786856297|5.0|My son who I have to force to read stayed up late two nights in a row to finish this book.  He identified with the hero (because he doesn't like school and has dyslexia--not, I swear, because his father is the Sea god).  This is a great boy book.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of the very best albums ever produced and ever written.<br /><br />I remember in high school when the hardest song I ever listened to was The Beatles' Helter Skelter. I had owned Metallica's black album which was nice to listen to. It wasn't until Master somehow found its way into my hands that I began to understand that metal could be musical. It could be complex, well composed, and interesting to listen to.<br /><br />Since Master, I have broadened my horizons greatly allowing all sorts of different music to come and entertain these ears. However infrequently I listen to Master anymore isn't a result of losing interest in the album. Rather it's because every time I hear it, I get depressed about how bad everything else is. Well, that's a slight exaggeration, but not far from the truth!<br /><br />Master of Puppets is a metamorphic conglomeration of every high-speed riff that actually sounds good, with a younger James's wailing about the horrors of life...I can almost feel the tectonic plates shifting beneath my speakers.<br /><br />What else about this album that's so great? Well, the art packaging inside the book is pretty minimalistic, but the cover of the album is one of the greatest designed covers for any album on earth. Of course Metallica designed it but the illustration was done by Don Brautigem, whose work mainly consists of rather unattractive book covers. Look closely at the left and center crosses: there is a soldier's helmet and dogtags on these crosses, respectively. I love this cover, the dark grasses, the sunset, and those godlike hands controlling all of us.  This album has no fault.<br /><br />A gem of an article can be found by looking up Metallica on Wikipedia.com

B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning -- one of two of the heaviest Tallica albums (the other being Puppets) that has actual influences coming from the bassist, Cliff Burton who was classically trained. In fact, musical theory classes at the University of Colorado analyze For Whom the Bell Tolls. The songs are more classically complex rather than merely utilizing classical chord progressions.<br /><br />This album is 7/8ths perfect: Trapped Under Ice is regarded by the band as filler.  However much I hate to agree, I listen to this album straight through every time.<br /><br />Listening to Ride the Lightning is like taking a weather course.  The band throws you fire, lightning, death, night, ice water, air, earth, and a digression into mythology.  As a whole, Metallica's albums can be classified as chrysology: the study of precious metal.<br /><br />I was in France when I purchased my first Metallica album, in 1991. I almost bought Lightning simply because it had the coolest artwork on the cover, but I ended up going with the Black album (best 149 Francs I ever spent!). I don't think I could've appreciated this album back then as I do now.
B00004Z46W|4.0|To worship at the sonic temple of King Crimson always meant dispensing with preconceived notions, and Fripp and company proved more than ready to lay waste to their more staid contemporaries on this 1973 masterwork.<br /><br />The recording itself, which won technical awards way back in 1973, is clear as bell: every nuance from Jamie Muir's eccentric percussion to John Wetton's vocal growls comes through crisply (no doubt a better vocalist for his going at it with Roger Chapman during his stint in the mighty Family before joining KC.) Bill Bruford obviously loved this band, and unfettered of the art-rock formula that Yes was starting to fall into, he unleashes some powerful drumming that, along with Wetton's meaty bass lines, help hold together this sonic supernova. David Cross sometimes plays against Fripp's leads with great effect, his violin swooping and soaring like a flying prehistoric reptile chasing its next meal.<br /><br />And Fripp, well, praise be to whatever the source of his muse here, for it is both balm to the jaded nerves of those disenfranchised by the corporate takeover of FM radio and anathema to the lobotomized program directors who have laid waste to creative playlists.<br /><br />I'm keeping a star back because the two versions of the title track sometimes veer off so far that the music dissolves into a vapor. Still the explosiveness of Easy Money clears the mind and feeds one's bellicose instincts, while Exiles calms the soul of the wanderer and hermit found somewhere deep down in us all.<br /><br />Like any King Crimson outing, \\"Larks Tongues in Aspic\\" is not everyone's cup of tea, but everyone needs to sample this one as a reminder of the power of imagination fueled by technique.
B000002VBY|5.0|I borrowed this album from a friend, and then bought a copy for myself, and I must say, Krokus is killer. one of my favorite tracks is \\"Screaming In The Night\\" but the whole album is killer. this is a classic album. if you don't have this in your collection, something is wrong with you.

B000002JR8|5.0|In my opinion, this and trendkill are Pantera's two heaviest albums.  I believe that Dimebag is the greatest metal guitarist to ever walk the planet, hands down.  Phil does a great job with the vocals on this album, by far one of his best performances.  Vinnie is nonstop blast and thrash beats throughout the entire cd.  This album showcases the best drumming out of all of Pantera's albums.  I'm a drummer and this guy thrashes on this.  So if you're looking for something brutal as hell, look no further.  This is a kick in the teeth from beginning to end...almost.  The last track, planet caravan, is a change of pace, but a good one.  What do you expect though, it's a trippy black sabbath cover.   It demonstrates the softer side of Pantera.  Phil actually sings on this one and there are only lightly played bongo drums in the background.  Standout tracks for me are as follows: I'm broken, slaughtered, and use your third arm.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves extreme metal.

0375507256|5.0|This book is the best book I've read in the last ten years. The characters seem steeped in tragedy and are insufferably cursed but the thing that holds them together is an energy and hope that outshines all their (or more accurately all civilisation's) misfortune. <br /> <br />READ THIS BOOK!
B000002I25|5.0|I certainly think so. <br /> <br />The Doors has an aura around it. When you listen to it, you are brought back to the days of incense and peppermints and vietnam. Jim Morrison was one of the leading figures psychedelic rock. The best songs are Break On Through, Light My Fire, Twentieth Century Fox, The Crystal Ship, and The End.
B000002LPD|5.0|The stuff presented on For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge isn't as intense as early stuff when Diamond Dave was the frontman. That's alright though, because this is good, solid, straightforward rock as good as you'll ever get. Every track kicks, there is no filler to be found whatsoever. I'll break it down for ya: <br /> <br />Poundcake: Bombastic opener with some very cool lyrics about how free love just doesn't feel quite right, and how the best you can get is from your own girl. It opens with Ed using a drill effect. The wahs at the end are the icing on the cake. <br /> <br />Judgement Day: A real ass kicking, fast paced song. Ed uses a Floyd Rose tremolo-equipped guitar to get some serious whammy action going throughout. The guitar solo is one of the best on this album. <br /> <br />Spanked: This one's a lot slower than the first two songs. That doesn't make it bad though, the real highlights here are Sammy's vocals during the chorus. The words are about the weirdness of dial-up love lines. <br /> <br />Runaround: Very very cool song. Ed plays some really mean guitar on this one, and the backing vocals on the chorus really add to the overall effect. This is probably the catchiest song on here. <br /> <br />Pleasure Dome: In my opinion, the BEST song on this album. Period. Everything is awesome. Alex's drumming on this one is among the best in the entire Van Halen catalogue, and towards the mid section everyone else backs off some to let Ed do his thing. And God does he ever. He gets a bout not once, but twice before they end it. Truly spellbinding. <br /> <br />In N' Out: This is my least favorite song on the album. It isn't bad at all, it just doesn't stand as strong as the others. It's also a bit too long. <br /> <br />Man On A Mission: The guitar line on this one has a really macho, swaggering feel to it, while Sammy sings about getting done what needs to be done: Go get that girl, bro! Very good stuff. <br /> <br />The Dream Is Over: A true rocker. In some ways it kind of reminds me of \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\" from VH's debut album. Ed plays some really sick guitar on this one.  <br /> <br />Right Now: Ah ha. Well, what is there to say about this one? It kicks! The music is actually kind of emotional, the piano line sounds really great and ties in with the rest of the music really well. <br /> <br />316: A really pretty acoustic guitar solo. Nicely done. <br /> <br />Top Of The World: A great \\"feel good\\" tune. Gotta love the music here. The additional guitar parts really make it shine. <br /> <br />Overall a great album, very worthwhile. If you're a VH fan and haven't checked this out yet, please do so now! <br />
B000002UAO|5.0|The beatles are one of the two best bands of all time (the other being led zeppelin). This is one of the reasons. When this was released with Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out in 1965, it was the first album without filler. It inspired the Beach Boys fillerless album \\"Pet Sounds\\". <br /> <br />You may be looking for a beatles album to buy. \\"The Beatles 1\\" is the best place to start. After that, you should buy some albums. I recommend \\"Rubber Soul\\". There are fourteen reasons: <br /> <br />Drive My Car 10/10 <br /> <br />Norwegian Wood 10/10 <br /> <br />You Won't See Me 4/10 (i think im the only one who doesnt like it though) <br /> <br />Nowhere Man 11/10 <br /> <br />Think For Yourself 8/10 <br /> <br />The Word 9/10 <br /> <br />Michelle 9/10 <br /> <br />What Goes On 6/10 <br /> <br />Girl 9/10 <br /> <br />I'm Looking Through You 8/10 <br /> <br />In My Life 11/10 <br /> <br />Wait 6/10 <br /> <br />If I Needed Someone 10/10 <br /> <br />Run For Your Life 10/10 <br /> <br />See the best album of the early sixties.
067697760X|5.0|I picked this book up because I was curious to learn how a boy could survive on a boat alone with a tiger for so long. I thought it would be an interesting story. The first few lines reveal the ease in which the author tells his story, and so I continued. And never regretted that I did. The story sails smoothly throughout, very serene, even with the tension going on between Pi and the tiger, and their adventures in the sometimes stormy seas. However, what really made me love this book was how the ending hit me. I was in a daze for days just thinking about it.
B00005ASHM|4.0|I would give this album a five because quite frankly, it is VERY good. I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me. God Only Knows, Wouldn't It Be Nice, and Sloop John B are the best on this album. <br /> <br />The reason it is half a point lower: <br /> <br />People keep claiming it's the best album of all time. If it was the best album of all time, wouldn't people let it be? <br /> <br />In the jacket it is always compared to the beatles' albums. <br /> <br />You don't see the beatles writing stuff about pet sounds in their jackets, do you? <br /> <br />THEY DON'T NEED TO... <br /> <br />I think the best album of all time is a beatles album. One of them. (id have to think too hard) <br /> <br />Buy this album, but don't buy the jacket. (first buy meaning purchase second buy meaning believe)
1400032717|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year!  A must read for anyone that likes The Pleasure of My Company and The Little Prince.
B000002UAR|5.0|If you don't have this, you need it. NOW. <br /> <br />This is possibly the best album of all time. VH1 thinks so. Rolling Stone calls it 3rd.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been hooked on Coldplay from the very first time I heard \\"Yellow\\", and I finally figured out why: the passion in the music, lyrics, and especially performance - and the emotions evoked by each and every song. Nine times out of ten, whatever Coldplay track I'm listening to will give me goosebumps, bring me to tears, or both... all the way down to their B-sides and lesser known EP's. Despite the obscure meaning of the cover and title, this disc is the epitome of soul-wrenching, heart-grabbing music that reaches out to its audience and challenges it to think on a much deeper level, and if there is a true definition of this band, this disc is it.
B0009353IW|5.0|This is the first time I have ever been moved to write a review, but I am just knocked out by \\"Chavez Ravine.\\"  I have been listening to it almost continuously for the five days since I purchased it, and I don't see stopping any time soon. <br /> <br />I'm a huge baseball fan, but I didn't know much about the sorry story of the disenfranchisement of the largely Hispanic community at Chavez Ravine to make way for Dodger Stadium.  The CD takes you through a cultural and political history of the area, starting with the so-called \\"Zoot Suit\\" riots during World War II, which branded the area as undesirable; the proposal for public housing in the area that wound up costing LA Public Housing Director Frank Wilkinson 30 years of his life (\\"Don't Call Me Red\\"); and the cultural life of the barrio (\\"Muy Fifi\\" and the Lieber-Stoller classic \\"3 Cool Cats\\"). <br /> <br />Along the way we hear multiple perspectives -- the operator of the bulldozer who razed the houses in Chavez Ravine (\\"It's Just Work for Me\\") and Wilkinson, understand the cultural conflict between Asian and Mexican Americans (\\"Chinito Chinito\\"), and finally, in  a ballad that leaves me weepy every time I hear it, a Dodger Stadium parking lot attendant, born in Chavez Ravine, who places his childhood memories at ballpark landmarks -- his home at 3rd base, his first kiss on the first base line -- while ruefully remembering \\"a place you don't know, up a road you can't go.\\" <br /> <br />This is a perspective most of us aren't familiar with -- the disenfranchisement of the poor in the name of progress in the 1950s, but after you've listened to this CD, you get it, and your body moves to the beat of the long-gone neighborhood.   <br /> <br />Don't miss this.
0767847431|3.0|just so you know people. the full frame version is not pan & scan, but the original edit before the top and bottom of the frame were matted out for theatrical release. that's right the top and bottom of the frame is cut for the widescreen version unlike the more common cutting at the sides known as pan & scan. Harryhausen was aware that his films were going to be shown on tv so he tried to keep the original films unmatted for future tv showings. So far this movie is the only one that I know of that carries this version. My advice is if you have a 4:3 tv set then I highly recommend watching it in full frame. however if you 16x9 set then it would propably be better to watch it in the matted widescreen 'anamorphic' version to get more detail & better picture.
B00065JTBA|2.0|I don't like to say it, but Bon Jovi is getting worse with this album. As a huge Bon Jovi fan, I bought this album immediatly and listened to it. The first month I loved this album and I played it over and over, but the second mont the songs became annoying and the lyrics made me sick. I was bored of the same lyrics and the same \\"messages\\" in the songs. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a great Bon Jovi fan, but this album doesn't deserve a place in the Bon Jovi collection...
B000002U9W|4.0|The album cover I have to say fits the music perfectly,just because they are both things you don't see or hear that often.I only wished this album was made alittle earlier because Meddle only reached 76 on U.S. charts because people didn't care much for this album even if it did reach 55 on the charts. The title track opens with a organ chord and then with the brass section warming up with the theme. This song covers everything lawnmowers running orchastra verses Richard Wright,some blistering blues solos by Gilmour turning into a superb jam with the choir singing some \\"jive\\" gibberish,to some avant-garde sound collages,and a reprise of every section to the main theme. Pretty neat! Then side two goes into some slightly laidback material. If with Rodger Waters by himself on acostic guitar and everytime there is a verse a insterment joins the song. Summer of 68 features Wright doing a fine job on his part even with the Beach Boy styled harmony to the full blown brass section fill the song out. Fat Old Sun is a peaceful acostic song by Gilmour about childhood,ending with a nice guitar jam with him on slide and his Fender. Alan's... is o.k. I don;t care for the fist song that much but the acostic duet and Morning Glory are some fine pieces of work just skip Alan eating breakfast. The album ends with water tapping I love it.
B0000C1733|4.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers is a band with two different sounds. The sound of funk :( and the sound of alternative rock :D. If you dislike funk, like me, you shouldn't buy BSSM or Mothers Milk, but By the Way or greatest hits. By The Way is really a great album and has got the true rock sound, but I am revieuwing greatest hits. This album is good for new fans, because it gives a good view of the Peppers. Most songs are perfect, but there are some very bad songs, like \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"Suck My kiss\\". When I hear this songs, I wonder why they act like a rock band. But I give the album four stars because of all other songs, wich have a very good rock-sound. So, if you like rock, buy this album and By The Way, but not anything else of the peppers and always remember: Rap=Crap
B000002U9Y|4.0|I can't believe this album didn't even reach 200 on the charts,thats like some of Soft Machines or Brand X's work, it is great different and lovable and the buyers doesn't give a rats ass about it. Thankfully Saucerful of Secrets is on CD. Then opening track begins with a bass rift by Waters that is pretty ahead of it's time. Then is goes into the stone rift with Wright and Glimour on vocals,wow, Gilmours voice has changed a how lot for a british clear voice to a gruff one. Remember a Day is a popish song by Wright with some intriuging slide guitar but it kind of gets annoying in a way. I love the classic Set the Controls song the whispery odd lyrics, the virbraphone in there making the song asmopheric like and that bass line. Corporal Clegg is the beginning of a horrible sign that ruins Pink Floyd, Water's father's death in the war. Even though this song and Free Four are good songs The Wall And the entire Final Cut a about this theme and it's pretty depressing. From that upbeat different song we inter the random A Saucerful of Secerts divided into about Three parts.The song is like a battle,first part tension building,2nd drumming section is battle and 3rd is the tragic mourning loss. See-Saw is good song to listen to for winding down, it is smooth and mellow like Remeber a Day it is about childhood. Jugband Blues is Syd Barretts final song he was on some of the album but this is his composistion. It is him by him self singing some druggish lyrics with him a acostic, pretty desolate sounding.Then you have the Salvation Army Band blowing away making the song even more strange,but a great song. If you like this album I would recommend Ummagamma of Volume 2 by Soft Machine.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|It may be the most telling tribute to the power of \\"The Day After\\" that 22 years later people still remember where they were when they saw it. A few scientific howlers and Steve Guttenberg notwithstanding, it was dead on the money. \\"This is your country.\\" [Banal, endearingly cheesy, more concerned with getting the daily grind done than what the stuffed suits in Washington are up to.] \\"This is your country after a full nuclear exchange.\\" [Dead, rotting, violently seeking crude animal survival.] \\"Any questions?\\" <br /> <br />No, it wasn't as graphic as its BBC counterpart \\"Threads\\". [But that movie's foreign setting and thick British accents dilute its impact for American viewers.] And I still don't understand why Jobeth Williams remains daisy-fresh when everyone else is becoming Dawn of the Dead. But its implicit criticism of the political \\"wisdom\\" of the day is of a boldness and ferocity with few equals in television history. I think it safe to predict that with today's media outlets fearfully kowtowing to the imperial delusions of the Cheney regime, we will not see its like again any time soon. <br /> <br />Of course, the scenario it depicts is a lot less likely now than it was then. But it behooves us to consider why. It's not because all the nuclear warheads detonated during it were hurled into the sun by the World Peace Fairy. It's because Mikhail Gorbachev didn't delude himself into thinking that the Soviet Union could continue pursuing its Cold War policies without destroying itself. Insert Iraq analogy here. <br /> <br />So our decline into savagery probably won't happen overnight. It will proceed by steps. Letting the rights to poison the environment go the highest bidder in the interest of \\"economic development\\". The lazy or fearful surrender of our civil liberties in the name of \\"security\\". The haughty dismissal of the civilian casualties of our warmongering as \\"worth it\\". The shrugging off of torture in clandestine prisons... <br /> <br />\\"The safest roadto hell is the gradual one - the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.\\" - C.S. Lewis
B0001BS4Q0|3.0|<br />  Colour the small one is relaxing,somehow melancholic album, with a great vocal,over avarage melodies,high quaility sounds and some really moving tracks like \\"breathe me\\" and my personal favourite;\\"the church of what's happening now\\" (a simple but great line gets into your head:throw away yesterday,today is a brand new day\\") <br /> <br />if you buy this album it'll probably catch you in track 3 and will make you have a good time until the end with its catching and relaxing melodies.They'll make you smile or sometimes feel sad,but never bad.once you listen it all,you'll eventually come back for more. <br /> <br />So if what you are looking for is good,high quality music,you are in the right title , but dont keep your expectations high like finding a track to make you cry for hours or change the way you look at your life;which;i thing should be the purpose of music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Admittedly, I have been a Foo Fighters fan only since Nothing Left To Lose. I was highly anticipating this new cd and have loved every part of it. I personally think both discs are great, and especially love the acoustic disc. I do wish the lyrics were included in the insert though. Some people I think are over analyzing the songs and such, maybe as musicians. Its music. And FF have done a great job with this project IMO. <br /> <br />I have read alot of reports of people not being able to rip this cd to their computers. I do own the copy protected version and had noo problem whatsoever in ripping both discs to my Mac. I then transferred both discs to my iPod with no problems. I am curious why so many others are having issues.
B00005QDW5|3.0|If you're already well-versed with the PF catalog then this double set is probably a waste of your time. In order to pack as many songs as they could into 2 CD's, the producers of Echoes trimmed down several songs from their original versions, most notably Shine on You Crazy Diamond. Not only are they missing the last few parts of the song (they only include 1-7), but they cut out the guitar solo before the first lyrical verse. For me, it was very painful to listen to this song, expecting the solo I knew so well, only to be greeted by the first verse of lyrics. If you've never heard the song before, then obviously this won't affect you, but for an experienced listener the song cuts that are made are very annoying. They immediately detract from the integrity of the song, making it feel more like a radio edit than the full track it was intended to be.  <br /> <br />Another complaint I have about Echoes is the arrangement and ordering of the songs. The producers obviously tried to include very diverse selections from all versions of Floyd (with/without Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, etc.). While this is seemingly a good idea, the actual order the songs are placed on these CDs seems to defy obvious logic--it just seems completely random. This is a shame, since Pink Floyd has had one of the most unique evolutions as a band in both songwriting and style. <br /> <br />In my opinion, instead of releasing Echoes, the producers should have released a 3-CD set that better highlighted the evolution of the band. The first CD would include their early tunes, the psychadelic, spacey, and most experimental side of the band. This time period covers everything from Piper up to and including Meddle, which is where their transition into more pointed, melodic music occurred. CD 2 would start off with DSOTM, and include the highlights of their next 3 major albums: Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. The last CD in this 3-CD set I'm dreaming of would start off with the Final Cut (rightbefore this album, the band started to break up, and this is Waters' last PF record) and include work from the post-Waters PF era. Personally, I'm not as huge a fan of the post-Waters Pink Floyd, but hey, it's still Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Instead of an idea similar to this, however, Echoes is just a random smattering of specific moments in PF's great career. It's hard (actually impossible) to capture the greatness of Pink Floyd in just 2 or 3 CD's, but I still think Echoes could have been done better. If you're new to Pink Floyd, then yes, it's a good introduction to the band's range of sounds and includes many musical highlights, therefore a recommended buy. But for experienced PF listeners, don't bother with this unless you absolutely need the complete catalog.
0141301155|4.0|In children's literature, the hero often faces extreme hardship.  Most often, his or her parents are killed and the hero is left as an orphan, dealing with evil stepparents or the like.  Charlie Bucket is spared that fate - both his parents are still living.  In fact, Charlie is a member of a large, loving household.  The Buckets problem is that they are poor - very, very, very poor.  They are starving, in fact.  Reading this book as an adult, it is striking to see just how extreme their suffering is.  They all suffer from malnutrition; Charlie has to leave early for school because, if he runs, he will pass out from exhaustion. <br /> <br />The cruelty of their starvation is exacerbated because they live right next to the most famous chocolate factory in the world.  Charlie loves chocolate more than anything else, but can only afford one bar a year - on his birthday.   When Willy Wonka announces that he has hidden five golden tickets to his factory in chocolate bars all over the world, chances look pretty slim that Charlie will find one.  However, considering the name of the book is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you can guess how it turns out. <br /> <br />The movie is such a classic that it is hard to come to this book without preconceptions.  Now, with the new movie, there is a danger that the book may get lost in the shuffle.  That is a shame.  The book stands on its own and should be read first.  For one thing, the book is less scary than the movie - the Oompa-Loompas are far less creepy.  For another, Roald Dahl's style is fun enough to be interesting to adults as well as children.  One danger though - reading this book makes you crave chocolate! <br />
B00004SVID|5.0|I'll start this off by saying that I already own The Wall studio version, and enjoy it very much. However, I happily consider this LIVE version of The Wall to be an upgrade. The fact that it's live, with an audience adds more energy to the feel of the album, not to mention hearing some different, slightly more fleshed-out instrumental segments on songs like Run Like Hell, Another Brick in the Wall, and Comfortably Numb. The booklets included in the CD case are also a bonus. <br /> <br />However, my favorite part of this live recording is a subtle point, but it's also the main reason that I prefer this version to the studio one: Roger Waters' vocal intensity. Here, he gives a truly talented performance. I'm not just talking about hitting all the notes, which he does, but more so with the emotion and feeling in his words. You can hear his sarcasm on Happiest Days of Our Lives, his authoritarian snarl on Run Like Hell, and the confusion and hysteria on The Trial, among many other things. Not that this sort of vocal presence is absent from the studio recording, but the fact that this version is live gives they lyrical delivery added integrity and poignance. I've always loved the lyrics on The Wall, and they've never caught my attention as faithfully as they have on this double CD.  <br /> <br />So if you already own The Wall, I'd recommend this as a noticable upgrade. If you don't own The Wall studio version, then this is definitely a good buy, and very much well worth your money. Recommended either way.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|I have just received by post the Eagles DVD. I must say I am a bit dissappointed with some of the songs although the sound and picture is great.The Eagles should forgo songs from their not-so-sucessful solo careers.I find the songs by Joe Walsh tedious and boring.Only when the James Gang is reunited miracalously, only then I prefer him peforming Funk#49/Rocky Mountain Way. <br />Where are the great Eagles songs like Best Of My Love, Witchy Woman, James Dean, Droolin' Dalton etc ????? <br />As for the new guitarist Steurt Smith he is competent (Hotel California is below par) but I miss the underated original guitarist Don Felder.To see how great Don is, have a look at the When Hell Freeze Over DVD. <br />The Eagles \\"Live\\" 1980 cd is a much better presentation of the band.  <br />The fans came to hear the Eagles not songs fron Don, Glen & Joe. <br /> <br />Best regards. <br />Abu Bakar <br />Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. <br />
B0002A0AH6|1.0|I ordered a seiko watch from bodying, the watch shipped from Malaysia??? and came in a broken box. I was so excited about the watch I looked past that and started wearing it. The watched advanced about 1 minute everyday, and when I didn't wear for about 3 hours it stopped, So pretty much every morning I had to adjust the time. When I wore it continuously I still had to take the time back 1 minute everyday. When I tried to contact them, I got an e-mail full of the word \\"KINDLY\\", there was nothing kindly about the e-mail, they refused to do something about the defected item. I wrote to amazon, and they refunded me immediately. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS RETAILER. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE, THERE ARE TONS OF GOOD SELLERS ON THE INTERNET.
B000002J1F|5.0|This is one of the best rock albums I have ever heard. I got the album a year ago thinking that the only good song was Roundabout and, man was I wrong! Every song on this album is solid gold! The singing, guitar work, drum work and especially the bass work! Heart of the Sunrise has one of the best bass lines ever! Buy this album!

B000022TSY|5.0|With a soundtrack featuring \\"If Six Was Nine\\" by Jimi Hendrix, \\"Weight\\" by The Band, \\"Born to Be Wild\\" and \\"The Pusher\\" by Steppenwolf, and excellent performances by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper as well as Jack Nicholson, this film is a true masterpiece. Usually called \\"The original biker movie\\", Easy Rider is about two bikers from L.A. who take off on a cross-country trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. On the way, they make some new friends, one in particular named George Hansen played by Jack Nicholson, the \\"lawyer with the ACLU\\". Dennis Hopper won \\"Best New Director\\" at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this movie. This movie also introduced the world to 3 time Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson. Also, this film was the first film that featured actors smoking REAL marijuana on screen. Yes, they were actually stoned, believe it or not. The 35th anniversary DVD is a re-release of the 30th anniversary edition. The only difference is that it features the Easy Rider soundtrack on CD and contains the 80-page British Film Institute Modern Classic book \\"Easy Rider\\". The transfer is flawless, especially for a 60's film. The 30th anniversary DVD contains a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation with Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 soundtracks, and extras such as the documentary \\"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\\", and a commentary by Dennis Hopper. So, take it from me, a 16 year old film buff: This movie is a true classic, and a worthy addition for anyone's film collection.
B00006BTCA|5.0|While Interpol's dark atmosphere and Paul Bank's what some would refer to as unique voice may be offputting DO NOT let that stop you from giving them a chance.  From start to finish this album is simply amazing, practically every song has single potential (untitled and Hands away are just too short for singles while the New and Roland are just weaker songs).  Although PDA was their lead single my personal favorite from first listen was Obstacle 1.  But now, as I continue to listen to it I find that my favorite changes everytime.  (I went through several stages where I JUST HAD to hear untitled one more time or Say Hello to the Angels.)  The arrangment of the tracks was done quite well too.  Untitled sets the tone and the rest of the tracks move the listener with Say Hello... as a climax within the cd (in terms of tempo) and Leif Erikson being the most memorable songs in terms of sheer impact. I just cannot stress ENOUGH how good this CD is.  If you've been listening to Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, or the Killers there is no reason NOT to buy this album.  It simply blows the other bands WAY out of the water.  (Also a must ((and the best interpol song I've heard)): the specialist (its supposed to be a bonus track but its on the OC mix 2 as well)
B00004TRD8|5.0|There's already great reviews regarding the movie, so I'm just going to add the differences between the R1 DVDs.<br /><br />DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ULTIMATE EDITION and EXTREME EDITION DVD:<br /><br />Extreme has better sound and picture quality, but you don't really notice unless you are watching it on a HUGE screen with a very expensive Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound system (THX approved of course), and have a guy that produced the DVD sitting next to you pointing out the VERY slight differences in quality.<br /><br />If I remember correctly, the Extreme edition is the only release that has a director's commentary featuring Cameron and William Wisher. UE has a commentary featuring lots of cast and crew that's pieced together from other interviews.<br /><br />The Extreme Edition has lots of making of and behind the scenes clips that can be accessed right from the movie. As you're watching, a Cyberdyne logo will appear up in the corner of the screen. If you click on it, it'll take you to extra info about that particular scene, behind the scenes footage, interviews, etc. I think some of the clips are different from those included in the extras of the UE version, and some are the same. When the clip is done, it'll return you right to the part of the movie you were at, and continue the movie. (There's also a menu page where these clips can be accessed directly without having to go into the movie.)<br /><br />Extreme also has DVD-ROM features that Ultimate doesn't have, such as a Windows Media Player 9 High-Definition transfer of the 139 minute theatrical cut. Extreme also has a 9-10 minute montage of behind the scenes clips that aren't on UE.<br /><br />Another difference between the two is that the UE contains the 139 minute theatrical cut, 152 minute director's cut, AND 156 minute extended director's cut of the film (it has the alternate ending and a scene that shows the T-1000 searching John's room), while the Extreme only has the 139 and 152 minute versions of the film. The 156 minute version is an easter egg on the UE though, which can be accessed on Disc 1/Side 1.<br /><br />Where is it?<br />Select the \\"Special Edition\\" option at the main menu. Enter 8, 29, 97 at the special edition screen to access the \\"Extended Special Edition\\" version of the film.<br /><br />What is it?<br />Two extra scenes will appear during the special edition (director's cut) version of the movie.<br /><br />Note: Some remote controls require the +10 button to be used to enter the numbers, other DVD players will need to have Enter pressed after each individual digit.<br /><br />As for soundtracks, the UE features: Dolby EX 6.1, DTS ES 6.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 and the cast and crew commentary.<br /><br />The Extreme features a Dolby Digital EX 5.1 soundtrack, Dolby headphone audio track, and the Cameron commentary.<br /><br />Ultimate has the better \\"extras\\", and the 156 minute cut of the film.<br /><br />So it's up to you. Go for the same film with less extras (Extreme), or the same film with more extras (Ultimate).<br /><br />However, if you love the UE, I'd wait for the movie to hit a Hi-Definition format before you go buying the movie again.on the UE though, which can be accessed on Disc 1/Side 1.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|You either get it.......or you don't.<br /><br />  The rantings and ravings from people and their \\"star\\" rating on Amazon regarding this movie will be either at the highest level, or they'll be at the lowest level......there will be no in-between. I got it........my son, my folks, and most of my friends got it. The movie is hilarious and I'm an old guy (50+)..........I think you'll especially get it if you're from a small town, you lived through the high school cliques, and I think you have to almost watch it more than once. The first time you'll shake your head and say, \\"What the heck was that all about?!?!??\\"<br /><br />  Have some fun with Napoleon, Pedro, Uncle Rico and friends. A very unique experience here. You'll either get it or you won't ..........I think that's the bottom line.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Very different from Danny Elfman's excellent Batman score and for good reason...it's a different Batman film. Awesome \\"moody\\" music. Great alternative for workout music.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|First off, this is a good pop album by a good pop artist.  I enjoy listening to it for the songs and is by far better than most of the garbage on the radio.  Catchy melodies, good chords, stupid lyrics but who cares.  All pop has stupid lyrics.  So does most good classic rock too. <br />. <br />Now onto the people who give this CD 1 star because they haven't got a clue.  All I've read are complaints about how she is a poser and not really punk.  So what?  Does that make the album \\"less\\" good?  Does one need to be a punk to make good music?  Last time I checked, those were contradictory with each other.  Since when were the Sex Pistols ever accused of writing quality music?  Punk, yes.  Complex quality musical compositions?  I think not.  And who uses the term \\"poser\\" any more anyway?  The last time I engaged in a conversation where that word came up was when I was 18.  So I assume all the poser bashers must be around the same age too.  Once you people grow up and find your place in the world, such terms become meaningless. <br />. <br />Sure, Avril \\"poses\\" herself as a Punk, but that's just an image.  Name one band that doesn't try to portray a particular image to their audience.  This is a great music CD, yes, a great POP CD.  Take it for what it is.  I'm still listening to it and I think Avril did and excellent job. <br />
B00005JNJT|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Great effects, very good plot line... well worth the money and a good change from the previous Batman titles (which, I thought were very good -- hey, it's from a COMIC BOOK)!
0515123447|5.0|Lee Child has written an amazing first novel. His main character Jack Reacher is not only believable but likeable. We are able to identify with him and be on his side from the outset. An honorable man who was released from the Military after an exemplary career because there was nothing left to do in the now peaceful world. Reacher being arrested in the first line of the novel made for a fast start to what proved to be a fast paced and adrenaline filled ride. <br /> <br />Reacher is accused of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He arrived into the small Georgia town in his new life as a drifter, after being cut loose from the army and his lengthy career there. Being the new guy in a small town would make  him stand out and be a plausible scapegoat. Reachers strong personality and Military Police background make his stoic acceptance of his early fate conceivable.   <br /> <br />It was somewhat unrealistic that Reacher and the Hubble could be put into the general prison population but that is where literary license comes into play. I think the portrayal of prison violence, although graphic, was very true. Having recently watched a documentary on prison violence, it really put the scene into perspective and provided a very realistic illustration. <br /> <br />Seeing Reacher's detective skills come into play was very impressive. Being allowed to have almost free reign over the investigation was unbelievable but worked for the story. Jack Reacher works as a big, scary police officer. <br /> <br />I was left thinking throughout this book as to the next step. As I have said in previous reviews of other books, I don't really try to figure the mysteries out. My preference is to let the auther weave the tale of suspense and I get to enjoy the ride. <br /> <br />This is the first in the Jack Reacher series and has proven to be a very fine novel. The series should stand out amongst it's peers as one of the best. I look forward to reading more from Lee Child seeing thecontinual growth of Jack Reacher.
B00097DX3U|5.0|There's been a lot said about Audioslave. Called a \\"supergroup\\" by some, and - more recently - corporate sell-outs by others.  It seems that some are unwilling to accept that Rage Against The Machine is no more.  Comparisons are bound to exist, just because Audioslave is definitely influenced by both of its predecessors, Rage and Soundgarden. But while those bands were great, their time has past, and it is now the time of Audioslave.   <br /> <br />What we get from this album is a more together, tightly knit, and somewhat more playful sound than their self-ttled debut. The band takes a more melodic approach here, and it pays off. Chris Cornell still bangs out explosive yet soulful vocals, and Tom Morello has matured and improved upon his guitar work from their previous album.  The bass and drum work is flawless. From the group that gave us a perfect soundtrack to roadtrips from their debut, we get another great album, certainly equal in worth to that debut. <br /> <br />Track by track, here's the breakdown: <br />1. Your Time Has Come - energetic opener, colliding Chris Cornell's soulful lyrics with very Rage reminiscent music, as well as a very Morello-esque solo. Great way to start an album. <br />2. Out of Exile - starts out slow, builds up, then reverts to slow during the verses. Nice verses, soulful chorus, and an effects-laden solo make this a great song to listen to. <br />3. Be Yourself - the first single off this album.  No matter how many times I hear this song, I still want more. Great guitar work, somewhat simple though it may be, builds to a Rage-reminiscent solo. Cornell's vocals shine as soulful and inspirational, and prove that the spirit of the band's predecessors are alive and well. <br />4. Doesn't Remind Me - a surprisingly melodic and playful effort by the band pays off on this track. The song almost sounds like a  Looking Glass effort (for those of you who enjoy old-school mellow rock). The solo starts off sounding oddly conventional of classicrock, touched by the grace of Tom Morello's unconventionalism. <br />5. Drown Me Slowly - starts off slow, but explodes into a very blues and classic rock reminiscent song. The solo is stand out for this track: it starts off with a DJ-scratching effect laid over a great bass line, followed by Morello's effects-laden mania. Great track.  <br />6. Heaven's Dead - slower track, but is so to let Chris Cornell belt out some great vocals. Accompanied by his bandmates, this song lives up to greatness that \\"I Am The Highway\\" created for their first release. <br />7. The Worm - great vocals, great music, great coupling, nuff said. <br />8. Man or Animal - high energy track, very reminiscent of classic rock. Great vocals that blend well with the music. Unusual solo, but such is to be expected by Mr. Morello. <br />9. Yesterday or Tomorrow - begins with a good bass line. Slower song, great, thought-provoking vocals. Great build up during the bridge to a mellow solo. <br />10. Dandelion - another melodic song.  Great vocals, possibly about a daughter.  Another playful song, that shows the band can just have fun while kicking ass. <br />11. #1 Zero - Another slower paced song, the vocals couple well with \\"What You Are\\" from their previous release.  Very ethereal guitar work.  Song is driven by powerful vocals. <br />12. The Curse - the final and longest track on the album. Great track to end things on. It just sounds like it was made to end an album. Solo starts slow, and ends very fast and crazy. As I said before, a great way to end the album. <br /> <br />Audioslave has given us another gem with Out of Exile.  A tight album, which the band acheiving new levels of harmony. This album is a must own for any Audioslave fan, and a great addition to any music collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|i just don't understand why everyone says that good albums always get bad reviews saying that it is overrated and the bad albums always get good reviews saying it is underrated.  this is a good album.  this album deserved that grammy it recieved and i think it deserved more.
0060920432|5.0|The book is probably one of the best books I read in my life. By applying some of the insights from the book, I have significantly improved my quality of life and work. The author is also a master in English. It is enjoyable to read his books.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|You can't call the Essential Bob Dylan essential anymore. Why? It simply skims too much from this classic. For instance, I would like to see my personal favorite, Tombstone Blues, show up on a comp sometime. I also would like to see the title track and From a Buick 6.<br />So, what's the solution? Buy Highway Sixty-One. The tracklist very much speaks for itself--Like a Rolling Stone is definetly required listening for all human beings, Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues is the one of the best blues tracks Dylan ever made. Then there's the aforementioned three, my personal favorites, It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry (another good bluesy song), the putdown Ballad of a Thin Man, and the 11:20 climax Desolation Row. I'm not a big fan of Queen Jane myself, but that's just me. Plus, nonsensical liner notes!<br />Should be in anyone's collection.
B000068MKZ|5.0|i just received her cd today and i just love love love it...she has such a beautiful voice. i dont speak any french, so if anyone knows of where i can find an english translation of any of her lyrics...please tell me! thanks.
B000000W5N|5.0|By 1971, it was clear that stardom, drug abuse, Brian Jones' death, and Altamont had huge impacts on the Stones. The resulting album was Sticky Fingers, a true masterwork. Easily the best by the Rolling Stones, this comes close to being my favorite album of all time.<br />1. Brown Sugar: 10/10. This one's a classic cut. A disturbingly exuberant fusion of soul and rock with some of the dirtiest lyrics in Stones history, there's no doubt that this works perfectly. Play it at a party, you'll get good reaction. This also happens to be the only song here with any optimism.<br />2. Sway: 10/10. Though those who only know the Stones from what gets played on the radio will never have heard it, Sway is a fan favorite and rightfully so. Besides containing Mick Taylor's defining moment as a guitarist, Mick Jagger's tortured screams and a brilliant string arrangement, it's also extremely well-written.<br />3. Wild Horses: 10/10. This is one of those rare Stones ballads that actually has a remote amount of emotional impact on me. (Most the rest, namely Angie and Ruby Tuesday, seemed forced). Not only does this country ballad tug at the heartstrings, it totally rips them to shreds. A worthy classic.<br />4. Can't You Hear Me Knocking: 10/10. Another one of the alltime greats. It starts as an aggresive rocker, but don't let that fool you. After the song's more traditional first half, it becomes a jazz/Latin jam! Not only does Bobby Keyes play the best damn sax solo on a Stones album, Keef matches it with his Latin guitar, sounding like Santana. Brilliant.<br />5. You Gotta Move: 6.5/10. You don't know how disappointed I was the first time I heard this song. Though it isn't bad, it sounds awful when heard after Can't You Hear Me Knockin'. I believe that this would've worked on Beggars Banquet, though it was obviously too late to include it on that disc. Oh well.<br />6. Bitch: 10/10. The BEST STONES SONG PERIOD!!!!! It's so energetic, it's like it'll explode at any second. It truly sounds like Motown...from Hell!!! (Take one of their best lines, \\"This must be love/it's a bitch!\\") With it's constant references to how drugs can screw you up, it's the definitive piece of the album and a hint at the last three songs.<br />7. I Got the Blues: 9/10. Mick's affected vocals really send this to the top, as well as a fine organ solo. Though it's not the most original song in existance, you gotta love the way Mick belts it out.<br />8. Sister Morphine: 10/10. The Rolling Stones, among rock's most notorious drug abusers, come up with a haunting O.D. ballad with some of the best guitar in Stones history. But this song is supposed to be listened to for the lyrics themselves. Jagger delivers his creepy tale in a dramatic fashion, paired with some truly frightening imagery. Best of all, it never seems over the top. Kicks off a suite of three drug-influenced songs.<br />9. Dead Flowers: 10/10. A funny country parody. Mick once said that he could never listen to country without cracking up. As a result, the send-up is a hilarious spoof of virtually every country cliche in the book. It provides the necessary lighter passage between epics Sister Morphine and Moonlight Mile. The second of the \\"Drug Suite\\".<br />10. Moonlight Mile: 10/10. Far and away the best, most affecting ballad the Stones ever pulled. Like Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Moonlight Mile is like no Stones song before or after it. An epic about drugs, death and ultimate redemption, it will follow you forever. A fitting closer to Sticky Fingers, and arguably their most beautiful song ever.<br />The verdict: buy it!om Hell!!! (Take one of their best lines, \\"This must be love/it's a bitch!\\") With it's constant references to how drugs can screw you up, it's the definitive piece of the album and a hint at the last three songs.  7.

B00005B36H|5.0|I have been listening to this album on a very regular basis since the day it came out. Tool has such a cult following for a very real reason, the mystique and revelations that everyone gets differently. They are \\"deeper\\" in many aspects. For example, all the references to the \\"golden spiral\\" if you rearrange the track listings accordingly, it still flows together, as almost planned. In the title track lateralus, the drum beat, and lyrical syllables follow the fibonnaci sequence. <br /> <br />Black <br />then <br />white are <br />all I see <br />in my infancy <br /> <br />1 <br />1 <br />2 <br />3 <br />5 <br /> <br />There is so much to them, its hard to know if people are just finding this by mistake or if its planned. That is part of the joy of this band. The music is perfect, and perfect in a different way for every listener.
B000002UAF|4.0|This was the first Beatles album I had ever heard - we had it on cassette and, like Highway Sixty-One Revisited, my dad played it all the time. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />While it's not their best, it's certainly good. Highlights include the title track, I Should Have Known Better, I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, And I Love Her, and Can't Buy Me Love, although every song is good (except for some filler later on, such as I'll Be Back.) It's a good intro to the Beatles.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If you can find a CD with one great song on it, it's probably worth buying for that one song alone.  You'll own the CD for years, maybe decades, and get pumped up occasionally just from hearing that one song.  Music is fuel, it gives us energy when we're a little down or gets us going even more when we're feeling good. <br /> <br />This album has 3 great songs, and 3 or 4 pretty good songs.  The songs that I consider \\"pretty good\\" I might elevate even higher after more listenings. <br /> <br />The three great songs are \\"Talk\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", and \\"Low\\".  I own all of Coldplay's albums, and if they were to compile an \\"All-Time Ten Greatest\\" CD right now all three would have to be included.  My favorite song is \\"Low\\", with \\"Speed of Sound\\" a close second.  After only a few weeks of hearing these songs they're already my all-time favorite Coldplay tracks, ahead of even \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Yellow\\". <br /> <br />The album as a whole is a little more uneven than \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\", I loved almost every song on that album and I can't say that about \\"X & Y\\" right now. <br /> <br />But anytime a CD has three great songs, especially ones as inspired as \\"Low\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\", it's a CD that I know I'll be enjoying for a long, long time.
0312323859|5.0|I must admit, while reading Emily Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed,\\" I didn't care very much for Darcy at all (though I did LOVE the book).  But after reading \\"Something Blue,\\" I have come to absolutely love her!  \\"Something Blue\\" finds Darcy Rhone newly pregnant--and alone.  She has lost virtually all of her friends, and her parents do not approve of, nor do they have compassion for, Darcy and her impending motherhood.  Desperate for a change in her shallow existence, Darcy makes an impulsive move to London and stays with her childhood friend, Ethan, much to his dismay.  She tells Ethan that her stay is \\"just a short visit,\\" no longer than a month, although she knows in her mind that she plans on staying in London a lot longer than a month.  Along the way, the reader will grow to understand Darcy as a person, and appreciate her genuine strive for change in a world where everyone is so focused on societal status and outward appearance.  The reader will also fall completely in love with Ethan, someone who is distant with Darcy in the beginning, but grows to genuinely admire her for the good-hearted, nurturing person she truly is inside; and he eventually comes to cherish the sweet, innocent closeness that blossoms between them.  This sequel is a winner!  It is warm and charming, a story about the true meaning of friendship and love, and the power they have to change us all.  I do hope Emily Giffin's admirable, lovable characters pop up again in a new book sometime soon!  Highly recommended!
B00006RU5B|5.0|As a HUGE fan of both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, it was no suprise to me that this album would kick ass. This album is an example of how an experimental band such as Audioslave make such great music, and I am proud to say that I've bought this album very early after it's release, and that I still listen to it.  <br />The Opener, Cochise, is a hard rocker that builds from a simple beat on the drums to a a killer tune. Show Me How to Live and Gasoline, are again great songs. Show Me How to Live is probably the best out of these 3 opening tracks, with some very cool guitar. <br />Though overplayed, What You Are and Like a Stone are some good tunes, What you Are being the better of the two, with a killer solo (hats off to Tom Morello.) <br />Set It Off, gettting into another upbeat song, is a great political anthem that would probably be a great Live song. Shadow On the Sun, is an ok song, kinda of boring, but again, Tom Morello and Chris save the song with outstanding performances. <br />I'm the Highway is a good song with some pretty sweet lyrics that seem very inspired by vehicles / freedom (as does Getaway Car.) Gets old, though.  <br />Here we go with the four best songs of the album, Exploder, Hypnotize, Bring Em Back Alive, and Light my Way. These songs all have the best drums and guitar of the album. The solo on Light my Way is very cool. These songs are the highlight of the album.  <br />The last two tracks are ok, slower than most of the songs on the album. These are actually the worst songs on the album (it might just be because they came after four lively songs.) But, out of the two, Getaway Car is better, being sort of blusey. <br />Overall, \\"Audioslave\\" is one of the best albums of 2002, and destined to be a rock classic, such as albums like \\"Led Zepplin 4,\\" \\"Nevermind,\\" and \\"Axis: Bold as Love.\\" <br /> <br />
B00006CXXU|1.0|Although all my CDs are bad, this one is the worst (at least for me it is).  The songs here are SO boring.  And to make matters worse, there are twenty of them and on all my other CDs there are only between twelve and fifteen, so I am forced to hear this horrible stuff for longer on this one.  There are some songs here that are ugly and that I really can't stand, like &quot;Dirrty,&quot; &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; and &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours.&quot;  There are some songs that are quite sweet, but are not as good as I'd like them to be, like &quot;Beautiful,&quot; &quot;The Voice Within&quot; and &quot;I'm OK.&quot;  The rest are just BORING.  Listening to them even for five seconds makes me want to fall asleep.  I got this CD one-and-a-half years ago.  I was very convinced that Christina Aguilera was a wonderful singer, so I forced myself to buy her latest CD, even though I was a bit hesitant.  What a terrible mistake!  I listened to it...maybe like twice, and it was so bad that I put it away, and I've never listened to it again ever since.  With all my other CDs, it took me a while before I found out that I really didn't like them that much.  For all the time I was listening to them I was only pretending to like them.  I guess because I wanted to like the music that I bought for myself, and the other CDs weren't terrible even if they weren't that good.  But this one is so bad, I almost felt like stopping it everytime a new track begun, even when it had only been on for half a minute or less.  I was very surprised when I heard this CD.  Her music doesn't sound at all like the  teen pop I have heard from other artists, like Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, 'NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys.  Not that I like any of them very much, but this pop singer is even worse.  If it were possible, I'd give this only half a star!
B0009I7NNA|1.0|This album is absolutely horrible. I will never see why people like this band. All these idiots walk around with tight girl jeans and black shirts and terrible haircuts and star tattoos and think they're hardcore. Guess what guys, YOU'RE NOT! You look like fools to everyone who listens to legitimate metal and not this Guns N' Roses wannabee bs. Speaking of which, I really wish Axl and Slash would get together and sue these people for ripping off their style.   <br /> <br />The vocals sound so strained and pitiful. The music is straight up 80s cheese and pure wankery. <br /> <br />If you want some real metal go buy the new Meshuggah or hell go buy the new Motley Crue if you want cheese done right.
B00005K3NR|4.0|I remember the year 1976 seeing commericals for this film. Let me rephrase that, the first commerical showed no scenes but blantly said this film is so terrifying we cannot show one scene. Marketing at it's best, caught my attention and I was only 10. Then the split photo poster comes out with Sissy before and after the blood dumping, scared the sh#t out of me. I knew some how I was sneaking into this film. I succeded. I was not dissapointed. With my reviews I don't go into details over plot and storyline, if you are here, good chance you have seen it. Spaceck's performance is wonderfull, well worthy of her oscar nomination, likewise of Piper Lauries nomination. Very unheard of for a horror film, that is how good this film is. Depalma,(director),is a genius at his no cut 3 min. long camera shots, split screen, and use of music. The suspence up to the blood dumping, personally the best I have ever seen, we know what happens but yet we are screaming, when?...when? The climax is literally arm grabbing and copied by numerous films. Film looks great on dvd and Travoltas performance is no different from his Welcome Back Kotter show. He grows...in Sat. Night fever. Buy this classic, word of warning, full frontal nudity in the beginning, wow, hygene sure has changed, thank God, lol, Carrie rocks.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Reading some of these reviews, I'd have to say that I'm a little surprised. I've been listening to NIN since way back when Pretty Hate Machine was first released. I think all of NIN's albums are good for their own reasons (I'm not too crazy about the \\"Fragile\\" to be honest but it's still a good listen) and I find this one to be the most accessible. I've been listening to this album just about daily since I picked it up and there isn't one song that I dislike. I would recommend this album fully. It's not as violent as, say \\"Downward Spiral\\" and it's not as grim as the \\"Fragile\\" so I'd put it as being closest to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". While some might say that it's a big step sideways for Reznor, I really don't mind this direction since the outcome is successful.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into why I like each particular song but some of the ones that stand out for me are:<br /><br />\\"With Teeth\\", \\"Only\\", \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"Love is Not Enough\\", \\"Getting Smaller\\" and \\"All the Love in the World\\" which I can probably hear on a loop.<br /><br />In the end, I say ignore the purists and check this out. I doubt you will be disappointed. Also, the DualDisc 5.1 mix sounds nice and tight. Occasionally, I pop it into the DVD player as it gives you a nice sense of envelopment.
B00005JNJT|4.0|WHAT A DIRECTOR!  WHAT A CAST! WHAT A SCRIPT!  WHAT A MOVIE!  I just saw BATMAN BEGINS last night and it's easily the best superhero movie I've ever seen, and maybe the best movie I've ever seen--period!    Val Kilmer and George Clooney were both good as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but Christian Bale is better looking, and goes from Batman to Bruce and back like he was born for the role!    Director Christopher Nolan's created a masterpiece here, with a terrific Hall of Fame cast with Michael Caine as butler Alfred, Gary Oldman as a wierd police buddy James Gordon--not yet Commissioner!--Morgan Freeman as a dedicated but isolated Wayne Corp staffer who becomes a sort of Tonto to Bale's Batman, and Liam Neesom as the main heavy, with Rutger Hauer hanging around as a corporate heavy at Wayne Corp.    The script keeps moving right along, and introduces an actor I've never seen before--Cillian Murphy--and boy, does this Irish kid steal the show as crazy Dr. Jonathan Crane alias the Scarecrow!!!  Murphy looks terrific, and he's one of the few modern actors with a great voice, which he uses to full effect in his terrifying role!    The music is great, too, and the only bad things about BATMAN BEGINS are that the action scenes area so fast you can never see what's going on, plus there's a stupid scene at Wayne Manor where  Wayne pretends to be drunk to run off some birthday party guests from impending danger--why couldn't a smooth guy like Wayne just send them off diplomatically???  Plus, Katie Holmes is a dud as love interest Rachel Dawes--she just doesn't look good enough for Bale!    But BATMAN BEGINS is beautifully filmed, and the movie keeps rolling along till the end when you're left wanting more--and that's the way movies are supposed to be!!!    BATMAN BEGINS IS THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER MADE!!!    Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING   TANGO2200@HOTMAIL.COM
B00005QIPH|5.0|I discovered The Strokes when my cousin gave me a copy of 'The Modern Age EP' and told me to check out this great band that had been getting buzz around New York. The first time I heard them, I knew this band really had something, and when 'Is This It' was released, with all it's hype trailing behind it, the world was introduced to The Strokes. These 5 guys not only took the world by storm, but they came around in a time when the music scene was sorely lacking and brought back what used to be great about music. This is an excellent c.d. with flawless tracks and completely original sound. It still remains one of the best albums since it's five year release. I am looking forward to the release of their highly anticipated 3rd album,which is said to be released January of 2006.  <br /> <br />The Strokes are just as great live, and anyone who has had the pleasure to see them live would agree that they put on an awesome show. If you get the chance to see them when they tour next year, you should definitely check them out.  <br /> <br />So, put the hype and the polished look aside and give 'em a listen. I don't think you'll regret it.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0345347951|4.0|Clarke writes a captivating mystery here.  The book is a very quick read and not very long.  The only draw back I could find for this novel was the ending.  It just did not feel right to me.  The holes were filled in what seemed to be a \\"deus ex machina\\" fashion.  It almost seemed as if Clarke had the story all planned out but could not come up with an ending.  It just does not fit with the feeling of the rest of the story.  That being said, Clarke broke the mold on alien invasion with this book.  The aliens do not want to conquer us, but to help us grow.  The irony being that both lead down the same road.  It is a good book and required reading for science fiction fans.
B00008WT5M|5.0|It's like this, I watched the Stones' DVD from Toronto '03 and after sitting through all that lukewarm nonsense Angus Young's opening \\"Thunderstruck\\" riff was like a hot knife through butter and I was reminded, once again, just how damn much fun AC/DC is. Alas they have no recorded compilation of their stuff so I made my own, and no AC/DC compilation would be complete w/o \\"Thunderstruck\\" or \\"Money Talks\\".
1401200923|5.0|When I read the reviews I keep seeig people saying that they guessed the villian from the first pages.  Either I'm really dumb, or they are really smart, because it kept me wondering, especially since the mystery changes several times.<br /><br />I'm a new Batman comic reader.  I saw the movie, ehcih was awesome, and that rekindled my interst for the Dark Knight after Batman and Robin crushed it.  Maybe since I'm new to the comics is why I wasn't able to figure it put, but the artwork was great, and being a new reader, I loved seeing all the bad guys that made appearences.<br /><br />Ive read Hush, which has been my favorite, The Dark Knight whicvh comes in an extremely close second, and The Dark Knight Strikes back, one wehere I read the reviews and bought it anyways. Mistake.<br /><br />I loved this story and the art, and as a new fan that it was spectacular.  I plan on reading more form Loeb's writing in the Batman universe.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am an ORIGINAL STAR WARS GENERATION fan and I have waited lightyears for these movies to come to dvd. I was not disappointed when it finally happend. The picture and sound are amazing. Just like new for me and even more exciting! There is a scene from A NEW HOPE that I was not thrilled about (Greedo) which Lucas changed in the SE. Also, a scene from ESB when the Falcon rescues Luke and they fly away but the action scene and fast paced music is interupted by Vader boarding the Destroyer and darker, slower music plays only to jump back into the Falcon fleeing the fighters on Bespin. This bugs me cus its a terrible interuption of an exciting moment. Other than those two issues, the dvds are fantastic! I like the fact that in RotJ the actor who originally played the ghost of Anakin was replaced with Hayden Christiansen. Returning back to his younger state when he still was somewhat of a good person. It brought the trilogies together some.  <br />I know people complain about things in SW that Lucas has changed, I am one of them at times, but could any of us have done any better?  <br />The Star Wars Trilogy dvds are a return to a galaxy far, far, away loaded with even more excitement and adventure and is brand new all over again.
0345452585|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book much - we spend too much time \\"in the narrator's head\\", with long drawn-out, repetitive thought processes. The plot was disappointingly predictable, and the tension between the main characters, the detective and Jeremy, was sadly lacking.  Kellerman can do much better..
B0007GAERG|4.0|I bought this album because I loved the dance tune for 'Like That Y'all'. The album is great to listen to because Jermaine Dupri is an awesome producer, but the mind blowing vocals associated with Mariah Carey are nowhere to be found.  There's a lot of synthesizing going on to help her sound and even background high notes that she used to hit on her own.  I believe her personal life has really affected her talent. She needs voice coaching to lift her sound back to where she used to be.  So why 4 stars? How many stars can barely sing but have the ability to put out great albums? Janet Jackson, Ciara, Britney Spears so forth and so on.  Music is about fun and this album has a certain listening quality where you want to learn the words to some and dance to others. Some songs however are painful to listen to. It's obvious she's been hurt in love, and partying to make up for it.  That's what the album is about.
B000002L7Y|4.0|It took me until April of 2005 to hear this album. I finally got the CD after many years of hearing Take On Me. This album personifies what some of the music in the '80s sounded like. They were known for Take on Me, the worldwide hit, but the rest of the album is full of strong light pop that's heavy on the keyboards and synthesizers. It was released in 1985, but the album has shades of the new wave sound of 1984 and what Cyndi Lauper was doing on her '83 debut. Both Love Is Reason, I Dream Myself Alive and Train Of Thought are superb dance pop songs that match well with the hits from this debut.  I still love the dramatic title song Hunting High and Low, which still is timeless a good 20 years later. The orchestra sound lush and fabulous on this song. Morten Harket has such a nice falsetto that cuts well through the songs. The last song Here I Stand and Face the Rain may have been the benchmark to their later, more mature sounds of the '90s and now. A-ha's debut has such a catchiness to it that you wouldn't have thought that they were young when making this album. It is still an '80s classic and they're still recording 20 years later today!  Hearing this album makes things come full circle for them! It's had a strong endurance in pop music because of Take on Me and the other singles that came from it.
0805076476|5.0|The sad part is I almost never read it.  Like a lot of reviews state, I didn't read this until after seeing the movie and in actuality when I saw the book at 'Barnes & Nobel' I thought it was a novelization and I HATE when movies get novelized so I didn't even pick it up.  Then I was skimming through some novels by Palahniuk because I heard that he had a similar writing style to Bret Easton Ellis (Less Than Zero, American Psycho) and I love his work and that's when I saw 'Fight Club' and thought 'OMG!  I have to read this!' and I'm so glad that I did.  The plot is pretty much the same as the film, which by the way is one of the only films I've seen that follows the book as closly as possible.  We have our narrator who remains nameless.  He's an insomniac.  He hasn't slept in months and finds some sort of peace, serenity, in the lives of distressed individuals and so he attends help groups to get his 'fix'.  Enter Marla.  Women ruin everything, right?  See, our narator can't deal with the fact that another 'poser' is getting high of his 'fix'.  Amazing, just amazing.  Anyways, so he hates this woman, but then again he loves this woman...I mean, she may be the only one who understands him.  Enter Tyler.  Tyler understands him.  Tyler is also somewhat psychotic...I mean, the man makes soap out of Marla's mothers body fat (one of my favorite scenes in the book) and threatens to cut off you're lovesack.  The end is just breathtaking, and even if you've seen the movie you will still be hanging on to you seat with every page.  I love the movies, don't get me wrong, but there is so much more you can get out of a good book, and Chuck is like that.  He serves up prime entertainment that is bound to keep you guessing.  Isn't that the best kind.
B00000JZC4|4.0|Filter is another band of young men that I didn't even hear about in the music scene. I decided on a whim to buy this CD for a taste of 'Filter'. Really if I could, I would give this album 3.5/5. It's not what I expected. This band experiments with their rock sound incorporating pop, fusion techno, with splices of punk and pyschadelic grunge in their songs. It is a fairly long CD just over 70 mins. This is a 11 track CD with the last track going for a whopping 19 minutes. 'Title Of Record' is a CD that will appeal to alot of people but not pure rock enthusiasts. I enjoyed two songs immensly on this album and they were 'Take A Picture' as well as 'Miss Blue'. These two songs have been on TV ads and movies and soundtracks, they are fairly distinguishable. Its not a bad effort but it won't be a CD that I will play regularly at all.
B00005JNJT|4.0|If you like campy, lame humor, terrible acting, and falling asleep while watching a movie then pop in a copy of BATMAN and ROBIN into you dvd player. If you like dark movies with great acting and awesome characters then go see BATMAN BEGINS! <br />This is not a Joel Schumacher (or however you spell it) movie for half wits. This is how Batman is supose to be done! <br />This is a film well done and needed so badly to keep the Batman alive. It developes Bruce Wayne from a small boy to his training to become a crime fighter and finally to becomming fear itself in the hearts of of those cool bad guys in Gotham. <br />We finally learn where Batman gets \\"All those wonderful toys\\". <br />A great flick for comic fans and anyone who likes action and a great story. Check it out!
B000654Z2I|5.0|Can's Tago Mago has forever changed the way I look at music.  From now on, anything I listen to will be dubbed \\"music post Tago Mago\\" and anything I heard before will be \\"music pre Tago Mago\\" <br /> <br />Ladies and Gentlemen, this album is fantastic. Groundbreaking.  Extraordinary.  Passionate. And so on.... <br /> <br />Listening to this, you can easily see where such rock and roll behemoths like Radiohead and Tool found much of their influence, and it is such a shame that Can never received the same acclaim that their progressive rock contemporaries like Led Zep and Pink Floyd did.   <br /> <br />I listened to Tago Mago straight through five times, and each time, it felt like some dark, musical secret had been revealed to me.  Halfway through my first listen, it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br />Purchase this album.  There are no especially remarkable songs, or better moments; this album is a masterwork, through and through, and it will forever change the way you see the evolution of rock and roll.
1573223026|3.0|Given his fondness for pop music, Nick Hornby may have been listening to Leonard Cohen, but he must have been channeling Gilbert O'Sullivan's \\"Alone Again, Naturally\\" when he conceived the plot of \\"A Long Way Down.\\"  Remember the lyric: \\"In a little while from now, / If I'm not feeling any less sour, / I promised myself to treat myself / And visit a nearby tower. / And climbing to the top, / Will throw myself off. . . .\\"  Four characters determine to do just that in Hornby's novel, until they start tripping over each other's neuroses on the roof of Toppers' House one fatal New Year's Eve.  Each of the four, even Maureen, the mother of a \\"sick child,\\" is savvy enough to know about the drug culture--a simple overdose is quick and relatively painless--so why do they insist on throwing themselves off a building?  This is but one of many questions that will have readers scratching their heads at \\"A Long Way Down.\\"  The good news for pedestrian traffic, but the bad news for the rest of us, is that, once having met, the four decide to put off the big event for six weeks, in which time they hope to bond as a \\"gang.\\"  Now there's a Dr. Phil-worthy goal for the wounded and depressed!<br /><br />Here's the gang: Matthew is an ex-talk show host who thinks his prison sentence for having slept with a 15-year-old is unfair because he was \\"not a criminal\\" but \\"a television performer who made a mistake.\\"  Maureen is a mother whose adult life has been taken up by the needs of her disabled son.  Jess is eighteen going on eight, a rebel without a clue who peppers her every sentence with four-letter words.  Finally, J. J., the obligatory American in the mix (think film rights), is a washed-up musician whose bathroom library extends to Richard Yates (foreshadowing?) and Pauline Kael.  None of these people has a compelling reason for taking his or her own life, but the reader might, after putting up with these whiners for 333 pages.<br /><br />Believe it or not, Nick Hornby is one of my favorite writers.  Nothing will take away my pleasure in having read \\"About a Boy,\\" \\"High Fidelity,\\" and \\"Fever Pitch.\\"  I wasn't crazy about \\"How to be Good,\\" but it had its moments.  Still, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is a major disappointment.  When I think of all the Grand Guignol possibilities for a plot such as this--the gang might have drawn lots to kill one another, for instance, or they could have made a pact not to die, only to expire en masse in a subway crash--I can't help but feel let down by Hornby's failure of the imagination.  I know others of the author's fans will be outraged by my defection (alone again, naturally), but I take comfort from the mostly negative reviews on Amazon's UK site.  Apparently, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is more popular in America than in his native England.  Cue the casting director.Nothing will take away my pleasure in having read \\"About a Boy,\\" \\"High Fidelity,\\" and \\"Fever Pitch.\\"  I wasn't crazy about \\"How to be Good,\\" but it had its moments.

B00004RF9G|5.0|I saw a high school production of BRIGADOON in San Francisco at the ICA (Immaculate Conception Academy) at 24th and Guerrero.  These girls who played the parts had never been anywhere near Scotland, you could tell, and some had not been in the USA very long and the charming accents of South of the Border stood in for the strong Scots burr.  Nevertheless they played the show beautifully and ever since then I have had a fondness for the music and the story.  I feel that the makers of MOULIN ROUGE were probably trying to capture some of the big-hearted appeal of BRIGADOON when they created their fantasy world.  Watching the movie I have always felt that a bit of the magic was lost because so much of Minnelli's canvas was spent on dance elements which, IMHO, are just not that interesting.  So many dance numbers created to take advantage of Gene Kelly's and Cyd Charisse's astonishing abilities.  Maybe too many!  Thus some of the musical numbers had to be cut out, including some of the loveliest of the songs Lerner and Loewe wrote for the 1947 musical.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise and delight when the new DVD came out this spring and I discover that, in fact, Minnelli did film three of the rejected songs (and recorded another, perhaps the greatest) and that all of this deleted material would be available on the disc.  I was in hog heaven.  However we are all familiar with some deleted scenes that you watch and then you say, \\"Well, I know why that sucker got deleted\\" and I was afraid that these scenes would be of inferior quality.  (Like \\"Is It A Crime?\\" in BELLS ARE RINGING--forgive me, \\"Crime\\" fans!)<br /><br />But it is my pleasure to report that all 3 numbers here are keepers.  I wish somehow they had been re-integrated back into the main print of BRIGADOON and we could then judge the movie for once and for all the way Minnelli wanted it.  If it is too long, then maybe shorten down the \\"Sword Dance.\\"  I feel sure that somewhere footage must exist for the exquisite \\"There But For You Go I\\"--or is that just a dream of mine?  In any case we can now hear the track, and we can see the fully staged versions of \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\" and the marvelous \\"From This Day On\\" which is to BRIGADOON what \\"From This Moment On\\" is to KISS ME KATE.  All in all, the plus factor makes this disc the one to buy if you're wanting the full BRIGADOON magic.e \\"There But For You Go I\\"--or is that just a dream of mine?

B0006284JQ|3.0|I don't care too much for how Britney Spears behaves, but why criticize her when its been going on for years? You think she's a slut and dresses skanky? I tell ya, I think George Michael with Wham! in their video \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go\\" was just as bad. I mean, George Micheal with his short shorts was scary. Anyways, my point is, I like her music, not her. Besides, its her life. As for the CD, all the songs are good, but where was \\"Don't Let me be the last to know\\" and \\"From the bottom of my broken heart\\"? I thought those were some really good hits.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Well, Star Trek Insurection was the first nail in the coffin for this tired series. Nemesis was the last nail. I went to see this with high hopes it was better than the last which was basically an episode of the Next Generation. How disappointing that the this was the best the writers could come up with.  <br />I liked the character of Shinzon but he was poorly developed.  <br />There was no chemistry between the crew members or so it seemed to me. The slap in the face was when they killed Data who became the best character in the series and the only one to hold my interest.  <br />The writers seemed to just throw out another ST movie without thinking about a decent storyline and expect fans to accept it. <br />Maybe next time they should try taking more than 20 minutes to write a movie. Oh wait! There wont be a next time!
0380789035|5.0|I loved this book!!  This was the first book by Gaiman I read.  I fell in love.  It was such an original concept, and so well written.  Gaiman managed to merge the realistic and the fantastic.  Before I knew it, I was hooked.  I was totally immersed in his fantastic world.  I have since read every other book I could get my hands on by him.
0316666343|5.0|I've read poorly written books and books I could not put down.  This one, in particular, is one I feel I will remember for a VERY long time.  In this novel, you meet a family, a neighborhood and strangers, all touched in some way by the death of a young girl.  You meet these people, learn some of their deepest darkest secrets, through a clever, insightful, tragically touching narration of the dead girl herself.  The novel follows her family and the others who've been drug along by the death as time passes, the girl's murder goes officially unsolved and her family struggles with loss, hate, love and the fact that life goes on.  If anyone ever asks me for a suggested book - I'll suggest this one.  If I ever meet the author, I'll tell her how much I admire her craftsmanship.
B00005JNJT|5.0|In Christopher Nolan's capable hands, the Batman franchise finally gets the formula right: drop the camp and embrace the darkness. \\"Origin of superhero\\" stories are notoriously difficult to do well because we all know where they're heading. Fortunately, Nolan and co-writer David Goyer have focused on the right thing: it's not just how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, but why. Fear - where it comes from, how we beat it, and how it can be turned against others - is the theme here, and the Nolan/Goyer script is all the more interesting for it. They also recognise the imperative of telling a good story, offering us a well-crafted action/mystery plot which never drags despite needing to cover a lot of detail and carry a large freight of emotional and ideological complexity. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight. He's fresh enough for most viewers to accept him as not just another Hollywood star in a rubber suit, and talented enough to pull off what ends up being a pretty complex character: both terrified and terrifying, sometimes simultaneously. He's impressive enough to be a credible superhero, yet fallible enough to be endearing. The big-name supporting cast are excellent, with the exception of the relentlessly banal Katie Holmes who plays Gotham's fearless, mob-busting ADA as Joey Potter in a nice suit. But she's a minor quibble. It all comes together here: a great script, engaging characters, wonderful production design, neatly deployed music (which right from the outset cleverly makes potentially tedious expository scenes feel like part of larger sequences), gorgeous cinematography, imaginative but never overpowering use of CGI, and perfect pacing. \\"Batman Begins\\" doesn't quite follow the mythology laid down in the graphic novels (which isn't internally consistent anyway) but it does prove what their readers have long known: it's not just the pretty pictures, guys - it's those wonderfully tortured characters, their desolate urban milieu, and the way it all grips your dark imagination. Nolan knows that, and he really nails it here. This is the Batman movie you've been waiting for.grips your dark imagination. Nolan knows that, and he really nails it here. This is the Batman movie you've been waiting for.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|The Iliad is immortal, and the actors characterizations ofAchiles, Hector, Agamemnon, Menelaos, and even Helen were vivid and reasonably true to Homer's monumental tale. But Hollywood just can't leave a perfect story alone - so Achiles is given a hugely unlikely love interest and has his death by an arrow striking his only vulnerable body part, his heel, postponed until Troy fallsAnd where is the important doom predictor, Cassandra? Also, no swordsman in his right mind would resort to aerobatics to launch an attack - he woulf lose the power of his back and legs behind his sword stroke. Still, the faults are insignificant on the canvas of this grand epic.
B000062YB1|5.0|Since this was Slayer's first C.D. of the 1990's, some fans had to be worried about the direction of their music. But fear not.\\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" was just as intense and extreme as anything turned out in the `80's. This band did not change their sound and did not make their metal any slower- - not yet, (as of 1990) at least.<br /><br />Like all Slayer albums (especially from the 1980's), \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" is brutal, relentless, addictive, and full of exquisite musicianship and frenetic guitar work. The drum work here is also very fast- - so fast that, if this were any other band, it would probably be the propelling force behind the beat. But since this is a Slayer album, it's the guitars that dominate the onslaught. I have no idea how Kerry King plays with this much force and precision. He could be totally screwing up his guitar part (by playing the wrong chord or something), and nobody would ever know because every riff runs, cascades, and flies by at a blinding, breakneck speed. At some points, the guitars are so fast that it's hard to distinguish one riff from another. The solos, however, aren't quite as scorching as before. They are slower and more professional.<br /><br />Next, it may be just my imagination, but I think Tom's voice is deeper, here. And since the music and vocals are this furious, Tom can't exactly sing a love song. Thus, the lyrics (i.e. \\"Razor's edge/outlines the dead/incisions in my head\\") are just as violent and gruesome as they ever were.<br /><br />Finally, an album isn't memorable if it is fast and heavy, but doesn't have any hooks. This album isn't typically heavy; it won't be stuck in your head all day and you can't really tap your foot to it, but \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" is still very catchy, in its own way.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"War Ensemble\\" opens with a really fast drum solo. This wild, all-over-the-place drumming remains throughout this song, but the opening riffs sort of sound like lasers, making this song not unlike Pantera's \\"Cowboys from Hell.\\" The guitars proceed to chug fast, then there's seamless tempo change and the riffs become lumbering. Up until the guitar solo near the end, it sort of sounds like drummer Dave Lombardo is trying desperately to keep up with the beat, which is driven by the axemen Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman.<br />\\"Spirit in Black\\" has more ferociously fast riffs. Even though these riffs sometimes sound almost punky, this is still a thrash song. I don't know any punk songs that have shrieking guitar solos.<br />\\"Expendable Youth\\" marries a pounding rhythm with Tom's squealing vocals, which echo \\"Jesus Saves\\" from the \\"Reign in Blood\\" album. There are some more super fast riffs (which blend into each other), as well as a pair of guitar solos.<br />\\"Dead Skin Mask\\" is a classic Slayer tune. It takes things down a notch and slows down the pace of the album, which was a good idea (so it doesn't become monotonous). This song begins with chugging riffs, then the riffs slow down even more, before going back to the speedier, opening riffs. Three more guitar solos are included; the first of which is only audible in the left headphone and sounds almost classical, a la Judas Priest. The second is audible in only the right headphone, and the third solo winds and bends and goes up and down.<br />\\"Hallowed Point\\" is another relentless sprint. It begins with Tom briefly breathing in, then the beat kicks in, the vocals begin almost immediately, and the song is rocketed full blast until around three minutes and twenty seconds, when there's a beat change.<br />\\"Born of Fire\\" has a 50-second long intro, which is shockingly slow and consists of just light strumming. Even when the beat becomes faster, this song has a mid-tempo pace. And I enjoy the deceptively kind lyrics that Tom spouts, here: \\"I need a friend; please be my companion.\\"<br /><br />Musically, \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" is equally as great as \\"Reign in Blood;\\" but \\"RiB\\" was definitely a bigger milestone, so \\"Seasons\\" isn't quite as great as that 1986 landmark--but, then again, can you think of a C.D. that is?<br /><br />In conclusion, Slayer definitely live up to their name with this album. Everything on here (crazy drum work, careening guitar riffs and solos, tortured vocals, beat/tempo changes) makes \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" another classic album from the thrash metal titans and essential listening for metalheads.ut, then again, can you think of a C.D. that is?

B0009A40ES|2.0|As much as I love the film, American Psycho, I can't help but feel cheated by this \\"Uncut Killer Collector's Editoin.\\" There is only one minute, and I'm not exaggeration, of extra \\"uncut\\" footage. Not only that, but the footage is almost unnoticable. The only decent attributes of the DVD itself are the new deleted scenes, however there are only four. The rest of the speical features were junk, a TV special on the 80s, which I didn't care for, and a reading of an essay by some Blonde chic. Huge sell out if you ask me.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|OK for those who are posting \\"This is Not For Children\\" need to stop. The movie is rated \\"R.\\" Of course its not for children! Neither is southpark, orgazmo, or anything else trey and matt have created. The humor is for adults and I think It's one of the funniest thing I've seen in a long long time. Its totally off color, if you are looking for Gumby or Davey and Goliath go somewhere else. Part of the joke is that it's puppets, for the same reason people like Triumph the insult comic dog.  <br /> <br />So for those who would mistake this for a childrens movie, either you are incredibly sheltered or have no idea what your children should be watching.  The text on the top \\"From the creators of South Park\\" should tell you enough. <br /> <br />
B00005A46T|3.0|In 1999, when their full-length debut was released, Slipknot were thought to be \\"a fluke.\\" 26 months later, the nine man band released their second C.D. Unfortunately, \\"Iowa\\" didn't get rid of those first critics, and it even brought on an additional label. In addition to being a fluke, these Iowans were now \\"an abomination.\\"<br /><br />It is my opinion/theory that, when Slipknot wrote \\"Iowa,\\" they tried to include every band member into about every song. The result is a sound which is cacophonous, monotonous, cluttered, and often ugly. Some parts of this album sound more like a garbage disposal than real music. This is not what heavy metal-even the most brutal heavy metal-is supposed to sound like.<br /><br />Three years after \\"Iowa,\\" \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\\" was released. This album also alienated some \\"maggots\\" (Slipknot fans), but, compared to its predecessor, \\"Vol. 3\\" was quite refreshing; its guitar notes are a lot cleaner, and the overall sound is a lot more harmonic and focused. There are a few things that would explain this increase in quality: the band members took their time when writing it, and \\"Vol. 3\\" also fused some melody into the metal. However, I choose to believe that Slipknot achieved this improved sound by not being overly worried about making sure every band member contributes equally.<br /><br />\\"Iowa\\" does present a new sound for Slipknot; it's the band's most raw, hard hitting and brutal album to date. One could even argue that it is their most inspired record. However, a new sound doesn't always mean a step forward. Slipknot's sophomore outing shows no signs of maturity or any other form of musical growth. Slipknot simply took advantage of their talent, potential, and fame, and made a C.D. that I can best describe as \\"thrash/death metal gone overboard.\\" Now, since there are some OK guitar riffs and talented, all-over-the-place drumming, you might wonder why I call this album \\"ugly.\\" Well, aside from sounding cluttered, the biggest problem \\"Iowa\\" has might be Corey Taylor's overly violent, unnecessary, and usually out of place bellows.<br /><br />But I don't want to sound overly harsh. Most of \\"Iowa\\" is still listenable (especially if you're a metalhead), it has some other good qualities (like being Slipknot's most intense album), and, when you listen to them in small doses, there are even some good songs. The infamous \\"People=Sh-t\\" opens with a pounding rhythm and two ascending yells, \\"Disasterpiece\\" chugs and pounds equally as heavy, \\"Heretic Anthem\\" is another famous song and a centerpiece of Slipknot's live shows. It has two guitarists playing the same chugging riff, then the drums and vocals kick in and the beat explodes. This song has a nice steam rolling beat, stereo rattling guitar noise, and a mosh pit ready shout along chorus of: \\"If you're 555, I'm 666!\\" Whether you want it to or not, this song will get stuck in your head. Next, \\"Gently\\" might be the album's all around best song. Very dark and slow paced, with even some whispers and spoken word vocals. But \\"Gently\\" is my favorite because of the introspective and somber lyrics. Finally, the beginning of \\"Skin Ticket\\" is so eerily calm and restrained, it almost quivers, but the end is centered around Corey's throat-straining bellows. This part of the song makes for a very uneasy listen, but I enjoy how this song's lyrics change from \\"Come see my cage, built in MY GRAIN\\" to \\"Come see my cage, built in MIGRAINE.\\"<br /><br />So, \\"Iowa\\" definitely has some ugly and unlistenable parts, but when you listen to this album in small doses, and listen to the songs one-by-one, you'll realize this isn't terrible music, either. You can blame the ugly parts of this album on a number of things: an overpopulated band, a lack of melody, or on just sloppy songwriting- -but whatever the case, I think there's no denying that this album did not live up to the band's potential and it did not showcase their ability to write good music. So, \\"Iowa\\" was just a big mistake. This C.D. is worth checking out and it will probably keep you entertained for a few months, but if you want an album that's as brutal as but better than \\"Iowa,\\" get Slipknot's debut. In conclusion, unless you're a diehard maggot, you should skip this one.g out and it will probably keep you entertained for a few months, but if you want an album that's as brutal as but better than \\"Iowa,\\" get Slipknot's debut.

B00005UW9T|1.0|If there is anything lower than making an animated childrens movie about the brutal murder of a family, I don't know what that would be. Those who made this should be ashamed.
B0000025DV|5.0|I wanted this album since it came out when I was a kid. I didn't have the money and later got into different things. Now at 38, I finally have this wonderful work. This is one of their best. It makes me happy from beginning to end. Why can't more bands be this good? The best part- no one has ever sounded like this band. And dare I say no one ever will.
B000006TRV|5.0|I own and love this album precisely because it is not played on MTV. Our culture is doomed.
B000002GH1|5.0|There aren't many albums today that you can listen to from start to finish and love every song - Simple Minds shows how. It's certainly different from the previous albums - but then if it were the same people would complain about it anway. All that hot air about their bombast is rubbish. Once Upon A Time in its own right is one hell of an album, that if you like the sound you'll love it all the way through, and if you didn't then you'd save a couple of bucks so good on you.    Ghostdancing, Oh Jungleland, Sanctify Yourself - I could be listing all the tracks but these are simply alive and kicking. And Robin Cook adds a touch to this album that makes it special, you want to hear her in every track. She did for Simple Minds what Oleta Adams did for Tears For Fears in Sowing the Seeds - another revolution but that's another story. And rightfully they have her winding up Alive and Kicking during the Amsterdam tour, I wish that was on record (sadly it's not the same one as that captured in the Live in the City of Light double album)    I only wish they'd release this complete with all the B Sides and extended versions - the extended version of All The Things She Said is an absolute gem - they simply don't make them like this anymore.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|If you were expecting another cinematic exploration of the beautiful complexities of romantic relationships, you'd be well served to take a raincheck on CLOSER. This film is absolutely scathing as it delves into the sordid state of affairs revolving around the core group of four romantically (for total lack of a better description) linked individuals and leaves behind a rather bloodstained and bleak outlook on love and human nature. Yet, with all that being said, the absolutely transcendent performances from Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and most notably the near charming ghoulishness of Clive Owen's alpha-male extraordinaire makes this film deceptively engaging. The dialogue isn't going to entice anyone's sweet old grandmother over for a viewing but it is unquestionably complex, humourous, appalling, and even comedic at times. It's akin to watching a train wreck; you know you should force yourself to look away but there's just something too magnetic about watching four beautiful love-challenged characters eviscerate one another with words and actions. It's one kick to the groin after another and an absolutely unflinching exploration of the dark side of destructive relationships and the personalities behind them. This motley crew of lovers has hardly any redeemable qualities about them. Everybody's a cheater, a bold-faced liar or a complete hypocrite at one moment or another. However, without the brilliant readings courtesy of the film's stars, the movie would be little more than couples swearing and doing unspeakable acts to one another. After watching CLOSER, you'll feel wiser, perhaps a little cynical, and hopefully properly-schooled in the art of how not to treat your significant other.   <br /> <br />
B00005YUPO|3.0|The music is great and the images/items are okay.  I didn't start showing this video to my son until he was about 4 or 5 months and he quickly lost interest in it because there wasn't anything in particular going on.

B000002UCN|3.0|Released in 1976 without the artist's input, \\"The Best of George Harrison\\" is an unusual greatest hits collection since it includes several Beatles-era recordings. Nevertheless, the album features all the essential solo hits from the early 1970s, along with the \\"Bangla Desh\\" single. The only clunker is a poorly sung \\"Dark Horse.\\" Otherwise, it's a good - not great - introduction to Harrison's work.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I jumped on the Coldplay bandwagon early on.  With the release of the single, \\"Yellow,\\" I became an avid fan, so the breakout success of \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" was no huge surprise to me.  These guys deserved the accolades and sales.  I was thrilled for them.<br /><br />How on earth, though, do you follow that up?  Few other bands have had to face the same level of expectations.  Of course, I had to buy the new album to find out for myself the results.  \\"The Speed of Sound\\" wasn't the best single I'd heard from Coldplay, but my hopes remained high.<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't blown away.  X & Y did not hit me with the instant impact of \\"A Rush of Blood...\\"  Although I liked the songs \\"What If,\\" \\"Fix You,\\" \\"White Shadows,\\" and \\"Twisted Logic,\\" nothing grabbed me by the throat.  Not instantly.<br /><br />Then I gave X & Y a second, a third, a fourth spin.  The nuances of the songs and vocals, the simple passion of the lyrics, the understated power hit me.  Don't give up on this one.  Put on headphones, turn off the TV and cellphone, and really let this soak in.<br /><br />Coldplay has not forsaken the ABCs of good songwriting; they've stayed true to their politic stances; they've written a mindblowing album without selling out.  They haven't taken on any messiah complexes (as U2 has been prone to do at times) and they haven't turned defiantly enigmatic (as Radiohead has done once or twice).  Coldplay continues to do what they do best: write memorable melodies that grab us by the heart and mind at the same time.  Now that's quite a feat.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This album is amazing!!! Every song is a genious. My personal favorite would be Telegraph Road. Dire Straits are definately the <br />best band in the history of rock and roll, ever!! Now, here's how <br />I feel about every song on this album. <br /> <br />(1) Telegraph Road: 10/10: This is a great way to open this album. It starts out with nothing. It is based on a true story. <br />This is my favorite song on the entire album! It is a very long <br />song, 14 minutes of great excellence. I love the ending, the ending is just awesome!!! <br /> <br />(2) Private Investigations: 9/10: Nice acoustic work!! I like <br />the lyrics. This song is a favorite to most Straits fans. I like <br />the loud heavy metal guitar.  <br /> <br />(3) Industrial Disease: 10/10: One of my favorites on this album. <br />This song has funny lyrics and is a track you can rewind. My favorite part is Doctor Parkinson. Great song. <br /> <br />(4) Love over Gold: 9/10: One of the best acoustic songs ever!! <br />Nice lyrics added to it. It doesn't gain 10 because it isn't a <br />song you can listen to over and over again but still really good. <br />One of Mark's best work. <br /> <br />(5) It Never Rains: 10/10: One of the greatest closers in the history of rock and roll! This is my second favorite on this behind Telegraph. I love the heavy metal guitar at the end, its <br />just awesome!!  <br /> <br />Go buy this now!!!
B0000028SR|3.0|Though I understand the conflicting reviews on this very uneven album, I never understood the derision that people have for \\"57 Channels\\".  It is perfect tale of modern ennui. Even though the song's character has it all, he still feels empty and cannot connect with others (including his wife) in a meaningful way. Springsteen uses the television as a metaphor, with it's facade promises and \\"reality\\" shows to envince this lack of fufillment and alienation that so many feel. The couple in the song think they can find the answers to their problems by pointing their satellite dish, like a beacon to the gods, \\"into the stars\\". But the message that comes back is void of anything genuine. This is what is significant about the Elvis reference. Ostensibly he had everything, but nothing that was emotionally real. And that bass ROCKS! (Not to mention the spector like howls and erie echo voices). <br /> <br />In fact the first five tracks are some great rock and roll.  The title track, though derivitive of \\"Tunnel of Love\\" is dynamic and well-paced.  \\"Soul Driver\\" is moody, has a great organ riff and a strong melody (how come so few folks care for this one either I'll never know).  \\"Cross My Heart\\" is a great, catchy adaptation of a classic blues tune, and \\"Gloria's Eyes\\" has searing guitars and powerhouse vocals. <br /> <br />But then we hit, \\"With Every Wish\\".  \\"Be careful what you wish for\\", wow Bruce were did you come up with such an original theme?  And beautiful \\"Doreen\\".  That name ranks right up there with Gertude and Bertha on the romantic/poetic scale.  Not to mention one of the worst uses of poetic license I've ever heard; \\"rusty cans of beer\\".  Who the hell says that? It's \\"rusty beer cans\\" Bruce and you know it.  Talk about forcing the rhyme. All this and a muted trumpet against an annoying twang delivery. <br /> <br />\\"Roll of the Dice\\" has potential, but I always cringe at songs that use an excessive amount theme metaphors, and this one gets real cheesy with all the gambling ones. <br /> <br />\\"Man's Job\\"--Yuck!   \\"Real Man\\"- Double yuck! (Was my choice for worst Springsteen song ever until tracks came out and introduced me to \\"My Lover Man\\". <br /> <br />\\"All or Nothing at All\\" and \\"Long Goodbye\\" are okay. <br /> <br />\\"Pony Boy\\" is self indulgent and should have not been included. <br /> <br />Recommended for the first 5 songs.

While the Stones seemed radical at the time, history has proven that Mick Jagger is, and always has been, as conservative as they come. The Who, social rejects all, are the original punks and the greatest rock and roll band in history. And this is their crowning achievement
B00005JNJT|5.0|We Saw Batman Begins today. It was great! I'm not gonna spoil the story for you but it was sooooo cool! Batman showing how his machinary works, Bruce Wayne going thru all the torture to become A hero, Batman fighting 50 people all at once, it's just so amazing. So if you're going to see a movie this summer that is excellent, make it this one!
B00002E233|4.0|It's important as a reviewer to get biases out of the way.  The fact is I love shark movies.  Ever since watching Jaws years ago, I have been hooked.  Which is why I get excited when a decent shark movie actually pops up.      Honestly, this isn't that great of a movie.  It has all of the action cliches, and the sci-fi try to play God and get screwed in the process plot.  Add some intelligent sharks to the mix and it's definitely a recipe for a B grade horror film.  But honestly, with the exception of the stellar Jaws, what shark movie isn't a B grade horror film?      What it does do is keep the tension going.  And there are some moments of shock and surprise in it.  I loved the \\"we must pull together and not go quietly into the night\\" speech that gets cut brutally short.  That was a genuinely fun scene because it was almost tongue in cheek.  In all action movies, you have this point where someone has to rouse the morale of the group and to have this individual torn in half midway through the speech is just a perfect nod to that.      Overall, there are some great moments in it, some cool special effects, and the sharks are well done.  A silly premise, no doubt, but fun.  And with the mostly straight to video crap fests of shark movies, it's nice to see one that isn't half bad.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|I thought this movie was genius! It starts off with two men waking up in a filthy bathroom. As the movie goes by they try to figure out why someone would do this to them and the doctor tells stories and he has flashbacks of a couple of suspicous things happening to him over the past couple of days and he talks about the \\"jigsaw\\" killer who picks people who have made bad choices in life and are not grateful about the things that they are givin in life and he puts them in a situation were they have to basically mutilate themselves or someone else in order to live. Then it ends up that the two men are connected in some way and whoever the killer is he is watching them. This movie is very well packaged it has gore suspense and you will never ever ever figure out who the killer is. This movie is brilliant and I can't wait until the second one comes out. This is definitely a need to own movie for all of you Horror fans like me! <br />
B000002TQV|4.0|This is my first Radiohead CD and I didn't know what to expect. Radiohead and The Bends are really good because the instruments work great with nice vocals. When the album first takes off its enjoyable and by the end I didnt want to end, the CD is fulfilling. I'd say that every song serves a purpose and the Album never drags. A solid Album, fun to listen to, and worth every penny.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was seriously looking forward to hearing this album when it was promised that it would be back-to-roots rock. Having listened to this several times, with the same few, monotonous power chords still ringing freshly in my ears, I'm left wondering what these roots are. Here's a short list of why I'm putting this CD back in its case for the last time: <br />1. Mostly every song clocks in around 140 bpm... very formulaic <br />2. Grohl sings too much. Well, sings/wails/moans/yells too much. <br />3. Related to the above: Grohl doesn't actually have a great voice. Very limited range. <br />4. Grohl needs to learn how to write a good riff. There is nothing catchy, nothing memorable, nothing infectious. <br />5. I would have been happy with 8 or 9 good, solid tracks, not 20 tracks of filler. <br />6. \\"The Deepest Blues Are Back\\" is an insult to the blues - this song is a soppy rock ballad, not a hard-hitting, grooving, grinding, or otherwise enjoyable blues/blues-rock number, a la AC/DC, Aerosmith, the Stones <br /> <br />I could go on. But to people moaning about copy protection etc, I ask you this: what makes this album even worth ripping?

He wants to make sure the public believes that this is a real find, and the independent scientist will do that. Everyone is excited by the great find and confirm the meteor is as NASA claims.<br /><br />Then a little too late, the civilians uncover that the whole thing is just scientific hoax. But before the President can be briefed, the scientist become targets to a team of assassins. At this point two of the five civilians have been terminated and three are on the run across the Artic ice. Everyone our heros caome across and tell about this trickery end up dead. While running they not only need to get the truth out, but they need to determine who orchestrated this plot.
B00000IN5G|5.0|The 2nd release from bodom and nothing short of a masterpiece. This album in my opinion has the best music, but Alexi's voice has not matured yet as it did in their later work. Some of it is raw sounding which isnt a bad thing, but he uses some cleaner vocals in some of the chorus'/pre-chorus'. Some of the tracks can get a little bland with the singing, but the music is breath-taking. This album is for in depth bodom fans. If your just starting out, get hatecrew deathroll then work your way down.
B00000DG1R|5.0|This is definitely a CD Duran Duran fans should have in their collection. It features a great compilation of their truly greatest hits without a bunch of filler or lesser songs in between like some bands' \\"greatest hits\\" disks. Virtually every track is very enjoyable and you probably won't skip over any - if you're like me it's hard to pick your one favorite song on this disk because they're all good. You will not be disappointed as you are transported back in time to another era!
B000001DYJ|5.0|A lot of critics were very quick to dismiss this 1993 live album. Apparently it was some sort of sacriledge for Kiss to attempt to follow \\"Alive\\" and \\"Alive II\\".  Well, I picked up this album the year it came out, not knowing a whole lot about Kiss (I was one or two years old when \\"Alive\\" came out in 1975). And I mostly got it because the cover looked cool, I think.    But I loved it right away. Great sound, terrific, high voltage renditions of Kiss' best latter-day material...this is every bit as good as their first two live albums. Yeah, I said it.  These tight, focused performances are as gritty as anything Kiss has ever put out, and many of these live versions are even better and tougher than the studio originals. How can you resist stupid but exquisitely melodic and utterly lovable songs like \\"Take It Off\\" or \\"I Just Wanna\\"?  The chorus kinda sets the tone for this album. It goes something like this:  \\"I just wanna fuh- / I just wanna fuh- / I just wanna forget you!\\"    Gene Simmons roars his way through \\"Unholy\\" and \\"I Love It Loud\\", his demon persona in full flight even without the makeup, and lead guitarist Bruce Kulick admirably fills Ace Frehley's high-heeled boots.  This entire album is nothing but highlights, actually, from the opener \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" to the anthemic \\"God Gave Rock 'n' Roll To You\\" and an instrumental \\"Star Spangled Banner\\".  And in between you'll find terrific performances of the driving riff-rocker \\"Domino\\", the classic \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" and crowd-pleasers like \\"Lick It Up\\" and \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\". Vocally both Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons are in superb form, and Stanley's flexible tenor matches Simmons' huge, gravelly baritone perfectly. Alright, so \\"God Gave Rock 'n' Roll To You II\\" is pretty much a pop song, but it's a darn good one!    Big riffs, impossibly huge hooks, and lots of fist-pumping shout-along choruses have always been Kiss' trademark, and if you only ever get three (!) Kiss albums, make sure it's the three \\"Alive\\" CDs. Collectively they're better than any compilation, and this particular lightning bolt of a live album is just too much fun! You ought to have a special name for this kind of music. How about \\"bubblegum metal\\"?
B0009A1AS2|2.0|DT is a prog metal band. But i guess many fans focus more on \\"prog\\" than on \\"metal.\\" Though this album shows some metal sounds, where the hell is proggy sound? No creativity found. For the most of the songs, it's like once-you-hear-the-beginning-part-you-can-predict-the-rest. Like the other songs, Octavarium's 24 mins is completely wasted. They could use only 8 mins (ain't it more relevant to \\"Octavarium?\\")to express exactly same feelings. I think it's time to turn to different bands like Symphony X.
0143034901|4.0|THE SHADOW OF THE WIND was receommended by a friend who lives in Europe.  Although it was a New York Times Bestseller at some point, I must have missed it.  Since I visited Barcelona years ago and also am a lover of books I had great anticipation about this novel.  For the most part, the book was equal to my anticipation.<br /><br />At the center of the story is the young Daniel, the son of a Barcelona  book dealer and his serach for Julian Carax and his novels.  The first subplot introduces the reader to the blind Clara and her household, which Daniel quickly becomes a part of.  But this is the first of many subplots, perhaps too many.  Daniel's life becomes absorbed with the search for Julian and the reader becomes absorbed in the many subplots that reveal the tortured life of Julian Carax and the people who surround his life.<br /><br />It seemed to me that somewhere along the line the author forgot about Clara and at the end tells the reader what happens to her. Daniel's chance meeting with a homeless man and their ultimate friendship was pretty predictable. The author takes the reader through a labyrinth of characters that weave their way through the streets of Barcelona, some of which got almost too confusing.<br /><br />Somewhere around page 300 or so I kept getting the feeling \\"enough is enough.\\" I wondered how he was going to pull it all together at the end. Through many interlocking relationships, Ruiz Zafron brings the book to a close, but I felt that some of the endings were a little contrived.  But once you introduce a character you have to create an ending for them.  However, all in all I enjoyed the book.  For those who have been to Barcelona, there are many references to streets and locations.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth the read.
B00082IJ08|4.0|This is a really good follow up from the debut album. I recommend listening to Demon Days with headphones, although it sounds fresh anyway you listen to it(car, stereo,etc.). Highlights for me include Don't Get Lost In Heaven and Kids With Guns, but the whole album is un-skippable. If you like these guys then I recommend that you check out Deltron 3030 as well.
B00004RFFI|2.0|This film is a bit dated now, having come out almost ten years ago, but it still sports excellent special effects and, for its day, had amazing (and still amazing) CGI tornadoes.  However -- and this for me is a big however -- there's nothing else.  The plot is thinner than deli-sliced meat, the acting (Helen Hunt aside) is sophomoric, and the dialog would make a saint cringe.  Now, to err on the side of the actors, there wasn't much that could be done with the dialog -- it's like the Doublemint Twins wrote it.  Everything is repeated twice ... \\"Tornado at three o'clock!  Tornado at three o'clock!  I'm on it!  I'm on it!  Where's the road?  Where's the road?\\"  Stop the insanity, stop the insanity.  I can understand English quite well, especially when the actors are bellowing it out at 80 decibels. <br /> <br />Imagine \\"Speed\\" with worse dialog, but with more action and with less wooden acting than what Keanu Reeves delivers.  Now replace the bus with a red truck and the bomb with a series of tornadoes and you have \\"Twister\\".  I'll admit that I liked it when I saw it, the \\"wow\\" factor of the special effects being the draw for me, but now that I've seen it again I only notice the fast-slow-fast-slow pacing and the completely dreadful dialog.  This would make a decent rental for someone looking for mindless entertainment, but please don't buy it.
B0007P3582|2.0|50 Cent - The Massacre (G-Unit, 2005) <br /> <br />You love to hear the story. MC New Jack drops a great debut album but slips up on his second album. Yes, this is what's known as the sophomore jinx and it happens to a lot of your favorite rappers: Snoop, Nas, Jay-Z, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Nappy Roots, Da Brat, etc. Well, you can add 50 Cent to the list with his weak follow-up to Get Rich or Die Tryin called The Massacre. <br /> <br />Don't get it twisted, though. It is far from a flop because it went platinum in the first week and will continue to sell based on 50's name alone. But this is one of those albums that you'll buy and ten years later you'll look back it saying either, \\"Man, I listened to THIS back then?\\" or \\"G-Unit/Shady/Aftermath was really falling off back then.\\" <br /> <br />The first problem are the beats. Since Fiddy doesn't stray from his usual subject matter (blasting guns, getting high, telling girls to \\"shake it\\", dissing others), he needs dope beats to hold the listener's attention. Dr. Dre's presence isn't felt as much as on his last album and although 50 doesn't need all Dre tracks to have a hot album, it sure wouldn't have hurt. Mediocre production plagues the album throughout, even with the well-known producers. Eminem slips with \\"Gatman and Robbin'\\" and Hi-Tek's bad luck continues with \\"Get in My Car\\". <br /> <br />The second problem are 50's lyrics which, as I said before, haven't changed much. They are all rehashed topics from his  first album. His diss track, \\"Piggy Bank\\", is aimed at Fat Joe and Jadakiss. Although this beef is old news now, I find it funny that 50 is mad that the two rappers guested on his foe Ja Rule's \\"New York\\" song, and that song wasn't even a hit. Oh well, it got people to buy this album. If you do a few fast-forwards, there are a couple of good songs like \\"Ski Mask Way\\" (the chorus is based off of a Biggie line from the \\"Flava In Ya Ear\\" remix), \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\", the remix to The Game's \\"Hate It of Love It\\", and \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\". The latter uses the same marching band sample that Ghostface used for \\"Metal Lungies\\" last year but to 50's advantage, more people bought this album than Ghost's album so the beat might as well be new. <br /> <br />But that's it. There aren't many dope gangsta tracks to keep the thugs interested and the only singles released so far are for the ladies (\\"Disco Inferno\\", \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Just a Lil' Bit\\"). And judging from Eminem's mediocre album, Game's overhyped album, and Lloyd Banks' and Young Buck's album sales not even totalling as much as what 50 sold, the G-Unit/Shady/Aftermath dynasty seems to be fading. If you haven't picked up this album yet, just listen to Get Rich or Die Tryin' instead. You'll get the same effect but with better production. -EJR
B000007492|5.0|I have been an avid Supertramp fan since I was very young and currently own every Supertramp album. I recently bought this 'Very Best Of' compilation and did not regret it. I like basically every song on here (Take the Long Way Home is my personal favorite) and they even threw in 'School'. Hooray! <br /> <br />I like the fact that all the old bands are making a comeback (The Logical Song is pretty much overplayed where I live) and that hopefully this phase of rap/hip-hop and greenday wannabes will end. <br /> <br /> I will close with 3 words: <br /> <br />Buy This Album!
B0007GAERG|3.0|Mariah Carey - The Emancipation of Mimi (Def Soul, 2005) <br /> <br />It's The Return of the Voice as Mariah Carey comes back and eventually lands on top of the charts with The Emancipation of Mimi. Now, this album is pretty solid. But looking at the reviews--5 stars? To each his own, but I think most of those reviews are either by high schoolers or members of her fan club because this album is far from a classic. Also, the 1-star reviews are by people who make the rest of us non-5-star reviewers look silly (i.e., \\"she sounds like a dog\\", \\"she sucks\\"). So here is my non-biased review. <br /> <br />Emancipation starts off interesting enough. \\"It's Like That\\", produced by Jermaine Dupri, is no \\"Always Be My Baby\\" but it will grow on you. \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\" are pretty decent. \\"Mine Again\\" is a great ballad that has her hitting the high notes without oversinging. <br /> <br />And there lies the problem with this album: it seems as if Mariah's trying too hard to prove that her voice is back. All that criticism about her singing in whispers (that plagued much of Glitter and Charmbracelet) must have made Mariah go and sing almost every song in high notes (for example, \\"Your Girl\\"). Moreover, the middle of the album contains all of the mediocre songs (\\"Get Your Number\\", \\"Say Something\\"). The Kanye West-produced \\"Stay the Night\\" proves that Kanye's production doesn't work for everyone while the slower songs curiously sound like Usher's Confessions rejects (i.e., \\"One and Only\\", \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\"). <br /> <br />However, \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" is a great throwback to her days of the early '90s with the inspired vocals and background singers, proving that Mariah Carey is back, despite the few missteps. This is her most listenable album since Butterfly. -EJR
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This is certainly the strangest effort from the Mac's heyday. The whole album reels wildly from bracing, percussive pop-rockers such as \\"What Makes You Think You're the One?\\" (perhaps my favorite song on the album), to relatively simple songs such as \\"Over and Over\\" and \\"Sara\\" (the latter the best song Stevie Nicks ever came up with, including \\"Rhiannon\\"), and all-out weirdness (\\"Tusk\\") without batting an eye. The album is certainly dominated by Lindsey Buckingham, who provides the most challenging material on the album. His songs are twisted, skewed versions of the pop/folk/rock style that Fleetwood Mac had created previously. It is Buckingham who wrote most of the great songs on this album. It is also Buckingham who wrote most of the worst.    Don't get me wrong, his best stuff far overshadows his lesser works, and it's far more numerous. There are just a couple tracks of his that I dislike (\\"Save Me a Place\\" is one of the least of his songs). Stevie Nicks continues putting out excellent songs, especially the aforementioned \\"Sara\\" and \\"Sisters of the Moon.\\" Christine McVie still balances the gap between them; her best work includes \\"Over and Over\\" and \\"Never Make Me Cry.\\" But as I said, it is Lindsey Buckingham's work that steals the show. \\"The Ledge\\" is short, catchy, and a little off-kilter (the moment when the instruments die away, leaving the vocals suspended over nothingness, is genius). \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" is more of the same, great, twisted pop-rock. And, of course, there is that strange, menacing title track, which uses a marching band (believe it or not) to great effect. Somehow, it was a hit, but I think that was more based on career momentum. When Tusk was released, it seemed that nothing could stop Fleetwood Mac. Few expected the band to release such a challenging album after scoring a massive hit with Rumours. And while Tusk did go double-platinum, it was no success on par with their two previous releases. It's really a shame, because Tusk is everybit as good as Fleetwood Mac's self-titled album and Rumours.

B000244FDW|2.0|I'm turning into quite the collector of British classics that have been made into movies. I love the PRIDE & PREJUDICE story and own the A&E version with Ehle and Firth. So I thought I'd like another version of the story in my collection, and the reviews encouraged me to buy.  <br /> <br />But this is so dull, it becomes a struggle to sit through. It is like watching a stage play with exaggerated character reactions. Little seems to flow naturally. The dancing was stiff. The scenery was confined to a few look-alike parlors. <br /> <br />The emotion in the A&E version carried me away, while this one left me yawning.
6305252521|5.0|This review won't be very long because I saw this movie a while ago. I do remember having really enjoyed it though. The plot is fairly simple and very memorable, being about a man whose every day life is like a TV show. He doesn't realize it but he's always being watched and everyone he knows is part of this TV show. But the difference is that they know that they're part of it, while this man, Truman is completely unaware and doesn't know that everything that he does is being watched. He's basically on FOX everynight on \\"the life ot Truman\\".  <br />Jim Carrey once again is great but the difference about this movie from his others is that it isn't a comedy. This movie is a drama, a comedy, a family movie, etc.. It will make you laugh and feel sad. That's what's special about this movie. It's very unique and intriguing. Something this original needs to be watched.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|One of my top 5 DVDs of all time. The greatest dance / electronica CD ever made set to world-class anime. However IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PLAY THIS DVD IN THE RIGHT MOOD / SETTING. Watching it 3PM on a Tuesday afternoon will not work. I suggest planning an entire night - a Friday or Saturday - around watching this DVD. Invite friends - turn the lights off - turn the music up. Dance if you want. You won't be disappointed. ~ <br />
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie was released before I was born and I saw it at a sleepover a couple years ago. That prompted me to buy the DVD. The movie's very funny and is trully a classic that should be in everyone's collection.  <br />The movie's about Ferris Bueller, one cool guy who's about to graduate from high school. He then fakes like he's terribly ill and spends the day having fun with his best friend and girlfriend. He even gets to drive his friend's dad's ferrari.  <br />So, you imagine that he's in for a lot of fun. Yeah, he is. And so are you. The movie delivers plenty of laughs thanks to many things. First off, the plot's classic. The acting is great. And Bueller has to have fun while avoiding people he knows and has to race home before his parents come home. And his principal and sister are on to him and come looking for him.  <br />So there you have it, this movie is a classic that still makes me laugh even though I've seen it a lot. This isn't worth a rent but is worth a buy. Enjoy. It's a classic.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I KNEW I should have seen this movie in the theatres...but I rather stripped of the opportunity from that happening. I rented it and then eventually ended up buying it. Witty, smart, funny and clever all around. Only in this movie can you see records being used as weapons and a zombie adding vocals to a song. I am very happy with the ending they chose. I haven't seen a movie with such a clever ending in a while.  <br /> <br />I thought that the mix of comedy and the mix of \\"horror\\" went well. Before I watched it, I thought it was going to be more of a comedy than horror, and it was. However I'd say that the horror element they did use wasn't as censored as I thought it would be. There are deaths in the movie, there is blood and biting, etc.  <br /> <br />This movie is just a parody of movies like \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" \\"Land Of The Living Dead\\", etc. You start out with Shaun and his friend Ed living their lives and eventually Shaun has to deal with a breakup...after the breakup everything just unfolds.  It's like an equivalent of Scary Movie, but a different type of comedic effect. I know there are a lot of people who said that they don't get British comedy, and that they did not see as much humor as they thought they would have in SOTD. I think you just have to pay attention, because yes, some of the humor isn't all out there presented, sometimes the humor is in the image or in facial expressions or actions. I'd recommend to anyone who loves humor (and it's not all crude humor), comedy and zombie movies. Yeaaaaahhh booooyyyyy!
B00006WUWQ|4.0|This trilogy is worth your money and will give you one hell of a good time. There isn't really much for me to say about them though. The plots are very simple and pointless but the movies are absolutely hilarious.  <br />Mike Myers is genius and makes the movies funny because he plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bast***. That's lots of talent! <br />Beware because if you didn't know, these movies are very silly and dumb but will definitely make you laugh your head off.  <br />This is how I rate the three: <br />Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery- 4 stars <br />Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- 4 and 1/2 stars <br />Austin Powers: Goldmember- 3 and 1/2 stars
B000067J1H|3.0|Well I saw this with my boyfriend like a year ago and I just did not see what the big deal was. A lot of people like this movie. Aside from the eye candy (Norton and Pitt), I don't think it's a movie I could watch again. I know there was some symbolism in the movie, but I couldn't really follow. No doubt though that the acting was really good. I would have to say the way the story unfolded was interesting and it drew me in for a little bit. There were the fight scenes where you can witness lots of bleeding and punching. It has its humor, it has it's dark appealingness to it...it sounds good, but I guess I just wasn't interested. It is not your average movie and it is rather unusual. Maybe I'll try it again another time. I'd say watch it because I'm just one of the few who didn't get as much as we expected from it.
B00003CXA3|5.0|The French Connection is a very good movie that's a true classic. I loved it as did the Academy as it won 5 academy awards back when it was released in 1971: <br />Best actor- Gene Hackman <br />Best director- William Friedkin <br />Best picture <br />Best film editing <br />Best adapted screenplay <br /> <br />The movie is based on a true story involving drug trafficking. The story is that of two narcotics detectives in New York played by Gene Hackman (in his first academy award winning role) and Roy Scheider. They find someone suspicious so they wire him which leads them to \\"the frog\\" (frenchman). This frog has a mean bodyguard and they are from Marseille, in New York to sell drugs. But, since the detectives don't know this for sure, they follow them around. They need proof. I don't want to give away any spoilers but this is a must see. It has a classic chase, a huge stripping of a car, a mysterious white car, a bad encounter with a sniper, and a good ending.  <br />Gene Hackman was brilliant as a mean but good cop. He even dresses up as Santa Claus to get the job done. Hackman's has one classic line \\"wanna a milkshake?\\" where he mixes everyone's drugs together in a milkshake/ blender after making a bust.  <br />The movie will keep you fixated until the very end with the suspense, the humor, and the constant following of the frog. The 2 disc DVD set has many special features including trailers and deleted scenes. This is a must have for everyone's collection.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I don't know what all the hype was about, I don't know why this movie recieved any awards of any sort? I guess it was also supposed to be a bit of a comedy too? I think this will just be one of the movies I either don't get, or I saw the point but it was so small, I expected something bigger. I first saw a big chunck of this movie with a friend and even he was not amused at the movie. I tried to watch it two other times later to give it a try and I could not get through the whole thing. For me at least, I find this movie to be quiet, somewhat symbolic of something, and just stylish. It is stylish in a way that's not flashy, but trendy and artsy. I think it's hard to explain. I thought there was decent acting, but I don't feel that the actors were given much to do really. You do end up seeing a lot of nice scenes and images in Japan which I can appreciate. It is set in modern day Japan and you have Bill Murray and Scarlett J staring as the main actors...they end up forming a friendship (which I thought was going to turn into something more). You also see Anna Faris (Cindy fron Scary Movie) in kind of the same bubbly spirit.  <br /> <br />I gave this movie 2 stars but I'd like to really give it 2 1/2 because of the picture and color of it and its style. Other than that, I did not like it. If you tend to like movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Equilibrium and things like that, you will most likely not like this film. If you like Tom Hanks kind of films, this is probably right up your alley.
B00000K3UU|3.0|I own this DVD and I have to admit that I NEVER watch it. It was an ok movie but it's not aa good one to buy. It's a great rent with some very funny jokes that you'll laugh about for a while. But, because of the lame plot, and because it's lame at time and not funny, and because it's not a good but, I'm giving it 3 stars. The movie's about a guy that adopts a child to please his girlfriend. But she dumps him after cheating on him and doesn't care. The man doesn't have a big bond with the kid but it starts to develop. The man teaches his son a lot of bad habits like peeing in public, eating like a pig, and lets him name himself.  <br />The movie has some funny jokes but the movie kind of is lame and very childish and pointless at times. I guarantee that it will deliver some laughs but I don't think that this is one to own. Like most of Sandler's movies, they're good rents but not usually good buys.
B000683VI4|4.0|After hearing someone talk about it, and hearing about it, I decided to watch it because it was on demand. Yeah it was pretty good and I really liked the duo (both old and young). Also, there was some serious eye candy in there for me (and please don't call me a teenybopper, because I saw Ryan Gosling in other films before this). Now, as for recommendations, I think there will be a lot of people who will like this movie and some who won't. The people who won't would probably not like it because it is indeed a sappy movie, no joke. I'm sure there were boyfriends or husbands dragged to see this movie and they were probably rollin' their eyes throughout the whole thing, as long as some girls too. But I did think it was well put together and well acted. I thought the McAdams girl was absolutely adorable...along with Ryan...he just looked really good (in all of his movies).  <br /> <br />The movie is basically about a rich girl and a not-so-rich boy who fall in love but her parents are not so chill with this fact (yeah this is a common theme, but it turns out a bit different than most of those type of movies). I'm not gonna give anything away, so you have to see what happens. You'll see why it's called \\"The Notebook\\". While there were some rather sad parts, I would not consider this movie to be a tearjerker. If you like Gone With The Wind, Titanic and love stories like that, then I'd go see it. If you have no tolerance for sap and some cliches, then just don't waste your time. I don't watch much \\"chick\\" movies or romantic comedies, but I found this to be in my best word \\"pleasant\\".
0790731452|4.0|Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael J. Fox star in this funny movie. This is the kind of funny and whacky stuff that you can expect from director Tim Burton.  <br />The movie's pot is simple. Aliens are invading the earth.  <br />This is executed very well with the hilarious looking aliens.  <br />When the aliens arrive, a translating machine reads that what the leader said was \\"we come in peace\\". So, one lady releases a dove in the air which gets vaporised by the beam of one alien. The movie develops very nicely with a resistance by the humans. The movie is just really neat and cool and is also really funny. And for $5.49, this is a gimme. You can buy for 2 dollars more than a rent. This is a movie that I enjoy watching and that's a good addition to my collection.
0800177975|4.0|Update: 2/21/05    I've been fortunate enough to procure a beautiful widescreen version of the film in NTSC. Its wonderful being able to see the film the way it should be seen!     Chalk me up as happy Japan uses NTSC also and has the movie out in the Superbit series with DTS sound.    -end update-    Last Action Hero (1993)     ****    This is a fascinating movie. Take big star, add big action, add a bit of seriousness, then a bit of spoof then to finish it off add a interesting plot. You have Last Action Hero.    I've always thought this movie was brillant. You have obvious gags - The glass eye seen at Slater's exwife's house. The cop rotates it completely blowing up the house. Then the next scene Slater and Danny at the police station smoking - literally. I Other scenes are subtle; Robert Patrick leaving the Police station as the T1000 or elsewhere the hubcaps on Slater's convertible change for no reason. Also, look for the E.T. and Lethal Weapon gags.  The gags really get going about 15 minutes in.    My favorite line these days when Slater punches the Leutenent Gov. in the face. \\"Call me when the Governor gets here,\\" hilarious stuff now that Schwarzenegger is the California Govenator.     I can see why this movie failed. The average action fan doesn't like it when a movie is spoofing what it bills itself as. Action fans take their genre seriously.  You have have a specific style of humor you enjoy to get this. At points the movie almost has a cartoon style feel. That things happen for no reason. Personally, I think that adds to the charm of the whole thing. There is a comic book quality here.    The biggest outrage about this movie is the current DVD release. Full screen pan & scan? C'mon, other regions of world (R2, R4) have beautiful widescreen releases with some features and AC/DC's video for Big Gun. Why do we not have this? Flabbergasts me. Sony/Columbia Tri-Star should be embarrased for this terrible North American release.    I hearby call on Sony/Columbia Tri-Star to give us this title as Europe and Australia have. Thank goodness I have a region free DVD player. I have the R2 version of the movie. Looks sharp.     As for the movie is it deep and causes you to think about your place in the world? No, not even close. Is it a fun popcorn chomper that will have you veering to serious to spoof in a matter of seconds? Yes, absolutely. Is it worth seeing Ahnold spoof himself? Yes. The scenes where Slater comes into the real NYC - fascinating, serious and fun.    Bottom line - this movie weaves serious, spoof, danger and brings it all home in the end. Its a cerebal movie you have to stay with from beginning to end to understand it. Catching it 25 minutes in on TV, more than likely you'd be lost.     Good stuff. Now, Sony/Columbia Tri-Star... get this awful pan & scan version off the market and give us the nice release Europe and Australia have!
B00092ZL80|5.0|If you did not see this incredible tour last year here is your chance. Almost 3 fantastic hours from two of the greatest rock & R n B bands of all time. The beginning and ending where both bands are onstage is worth the purchase price alone! If you are a fan of either band or a fan of 70's music in general this is one not to miss! If this great show comes to your town this year you should go see it live as well. The early reviews are that it is great as well.     Time for an edit in of gripes with some reviewers.    1- Jay L. Rudko - Hey Jay my boy Peter Cetera has been a solo act now for 20 years. If you expected him the show up for this show, you must really be Rip Van Winkle. And Jason Scheff does the majority of Peter's songs. Keith only does one or two depending on the set list.    2- Nathan - Hey Nate that \\"Medley\\" you refer to is the \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\" written by Jimmy Pankow See Chicago II for the original studio version. And Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away is presented as it was on Chi 16 (with a repeat helping of Get Away and some horns added on HTSIS) And what \\"Lesser known songs\\" are you referring to? Also PC left of his own accord and Champlin was brought into the band cause it was thought that Robert Lamm might leave the band at some point. And how can you say Jason and Bill's singing is inadequate, versus who???? PC's voice isn't all it used to be either.    3 & 4 - Emacomber & Bluzman - You two make zero sense at all, and that is more than enough to be said about the two of you except to say that I am sure that Maurice would love to be healthy enough to still be touring with EWF. Sadly he has Parkinsons Disease and can not tour. But I do understand that he will be on EWF's new studio CD due out this summer!
B000089RV6|4.0|Personally, I think this album is one of the greatest albums recorded so I have to give it a good amount of stars even if I don't think this is worth buying. Then again I also own an original LP in M/NM condition from one of the early recordings and let me tell you, there is NO WAY that this album compares to the LP. Yes, if u have a bad LP player or a scratched disc the CD is better. All I'm recommending is that you buy the original CD release of this album if you want a CD. It doesn't have all the doohickey's and extras that can break/be torn/distract from truly good music. The bass is extremely empowering in this album but where it picked up, it also began to lack in other places. The high end notes are not as crystal clear as they should be. I think it has to do with targeting younger teens who want enormous bass without REALLY caring about the music quality. <br /> <br />Another point I want to make is that the extra packaging **** is definately not worth it. If you're on Amazon, you probably have some internet knowledge and can find the same stories/pics on the web. It's a waste. It's not as structurally sound as a regular CD case, even though CD cases aren't strong to begin with. <br /> <br />If you want great AC/DC music, here is NOT the place to get it. Go try to find an LP, it's so worth it. There are better ways to get this album if you want it. You MUST have this album if you like Rock at all. I think whoever made this album is listening to AC/DC's and living for the money and stealing from us all 'cause this digipack is nothing special over any of the other releases of this album.
B0000C1733|1.0|Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs on this album - but this is a collection of their commercial successes, not their greatest music.  There earlier stuff ( their best stuff in my opinion ) is not well represented.  While all the chart-toppers from the last 3 albums all there, songs like 'Fight Like A Brave', 'Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky' and 'Backwoods' have been left out.  Personally, I would consider \\"What Hit's\\" if you are looking for the Chili Peppers from the late 80's / early 90's.
B000002L75|5.0|I actually think this is a better album than \\"Black Celebration\\".  Both have good songs, but the over all feel of this album seems more cohesive.  I also enjoy the sampled percussive elements of this recording more, which is somewhat lacking from \\"Black Celebration\\".  This album had more recognizable singles, which I think is why most prefer \\"Black Celebration\\".  \\"Black Celebration\\" will always have a kind of awkward mystery to it.  For those who may not have heard \\"Some Great Reward\\" beyond the two lead singles \\"People ar People\\", and \\"Master and Servant\\", you're actually missing out on some great songs.  \\"Something To Do\\" is one of those great DM songs about being bored and a bit naughty.  \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" is a good example of how a meadering verse can make a great chorus sound amazing.  For me this is the better of(what I consider) the two transitional albums for DM. If you buy \\"Black Celebration\\" you should also pick this one up as well.
1400032717|4.0|This book is interesting because the narrator is an Autistic boy. It is nice to experience the world from his point of view. It is a very light read.
B00008V5VN|4.0|This is great stuff.  It's basically like one of the many Melvins' EP's (\\"Eggnog\\", \\"Lysol\\", \\"Colossus\\", \\"Prick\\", etc.) where the music is the slowest, heaviest, sludgiest sludge for one or two tracks that span the length of the CD.  This is something that is very hard to pull off.  Being able to keep a consistent sound while still keeping the attention of the listener requires raw talent and subtle originality.  Many underground metal bands have attempted this, but few (Melvins, Swans, Earth, Godflesh, Isis) can pull it off really well. <br /> <br />After listening to this CD several times through, I think sleep \\"gets\\" it.  They manage to keep my attention for an entire hour on the first track.  The sparse vocals, when they appear, are aggressive and on top, but not invasive.  The hooks and rhythms are wonderful.  It basically sounds like a really great \\"Dope Smoker\\" jam session.  Most people know what \\"stoner\\" jam sessions sound like (ELP, Grateful Dead, etc.).  They're either something that you like, or not.  Not that this is like the Grateful Dead.  The music here is harsh, loud, and wonderful. <br /> <br />This is definitely worth a listen.  I do think it sounds a little bit too much like the Melvins at some points.  The vocals are almost exactly like Buzz Osborne's.  Fortunately, it's not an exact copy or rip-off, and is still a great CD on its own merits.  If you like sludge guitars and jam sessions, definitely pick this up.
0975991477|5.0|Given so many reviews already, I just wish to add my appreciation and thanks for the book.  I was thrilled to watch Lipton's \\"The New Biology\\" videotape a few years ago and even more impressed to hear him in person with slides, animations and movie clips last January.  Short of such opportunities, the book with many pictures and diagrams, will be a good introduction.  It is rare to find a highly qualified research scientist being able to present his ideas in such a simple, personal, lively and engaging way.<br /><br />The book is much more systematic than the documentary \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\".  Both open up new horizons and will stir up much debate.<br /><br /> We are not just determined by our genes.  Our environment, thinking and beliefs all play an important part in the creation of our own destinies.  It is a message of hope and challenge.  Such a world-view has tremendous implications for spirituality, healing, education, parenting and the building of a more loving and peaceful world community.
0743420373|2.0|I was discussing finances or something with a friend of mine, who then suggested I read this book. I did, anticipating something extraordinary and was disappointed. <br /> <br />The advice was simple, which did not surprise me. Many times, seemingly complex problems - i.e. getting wealthy, losing weight, etc. - revolve around simple principles. In general, eat less calories than you expend and you will lose weight, save and invest more money than you spend and you can begin accruing wealth. These are both oversimplifications, but the point is the same.  <br /> <br />This book is not a radical source of information on how to acumulate wealth. Rather, it tries to expose the fact that often the people who seem the wealthiest are not. Again, little surprise for me. <br /> <br />What I disliked so much about this book was the anecdotal style, and the way I felt as though I were contantly being talked down to. While this may have just been me, I felt the writing style contributed greatly to this. It was overly simplistic and built up to the \\"great revelations\\" that the authors italicized, just in case we missed the facts in the tables or graphs. This whole thing was repeated over and over again in almost every chapter. <br /> <br />I didn't examine their selection methods, but I am planning on going back and looking them over. In this book, the authors refer, in an anecdote of course, some Texas millionare who doesn't look the part of a wealthy person, and talks about how a lot of the seemingly \\"wealthy people\\" have big hats and no cattle - that is to say they are all show and no substance.  <br /> <br />That really sums up my feelings on this book. Ok I get the basic concepts. In fact I knew them before I started this book. The text itself is more a overview of the results of the author's survey than it is a tool with which to help the reader accumulate wealth. The problem is that the authors' mention this as a goal of the book, but don't follow through. <br /> <br />Read this book if you like. I honestly can't recommend it. On occasion, it is mildly interesting, but don't read it and expect to get anything sound to help you out in your finances.
B00005JMX6|1.0|I like T&A as much as the next guy, but this movie is pure trash.  But that's not its worst transgression -- I haven't seen a movie this dumb since...  Well, since I don't know when. <br /> <br />Very simple things are completely botched.  For no reason whatsoever. <br /> <br />1)  The kid gets a nosebleed at a formal function.  He spends the entire evening with a bloody smear under his nose.  Does he bother to wipe it off?  Does his date?  No, certainly not. <br /> <br />2)  We think (spoiler!) he's making a porno during his prom.  But surprise, he's making a sex ed film.  With porn actresses.  It's not so much about the biology of sex and how to prevent disease as it is about teaching different sexual positions -- in as raunchy a way as possible.  Just what sex ed is all about!  Because hey, that's where teens are really lacking -- knowledge of sexual positions.  His parents are totally fine with it, of course.  Who are these parents? <br /> <br />3)  The porno producer (who acts more like a pimp) bursts into the kid's class and forcibly hauls him out.  No one seems to care.  Where is this school? <br /> <br />4)  Time and time again the kid goes off alone with the producer despite clear evidence that he's psychotic. <br /> <br />5)  The \\"girl next door\\" thinks it's okay to make the kid strip naked in the street after knowing him for ten minutes, but she's offended when he wants to have sex with her.  Um, yeah. <br /> <br />6)  Much is made of the need to shoot the sex ed film in multiple locations within the school -- the half-naked porn actresses have to scurry through the halls from one location to the next, and a crew person trips and breaks a piece of equipment.  But why?  There's absolutely no need. <br /> <br />On the issue of whether the film is funny...  I did laugh at how dumb it was.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I cannot come up with enough good things to say about this album.     Lyrically, Kanye tears it up. Clever rhymes and succinct sharp lyrics are standard here, which raises the bar for the competition. Some people have complained that the skits are not all that funny. I disagree. However, I regularly listen to this album without them, which suggests they are not a key component of the overall work's effect. I would suggest eliminating them though, in the spirit of tightening the entire  album.    The released singles were well-chosen in my opinion, though my favorite songs are not among these. The two most outstanding tracks for me are \\"Two Words\\" and \\"Family Business.\\" The former relies on the instrumentation and the choir for its charge, while the latter comes off as the most heartfelt song of the album.    \\"Spaceship\\" and \\"Never Let Me Down\\" are two other juggernauts. \\"Never Let me Down\\" showcases the lyrical prowess of Jay-Z, Kanye, and ?? (I can't remember the 3rd person,) while the female vocals add to the overall effect.    Kanye knows his stuff. He picks the right people to work with and it shows. This album deserves every piece of praise it receives, as does Kanye. People have commented on his cockiness, but when you're this good, you can say whatever you want and its ok.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I don't want to regurgitate every positive thing everyone else has said, so I will keep this very brief. This was without a doubt, the best movie I have seen in the last few years. I was 100% riveted, 100% of the time. This movie is a must see. The visuals are genius, and even the cheesy film noir dialog is perfection. Period.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Now, I have to admit....I havent been a big fan of theirs since \\"The Colour and the Shape\\". The albums they seemed to bring out since then, tended to annoy me. But, this time around... I heard \\"best of you\\" on the radio and I have to say, it really caught me. Because of that, I was curious as to what the rest of their album would sound like.  <br /> <br />SO, I went to a music store and listened to all their tracks and I was pleasently surprised by what I heard! And the coolest thing about this album is that it's a dual disc. First disc: Loud. 2nd: Not so loud. SO you just get best of both worlds. <br /> <br />Of course, there's some songs on the album that I have still yet to get used to... but for the most part, I've found pleasure in this album!  <br /> <br />It's definitely an album to check out.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I love Green day. I am from the bay area. Green Day is legend here. American Idiot was an outstanding album. And was truly amazing. With songs like jesus of surburbia and wake me up when september ends (my personal favorite), make this album great.  <br /> <br />On the othr hand I feel as if the old stuff. I liked it better when they were three kids on narocotics and hallucinogens. Then again I am not a big person when it comes to politics.  Do you know what green day means??? It's a term in Berkely used that means you spent the whole day out smoking your bongs and weed. This is not green day. You want to compare huge green day songs. Fine then...Basket Case v.s American idiot. Basket case. Good riddance vs. BVD of Broken dreams. Good riddance. Brain stew v.s. Holiday. I dunno I would prefer Brain stew, but you might like something different. Minority v.s St. Jimmy. Minority hands down.  When I come around vs. Wake me up when september ends. When I come around. Warning vs. homecoming. warning.  <br /> <br />Although I must say this album shows a big sign of maturity on Green Day's part. That's great, but come one green day go back. I know some of you will not say this review helped you or give me negative votes and you can do that. Watever. But honestly who are you foolin. You know their old stuff is better. But hey I'm suppose to talk about the album. so go buy this album, because no matter what I just said it is unanymous that its a great album. Go buy it. songs that stuck out to me... 1. Wake me up when september ends (closest thing to their old stuff). 2. jesus of surburbia (love the solo Tre' Cool) 3. Homecoming.(somebody get me outta here (those are some lyrics in it.)) (also like there old stuff).
B000031XCR|5.0|This album gathers its better songs of an entire decade, but 7 new songs, in which you highlights the first Single That's  The Way It Is which had very good acceptance, the simple ones that continued him were not good, but in all ways celine  is a Very Complete artist, its Voice it is Of The best In the World, the 4 Single I want You To Need it is I a Very Beautiful Ballad As all those that Celine Interprets, I wait that after its not So successful Album One Heart, return to these ballads and not to a Mediocre pop music.
B000085RTZ|4.0|This band rocks. I am a huge fan of the prog-metal genre, and this is the CD that got me into it in the first place. I heard it on iTunes Snakenet Metal radio, which you should check out. This CD is an epic masterpeice, better then the Black Halo or Karma. Center of the Universe is my favorite track, the opening riff is just amazing. The coldest winter night is a great power ballad, so flick your bic, everyone! This CD is a great place to start off with this band, it worked for me. This is possibly the best CD of the Decade.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Q:  Take a rock n roll band with horns, mix it with a mystical funk group and what do you get? <BR>A:  A sparkling new concert DVD combining the music of two classic horn bandsChicago and Earth, Wind & Fire Live at the Greek Theatre. (Shelf date:  June 28, 2005)<BR>In the show taped in high-definition at the conclusion of their 2004 summer tour, the two-band powerhouse has the Greek Theatre crowd on its feet for most of the three-plus-hour concert.  The show was originally recorded for a pay-per-view concert that aired on cable systems in early 2005.<BR>The two-disc DVD set opens with the groups hitting the stage en massecomplete with six horn players, two drummers, three percussionists, two bass players, three guitarists, et al., launching into Chicagos Beginnings.<BR>When we open and both bands are on stage, people are like agog, Chicago founding member and trumpet player Lee Loughnane said during the 2004 tour.  Theyre like oh my God, you guys really are playing together.<BR>Putting two bands on stage at once is often a train wreck in the making.  A muddy sound mix can plague the effort or whole sections of one band or the other get left out.<BR>Instead listeners are treated to a sparkling mix and interplay among the horn players that only adds to the classic tunes.  Clearly the sum is greater than the already exceptional parts.<BR>Next is EWFs majestic In the Stone, cross-pollinated with Chicagos Dialogue.  Like a club DJ, the bands somehow mix the two songs together with stunning results, using an a cappella bridge.<BR>After some friendly banterand a coin flipbetween Chicagos Robert Lamm and EWFs Philip Bailey about who should play next, Chicago leaves the stage and Earth, Wind & Fire launches into a funk-filled set  mixing in classics like Getaway, Boogie Wonderland, and Thats the Way of the World.<BR>Chicagos Bill Champlin returns to the stage and takes over lead vocals on the EWF hit After the Love is Gone  a song he penned before he joined Chicago in the early 80s.<BR>Given that a DVD mixes sight AND sound, EWF is the more entertaining band visually.  Verdine White is a special effect in his own right, prompting some to call the lanky bassist the Energizer Bunny of the band.  The man absolutely never stops moving.<BR>Motown-like moves and cajoling of the audience to dance and sing along play into the party atmosphere that marks an EWF show.<BR>While the members of EWF are better entertainers than their counterparts in Chicago, both bands are peers musically.  Earth, Wind & Fire are just more fun to watch.<BR>Starting on disc two, Chicago powers its way through its own impressive catalogue of hits, stringing together Make Me Smile, Colour My World, Saturday in the Park, and Hard to Say Im Sorry as part of its set  mostly focusing on their early hits.<BR>Lets get lost in the 70s, says Lamm to the cheers of the audience filled with graying baby boomers, as he introduces Call on Me and Alive Again.<BR>The bands again swap vocalists on If You Leave Me Now, with Bailey and his soaring tenor making the ballad sound better than it has since Peter Cetera left Chicago two decades ago.<BR>The two bands claim combined sales of more than 150-million records and albums.  Both have collected their share of Grammies and American Music Awards.  EWF was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.<BR>But despite their credentials, it is not a pairing that immediately evokes the same sort of  thats a great idea response as the Piano Men tours of Elton John and Billy Joel in past years did.<BR>During their heydays in the 1970s, Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire were the yin and yang of the pop music worldboth with dominant horn sections, but radically different approaches to their music.<BR>When Chicago formed in the Windy City in 1967, members came together with the idea of being The Beatles with horns.<BR>As Maurice White started pulling together EWF in 1969  also in Chicagohis musical vision included Afro-centric themes, astrology and black pride wrapped around a tight funk base, spiced with hints of Motown and gospel.<BR>The real fireworks of the concert come appropriately during the six-song encore  both bands fully energized and on stage together again. Its an impressive closing set.<BR>Trading hits, the tour de force powers through: September, Free with dueling sax solos by Chicagos Walter Parazaider and EWFs Gary Bias, Singasong, Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? Shining Star and a free-for-all version of 25 or 6 to 4, with each of the three guitarists taking a turn on lead.<BR>During last summers pairing, EWF drummer John Paris said, We seem to bring out the best in each other.<BR>The chemistry is obvious as both bands, energized and challenged by each other, far outshine their previous DVD concert performances.<BR>And the fans agree.<BR>Theres a reason bands like Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire are still around after all this time, said Roberto Fernandez, who drove six-hours from Jacksonville, Fla. to see the July 11, 2004 show in Atlanta.  Its called talent.<BR>The pairing was such a success that both bands will tour again together this summer, starting June 24 in Chicago and not wrapping up until late September.
B00000AFGM|4.0|<br />I have very mixed feelings about this record.  it obvious sounds nothing like early manson records or like the albums that came after it.  and of all this bands cds it is one of my lesser favourites.  but when you take this music out of the context of being compared to other Manson albums it sounds better.  it is so different at soem point that i think it stands on its own as a record.  so instead of saying \\"this is nothing next to antichrist superstar\\", just think of it as a record on its own, with a very different feel.  but also a very good one. <br /> <br />#1. \\"Great Big White World\\": 8/10: deep and melodic, but gets harder.  in general i thinks its a very good opener because it showcases a combination of eery balladry and siring rock.  which basically those 2 definitions make up the album. <br /> <br />#2. \\"The Dope Show\\": 7/10: i think my favourite aspect of this song is its music video, but speaking of it strickly from a listening stand point i think it just OK.  soemtimes i skip it cause it seems sort of plain. <br /> <br />#3. \\"Mechanical Animals\\": 6/10: a depressing little number, is best at the end but for a while just seems to exist in a kind of unentertaining limbo. <br /> <br />#4.  \\"Rock is Dead\\": 20/10: I LOVE THIS SONG!  its my favourite on the album and one of my fave manson songs.  its hard and awesome.  proving once and for all that ROCK IS NOT DEAD!!! <br /> <br />#5. \\"Disassociative\\": 10/10: a beautiful song.  very slow and sad.  the kind of song you could just cry your eyes out to.  a very different turn from, say \\"the beautiful people\\", but regardless i love this song ( and i always have maintained that \\"the beautiful people\\" is overrated). <br /> <br />#6. \\"the speed of pain\\": 10/10: ouch, this song hurts to listen to, and i don't mean that in a bad way.  it is so deep and painful that it seems almost too real.  very, very sad. <br /> <br />#7.  \\"posthuman\\": 10/10:  this song sounds extraordinarily out of place after the 2 most depresing songs on the record.  it has a very fast, techno like beat and quick vocals.  good, but it sure comes as a shock right after those ballads. <br /> <br />#8. \\"i want to disappear\\": 7/10: ok.  good lyrics but the music doesn't do anything for me. <br /> <br />#9. \\"i don't like the drugs but the drugs like me\\": 8/10: i have some very mixed feelings about this song.  its good, definately good, and i really like the msuic video for it.  but the women at the end just bug the hell out of me.  i'm not sure why.  maybe cause gospel type singing has no place in a goth record.  but that's only my opinion.  and brian warner probably did that on purpose to show that genres can be bended (but personally here i think he went to far, atleast its not rap...that would be vulgar) <br /> <br />#10.  \\"new model #15\\": 12/10:  AWESOME.  love this song too.  its fast and heavy and has great lyrics.  but i'm the only person i know who loves this song so much so its probably one of those things that's \\"just me\\" <br /> <br />#11. \\"user friendly\\": 11/10:  another great song.  all about the true motovation behind \\"love\\".  SEX!  Its a great, hard little number and one of the best on this record. <br /> <br />#12. \\"fundamentally loathsome\\": 5/10:  it took me a really long time to like this song.  i thought it was drowning and unimagionative.  just very bland.  but i've warmed up to it alittle and now whould call it decent.  but its likely my least favourite on \\"mechanical animals\\" <br /> <br />#13. \\" the last day on earth\\": 8/10:  kinda simple, but still good.  in my opinion its the last good song on the album <br /> <br />#14. \\"coma white\\": 6/10: i don't mean to offend anyone (cause i know a crap load of people who absolutely love this song), but personally i think its boring.  the only good part is the chorus, and its not enough to make up for the rest.  which in general is quite boring and goes on for far too long.  in all a weak ending <br /> <br />so in conclusion, if you love manson'shard stuff (say \\"antichrist\\", \\"holy wood\\", and \\"golden age of groteque\\") and are not a fan of his slower songs then i don't recomend this cd.  i think you have to appreciate glam rock (for instance i'm a big david bowie fan) to see this album not so much for being by marilyn manson, but for being a good peice of music.  the album is definately not for everyone.  but if you have an open mind and/or like the singles from it, then go ahead and pick it up.
1932100385|1.0|Back in the 1980s, T. Colin Campbell and a team of researchers traveled to China to survey the dietary habits of 6,500 adults in 130 rural villages.  Although they gathered data on a whopping 367 food variables,they somehow neglected to note how much soy people were eating.  Yet soy is widely reputed to be a \\"miracle food\\" and the reason that the Chinese have lower rates of some cancers and other chronic diseases. So it's \\"startling\\" indeed to find that ALL legume consumption came to a grand total of only 12 grams per day, which is NOT very much.  However, what's truly \\"startling\\" about this book is not the researchers' failure to be \\"comprehensive\\" -- they gathered plenty of good data though readers will have to go to earlier publications to get it -- but the many ways Campbell massages, misuses and misreports that data.  Although he clearly thinks that it's all for a good cause, this is a textbook case of \\"Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics.\\" I recommend that the publisher follow up with a sequel -- a companion volume in which researchers without any dietary agenda take the same data and reach statistically justified conclusions.  Now that would give readers food for thought!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I will take a different approach on this review.  I have read several that state, \\"I don't watch that much TV.\\"  They are trying to make the point that they are well rounded individuals that love the show instead of people that spend 40 hours a week watching TV. <br /> <br />Well, I consider myself to be well rounded and I DVR a lot of TV shows (tough to fit it all in).  Shows like 24, Lost, Alias, Veronica Mars, Everwood, and The O.C. (my guity pleasure if you will). <br /> <br />So, when I say that this is quite possibly the best TV show I have ever watched, it comes from a person that is well rounded and has the \\"experience\\" that comes from watching a lot of TV to call myself a critic. <br /> <br />Firefly is quite possibly the best TV show I have ever watched. <br /> <br />Joss Whedon, for those not in the Whedonverse (he did Buffy and Angel), is one of the best out there right now in terms of being able to write and produce witty, suspense/tension filled shows.  The dialogue in his shows are sensational. <br /> <br />Firefly had the amazing ability to pull you into Mal and the crew's world from show to show.  24 pulls you in from a different angle.  It is the twists and turns of the plot that pull you along for the ride.  But when I think about it, I could really care less about the majority of the characters.  I just want to see what the next danger is that Jack Bauer can get out of.  Firefly does both well.  You truly care about each character and the storyline of each show never ends up where you think it would.  The show hits all emotions. <br /> <br />When you watch the shows in order on the DVD, a luxury we didn't have when the show aired on FOX (those morons), you will fall in love with it and also think that Fox should have a place reserved in \\"that special hell\\". <br /> <br />I also was one of the fortunate ones to see the advanced screening of Serenity, the movie spawned from the efforts of the cast, crew, Joss, and the fans.  It was an amazing pieceof work.  Watch the DVD set of the TV show first then go watch Serenity. <br /> <br />I can't say enough great things about the show!  Simply one of the best!! <br />
B00097A5I6|1.0|'Member the days when the cats were Mad Fer It, mates?  Those days are long over, it seems.  Liam's croaky voice has been busted up by too much booze and too many cigarettes, while his flat-faced brother, poor Noel, couldn't write a decent guitar lick these days if John Lennon's ghost appeared in his bedroom with hand-written instructions. <br /> <br />Poor Oasis.  They were once so great.  This new record sounds straight outta 1965, for old fogies only.  That's too bad.  I remember when these guys were armed (with guitars) and dangerous (with attitude).  Now they are just middle-aged millionaires who make British compatriots Def Leppard look young and edgy.   <br /> <br />What happened, guys??  Let's bring it back to what it was.  Maybe one day soon the cats'll be Mad Fer It once again. <br /> <br />P.S. IS BLUR REUNITING??????????????
1400032717|5.0|Curious Incident is an expertly written book. I was hooked to this book the moment I started reading it. Within three hours, I was at the end of the last page. It was so touching. Told through the eyes of a boy who suffers from autism, the book captured our failings as humans, the strength of faith, the innocence of childhood, the things we take for granted in our lives, the hopes we cling to, the dreams we want to realize and the love we aspire for in our lives.     Intriguing as it may sound; I was fascinating by the unusual chapter numbering, the use of diagrams, statistics and the use of a first person narrator. It was clever and achieved its desired result of stirring curiosity and eventually keeping the reader hooked. It is a very creative style of writing. In fact, it is a unique reading experience.     By trying to get into the mind of the boy in his narration, I could easily understand his parents who had to deal with his problems constantly. I recommend this novel as a good, enjoyable read and a unique diversion from the other styles of writings that are in the market.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Bjork wasn't content in just starring in a movie she had to produce and write the music for the film, culminating in this soundtrack.Two words only are needed to sum up this soundtrack, Simply Beautiful.Bjork is such a musical genius, she is up in another league of women musicians, shared by only a select few.<br /><br />But what makes Bjork such a wonderful musician is how she creates the most un believeable songs,whether it is an orchestral masterpiece (as shown on this album) or a sweeping ballad with a huge choir, Bjork has done that and much more.<br /><br />She is in fact the most inventive musician there ever has been and ever will be.She is that good and this album proves it.<br /><br />The first track to start this album is \\"Overture\\", well named as it is the overture to the film. This song starts with a deep string section and works its way into a fully rounded orchestral masterpiece. Bjork is well known for her use of orchestras in her music and this fully orchestra track is well worth the listen, because I don't really like classical music I was really ominous about this track, this is actually my favourite classical music piece ever.\\"Cvalda\\" is a really weird song, it starts off with about 1 minutes worth of machine and factory sounds the finally -Clatter,crash,clack,racket,bang,thump- the first lyrics are as suggestive as the rest of the song, which is all over the place and sonically loud. Catherine Denevue makes a worthy appearance on this song and adds to the excitement and energy. On the next track Bjork ropes in another musical genius, Thom Yorke of Radiohead to create quite simply the most moving track the album along with -New World-. Now this is the song that is credited with me first getting into Bjork.One morning I was watching a music video show and I saw the video for this song and I instantly went searching for it. This song is so amazingly beautiful. Thom and Bjork work so well on this duet. \\"Scatterheart\\" is quite lenghty but well worth the listen and it has the most wonderful electronic programming in it. It talks about hurricanes and how -you are going to have to find out for yourself- quite a lyrical muddle but it is very well written. \\"In The Musicals\\" is a very good song that starts off with a basketball like sound. The irony is that -Dancer In The Dark- is classed as a musical and this song is about just that. It's strangely empowering and encouraging. \\"107 Steps\\" is Siobhan Fallon counting her steps and Bjork cooing every random number that comes along. Then finally at 107 (Or is it 100)steps there is an orchestral explosion and everything goes fantastic. Again she ropes in another beautiful guest to accompany her. \\"New World\\" is the 7th and final song on the album, although this album is short it is well worth the listen. This track is AMAZING and I didn't realise it was this wonderful for a while, a great example of how songs can come to grow on you.<br /><br />10/10. This album may be short but every track is fantastic.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this to anyone, of any age.en and it has the most wonderful electronic programming in it.

B00005JNJT|5.0|Being one of the highly anticipated movies of 2005, I just had to go see this movie when it released. Even though I heard it was different compared to the previous Batman movies, this intrigued me more. After watching `Batman Begins' I can easily say that this was like a breath of fresh air from the previous movies. <br /> <br />Since there are so many reviews describing the story of the movie, I will keep this one short. `Batman Begins' starts off with 8 year old Bruce, playing with his friend Rachel in his Mansion. He falls into a ditch and is attacked by a lot of bats, hence starting his fears of them. The story follows as to how he loses his parents, how he is arrested, saved, and how he becomes the caped crusader to defend the citizens of Gotham. Of course, during all this, also includes his relationship with Rachel, overcoming his fears and learning the difference between justice and revenge. <br /> <br />There are many reasons as to why I loved this movie. They are: <br /> <br />1) The dark and mysterious atmosphere that the story takes place in. This gives a very serious look to the movie, making it what Batman is actually supposed to be about. <br /> <br />2) The way in which the movie fits all the pieces, like how the villains come to take their identities, how Batman came to be, how the Bat Cave, Bat mobile, and other equipment were created etc. It has all been so nicely incorporated into the movie, that you will find yourself going `Ok, so that's how it started'. I'm sure that fans of the comics will already know the whole history behind Batman, but for some people like me, it is a roller coaster ride of suspense and surprises. <br /> <br />3) Finally, how Christopher Nolan managed to balance the emotional scenes to the crime fighting scenes throughout the movie. You don't feel the movie dragging for even a minute because it keeps you interested throughout. <br /> <br /> <br />Christopher Nolan (who directed other great movies like `Insomnia' and `Mememto') continues showing his talent in `Batman Begins'. Christian Bale gives a wonderful performance as Batman, the dark knight. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, and Gary Oldman play their role well. I was actually surprised by how Katie Holmes has matured in his acting abilities. I have seen her act only on `Dawson's Creek' and didn't think she could pull this roll off, but she proved me wrong.  <br /> <br />On the whole, whether you are a fan of Batman or not, you will definitely enjoy this movie.  <br />
0380729407|5.0|I have read Something Wicked This Way Comes at least 5 times and every time I am amazed at the writing skill of Ray Bradbury in this novel. Each paragraph reads like poetry. I not only see, but I smell and feel the story.  <br /> <br />The book evokes the desires of all of us to be younger, older, prettier, or more famous. But there is always a cost for these atributes and there is even a cost to recover them from your past. We all know a Jim Nightshade (the darker side of each of us) and a Will Halloway (the brighter side of us). In this coming of age novel, the two best friends are only one day apart in age, but quite different in what they will do to attain their aspirations. They are anxious to be \\"older\\" and when a carnival comes into town during an electrical storm, they find the means to their desires. The question is whether the cost is worth it. <br /> <br />This book is not for those that get high off of action, but for those that love to indulge in feeling goosebumps, smelling decay and hearing creaks. Just one example of Bradbury's prose from the book: \\"What's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers? Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib. Caesar's lean and hungry friends. They eat in the dark, who only stand and breathe.\\" <br /> <br />Interestingly, the movie with Jason Robards as Will's remorsefull librarian father (quoted above), still maintains the same prose and feel. I recommend both. Read the book, but remember, there is a cost for going backwards.
B000002L7Y|5.0|Hard to believe, but it's true! The band will perform Sept. 12, 2005 at Irving Plaza, New York City.  It's been along time coming and they are sure to play tracks off of 'Hunting High and Low' as this was their original masterpiece! 'The Sun Always Shines on TV' is still my favorite song to date out of their entire catalog.  See you at the show...
B00000634J|3.0|While I prefer his Beatles songs, this CD has some of Lennon's best solo tunes including:<br />\\"Imagine\\"<br />\\"Instant Karma!\\" (my favorite here)<br />\\"Cold Turkey\\"<br />\\"#9 Dream\\"<br />\\"Stand By Me\\"<br />\\"Just Like Starting Over\\"<br />\\"Watching The Wheels\\"<br />\\"Nobody Told Me\\"<br />\\"Give Peace A Chance\\"
B00004Z400|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Deftones album. Catchy melodies, heavy guitar and deiversity. It's not perfect, but it's really close. Plus these guys don't really sound like anyone. Can you name a band that they sound like? Nor can I. I'd recommend Deftones to fans of nu metal or even rap metal. And this is the album to get if you don't own any. After this buy their self titled (skeleton cover) and Around the Fur. I didn't care for Adrenaline, but you might like it. Enough about their other stuff and on with the album. This version of their amazing cd has included the single \\"Back to School\\" so get this version of the cd. And now for my review of my favorite songs.<br /><br />Back to School - Wasn't on the original release of White Pony and I'm happy it's on this one. Starts off soft then gets heavy. Rapping verse and a melodic chorus. 4.5/5<br /><br />Digital Bath - Mostly a slow and mellow slow, with a nice melodic chorus. My 2nd favorite on the album. 5/5<br /><br />Elite - Starts off loud and stays that way for most of the song. Nice song to rock out to. 4/5<br /><br />RX Queen - The verses drag, but they lead to an amazing chorus. 4.5/5<br /><br />Street Carp - The shortest song at 2:41 and one of the heaviest. My 3rd favorite. 5/5<br /><br />Knife Prty - One of the better average songs on the album. Takes awhile for this song to start up, but it's good when it gets going. 4.5/5<br /><br />Change - My favorite Deftones song of all time. I heard this somewhere on the internet and had to get the cd. Slow verses and such an inspiring chorus. 5/5<br /><br />There is my review. Hopefully it changed your opinion about this album or made you want to get it. Remember to check out Around the Fur and the self titled if you liked this.
B000002J1S|3.0|After the taste of success from their 1974 album, Selling England By The Pound (#70 on Billboard album chart), Genesis turns to New York City for their material on Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, forgoing the English themes of their earlier albums. LLDOB tells the tale of a New York City punk, Rael, using West Side Story as a reference point. It seems to me an attempt to breakthrough to the music fans in the States, and it did become their most successful album in the USA to date (1975) reaching #41 on the Billboard charts. Of course, Peter Gabriel didn't really reach the \\"Big Time\\" of superstardom until his So album in 1986, but LLDOB had a similar motivation of pandering to the masses. I'm inclined to give it 2 stars (okay) as I don't really care for the N.Y.C. theme, but there is some great songwriting within this double album. My favorite LLDOB songs are: \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\", \\"In The Cage\\", \\"Grand Parade...\\", \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", \\"Lilywhite Lilith\\", and \\"Colony of Slippermen\\".
0975991477|5.0|If you saw the movie What the Bleep and liked it, you will love this book. Along the same lines as Candace Pert, who wrote the Molecules of Emotion, this book written by Bruce Lipton, PhD.,shows the relationships between attitude and cellular movement. E-motion literally opens the cells up to enable the DNA to move and make changes in the body. He explains on a cellular level up to a world view how we are all connected from a scientific viewpoint. I am not a scientist but it was fun reading as well as transformational. If you want confirmation about the benefit of changing your attitude this book is for you.
B000002J1M|5.0|This is my favorite Genesis album, as I favor their early prog music. It was their first album to chart, reaching #12 on the U.K. album chart in 1972. The total time is 50:53. The cover art with the foxhunt depicts the distinctive English flavor of the band's music, but the alien horsemen, shrouded figures, and \\"foxy lady\\" also foretell the bizarre stories within .<br /><br />\\"Watcher of the Skies\\" tells a sci-fi tale of mankind's departure from earth and voyage to another planet. It was a concert staple for Genesis until their mid-80s transformation into a pops band.<br />\\"Time Table\\" waxes nostalgic about past ages, and poses a puzzling question and answer.<br />\\"Get 'Em  Out By Friday\\" is another futuristic song, but this one has an element of humor, being a story about a governmental genetic engineering program to reduce peoples' heights to below 4 ft. to maximize corporate real estate development profits. The highlight is Gabriel's funny vocals for the 'TV Flash'. The song ends with the cynical words \\"Land in your hand you'll be happy on earth. Then invest in the Church for your heaven.\\"<br />\\"Can-Utility and the Coastliners\\" shows the revolutionary power of a single smile. I like Steve Hackett's acoustic guitar strumming, and Tony Bank's keyboards on this one.(!)<br />\\"Horizons\\" is a light, classical guitar hor d'oeuvre before the main course (scrambled eggs),<br />\\"Supper's Ready\\". It figures this is based on an actual dream as it's real bizarre. It covers alot of territory, including a deceitful leader, warmongering, human conditioning/engineering, and the apocalypse. It is varied musically too, going from the prog rock of \\"Ikhnaton and Itsacon and Their Band Of Merry Men\\", to the quiet rumination of \\"How Dare I Be So Beautiful?\\", to the bawdy, Monty Pythonesque humor of \\"Willow Farm\\", to the folky beginning of \\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\" with flute, to the bombastic crescendo finale with an extended keyboard solo. Of course, \\"Supper's Ready\\" was a Genesis concert mainstay during the 70s..
0465043550|3.0|I can only conclude that Prof Mandelbrot had this book written to boost his earnings in his old age.  It promises to mix finance ($$$!) and fractals (cool) in a way that will help you make better financial decisions (fractal $$$!!!). But it does not. <br /> <br />It reviews (basic) modern finance theory but not in a way that is terribly easy for those who have never studied it.  He correctly points out that asset price developments are often not normally distributed (which is one of the assumptions usually made)but then fails to have anything usable to replace it.  There are not even any high-order heurtistics that come out of it, such as \\"don't put more than x% of your savings into stocks for less than y years\\". <br /> <br />Even worse, he makes incorrect criticisms of Markowitz mean-variance analysis and suggests that he has an answer to the equity premium puzzle which turns out to be worse than many other recent explanations. <br /> <br />By the way - if Markowitz and equity premium don't mean much to you - don't read this book.  If you are studying finance & want to annoy your professor - do. <br />
B0000959N0|4.0|Well let me start off by saying that I haven't seen the most recent DVD release of the Director's cut so I can't give you any information on that. <br />I do want to talk about the film's moral content but that will probably be last. <br />So let's start out with the story. <br />Matt Murdock (played masterfully by Ben Affleck), the man without fear, begins the story with his father being a out of luck boxer. <br />Matt grows up in a rough neighborhood called Hell's kitchen, after an accident he finds that he has special abilities. <br />He has a hightened sense of smell, touch, taste, and feel. <br />After several tragidies accur to him, he grows up, becoming a lawyer, and also (in the darkness of the city) becomes Daredevil. <br />Matt fights for justice, but if he loses a case (and justice, in his own version, is not fulfilled) he serves it with ultra-violent style. <br />Matt's love interest Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner) comes into the picture eventually, but their relationship, though trying to be emotional, feels forced. <br />There is a lot more to the plot (and I've really hastily scanned over most of it) but I think that I will focus more on the moral content in my review. <br />Matt Murdock is a complex character. <br />He is a man who is trying to do what he feels is morally right, but he often allows his own emotions to drive him. <br />His only confidant, a catholic priest, guides him and directs him in the proper way of justice. <br />Matt tries to listen but again, he is driven by emotions. <br />His relationship with Elektra is immorall, they sleep togeather premaritally (and a side note, the sex scene is not immensely bad but get's the point across). <br />The priest, while providing the moral basis for the film also has some quotes that don't ring true. <br />For instance, \\"A man without fear is a man without hope.\\" That may be true in a wordly sense but not a spiritual sense. <br />God has not given a spirit of fear, outside of the respect of him. <br />The violence: Considerable, prolonged and at times bloody. <br />The mood of the movie is overall very dark so I wouldn't recommend it for people who are sensitive. <br />The foul language: Present throughout, for most Christians it will probably be enough to drive them away. <br />This is definately not a movie for children and sensitive teens. <br />I know I keep giving warnings but whoever is to watch this should be able to emotionally handle it. <br />Overall: Daredevil is a great movie, it does have many positive messages, but parents should be warned that there is plenty of content to keep the youngsters away.
B0000CDL3W|4.0|Come on people. This was not a bad movie at all. It's not the masterpieces that the first two are, but it's better than most third entries in a series. Arnold was once again good as the robot sent back to protect John. Claire did well as the fill in for Linda Hamilton, but she couldn't take away the fact that I missed her. Nick Stahi was a better actor than Edward Furlong, and pulled off the role of John Conner nicely. It's not a bad movie, go see it, and prepare to be amazed.
0393035158|5.0|This book explores a crucial point of awareness regarding humanity's future, namely, the continually suppressed and ignored fact that religious faith is irrational, destructive, and cannot be allowed to continue influencing world affairs if cultural and technological advances are to be achieved. This book is packed with insights; one is tempted to highlight only those sections that are not worth remembering.<br /><br />Some reviewers did not appreciate the author's opinions of meditation or mysticism, but I find them both instructive. We cannot realistically expect to eliminate religion without first acknowledging, in the form of proven, rational alternatives, the universal needs for such metaphysical concepts as meaning and purpose.
B000002ACR|4.0|The Byrd's first six albums are essential for anyone's library. Many people still debate which one is their best, and some point to this. I'd disagree (going with either the debut or \\"Fifth Dimension\\"). However, this is still a great, if slightly flawed, album. Quickly paced (without the bonus tracks, it's under a half hour), and full of folk-rock classics. \\"So You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\", \\"CTA\\", and or course \\"My Back Pages\\" are all some of the best songs in  the influential band's catelouge. The Byrds weren't nearly as good in their psychadelic attempts as they where in their folk or country rock numbers. \\"Renaissance Fair\\" and \\"Mind Gardens\\" are the two tracks this album could've done without. Those two songs don't keep this from being a great album, and any fan of the Byrds should own it. The bluegrass number \\"Time Between\\" seems to hint at the Country-Rock classic \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" they pulled out of their sleeves a few years later. An album that warrants repeated listenings, and definatly worth owning.
B00003W8NM|3.0|I'm not a fight fan so I resisted viewing this film for years. Friends told me I would really like it and from a visual point of view they were right.  The cinematography is awe inspiring and creative and some of the fight scenes are incredibly graphic and certianly are not for the squeamish. Fight Club is an unflinchingly stunning and stylish film that sucks you in and propells you along its high octane trajectory.  Yet when the secret \\"twist\\" is revealed, it's a huge letdown that has been done before in countless other films.  This is definitely a guy flick, highly entertaining but low on substance.  If you're a fighting fan you'll forgive its flaws and love every minute of it.  If you're a Brad Pitt fan, you'll forget the plot and drool every minute of it.  I am neither so I was mildly entertained but ultimately disappointed.  Overall, a really good film but it didn't live up to all the hype surrounding it.  I hear the book is better.
B000002G7G|5.0|Every album in the Velvet's catelouge was unique in some way. \\"VU & Nico\\" was arty and dangerous, \\"WL/WH\\" was raw and crude in an inaccesible but ultimatly great way, this one is melodic and soothing, and \\"Loaded\\" is the perfect pop-rock album. Despite the various styles, the group never failed. They could suceed in any style they tackled. Despite the presence of \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Begining to See the Light\\", the songs are softer and quite, lacking the rawness of the first two albums. The lyrics are probably the most consistent out of any of their albums, despite this being musically my least favorite album of theirs. The Velvets never had a bad album, and instead of picking up a lame \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation, you'd be much better off buying all four studio albums.
B00008BXJF|2.0|This lyric from Crimson's newest offering aptly describes the album itself. \\"The Power to Believe\\" is an unsettling and unappealing waste of the prodigious musical skills of Fripp and company, one that leaves the listener longing for a melody and structure. Strange that this album should come from the same band that gave us Red, which demonstrated conclusively that musical force could be created without sacrificing listenability. <br /> <br />Most of the songs on \\"Power\\" continue the decentered sonic assault that has characterized Crimson's last several albums (with the welcome exception of some tracks on Constrkction of Light). The majority of the album seems intentionally-composed to disappoint the naive listener who might wish to relate to the album on a basic, visceral level. The primary exception is \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", a saccharine and ineffective shadow of \\"Matte Kudasai\\".  <br /> <br />I have been a fan of King Crimson for many years and I have seen them go through several incarnations. This latest ensemble leaves me completely unmoved. I hope for brighter days ahead from the band.
B000001FHV|2.0|The Meat Puppets where one of the best bands of the 80s, but once they got signed off SST to a major label they seemed to have lost something. They didn't sell out, but a certain amount of soul present on \\"II\\" and \\"Up On the Sun\\" just wasn't there. The problem is they seemed to get swept up in the grunge explosion that happened. That isn't to say this is a terrible record. There are a few good songs, notibly their big hit \\"Backwater\\" amoung a few others. However, something just wasn't there. The lyrics weren't as funny or as emotional as before, and it leaves no lasting affect. I know there are many who disagree with me. If you like grunge such as Soundgarden and Mudhoney, you'll probably like this. If you like classic Puppets however, you'll not like this too much. Not bad by all means, just not that great either.
0316172324|2.0|I tend to agree with the reviewer, Loyd Eskildson, about this book. In essence, I have not gotten more than a couple of new ideas from this book, the rest are commonsense. Of course, your thin slices will get more accurate if you have more experiences and in depth knowledge of the area you're thin slicing. Hmmm ... tell me something new ...
B000001F76|5.0|While Jimmie Rogers may have invented country, Williams made it what it is today. If you can't afford the \\"Complete\\" box set (most beginers probably wouldn't want to buy it), this is a good starting place. It's meatier than most single-disc compilations, but isn't as exhausting as a multiple-disc set. William's songwriting skills were, at the time, unopposed. He could create compositions with heartfelt lyrics for any mood he was in. Happy, sad, angry, Williams could reflect it. Country is one of the most purely American creations, and this collection is pure American music. It reflects some of the roots of popular music in the pre-Rock era. If you aren't affected some way by \\"Lost Highway\\", you just don't appreciate roots music. I enjoy Johnny Cash's work better, but this is an undeniable essential. Any collection of country or American music should have at least one compilation of Williams.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|this great and totally unique film will be THE holiday film for the ages! it is wondrous to behold, beautifully breathtaking to watch, with unforgettable acting by a great cast headed by mr. tom hanks, and with mr. zemikus directing i knew from the start it was going to be superlative, and of course it was! do treat your family, friends, or yourself to last years very best holiday film! i just pre ordered mine today, and already i am salivating.it is an astounding achievement in both sight and sound.
B000002ADT|5.0|It truly is. Beleive all the hype you've heard about it, this is one of the most ingeniously conceived peices of music. Few Jazz albums, or albums of any kind, have been so well conceived and thought out. Miles and his band aren't jamming here, it's all part of a greatest vision to cause a revolution in popular music. That is what it did, making it one of the best-selling Jazz albums of all time, and many people who don't listen to Jazz own this album. Each song seemlessly flows into each other, and there isn't a single wasted note. It is one of the first truly great full lentgh albums (even though Miles created the first great album in 1949 with \\"Birth of the Cool\\"). Even if you aren't a Jazz fan, this is an essential album to own. And if you are interested in becoming a Jazz fan, this is the album you want to buy to get started. And what can I say about the all-star band? Probably the best ever assembeled for one album! In addition to Davis, there's John Coltrane on sax, Bill Evans on piano, Cannonball Atterly on alto sax, Paul Chambers on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums - basically a Who's Who in the Cool School of Jazz. One of the most important American albums.
B000068IEU|1.0|I recently saw some show on TV that was like the 100 scarriest movies of all time, and had people like wes craven, rob zombie, and all kinds of people who actually wrote, directed, or produced horror movies talking about and ranking horror movies. More than a few times this movie was mentioned, and I think it was like #3 or something. I saw it at the movie store and decided to rent it just to see what all the hub-bub was all about. <br /> <br />WHAT A BAD MOVIE! First off, it's not even scary. Poor production, poor acting, and a very POOR story! Sure it might have been \\"groundbreaking\\" in 1972, but come on, it's a pile of poop now. The first car was pretty cool in it's day also, but there's no comparison to a modern day sports car. This movie is BAD, it's boring. Did I mention it's bad? You want a scary movie, see ALIENS. I can't believe people ever thought this was scary. I can't believe it was actually banned. What a joke. People say, oh, it's a cult classic, and oh, it was good for it's day. Yeah, a lot of things we thought were great in the past, we look back now and realize they were poop. This movie is poop. Did I mention how bad this movie is????
B00005JGAF|5.0|The debut saved rock 'n' roll and is an all around more important album, but when it comes to the songwriting and consistency, this is their best studio offering. In an age of overblown arena rock and overpetentous prog rock, the Ramones kept things simple with their raw and primative style of pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll. Despite the fact that they were totally derrariative, they were completely original at the same time, making them something other than just an oldies band. They took the classic style of early Garage and Surf rock, and played it at a breakneck speed. There wasn't anything else out there quite like what the Bruthas had to offer. Dee Dee Ramone said \\"Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration, the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five\\". Some may claim this is looking deeper into songs that really aren't too deep. I disagree. Everybody can relate to sitting around, eating hamburgers for lunch, hoping for better days, and wanting to go out an have a good time on a Friday night. Despite the simplicity of a Ramones song, they manage to speak to bored alienated teens. One of the best punk albums ever, there is so much more to the band than \\"Blitzerking Bop\\". Buy the first four studio albums and they amazing \\"It's Alive\\" live album (don't get a greatest hits you loser).
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I never read the original comic books, so I can't argue from an adaptation point-of-view.  However, going in unfamiliar with the source material, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Constantine is a great anti-hero different from all the other \\"super\\" heroes in most movies.  He's conflicted, impatient, and cynical.  Keanu did a solid job in the title role, I found him very empathetic and entertaining.  Also, I didn't think the movie succombed to its SPFX - in fact, the grand finale was more cerebrial than just a big action scene.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This movie,sucked, not in a vampirical sense, but in the wet sucking sound a toilet makes on an airplane going down in flames. There were so many things wrong with it. Dracula had a draconian mullet pulled back in a banana clip in a world where we have come to know dracula as a smooth talking, handsome smart coffin dweller, this one must be a distant cousin who crawled out of the compost heap behind the trailor park, Hello he has to kill all the Valarius family and doesnt just take them out when they are sleeping at night? The CGI was laughable, Dr Jeckl was supposed to be, according to the \\"behind the scenes\\" guys the \\"most realistic CGI ever made\\" AHAHAHAHA, they have got to be joking. They dont explain why Draculas nasty little children who reside in Gremlin rip off sacks of goo, need to be electrified to live. Hugh Jackman is a talented actor as well as Kate is a great actress but both of their characters wouldnt stand a chance against the Awesome personalities of Selene from underworld or Wolverine from X-men. I guess they had to work with the crappy juvenile script they were given. Van Helsing is a wreck all around, reinventing myths and ehem sucking the life out of great characters.
B000084T18|3.0|That is what I thought after I first heard Get Rich or Die Tryin. Then came the dreaded lyrical step backward called The Massacre. Anyway, Get Rich is a decent album. It is nowhere close to a classic but it is bearable and you might find it entertaining not enlightening. For any rap fan, I recommend this album. Though Fifty is not an amazing mc, this album is still average.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|This band has chosen to completely change their form of music & ditch their beloved fans. I actually compared this band to Atreyu & Bleeding Through. Now they sound nothing alike. If megadeath or iron maiden came out with this album it would not have bothered me but I feel like I have lost a good band. It's just not the same music now. Hopefully they will be back to making hardcore music on their next album.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I never liked opera, but this movie is outstanding, special effects are awsome and the music even more awsome.  I have watched it over and over again.  What a romantic and wonderful film.   Not enough stars in the sky to rate it. <br /> <br />
B000002BPS|4.0|Writing a review of \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" is a tricky task to say the least.  Some herald it as the band's greatest release, while others dismiss it as their official cross over into mainstream, commercial territory, and in the vast domain of true punk rock, that is no man's land.  All of these opinions have their justification, but when they are combined, they do not paint a very clear picture of whether or not this is a good CD.  Truthfully, the good reviews outnumber the bad, and rightfully so.  Though I am in no way, shape, or form a punk rock expert, I do like this album.  Sure, it may not have the \\"indie\\" feel of the band's self-titled debut, \\"Ignition,\\" or even \\"Smash,\\" but it still remains one of their better releases.  From the goofy intro criticizing censorship (the aptly named \\"Disclaimer\\"), you can tell that this is going to be a little different than the previous stuff by the Offspring.  \\"The Meaning of Life\\" follows, and it carries a message of individuality along with an extremely catchy melody, both of which make it one of the best songs on the CD.  \\"Mota\\" is up next, and though it is very immature, it's still pretty decent (and besides, the Offspring aren't notorious for their maturity).  Number four is \\"Me and My Old Lady,\\" and is, in my opinion, one of the worst songs on the CD.  The only really memorable thing about it is Dexter saying \\"she ain't no ball and chain\\" over and over, which is more annoying than anything else.  \\"Cool to Hate\\" is a song about, well, just look at the name.  This song is a forgotten treasure that never really got the recognition it deserved.  \\"Leave It Behind\\" is an extremely short and fast song, and though it's not one of my personal favorites, it's still a decent track.  \\"Gone Away\\" is probably the most popular song on the CD, and for good reason.  It's a slower, sadder song than most here, which makes it all the more powerful.  \\"I Choose,\\" is another song that is often unfairly overlooked, and though it may not be very memorable at first, it grows on you.  \\"Intermission\\" is exactly what it sounds like, with soft elevator music being played while a man makes \\"relaxed\\" sounds.  \\"All I Want\\" kicks the album back into drive, and is a moderately popular song that I first heard on the video game \\"Crazy Taxi\\" and had a hell of a time finding.  \\"Way Down the Line\\" is another song that I discovered on the \\"Crazy Taxi\\" game.  Although it's not as good as \\"All I Want,\\" it's still one of the better songs on the CD.  Next is \\"Don't Pick It Up,\\" a fan favorite that I myself don't really like that much.  \\"Amazed\\" once again represents the band's slower side, and though it does not quite match \\"Gone Away,\\" I personally like it.  Lastly, \\"Change the World\\" (which might as well have been called \\"Genocide Part Two\\") closes out the CD, starting with the same riff that was played at the end of \\"Smash\\".  When I listened to that CD, I thought that it was supposed to be an extension of the song \\"Genocide,\\" but I guess the boys in Offspring had different plans.  Either way, it's a catchy riff and one of my favorite songs on the CD.  Overall, while it may not be The Offspring's finest hour, \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" isn't just commercial garbage, either, and I say this as an owner of the band's entire catalog.  Though some may find it too \\"poppy\\" for their tastes, the majority of Offspring fans, including myself, believe it to be one of their better efforts.  So, if you don't have the CD and want to get a glimpse of the Offspring on the brink of glory, then by all means try to get your hands on this disc; you will not be disappointed.
0060977493|5.0|Upon finding myself entirly out of books to read, i consulted my mentor/friend for reccomendations. He wrote me a list of six highly repected authors varying in style from Thomas Pynchon to Salman Rushdie. For the past several weeks I have worked my way down the list, absorbing each book then moving on to the next. Always consulting online reviews before ultimatly making the final purchase. The reviews of The God of Small Things intigued me, all being of one extreme or the other, few falling in between. Fully satisfied with my findings and ultimatly courious, I bought the book that night, anxious the whole drive home to sit down and start. It took me 3 days to finish, but after doing so (as the back cover implies), I immediatly wanted to read it again. Not because the story was unclear, but because the authors use of words made me stop. Stop like no book ever has. To say the characters are underdeveloped is absurd. Roy depicts these lives so rawly, you feel as though you are watching everything unfold before your eyes. I found myself frequently feeling disgust, hatred and frustration with humanity, completly disragarding the fact that it is a work of fiction. This story, though about a family in india, applies to all human life. The author illustrates life with such perceptive detail and insight, you see the world for what it is. As i neared the end of the story i became overlyemotional, crying for ficticious characters. But soon came to the conclusion that it was not for them but for myself. This book causes you to question reality, morality and human nature. Roy's poetic style and painful honesty engulf you in such a way thatlong after the story has ended, it will not stray far from your mind. It forces you to figure out who you are, and if thats who you really wanted to be. Far more than just a story, its a lesson in life, love, human innocense and whats really important. If you haven't bought it yet... Get up right now and do so. If you have and just haven't found the time, make time, it's a little over 300 pages that will change your priorities forever. Or maybe i'm wronge, don't take my word for it. Buy it today... You can thank me later.
B00005B36H|5.0|lateralus is as good as their old stuff, if not better. <br />it has heavy/melow songs that really stand out. <br />this album, however, is an album that grows on you. <br />if you don't like it the fist time you listen to it, then give it a chance. <br />the first time i listened to it i didn't like it that much, but the more i listened to it, the more i liked it. <br />Maynard James Keenan is one of the best vocalists around, and his 30 second long scream on the opening song is amzing,and it is an awsome way to start an awsome album. <br />it is very melow, but yet very heavy at times. <br />if you like NIN then you will like this album. <br />it is amazing that if the songs are put into a certain order that the songs flow into each other, making it a never ending cd. <br />tool is a very artistic band, that are unlike any other band out there. <br />this cd is a great purchase that i recomend to everyone.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The orchestration and the instrumental performances make this DVD a \\"must have\\" even if you are a longtime Eagles fan and already have all their CD's.  Seeing the edited concert is way better than just hearing the studio mix. By the way, you have to have a good sound system and a video monitor to make this worthwhile. A normal TV with its typical speakers does not have the capability to provide you with what is on the actual DVD. The number of musicians performing and the number of instruments being played will take your opinion of the Eagles at least one step higher. My only negative comment, I can't believe that the beautiful people standing in the front row(s) weren't planted for the benefit of the video.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have been a tool fan for a long time now, and i love every tool album. <br />Each cd has it's own unique style, and this cd is one of 'em. <br />It's very good, and different from \\"undertow\\" (the second tool cd). <br />If you like NIN, or Wes Borland (guitarist of limp bizkit, and eat the day) then you'll LOVE tool. <br />Maynard James Keenan is an awsome vocalist who can sing very melow, and then bust out a scream out of nowhere. <br />This cd is melow yet slightly heavy. <br />The Bass guitar, guitar, and drumming are awsome. <br />It is a very artistic/industrial album. <br />Tool is a very artistic, and a great band.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|From what I've seen of Veronica Mars (and being in the UK that means very little!) it seems a brilliant show with great acting and lots of twists and turns in the plot.  A great lead with some great chemistry with just about everyone in the cast (especially Logan) and an intruiging season long mystery to solve (actually 2 mysteries).  Thats probably why no network in the UK has picked it up yet, instead showing crap like Big Brother and other reality (read BORING) shows. Anyway I've just read somewhere that the dvd box set is out mid October although unfortunately with almost no extras on it.  Hopefully it will sell well enough to encourage more people to watch it and maybe give us in the UK a chance to see it.
B000000993|5.0|tool is a very talented and unique band that no one can imitate or copy. <br />this cd isn't as industrial as the new stuff, however, it is heavier. <br />the guitar in this album is more distinguisable, and heavier then in the new stuff. <br />Maynard James Keenan shows his great voice once again in this album. <br />This album is a great purchase that every metal fan should own. <br />Sumerization: Great Heavy/Melow album that is worthy of purchase. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I purchased this record soon after it was released.On my first listen it was like whoa! <br />I can sit and listen through the whole cd which is rare these days.I won't compare it to they're previous albums just cause its definately dynamic.I would consider it right up there with Toxicity.I like that the songs are not too long its more like snippetts with all the changes in the songs themselves.My favorites on this album are - #1 BYOB, #2 Lost In Hollywood #3 Questions #4 Sad Statue #5 This Cocaine... - My only gripe is that one more powerful song would have been perfect but thats why this is part 1 of 2.Can't wait for more!!Overall I like the growth of this band since the first album.More bands need to take notice.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I put soundtracks in quotation marks for a positive reason, just so we start out on the right foot. Please don't get me wrong when I say what I'm about to say, because I love Danny Elfman's composing talents and even enjoyed Eliot Goldenthal's version. I even own and enjoy Nelson Riddle's take on the Batman from 1966! I still say this is the finest score to date, and I hope to explain this thoroughly.  To my way of thinking this soundtrack is yet another character in this incredibly stark and moving film. It, like all the other characters that surround Wayne/Batman attest to his drive for justice and hope in a seemingly hopeless world. Unlike the others this soundtrack does not come off like a traditional soundtrack. It looms in the background and hauntingly draws attention to the angst and pathos of the creature known as Batman. From the death of his parents to his meeting with Ras Al Ghul to the creation of Batman to the rescue and further need of rescuing Gotham, I believe this film would lose something in the translation if not for the beautiful soundtrack that graces it. Just to think not one, but two major talents went into this and came out with a cohesive soundtrack that comes off sounding like a 12 mvt. symphonic suite for the Dark Knight! If you want to hear Elfman or Goldenthal then buy those soundtracks (I highly recommend them!), but if you'd like to hear the legend of Batman in music form grab this right away and be prepared for a listening experience like none before! ENJOY!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this show on the recommendation of a good friend and fellow science fiction fan. I watched it and less than twenty minutes into the first episode I was hooked. This is an extremely intelligently written science fiction western themed space opera. Character development is superb, the cast fits together like a puzzle and the storylines have a 'real' and 'gritty' feel to them. You can't help but empathize with one or all of the characters. The show follows an addictive path by weaving all of the formerly listed attributes together into a seamless complete future universe. <br />Enjoy! <br />If you are a fan of intelligent and fun cinema a la Buffy genre then you'll quickly find out what a Browncoat is. Keep 'em flyin'.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|Anyone who considers themselves to be a fan of hip hop NEEDS to own this album..I know it sounds crazy but I bought this album almost 2 months ago and have listened to at least 3 tracks on it everyday since i bought it..When I first listened to it i skipped over a few tracks and didnt find it to be a classic until i actually listened to every track and listened to what he was saying...Then I realized he was a genius. <br /> <br />1.Intro 10/10 its an amazing intro..it leads up to the next track well <br /> <br />2.Things Done Changed 9/10 He talks about how his lifes been hard basically and how everything has gone wrong. <br />Best line: <br />\\"Cuz the streets is a short stop, <br />either you slingin crack rock or you gotta wicked jump shot\\" <br /> <br />3.Gimme the loot 9/10 this is really amazing lyrically.. <br /> <br />4.Machine Gun Funk 9/10 again he talks about how he lives by the gun <br />Best Line: <br />\\"and N****s wonder how i live the mack life, <br />makin money smokin mics like crack pipes\\" <br /> <br />5.Warning 10/10 its insane how he tells this story so well.. the first few lines make you think youre right there with him <br /> <br />6.Ready To Die 8.5/10 tells how hes not scared of death <br />Best line: <br />\\"I got techniques drippin out my butt cheeks, <br />sleep on my stomach so I dont f*** up my sheets, <br />my s*** is deep deeper than my grave G, <br />I'm ready to die and nobody can save me\\"  <br /> <br />7.One More Chance 10/10 this is so funny..one for the ladies lets just say  <br />Best line: <br />\\"I got the cleanest meanest penis, <br />ya never seen this stroke of genius\\" <br /> <br />8.F*** Me(interlude) 10/10 its so funny..one for the ladies <br /> <br />9.The What feat.Method Man 8.5/10 Meth and Biggie sound good together <br /> <br />10.Juicy 10/10 I LOVE this track..best lyrically and has a sick hook and the best beat. <br />best line: <br />\\"Super Nintendo sega genesis, <br />when i was dead broke man i couldnt picture this,<br />50 inch screen money green leather sofa, <br />got two rides a limousine with a chaffeur\\" <br /> <br />11.Everyday Struggles 9.5/10 this is an underappreciated track that really shows off his storytelling ability.Has been used in a lot of remixes over more addictive beats. <br />Best line: <br />\\"Im sein body after body and that mayor Giuliani, <br />aint tryin to see no black man turn to Jon Gotti, <br />my daughter use the potty so she older now, <br />educated street knowledge Im a mold her now\\" <br /> <br />12.Me and My B**** 9/10 the greatest hip hop love song of all time <br />Best line: <br />\\"When I met ya I admit my first thoughts was a trick, <br />you looked so good I suck on your daddy's d***\\" <br /> <br />13.Big Poppa 10/10 its basically the pop song of the album but is so addictive  <br />best line: <br />\\"Money h**s and clothes, <br />All a n**** knows\\" <br /> <br />14.Respect 9.5/10 again u need to listen to this more than once to really understand how great it is..talks about his life since the day he was born <br />best line: <br />\\"10 months in this gut what the f***, <br />I wish moms would hurry up so I can get buck wild, <br />rippin mics and s*** New York New York, <br />ready for the likes of this, <br />then came the worst date May 21st, <br />2:19 thats when my momma water burst\\" <br /> <br />15.Friend of Mine 8/10 basically tells how he cant love a woman <br />best line: <br />\\"Now when Im f***in this Jen I'm invincible, <br />dont love no h** thats my principle\\" <br /> <br />16.Unbelievable 10/10 oh my god this is so good lyrically..if you're a lyric lover you'll love this..also has a knockin beat <br />memorable line: <br />\\"ba****ds duckin when big be buckin, <br />chicken****s be cluckin in my bathroom f***in\\"  <br /> <br />17.Sucidial Thoughts 10/10 this song changed my life  <br />memorable line: <br />\\"it dont make sense goin to heaven wit the goodie goodies, <br />dressed in white i like black timbs and black hoodies\\" <br /><br />18.Whot Shot ya? 10/10 has one of the best beats on the album even though its just a bonus track. <br />\\"and I'm brooklyn's finest, <br />you rewind this, <br />bad boys behind us\\" <br /> <br />19.Just playing 9/10 talks about all the r and b divas he wants to sleep with. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks and DVD are definitley worth the extra $$$... buy this version cause it has bonus tracks and sounds fresher since it was digitally remastered just last year. Its a great album and I reccomend it to anyone who loves hip hop.. but then again if you're a little girl who listens to britney spears and 50 cent, you probably shouldnt buy this..This isnt for people who consider Nelly,Lil Jon, Ludacris, and G-Unit to be the greatest rappers ever..
B0000YEEHG|4.0|This movie is truly magnificent. The visuals here are truly something else. I wouldn't be too sure about what sort of interpretation I should give because the movie is very open ended and hence you are left to make your own take on what this is about. Some will like it, some will not. I found it a very gripping story of sorts. There is a story to it but the thing becomes fractured midway through and from then on you have to make your own way through this movie. It does question the impact of friendships and the deceit and betrayal that can come from them. It's all very real in a sense and then it's not. It is that which questions our own take on reality. In a way I suppose it is a very existential movie. Though by no means should you take my word for granted. See the movie for yourself, take from the film what you can ( if there's anything there for you ).
B000002I6T|5.0|\\"I wonder who they are<br />The men who REALLY run this land?<br />And I wonder why they run it<br />With such a thoughtless hand.<br />What are their names<br />And on what streets do they live?<br /><br />I'd like to RUN right over.<br />and give them a piece of my mind<br />...\\"<br /><br />Crosby combines the services of parts of The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Neil Young ( see above), Joni Mitchell and others. Everybody sings and plays. Hippies who loved harmony. Great harmonies that float around the room like organ chords flying in Grace Cathedral. Very San Francisco Haight-Ashbury. People report getting a contact-high just from listening.<br /><br />Particularly wonderful I have always thought, is \\"Orleans\\", the laid-back \\"Mt Tamalpais High\\", the Title track and Neil Young's song quoted above, is just as true today as in 1969. I like all but the edgy \\"Cowboy Movie' but don't let that keep you from buying this masterpiece.<br /><br />Crosby is at the heights of his powers before drugs and coke would ruin his life. The sound, is not nearly as good as the vinyl, but worth keeping either way.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Okay, so the movie isn't like the book.  So, who cares?  If you really wanted the movie to be like the book, it would be a 7-hour movie.  Alfonso Cuaron does a good job adapting the book to the movie.  I have read the all the books so far, and I can see nothing to complain about any of the movies.<br /><br />  Harry Potter has an enemy.  No, it isn't Lord Voldemort.  It's Sirius Black, a follower of Voldemort.  Black has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban, which is supposed to be impossible to do.  The movie doesn't explain how Black escaped from Azkaban.  Harry goes back to Hogwarts, where he faints when a Dementor is near.  A Dementor is a guard of Azkaban, and they suck all of the happiness from you.  Harry, Ron and Hermonie discover that Sirius Black did not kill any of the people he was accused of killing.  Nor is Black a follower of Voldemort.  Harry gets to ride a Hippogriff, one of the highpoints in the movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|In the spirit of not wanting to re-state what everyone else has said, I will keep this quite brief. Idina Menzel is simply amazing, espscially when she belts out \\"Defying Gravity\\". Kristin shines as well, but Idina Menzel eclipses her times ten. Love the soundtrack, love the book, can't wait to see it in Chicago on August 24th. BUY \\"WICKED\\"...simply for Idina.  <br />

B0006L16N8|3.0|I like Coldplay. I really, genuinely, do. But they can't seem to diversify themself in the music world. They are a standard act, and, I know I'm gonna get beat up by some twenty-something Coldplay fans for saying this, but everything sounds the same. The two hottest singles off of their last two albums sound exactly alike. Honestly, who can find one big difference between \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Clocks\\". Before Coldplay was just struggling to be somebody. And now that they well above being just somebody, they feel like they can be anybody. I recall Chris Martin discussing about just how hard Coldplay worked on their X&Y. This obviously led me to believe that this album's release would be an explosive cosmic event. In terms of record sales it was, in terms of album content the album was sheer depression. In fact, the album has sat atop the charts for three weeks running, displaying Americans shallow music taste. If Coldplay had genuinely worked hard, their new album would sound a bit like the White Stripes' recent efforts, meaning every song would be a sonic curveball. But the songs are not. They're preachy and lackluster. I'm sorry to admit it, but these guys are run of the mill rock. However, the American public makes them look like rock gods. Coldplay is beginning to fall into the commercial pit, one that Eminem is falling into and one that Britney Spears has always been in. By the way, congrats to Britney being a new, white-trash failure of a mother. Exciting! Anyways, the difference between Coldplay, Britney, and Em is that Britney's always been disposable, Em has wit that far surpasses Chris Martin's croons, and Coldplay is just beginning to sound bad. The sad part is Chris Martin and crew sounded bad just as they became kings of the rock world. Eminem was actually churning out some of the best raps laid to wax when he was king of the rap world. It's just the opposite. Bottom line: Coldplay MUST start working harder to sound fresh. Not so that they can sell records, my, they're already doing that, but so that they don't make fools of the American public once again, who can't seem to pick out genuine music in a mainstream wave.

1565114582|1.0|I am a new father and I thought this book would be helpful with our first child. The only part of the book I found useful was interpreting a baby's needs by observing what he does. The rest of the book I found frustrating and sometimes condescending. That's right, \\"Ducky\\". It got to the point that I could not even finish it, I was so angry. <br /> <br />Tracy's book states \\"A baby needs to be shown his/her place within the family, and thus should not be the one to dictate when s/he eats, sleeps or plays.\\" She also states that babies should not be fed on demand, but on a schedule, as part of her \\"EASY\\" plan. It's a great theory, but try getting that to work with breastfeeding, where you never know exactly how much milk the baby has consumed. Tracy states that we should learn to read our baby's needs, then respond to them (like when he's hungry). However, that's the essence of feeding on demand, which Tracy is against, isn't it? That's a contradiction. We learn to read our baby's needs, and when he's hungry, we shouldn't feed him, but deny our baby food until the next scheduled feeding. This is cruel, and just added more chaos and crying to the household rather than reducing it. <br /> <br />And what's wrong with rocking a baby to sleep in your arms? It's one of the great pleasures of my day. It's not something you should do, according to Tracy. What you should do is place him in his crib when his eyes are heavy. He invariably wakes up when you do this, so you repeat the process until he falls asleep on his own. This can take an eternity and is equally frustrating. <br /> <br />Skip this book.
B00005JKN9|1.0|You'll need a strong stomach for this one.  No doubt there was a deep seated prejudice against the Irish immigrants in the 19th century, there was crime in New York, anti-Lincoln feeling, and race riots occurred there also.  But this movie made one think that there was nothing but hate, poverty and riots in Manhattan.  Don't believe it!    It is hard to know what the movie was trying to say.  Was it a social statement or a Hamlet-like tale about revenge.  Everyone was shown as corrupt including the Mayor and his people, the leaders of the gangs, the police and the armed forces, the outstanding newspaper publisher in the City and the protagonist and his love interest.  How did the City ever get to the 20th century?    The movie had little focus, lots of violence, mostly unnecessary violence, and there was no one worth one's admiration, sympathy or pity.
0393316041|4.0|For those of us who ditched studying the sciences for arts, it is obvious we suffered from malnutrition: we needed a dose of feynman. <br />Richard Feynman was born in New York, where he harnessed his skills as a radio mechanic during the Depression.  He studied Theoritical Physics at MIT, then Princeton, before moving to Cornell as a visiting lecturer. Interspersed within this period was a stint at Los Alamos in the Manhattan Project where he rubbed shoulders with the creme de la creme of the scientific community. <br />Now, there are a lot of scientists who have excelled better in their fields; there might even be some who even had rather interesting lives. What separates Feynman's reminisces from those of his peers is his jollity. Infact his book is infected with it. <br />Between globetrotting to foreign universities for lectures, and hobnobbing with intellectual brahmins, he found time to learn the bungo drums, paint naked models, among other escapades. <br />Surely you are joking, is not a timeline detailing his progress from birth to death, rather it is a fascinating pastiche of tales from his varied life. <br />His cracking of safes was a real treat for me, as was the snippet of his greeting a lady in chinese. I also enjoyed his forays into speed dating (When we've thought of  all scientists as boring?)The sketches of contemporaries like Einstein, Bohr, and Watson, were also entertaining. <br />The writing is hilarious, the science though easy to understand is never dumbed down. We find a man who was incapable of sycophancy, who never lost his childlike fascination for the unknown, and though a theorist, was among the minority of those who could apply what they taught. <br />Read this book and enjoy the life of a man who was intent on enjoying life to the full; enter the mind of one of the greatest minds of the just gone century.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|It's summer, it's 110 degrees at 5pm outside, and the theatre is air conditioned. This movie is just fine. Beautiful scenes, places i'll never see in real life. It's simple, mindless fun for an evening. Unbelievable plot, nothing really makes sense so you stop trying and just drift with the flow.<br /><br />It's cute, busy, fun, with unsophisticated humor, and stupid jokes.<br /><br />just go for it.
B000059T00|5.0|i'm not sure why this album isn't more widely know and heralded as a great, original and unique (redundant i realize) album from the still relatively early days of rock.  perhaps it is because clapton's guitar playing is subdued and chiming vs. aggressive and bluesy as was his other work prior to this album.  the whole sound of the album is different than anythimg else you'll hear and has a haunting melodic feel throughout.  cant find my way home is the track that, to me, stands above the rest, but only slightly.  compared to the \\"supergroups\\" of today (Audioslave, Velvet Revolver, etc.) this album is truly new and different than the artists previous work and the collective musical talent truly shines through.  <br /> <br />guy smiley signing off...
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I'm not a metal fan per se, although I do love a lot of bands that play pretty heavy music (Helmet, King Crimson, Faith No More. . .).  IMO, SOAD's music is very sophisticated and avant garde in a lot of ways, and is a good match for fans of those three bands.  Musically I like this album a LOT, and appreciate the genre-hopping that this release adds to their repertoire; it's definitely reminiscent of FNM.  But. . . while I agree with the politics of the lyrics I think their execution is pretty sophomoric.  I hope that with the next album they write they can come up with lyrics that better fit the intelligence of the music without compromising their viewpoint. <br /> <br />I also really like the Armenian musical influence that they bring, and hope they pursue this more.  I'm a fan of traditional Armenian music (e.g., the band Arev).  Bringing in this influence helps give SOAD a unique sound. <br /> <br />Recommended.

B000002LEE|5.0|One of the most original and unique records of its era, \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" is the album that turned into the bar for alternative music.  In many ways the LA variant of grunge, Jane's Addiction successfully combines the sounds of '70s arena rock with a punk sensibility and a post-punk feel, adding Perry Farrell's esoteric and often dense lyrics on top of this.  While commercial success would follow with \\"Ritual de lo Habitual\\", its controversial artwork and its hit single, this is in my assessment the superior album, and the benchmark for alternative music since.  Its a testament to Jane's Addiction that few records have been able to match this. <br /> <br />Admittedly, Jane's is probably not for everyone-- its hard to deny the instrumental prowess of this band: guitarist Dave Navarro can wail away with the best of them, and its through him that the influence of '70s and '80s arena sounds come through.  Bassist Eric Avery has a very different sensibility, if there's one thing about Avery, its that he's really a master of sitting in a pocket, whether featured in a melodic context or even just marching to the guitar line-- he phrases slightly off to provide that sort of groove feeling.  And drummer Stephen Perkins is probably the best of his generation, with a fine technique and an expressiveness that is really quite rare to find in modern drummers.  But the band's calling card is really Perry Farrell, and he's the kind of thing you sort of like or dislike straight off-- his kind of punk-meets-Queen vocal approach, very much over the top the way Freddie Mercury was, but filtering out much of the technique in place of passion and a raw wail.  It's not for everyone. <br /> <br />Getting past the band, the music on this album is intense-- their proclivity for rambling, musically, further accentuates the tighter material, and they manage to strike a fine balance between the two that they'd miss on future releases.  Avery and Perkins lock together and provide propulsive foundations, laid back grooves, and ambiance to the pieces-- Navarro either explodes or focuses on color, and Farrell maintains a surrealist presence, drifting, seemingly randomly at times, in and out of the pieces, content to babble abstractly rather than provide coherent lyrics at times.  It sounds like a mess, but it works well, from the explosive \\"Ocean Size\\"-- a driven modern rock anthem to the funky, laid back, atmospheric and deeply disturbing \\"Ted, Just Admit It\\" (about serial killer Ted Bundy) to the delicate, lilting ballad \\"Summertime Rolls\\".  The band could rock (\\"Mountain Song\\"), swing (\\"Thank You Boys\\") and get plain funky (\\"Idiots Rule\\"), or move into a delicate mode with acoustic guitars and steel drums (single \\"Jane Says\\").  And for the album closer, they give in to Farrell's most self indulgent tendency with the totally bizarre \\"Pigs in Zen\\", an alternative masterpiece that needs to be heard to be explained. <br /> <br />The members of the band would manage one more album before literally getting into fist fights on-stage at Farrell brainchild Lollapalooza, and while they've all gone on to produce some great music outside of the band, none of them would quite reach this level.  Essential listening.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|#1, this is my first time writing a review, after years of buying DVD's and such from Amazon and reading everyone elses opinions, and I figured its time to add my 2 cents, and figured theres no better DVD to rate than Team America: World Police! <br /> <br />WOW!  In this world of CGI and flat out unreal film with everything looking like it came out of a computer other than a humans own hands, Team America takes a step in a different direction with a movie fully comprised of marionettes... or Puppets! And the funny thing is, it works!  The very first scene starts with what looks like cardboard cut out landscape and a horribly acted puppet and I was like OH MY GOSH this is gonna be horrible, only to have the scene pan back and open up to a vast view of (an Americans view) of Paris, and was wow'd immediately by the detail placed into this movie....   <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and by the way, the movie is HILARIOUS!  Its good to finally see Trey and Matts original version in this uncut and unrated version and gotta say this is some of the most hilarious visual and verbal comedy there is, and this rates right at the top of funniest movies of the year.    <br /> <br />Its smart, funny, and full of political satire to keep ya talkin for weeks (tell me watching North Korean President Kim Jung Yu or whatever the hell is name is sing about being Lonely didnt have ya dying!)   IF YA HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE BUY THE UNCUT DVD NOW!  TRUST ME, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B000819PKC|5.0|This album is as good as Travelling Without Moving. Perhaps better. The funky grooves are definitely back. There are some strong tracks  ...Starchild, World That He Wants, Seven Days, Give Hate A Chance...virtually every one is great. Usually I find one stinker I really can't stand but everything on Dynamite oozes class and good songwriting. The import and UK release has the additional track Time Won't Wait which is worth the extra cash alone. Why they decided to leave it off the US and European release baffles me as its a fantastic piece. I have all the Jamiroquai albums and this has turned into one of my favourite  after spinning it for just 2 weeks. Jay Kay may be the bad lad the music industry loves to hate but they can't deny the boy has talent. The album could do with a good jazzy instrumental (a la Roy Ayers) but that's just nitpicking. Excellent.
0783114222|5.0|In a docudrama like this, even a nitpicker like me looks more for their getting the tone right, rather than the bare facts. Does it emphasize what mattered, and in the right way? Does it cover the essentials? And this production absolutely does. <br /> <br />You get a feel for just how risky Apollo 8 was, and what it meant to Americans alive at that time to be sitting in front of their televisions on Christmas Eve watching a hazy triangle of lunar surface go by while listening to men a quarter-million miles away read sublime poetry. I was ten years old then, and I still remember it vividly. <br /> <br />You get a feel for what it took to build a machine to land men safely on the Moon, and what it took out of those who built it. <br /> <br />You understand the scientific goals of the missions, and how the astronauts were persuaded to pursue them - and how enthusiastic some of them got, once they fully understood how important their efforts were to geologists back home. <br /> <br />It's just a superb evocation in every way, especially the chapters I single out: \\"1968\\" (about Apollo 8), \\"Spider\\" (Apollo 9, the first to fly the lunar module), and \\"Galileo Was Right\\" (Apollo 15, the first mission focused on science). If there's a weakness, it's the Apollo 13 chapter, which in order not to duplicate the (wonderful) movie focuses on the news coverage of the mission rather than the mission itself. I would have liked them to focus on what the mission controllers and ground support personnel did, a topic that the movie left plenty of room for. <br /> <br />But the rest is absolutely brilliant. I seldom find time to watch my DVDs and videotapes, particularly ones I've seen already, but I've watched episodes of this over and over again. Highly recommended.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Five years ago I was obsessed with Britney Spears and not much else. I don't like her as much as I used to, because I'm older, but I also remembering loving Moby at the same time. I find this quite strange because I was listening to, essentially, teeny-bopper music and also the amazing music of Moby. Ever since I heard the singles from \\"Play\\" in early 2000 I knew I had to have a copy of this album. I planned on buying it but never got around to doing so. I saw it on sale last week in a record store and bought it straight away. I had sort of forgotten about the songs from this album, but once I took a listen they all came back to me.<br /><br />I also remember around five years ago I was in school talking to my form tutor and she told me I had to have a copy of this album. She was a really great woman and meant a lot to me through a tough time in my early teens, so I was reminded of how good a soul she was when I listened to this album again. Even thought this album was released in January 1999, it took a full year to make even the slightest dint in the UK album chart. Once it started climbing, though, nothing could stop it. This album was absolutely huge over here and spent 6 weeks at No.1, selling over 2 million copies. The fact that every song on the album has been licensed and used in advertisements or TV shows makes this a familiar sound, so there shouldn't be too many shocks when you hear this for the first time.<br /><br />I have been very interested in the blues samples that Moby has incorporated into many of these songs. I think the sampling of these soulful vocals is not only haunting but very eerie when juxtaposed with the ambient, modern electronica. There's a sense of old versus new on a lot of these songs, but they are both tied up by an incredible sense of loneliness; the music is sparse and diverse, epic and daunting, while the arrangements remain rather simple and chilled.<br /><br />The album opens with the strange \\"Honey.\\" This samples the blues vocals of Bessie Jones and is a very funky opener. You can't really understand what she's singing, but this adds to the mystery. The instruments are quite heavy and make for a foot-stomping intro. \\"Find My Baby\\" is a superb song which samples Boy Blue's 'Joe Lee's Rock'. This is quite a repetitive song because the same line of \\"I'm gonna find my baby! WOO! Before the sun goes down!\\" is repeated over and over. It's insanely catchy and stands out a mile because the vocal is just so strong. The guitar is very funky too and the addition of more electronica is very surreal. \\"Porcelain\\" is probably the most popular song off this album and peaked at No.5 in the UK. The strange intro soon makes way for a beautiful piano solo and some altered vocals by Moby. This song is so pure and natural, it's like a flower opening for the first time in reaction to the sun. Very delicate and fragile yet powerful and moving. \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\" is a very sad and sombre song that tells the tale of a man who feels so low because he is alone. Everybody in the world can relate to this song; even when you're surrounded by people you can feel completely alone. The vocals are very emotional and the soundscapes that undulate in the background are so poignant. The sharp female vocal-yelp in the background tops off a classic song.<br /><br />\\"Southside\\" is another incredible song is probably the most commercial song on the whole record. The guitars are quite heavy on this song and work a treat against Moby's voice in the chorus. I love the idea of travelling through a sort of underworld with your friends. The way the vocals rise and fall also makes for quite an anthemic song. \\"Rushing\\" is not on a par with the previous five songs but it's still a great track. The female vocals on this song are incredibly relaxing, accentuated more by the piano in the background. \\"Bodyrock\\" was used in the credits to Veronica's Closet, and is a great dance track with some funky lyrics. This song has a veryurban, underground feel to it that is of course repetitive but very addictive. \\"Natural Blues\\" was the first Moby song I think I ever heard. I was in absolute awe at the video starring Christina Ricci, which shows the idea of death and old age. It's incredibly moving and very emotional. The vocals are very strong here, and this song is a classic that everyone has heard. \\"Machete\\" is the most upbeat, hardcore song on the album. The beat is heavy and races like blood through the veins. It really gets your adrenaline pumping!<br /><br />\\"7\\" is seen by many as a pointless interlude, but I really like it. It breaks the album up a bit and has a very eerie quality to it. \\"Run On\\" is totally not what I expected from this album, because it's just incredibly strange. The song opens with an up-tempo piano solo and strange blues vocals are soon added. It's very traditional of the area it's from in terms of lyrical content and especially the deep harmonising in the background. \\"Down Slow\\" is another short interlude and yet again I love it. This is followed by the beautiful \\"If Things Were Perfect.\\" This song is very sparse and alienated with the odd lyrics \\"Give me summer!\\" being echoed across the electronic baseline. The record-scratching is also very chilling and calming. \\"Everloving\\" opens with a soft guitar and some deep humming. This song definitely tries to get across a message of peace, tranquility, and most of all, love. The song begins to open after around a minute with this high pitched tone that rises and rises like the sun in the sky. Definitely one of the most beautiful songs on the album. \\"Inside\\" is another excellent song that opens with a deep throb that continues on throughout the length of the song. This song is so beautiful and sensual because the beat that rides on the back of this throb is so perfectly aligned. The two dance this unique dance for almost five minutes as a piano joins in at the end to close things.<br /><br />\\"Guitar Flute And String\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album. It's still quite interesting though, and the flute brings out thoughts and feelings of loneliness inside you that you never knew existed. \\"The Sky Is Broken\\" is a very dark and quite unnerving song. The beat is sparse and very direct, as it echoes around your ears and back. Moby's voice is very content and relaxed, almost dead. The piano that creeps in during the chorus is very atmospheric, as are the ambient strings that come in later on. The album closes with the amazing \\"My Weakness.\\" This song almost makes me cry, it is so beautiful. I haven't cried to it yet, but I just know it's going to be one of those songs that I will cry to at some point in the future. This song was also used in Season 7 of The X-Files, and with good reason. This is like the sound of a celestial choir descending from the Heavens, giving us a brief glimpse of the beauty contained within. The reason I feel this is because it's almost too beautiful to describe, like you've been trusted with a secret that you feel honoured to be a part of.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />There's a total of 18 songs on this album, and at first you might think you'll have trouble getting through every song. This is totally not true. The music on this album seems to all bleed into one, yet many of the songs are different in style. For example, compare Find My Baby to My Weakness, and they are world's apart! I'm glad I took the advice of my form tutor from five years ago because this album will be with me for life. Eminem is SO wrong when he says nobody listens to techno. Arrogant little fool. Moby is a true genius, and so what if he's a bit of a simpleton? He makes awesome music and that's all that matters.

0618164413|4.0|I got this book for my 4 yr old daughter  and she really loves the stories.....they are just the right length for her age and the pictures keep her attention....Bring back alot of memories....I only gave it 4 stars though for what I write below.... <br /> <br />Parents should be warned of some illiustrations/ideas...Noteably in one, Curious George jumps up on a windowsill  and makes like he is climbing/looking out (can not remember if he actually does climb out) ...You can see form the illlustration that the window is atleast a 2nd or 3rd floor window.......Now my daughter knows better but for a smaller child, this might give them ideas....ACTAULLY alot of his antics might give kids ideas that we don't really want them to have....perhaps it is that I live in the city on a 10th floor so the window thing got me.....I don't know but I really did not think that illustration was well thought out and my Mom (without me saying anything) said \\"This really should not be here\\" about the SAME page.... <br /> <br />There are several other not very PC things in the book...Riding a bike at full speed without a helmet? Riding in a car without a seat belt?.....Also all the important figures are men for example...But I don't think my daughter really notices and I don't care....I mean I read these books when I was young and I wear my seatbelt ! LOL! <br /> <br />I think as parents we often look too much into these books and should take them for what they are - fun and for kids.......BUT I do I find myself often saying \\"But we know that we don't do that in real life, right? That is just in the book\\"  cuz George is very curious and does lots of things that as parents we would not be too happy about (like, uh, running away constantly or bringing the garden hose into the hose to wash the rug?) <br /> <br />But I have to say my daughter really likes the book and  so far we have read a story a night before bed since we got the book...I think we have one left!  <br /> <br />P.S. The book weighs a TON!
0385512104|3.0|Christopher is a 15 year old boy with a brilliant mind.  His ability to comprehend logic and math is nothing short of genius.  However, he is also autistic, and has extreme trouble when trying to understand human emotion, sarcasm, and other parts of everyday life that most people take for granted.  This novel is told from Christopher's perspective as he travels through his days and recounts his thoughts and observations.  Initially his story begins as he encounters his neighbor's dead dog and sets out to investigate who the murderer is in Sherlock Holmes style.  He is ultimately faced with the destruction of his parent's relationship and sets off on an adventure that even he is not sure he can survive.      This unique narrator gives the reader insight into how autistic individuals think and feel.  Christopher describes how he gets physically nauseous when confronted with too much visual stimulation, and how he cannot stand to be touched by others.  Certain colors bother him so much that he avoids all foods and objects of those colors.  When he doesn't get his way or is uncomfortable he groans or screams and throws a fit which scares and annoys the people around him.  But we also learn that unlike a spoiled child, he simply cannot understand why these reactions are inappropriate.  In fact, these outbursts are the only tools he has to effectively communicate his discomfort and dislikes.    There is a somewhat monotonous tone to the book and at times it is dry given that Christopher is not in tune with ordinary human emotion, but it is a fascinating look into the mind of someone that very few of us have an opportunity to encounter.  It gives perspective on the amazing amount of patience that is required to care for someone with autism on an everyday basis.
B000254EXC|5.0|Originally I had owned \\"Closer\\" the original version, but when I picked up the CD \\"Live at The Greek\\" and heard \\"Mi Morena\\" I just knew I had to have this special version, regardless of cost. Josh Groban has a really great voice and I adore it. It's kind of odd for me being that I'm a goth/doom metal chick, but I love to just sit and listen to Josh. Just buy this, his version of \\"She's out of My Life\\" is excellent as well. And the DVD has some priceless moments. :P ~Daniela

B00003CXA6|3.0|The widescreen edition of Gettysburg is a good movie to gain insights into the thinking of the Southern generals involved in the battle for the areas around Gettysburg. However, the battle scenes, which pre-date advanced computer character generation techniques and far below expectations of typical audiences in 2005.<br /><br />About 25% of the story involves the actions around the infamous \\"Pickett's Charge.\\" The movie does bring out the fact that although the action is named after Pickett, he wasn't doing this of his own desire. He was ordered. As Martin Sheen presents General Lee, Pickett's orders came from a general dealing with an overly-large ego and wanting to win the high ground regardless of the cost.<br /><br />Today, many of the techniques demonstrated so successfully in The Lord of the Rings could be used to enhance the numbers of soldiers involved in the battles so that they would more closely resemble the masses (~75,000 from the South and ~90,000 from the North) involved in the battle. It is estimated about 15,000 men charged the center of the union line on the last day, walking across a mile of open land, going uphill to meet the Northern army. Certainly a remake of this scene alone could add a lot to the impact.<br /><br />And ignore the beards... (they must not have had a large facial hair budget).

B0001GF2DS|5.0|I'm sure people have spent much time reviewing how great this movie is, and it is. So I'll keep it very short, and just comment on a couple of extras. It was cool that the extra footge was added in, but having Eli and Clint do the lines so recently was very distracting and obvious (as in, you could tell they were very old). For integrity purposes, it was cool, but for movie consistency, I almost would have liked to have had an impersonation closer to the original younger voices. It would have made these added scenes seem less obvious as added/restored scenes. Secondly, I've heard some people complain about the commentary being dry and boring. Personally, I liked it. Either way, who cares, these are just the extras... the film itself is phenomenal. You don't have to like westerns... if you like Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this. Probably, you'll love it for what it is, though!
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now has long been one of my favorite ten films. I found Apocalypse Now Redux to be an excellent reintroduction to a film that I have not seen in over 20 years.  <br /> <br />The story is the classic story of Ulysses and his sailors encountering adventure after adventure; yet these deadly dark adventures reveal the nature of warfare and the return to a killer instinct to survive under such conditions. <br /> <br />The story is based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and as the film explores the mind of Captain Willard, the mind of Colonel Kurtz, and the aboriginal world they eventually inhabit the meaning of 'heart of darkness' becomes all too clear. <br /> <br />Whereas the case against Col. Kurtz is presented as a man gone insane who has lost all respect for societal authority, we learn that he gradually became a warrior in the classic sense and grew beyond the control of a Pentagon system of career generals.  <br /> <br />The most telling lines in the film is the description Kurtz gives of the mission to give polio vaccine to a village of South Vietnamese sympathizers. As soon as the children are innoculated and the army leaves, the Viet Cong enter the village and cut off the little arms of the children. Kurtz says: \\"What genius!\\" Kurtz had come to believe that in a war to defeat the enemy that every effort should be made to achieve that goal and that the chain of command above him in Viet Nam did not have the mindset to achieve a victory with these methods. Because the Vietnamese were willing to employ such ruthless methods, Kurtz knew that it was only a matter of time before the United States would be defeated. The image or parable of the leaderless soldiers is played over and over in the film, where Willard can never seem to find the commanding officer at one hell hole after another. <br /> <br />Multiple aspects of the insanity of war are shown. One story within the story is that of Clean, the 17 year old Black youth from the Bronx. He overreactsin a terrible scene where he kills a group of Vietnamese boat merchants in an act of homocidal panic. Later he is killed while his mother's sweet voice is heard on a tape recorder sending him a message not to get hurt. <br /> <br />Lance the California surfer gradually mentally deteriorates until he is ready to move into the jungle with Kurtz's tribe.  <br />Chief from Louisiana has maturity and common sense and it is symbolic that he has his head cut off.  <br /> <br />The scene at the French rubber plantation is highly criticized but yet gives one of the most accurate descriptions of the way the United States inherited a needless catastrophy in IndoChina. Toward the end of World War II in Europe, Roosevelt was very insistent that both France and Great Britian give up their empires in Africa and Asia. After all, the United States helped them defeat Nazism, not support them in anti-democratic empire maintenance. DeGaulle flatly refused to join NATO unless he was able to keep Vietnam. When Ho Chi Minh, an expert on the United States Constitution, ask Secretary Dulles for help driving out the French so that the Vietnames could have freedom and democracy, the Secretary of State sided with the French to maintain a balance of power in Europe becuase of fear of Stalin. We paid dearly for this miscalculation as the Vietnames then courted the Chinese, their traditional enemy. This series of events is discussed tangentially at the French family's dinner table. Read Henry Kissinger's chapter on the French in Indochina in his book: \\"On Diplomacy\\", and the conversation at the dinnertable all makes perfect sense. <br /> <br />Yet, it is not the historic that is the powerful engine of this machine. It is the dark journey of Willard into and out of the dark jungle of humanities most base instincts. The original Heart of Darkness is about an officer gone \\"insane\\" in the Belgium Congo, which is a reminder to us the viewer that this is not really about Vietnam, this is about man thekiller and society's methods of dealing with those of us that cross that line. <br /> <br />
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|With its controversial can't-make-out-a-bloody-thing shaky camera work that deliberately obscures the action, I was reminded of 2001. What would happen if those apes found a movie camera instead of a bone? Would the results look just like The Bourne Supremacy? <br /> <br />Well, no, I think the monkeys would make a better fist of it. But I definitely got the impression that Monkey Boy didn't understand the first thing about movie-making or storytelling. Maybe a little bit more respect for the audience might be in order next time, Mr Greengrass. If we wanted to see nothing but blurs, we'd spin around in circles until we made ourselves dizzy, not waste 6.50 on an out of focus movie. It ain't art and it ain't funny, it's just a rip-off. <br /> <br />Grengrass has been getting away with this shoddy style for years in bad TV shows and dramas and seems unable to understand a) just how much more irritating it is when magnified 100 times on a movie screen; and b) that the more you use it, the less effective it becomes. It's certainly not realistic - in case he hasn't noticed, people's eyes adjust focus naturally, so the constant needless shifts of focus were just moronic and totally unjustifiable - and it really did feel that the whole movie had been shot by an epileptic monkey on roller skates. I feel sorry for Damon and the stunt team who saw all the hard work they put in that was wasted by the inept, amateur night direction. I really felt cheated out of my time and money. And the worst of it is that Monkey Boy Greengrass will probably get to ruin more movies in the future now. One thing - I know better than to waste my money on any of them now. This was a good movie ruined by a director with contempt for his collaborators and the the audience. Shameful.  <br /> <br />
B00064AM6C|5.0|I am a musician - I play because I love music.  That's it - bottom line.  This was my first glimpse of Jack and Meg White, and I was floored!  I'd heard the hype, and frankly, I resisted even giving them a chance.  I'd heard it before countless times about so many other nameless bands shoved down our throats by the record industry... but The White Stripes are the REAL DEAL.  It comes thru that they do this because the LOVE it, not to be famous or to make money, blah blah blah - it's who they are.  Buy this DVD and you will see what the love of THE MUSIC is all about.  Forget the hype, the marketing, the demographics, the INDUSTRY - just grab your guitar(or drumsticks) and PLAY!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Just when you thought the dawning of the millenium was going to wander by without producing one single musical phenomanon, we are introduced to the soul enchanting likes of Gavin Degraw. Belting rock numbers infused with umistakeable soul Gavin Degraw places himself in the \\"unique category\\", and noones complaining. The most captivating aspect of this artist is despite have different styles and sounds he incorporates them into eachother flawlessly making for catchy songs, with genuine feeling. Chariot,his freshman effort is quite frankly extraordinary. Boasting gritty vocals sprinkled with soul, and solid song writing \\"Chariot\\" is a refreshing wonder, from an inspiring artist.
B00005JLEU|4.0|After seeing \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" a few weekends ago and loving every second of it, I thought it would be a good idea to check Hayao Miyazaki's other animated films. I recently rented \\"Spirted Away\\" and viewed it for the first time.<br /><br />A young girl named Chihiro and her parents are traveling to their new  home. Along the way, the father decides to take a detour. Big mistake. He comes across what he thinks is an abandoned amusement park. When Chihiro's father and mother sees food, they begin to stuff their faces. It turns out that the food is for the gods and spirits who have travelled to this spa for them. As punishment for eating the food, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs. Chihiro meets a mysterious boy named Haku who gives her instructions to go to see about getting a job at the spa from a witch named Yubaba so she can stay and try to help her parents. At first Yubaba was reluctant but eventually she allows Chihiro to stay but at a cost, her name. Chihiro has to go by the name Sen. Over time Chihiro/Sen slowly gains confidence in herself and realizes her full potential.<br /><br />In the beginning, I found Chihiro annoying. She was shrill and obnoxious but as the film went on, her character quickly evolved and became more mature. The writing was excellent. The animation was a delight to watch. Like \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", I would have liked to have been able to watch this film in its original language. What Disney should have done was to include the option to view the film in Japanese on the dvd version. Otherwise I loved \\"Spirited Away\\". It is perfect for anyone of any age.
6305511055|5.0|I'm just getting around to seeing this espionage film.  A young Redford scrambles to understand and outwit the unknown elements trying to eliminate him.  Despite being over 20 years old, it doesn't have that dated feel that some films have.<br />The action grabs you without a lot of special effects and car chases.  The scenes with the leading lady sizzle.  Just watching Redford is a treat.<br />Of course, he was great in Butch Cassidy and in The Sting, so I don't know how I missed this one before.  If you haven't seen it for awhile, treat yourself to a fresh viewing.
B00005Y1UX|5.0|Usually, when a movie has a bunch of big names (that brings with it a very overinflated budget and a beyond crappy storyline), you know it's bound to suck.  That wasn't the case with Indecent Proposal.<br /><br />Sure, the plot became the favorite punchline of every comedian - professional and amateur - in the country but it also managed to stir up discussion among the fiscally conservative (meaning broke) portion of the population: Would you have a one-night stand with a wealthy person, or anyone who was offering you money, in order to make ends meet?  (In other words, would you be a temporary hooker?)<br /><br />Okay, the majority of us will never meet a billionaire or even a millionaire (who is single!) in a casino who will be bowled over by our movie-star looks but if you were on hard times, would you do it for the money?  (You can hear the bill collectors right now pushing you, \\"Say yes! Say yes!\\")<br /><br />Robert Redford, for all the age cracks, is a damn good actor (and better looking than these dorks half his age).  Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore had great chemistry between them to really carry the movie and make it an enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />A big-name movie that one can watch over and over.
B000060K4O|5.0|`Ghostbusters', produced and directed by Ivan Reitman, is probably the greatest single movie effort attributable to a Saturday Night Live ensemble. The principle perps responsible for this singularly great movie are the director plus writing by SNL alum Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, plus acting by another major comic talent, SNL alum Bill Murray and great performances put out by Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, and Ramis.<br /><br />Like many other great comedies such as `Some Like It Hot', `Blazing Saddles', and `Animal House', this movie benefits from the excellent premise which posits that ghosts are real and just happen to be making themselves known after a long fallow period. Part of this premise is that a trio of `professional academic parapsychologists' can work out an effective method for trapping these ghosts, spirits, apparitions, and vapors without one wit of testing on a real phastasmic being.<br /><br />Like `Some Like It Hot', but unlike `Blazing Saddles', writers Aykroyd and Ramis play it straight from those few premises, much like an excellent Science Fiction story by Robert Heinlein or Arthur C. Clarke. They don't play for cheap laughs in the style of Mel Brooks (not to say `Blazing Saddles' is not an immensely funny movie, just that it's writers and directors use different methods to get to the same end).<br /><br />Much of the humor in the early part of the movie is generated by the struggles of our three heroes, the future Ghostbusters Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis with the real world, beginning with the university (to all who have been in Manhattan, this will be recognized as Columbia, but Columbia allowed the moviemakers to film there if they would NOT identify the campus as Columbia) and continuing with mortgage bankers and real estate agents. At this point, Annie Potts, in a minor role, appears and adds just the right amount of counterbalance to the serious / ethereal role to be played by Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />The story does not go into too much detail on how it is an 80 year old building build to act as `spook central' on Central Park East should suddenly come to life, but questions like this don't come to mind until after the third or fourth viewing. And, this is for sure the most important criterion for whether you want to buy a DVD. Does it survive rewatching and offer new things on a second or third viewing? As someone who has seen this flick at least six or seven times, I assure you that I certainly believe it is worth rewatching. I even get the giggles when I see the license plate on the tricked up hearse which takes our heroes to their first gig, but my hearty belly laugh on first viewing is just a fond memory.<br /><br />Like all great comedies, going back at least as far as Shakespeare (and probably further, but I'm not up on my Aristophanes), the humor is made just a little more powerful by adding an element of danger to the story line. In the totally realistic `Animal House', it was the threat of our frat lads being expelled to the mercies of their draft boards. As the `Ghostbusters' premise is supernatural, the writers, director, and actors need to go just a little further than usual to make the peril believable. My hunch is that on this matter, the principles really hit the ball out of the park.<br /><br />For starters, the peril is built up slowly with the brief appearance of the ancient spirits in Sigourney Weaver's refrigerator just after the appearance of the first successful ghost capture which establishes the spirits as a genuine danger to corporeal beings. Even after so many viewings, I can still sense the tension when Ghostbuster Murray is reluctant to open the refrigerator where the initial sighting occurred. The visceral high point that still thrills is the psychic kidnapping of Weaver's character by the gatekeeper beast. From that point, the danger expands to grip not only our brave lads, but also all of Manhattan.<br /><br />It seems as if no movie which involves some civic,political, or financial organization can get to the finish without some nominal ally throwing a monkey wrench into the works and thereby making things worse. I just wonder why the authors picked the Environmental Protection Agency as the inadvertent heavy. I guess it was easiest to use a Federal agency as the dumbbell and leave the New York City government free to be saved with a clear conscience.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the last `big joke' involving the form taken by the ultimate heavy is less effective than all the business it took to get to the final reel.<br /><br />For being a pre-DVD era movie, this release has a very nice collection of special features, although the only two that mean much to me are the commentary track by Reitman and Ramis and the wide screen presentation. The commentary virtually doubles the number of times one can watch the flick with pleasure.<br /><br />I recall that `Ghostbusters' ranked somewhere around 25th in the AFI list of greatest comedies. I would have rated it in the top ten at least.es some civic, political, or financial organization can get to the finish without some nominal ally throwing a monkey wrench into the works and thereby making things worse.

0792151712|5.0|I can think of a ton of movies that are trashy, overhyped and overrated and James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" is *not* one of them.<br /><br />Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion but the folks criticizing this movie so vehemently usually have the attention span of a flea.  And if they did sit down long enough to watch the entire movie, they just don't get the history of it.<br /><br />If Cameron had decided to make the movie strictly as a documentary, it would have been called \\"boring.\\"  Since he attempted to make it interesting by centering the history of the disaster around a fictional love story, it's called \\"trashy.\\"  No, you can't win any which way you look at it so you make the movie in a way that's going to make money - and Cameron's formula worked...and then some.<br /><br />I liked this movie not because of the love story (and, yes, I'm one of those saps who can't help but cry as Rose lets Jack go after the ship has sunk and he disappears into the freezing darkness of the Atlantic) but because of the attention that was paid to the actual sinking.  It makes you think if some of what was shown did happen on that frosty night in April of 1912.  Had the action been cut off and the ship sunk in less than five minutes, the movie would have lost all credibility.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for the historical accuracy.  The only bad things about this movie were that Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were not nominated for Oscars for their performances.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|The first song I ever heared from Gavin was \\"I don't want to be\\". <br />Well, it got stuck in my head and I decided to check out the rest of the album. The cd I bought also includs the bonus disc - and together they are worth 5 stars. <br />I adore his voice - very sexy.It kind of get's to you - kind of slipping under your skin. I respect him even more for writing all the lyrics and music him self. Some of the lyrics are really good. Love \\"Chariot\\". <br /> The main cd really rocks. The stripped one is more tuned down and you get a different look at the songs. Beautiful! <br />This very soon became a favourite of mine and I hope many more of you will discover this \\"rock'n roll beauty\\".
B0007GAERG|5.0|I believe that this may be be Mariah's greatest achievement in the music industry yet.  I think that this album shows Mariah's true voice.  It really \\"emancipates\\" her talent!!  I think the best songs on the album are \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"Circles.\\"  I love how she belts those notes out. Mariah is back and she's hot!
B0006L16N8|3.0|I am a huge fan of Coldplay. However, this particular album did not deliver like i thought it would. Their past two albums \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" were both really good pieces, particularly my favorite is A Rush of Blood to the Head. I was anxiously waiting for X&Y to debut and when i bought this album after listening to it several times i found myself skipping through or barely being moved by this cd. There are only a few songs that actually do something for me and they are Square One, Speed of Sound, and Talk. I am a little disappointed because i guess maybe i expected too much from this album. If you are looking into buying a Coldplay album i recommend A Rush of Blood to the Head or Parachutes, this album however isn't that bad but not all that either.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Love the album, both CD's. <br /> <br />On the sleeve notes, Josh Homme is credited for 'Razor' and Nora Jones for 'Virginia Moon'. Surely it's the other way round? My first thought on hearing 'Virginia Moon' was 'Lullabies To Paralyze' from 'Songs For The Deaf'. But it sounds like Nora Jones on 'Razor' whereas I couldn't detect her at all on 'VM'. Maybe Josh Homme plays on both? <br /> <br /> <br />
006072448X|4.0|This book was at times difficult to read.  Not because of its content, but because of its wordiness.  Shriver at times, tends to use big fancy words when it is not necessary.  Other than that, the style in which the book is written (as letters to her husband) is brilliant.  Letters which after the fact, reveal far more than Franklin ever knew, or cared to know about his son.<br />I love how she reveals in the letters, her feelings about raising Kevin along with some secrets that Franklin did not know.  <br />Franklin was oblivious to Kevins life.  He only saw the good side of Kevin (and Kevin was sure that Franklin only saw what Kevin wanted him to see) whereas Eva, who as the mother spent far more time with him, knew the real Kevin.  No matter how much Eva would try to tell Franklin about Kevin, he would have none of it.  Kevin was Franklins little angle.  Only when Celia arrived did Franklin finally realize what a normal child should be like.  Only then did he realize how wrong he was about Kevin.  Only then, it was too late.<br />Is Eva or Franklin to blame for Kevins actions?  I dont think so.  Each tried their best to raise the best child they could.  However this story underlines the realities of having a child that is not wanted.  Eva did not want to be a mother.  She did not want to have a child.  It was Franklin who pushed her into having a child.  In the end, they, their marriage and the dead innocent bystanders paid the price.

B000002U82|5.0|A couple of day's ago as some of my friends and I were in a local coffee shop a guy came wearing a t-shirt with the album cover to \\"the dark side of the moon.\\"<br /><br />I, of couse asked him what he thought of the album....and he had no clue what I was talking about.  He didn't have a clue what the meaning was behind the shirt he was wearing.  BLASEPHY! is the sole thought that came to mind.  This is the problem with Pink Floyd and today's generation.  Their name is still popular but their meaning is not.<br /><br />Dark Side of the Moon is one of those albums that hits you the first....and second.....and every time you listen to it.  From the slow tempo echoes of \\"us and them\\"  (up,up,up,up,up and down,down,down,down.  And in the end it's all just round and round) to the insane high-pitched ear piercing vocals on \\"great gig in the sky\\" to the radio-hit \\"Money.\\"  This album, if you have never listened to it needs to be listened to.  There is a reason why this is one of the highest selling albums of all-time, because it is lyrically and musically structured to utmost perfection.  Buy it now.
077106506X|5.0|Munro's unique portrayal of everyday aspects of life is rare around and the richness of it will make you want to read all of her other books. Most of the stories tell us how the characters that are easy to relate to are changed by events for forever The fact that this book is a series of well written stories that delve into the thoughts and dreams of the characters, thoughts and dreams that we all share, makes RUNAWAY and the other stories a recommended read. It is a superbly written work that takes its time to work its charm on you. With the same great writing that youll find in books such as The Bark of the Dogwood and the same intricate character detailing as youll see in works such as Kidds Secret life of Bees, this collection will surely not disappoint you.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I agree with many reviewers, Coldplay previous releases were a mile better than this one.Chris Martin makes abuses of h falsetto all over the cd,and i get tired of it.He`s reminds too often Radiohead`s Thom Yorke or Echo & Bunnymen`s style. Production is quite good and the songs are polished but that`s not enough for me.I think the album is sort of boring and monotonous due to the  economic and cheap drumming,there are no tempo changes during the songs.They should replace drummer urgently,it`s the engine of a pop-rock band.Despite of these flaws, the album has some quite good numbers like square one and white shadows,that is the right direction boys.Would i spend 15$ in this cd? No, i would buy Embrace`s out of nothing instead.(Chris Martin wrote a song for them, check out song \\"gravity\\" ).Same genre,but better crafted.
0515123447|4.0|I had not read Child before.  Once one gets past the huge coincidence and ignore that Reacher's response to any question is to shrug, you find an exciting, suspenseful, rather brutal read with some good characters and very good dialogue.  Jack is a loner but not above having a relationship.  There is non-stop action, a couple very good twists and some very interesting information about the U.S. currency system.  I'd place this in my airplane or beach book category, but I did enjoy it and plan to read more in the series.
B000002KK2|5.0|WOW!  For some reason, I had Rickie Lee Jones on my mind the other day and it occured to me I hadn't given this CD a listen in a few years.  Now I see that virtually on the same day, there's a brand new Anthology release. HMMMMM!!! Anywyay, RLJ IS THE DUCHESS OF COOLSVILLE.  <br /> <br />Nostalgic yet currently accessible, I am amazed I could ever file this away.  I've been listening to it for the past 2 days and it's absolutely incredible that I was enjoying these songs immensely in the early 80s! It soared way above just about anything else that was current during that period of music and again, 25 years later, the same thing holds true! <br /> <br />One of the greatest things I enjoy so much about this collection of songs is that it takes you through a gamut of emotion.  How many artists can do that on one single album?  Rickie Lee Jones can. So much has been said about this already but I love to see that other's \\"get\\" the absolute grab and hold that \\"Last Chance Texaco\\" takes of your heart.  It reaches some place in my heart like no other song can.  The only other song in my collection that goes anywhere that close is Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\".   <br /> <br />It is really hard to pick a favorite, so I won't. But if I had the nerve to open my own bar, I'd call it \\"Danny's All Star Joint\\" and the bartenders would have to sing along with Rickie Lee every night for last call.   <br /> <br />Shameless Nostalgic Warning: I don't see much mention of \\"Young Blood\\" but that song was the inspiration for a multi media slide show project I did at the University of SC Media Arts department w/ my friend Carolyn Howe, around 1983.  It's the closest thing to a music video I ever got to help create and boy I wish I could see it today, 25 years later.  <br /> <br />I think this music is an essential for any music lover's collection, a must have.  I'd love for them to remaster this entire CD.  I have to admit however that even though the CD is not a remaster, it sounds pretty damn good in 2005.  Give it a listen!   <br /> <br />\\"Turn her over......and go!\\"
B0009NSE1K|5.0|So there I was, midnight, at the record store for the Clutch release party.  Well, there wasn't really a party, it was basically me asking the store to stay open so that I could buy the disc the minute it was released, but alas, I digress... <br /> <br />From track 1 all the way to the end of the disc you just can't help but think to yourself...wow, these guys are nothing if not pure musicians.  Complete, artful, original, driving, thought-provoking, and quite simply one of the best albums I've had the pleasure of hearing.   <br /> <br />Clutch continues to grow and in doing so, continues to please us with such incredible music.  Here's a toast to Clutch keeping up the hard work, the relentless touring and the production of amazing albums that leave us lesser humans to wallow in their glory.  THANKS GUYS!!
B0009A1AS2|2.0|With the same excitement I bought all my other Dream Theater albums, I bought this one and too my surprise, it was, well, half unbearable. No more jamming solos, interesting drum patterns etc. but predictable and sometimes corny(I walk beside you and The answer lies within). If I was told 'Never Enough' was the new song by MUSE, i wouldve believed it etc etc, the unpleasant surprises go on and on... 'These Walls' however, is why it got 2 stars and not 1. Brilliant song(If you forget that its Dream Theater playing it. 'Octavarium' is a nice long waste of 24minutes. Suppose it must be soooo hard to follow up on TRAIN OF ThOUGHT. IN SHORT:This is Dream Theater's ST.ANGER. YOU know what I mean... Next.
B000024D4R|5.0|A follow up of the brillant Wish You Were Here this album is about George Orwell's thoughts of the society stance.This is Pink Floyds last album with Rodger Waters that has great music in it too.Waters lyrics are great in this album better than most other progressive bands.The 1.25 songs Pigs on the Wing start the album with Waters singing a love song about his new wife. Dogs starts the epic part with acostic prerecorded guitar by Gilmour great lyrics to sing to,2nd verse is where the band picks-up with heavy bass and tight guiar licks.As the track sizzles up with some guitar soloing the band gets a diminishing effect with the word stone decaying more and more when repeated.Some new updated synth goes screeching in with Mason behind on drumming.The song builds up again turning into a massive ending with Waters adding \\"who\\" to every line of the song and ends with a punchy outro. Pigs is about the rich people,poor people and Mary Whitehouse,a censor person trying to keep smut off the T.V.The song is a dirty white funk cowbell driven piece with some nice piano by Wright. Sheep has got this bombastic feel with Waters screaming his lyrics to the people with a bible verse with some attached lines turning it into a butcher praise. We end with Pigs on the Wing same chord progerssion different words,same time too 1:25.Recommended Wish You Were Here or Brain Salad Surgery by ELP.
0446310786|5.0|So in the midst of reading some \\"previously missed classics\\" - The Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye amongst them - how nice to find one that genuinely deserves the title.  Beautifully told story, great characters, emotion, suspense, and lots of feeling.  Maybe tales off a little towards the end, but should definitely be required reading.  At least, that's what I think...
B0001HLVS2|5.0|\\"Master and Commander\\" is so much more than a Napoleonic-era swash-buckling romp on the \\"far side of the world\\". It is of course these things, but the subtle human dramas and richly-drawn characters give the film as much power and energy as the raging oceans it is played out on.     Perhaps the best story in this Peter Weir masterpiece is that between the ship's doctor, played wonderfully by Paul Bettany, and the formidable but equally human Captain Aubrey, of course played by Russell Crowe, who just oozes with honor, courage and nobility in this role.    Chasing the French \\"phantom ship\\", the Acheron, from Brazil to the Galapagos Islands becomes a side story to the relationship between the doctor and commander, who come to realize that, as men, they are not as different as they outwardly appear. Captain Aubrey's steadfast commitment to duty, order and discipline closely mirrors the doctor's passionate hold on science, discovery and his strong sense of morality and reason. The two occasionally butt heads, but over the course of the film the lines separating the two men become almost indistinct.     This is a film to watch again and again.

0312932081|4.0|I was blown away by how incredible this book is.  I expected some serious sci-fi starjet fighting sequences, various glowing planets, humans pulverizing various races of alien species, and so on.  I had no idea Orson Scott Card wrote a study on military strategy and psychology.<br /><br />The book made for a fascinating read.  I allowed some time to pass after completing it to let the story to sink in and grow in my mind.  I already miss that \\"I can't wait to get back to read it\\" feeling.<br /><br />Card's characters are ultra-realistic.  I sensed some origin in his style of writing that has spread through other writers, including Kim Stanley Robinson, perhaps paid as an homage to Ender's Game.  The book is an intruiging look at how the government could effectively create soldiers from their young age, when they are most influential (in both senses of the word: they can be influenced, they can influence others).<br /><br />Having read this, I can see where many others have literally ripped off a great idea.  To say more would be to destroy the plot.  Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is born into a strange future where the government controls birth rates.  He was \\"asked for\\" simply because his brother, Peter, and guardian angel-like sister, Valentine, were deemed unuseable by military standards.  So Ender is born, monitored, and then taken to be trained.  He will become an efficient and ruthless commander.  The voyage to this point is white-knuckling.<br /><br />This is a book to set aside and re-read in the future.  This edition has a wonderful introduction by Mr. Card who recommends  you don't read it at all!  (To his distaste, I read it twice.)

And there still showing more of there music videos on tv Boulevard of Broken dreams and holiday It's like every song on this album is a hit. Some girls in my school some girls say i look like the lead singer of greenday. at my school most of the time for the 8th grade graduation they play the song \\"time of your life\\"
B0002OERI0|4.0|I don't really care whether this band is \\"commercial\\" or \\"pop punk,\\" because the fact is, they're a good band. It's impressive - and slightly comforting - to see a CD so overtly political receive so much radio play and media attention. Unlike other punk bands, Green Day is accessible to not just those with a rarefied knowledge of music, but anyone familiar with radio, MTV, Vh1, etc. (I'm assuming that's most people). And I think that's a good thing, because, unlike so many popular groups nowadays, Green Day have a smart, valuable message: think for yourself and advocate for your rights and freedoms. I'm glad that \\"American Idiot\\" has experienced such great success, because Green Day is a talented, politically savvy band that churns out solid, catchy music with important implications.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Every CD is unique and uniquely Dream Theater. They are true to what it is they do. They have never changed with the popular musical trends. Each have highly creative and impactful solo albums in addition to their work in DT. Octavarium is a superb effort. If you are a Dream Theater fan it is a must have. As much as I hate to make comparisons with other bands....I hear influences from Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and Pink Floyd. All very talented musicians and near the top of my list. Don't wait..go get Octivarium now. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It's about time our music world was reintroduced to original genius... it's been rare in the past few decades that a new act comes along and blows your doors out... something more common in the days of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd... but alas, they have arrived... our modern day heros... The Mars Volta! This album (the second full-length project) is a masterpiece on any and every level. There is no need to go into detail about how this statement should be supported... if you do anything for yourself it would be to purchase this album and see for yourself... as the formentioned bands in this review... The Mars Volta are destined for greatness! <br /> <br />@@
B000000WF0|5.0|This is the kind of album you can become dangerously obsessive over.  I bought it when it first came out, and only listened to it about 15-20 times over the first seven years I owned it.  For some reason I pulled it out about two months ago, and it has been almost the only music I've listened to since.  The melodies echo throughout my head all day, to the point of distraction.  They are beautiful, and the orchestration is amazing, but there's also something hypnotic and trance-inducing about them - probably because of the echo effects and repetition of the riffs.  I actually think \\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" is one of the worst songs on the album (not to say that it's bad at all), because it never seems to get going, like it's incomplete.  \\"Space and Time,\\" \\"Lucky Man,\\" and \\"Velvet Morning\\" are just amazing.  Great lyrics too, just enough to give you a idea of what's happening, but vague enough that you can interpret them in any number of ways, depending on your mindset at the time.  Highly, highly recommended.
0975991477|5.0|M. Rock, the \\"Hookum\\" author, and others of their ilk have clearly not read the book, or they would be able to offer thoughtful critiques rather than bashing it with their prejudices. Give me an example of this competing research they claim, show the discrepancies between it and Lipton's research (he was into stem cell research before the current fuss about it - hence the bashing, no doubt) and I might be persuaded to listen to them. As such, I think their comments are a waste of space on the Web. It is beyond belief to think such opinionated folks could imagine any thinking person would be persuaded from buying this book on the basis of their trashing it.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I just bought this CD two weeks ago at Wal-Mart for 15$ and listened to the entire collection which took me some time but I can understand why many die hard Bruce Springsteen fans are disapointed because this does not include alot of great Bruce songs. But this essential series was not created for die hard fans, this only got die hard fans attention due to the fact their is a BONUS disc with all previously unreleased material. But you the first time listener will enjoy this Essential collection because........it is essential due to the fact it includes only the best of Bruces hits inlcuding Thunder Road, Badlands, Darkness On The Edge Of Town, The River, Altantic City, Born In The U.S.A., Glory Days, and millions more!!!!!!! I really enjoyed the first disc with some of Bruce first recordings such as Blinded By The Light, and For You these recordings really molded his career as a great song writer, and as a great back man, the back bone of the band. With his tele hung across his back, Bruce Springsteen created some of the most greatest material ever. Even the die hard fans who have probaley all of the material on disc one, and disc will buy this due to how great the bonus disc is. This entire collection spans recordings from 1972 up through 2002 WOW!!!!!!! This is one essential collection. Highly Recomended!!!!!
B00000IWVS|5.0|This is one of those CDs that, on first listen, I knew I'd be pulling off the shelf repeatedly over the years.  The playing on the B Minor Sonata is stirring.  Technically superb, of course, but that's a given.  The intangible is the emotional impact of the music which is considerable. <br /> <br />At times, the coloring is more impressionistic than romantic.  No matter, because the entire program is passionately and beautifully played.  (OK, the A Flat Polonaise may be a bit over the top).   <br /> <br />Music making of the highest order.
0156421178|5.0|Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists). The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.<br /><br />During the war in Spain, approximately 38,000 non-Spanish, anti-fascist volunteers from fifty-two countries, took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Twenty-eight hundred Americans, in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, fought here alongside their Spanish and international comrades-in-arms from 1937 through 1938. These men and women believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\" English novelist, essayist, and critic, George Orwell was one of them.<br /><br />Orwell was not just a writer, he was a partisan and he was a political idealist. A revolutionary Socialist, not a Communist, he was affiliated with the Independent Labor Party (I.L.P.). Orwell originally traveled to Spain in 1937 to observe and to write, but he almost immediately enlisted in the militia as a private. At that time there were several political parties in Loyalist Spain, and each party had its own militia units, soon to be absorbed into the People's Army. Because Orwell's letters of introduction were originally from the I.L.P., which had connections to the P.O.U.M. (Workers Party of Marxist Unification - a small group of anti-Stalinists), he joined a unit of that party. Most volunteers fought Fascism under one of the Communist or Socialist banners, in a coalition effort, with the intention of working through political and social differences when the war was won. Until that time, he believed that the anti-Fascists should work together in a united front.<br /><br />When Orwell arrived in Barcelona, the Anarchists were still virtually in control of Catalonia. It was the first time Orwell had ever been in a town where the working class \\"was in the saddle.\\" He clearly conveys the sense of excitement of seeing the city under de facto workers' control, and the intensity of the revolutionary spirit which coursed through the people. \\"Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Senor' or 'Don' or even 'Usted;' everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' and Thou,' and said 'Salud' instead of 'Buenos Dias.'\\" It seemed like all men were equal, and there was hope in the air. \\"All this was queer and moving. There was much in it I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it almost immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\"<br /><br />After the most elementary training, Orwell spent weeks of bitter cold and hardship on the Zaragoza front, but saw little action. He was briefly hospitalized with a festering hand wound, and then returned to action - and this time there was plenty of it. Orwell's description of the fighting and conditions at the front is extraordinarily vivid and chilling. He went on leave to meet his wife in Barcelona in April, and thus was in the thick of things for the P.O.U.M. uprising. The situation in Barcelona had changed drastically since those initial days when everyone appeared on equal footing. There were startling changes in the \\"social atmosphere.\\" Perhaps initially, everyone had worn overalls and shouted revolutionary slogans \\"as a way of saving their skins.\\" Now, smart hotels and restaurants were once again filled with the wealthy, while food prices had jumped enormously for the working-class. The poor experienced serious and recurrent shortages. The differences between the luxuries of the \\"haves\\" and the increasing poverty of the majority became obvious. On May 3 a struggle began between the syndicalist unions and the Catalonian police force. Orwell saw the issue as a clear one: \\"I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.\\" He spent three nights on the roof of a moving-picture house, watching over P.O.U.M. headquarters until troops came from Valencia, and the street fighting stopped.<br /><br />After ten days back at the front Orwell received a near lethal neck wound. By the time he left the hospital he had lost his voice and all movement in his right hand. Warned by friends that the P.O.U.M. had been suppressed, and many members jailed, Orwell escaped to France with his wife. He began to write \\"Homage To Catalonia\\" shortly thereafter. It is a most inspiring and eloquent account of his time fighting with the militia during the Spanish Civil War, not just from a soldiers perspective, but as an eye-witness to one of the most significant events of the 20th century. It first appeared in 1938, but was coldly received by the left-wing intelligentsia, who regarded Communists as heroes of the war. In Orwell's lifetime \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" sold only about fifty copies a year.<br /><br />Many became disillusioned with communism in Spain, but kept silent fearing to harm the Loyalist cause. Orwell's take on the Communist's/Stalin's political machinations, and the overriding priority of the USSR to strengthen Soviet foreign policy, may appear obvious today, but those who put their lives on the line in Spain were much more naive. \\"The whole of Comintern policy is now subordinated (excusably, considering the world situation) to the defense of the USSR.\\" History now documents the Communist betrayal as far more terrible than Orwell conceived. He became an enemy of Soviet style communism as a consequence of his experiences in Spain, and advocated the English brand of socialism. There is an excellent Introduction in this edition by Lionel Trilling which discusses, to some extent, the political wheeling and dealing that occurred on the Republican side: how the Communist Party allied itself with right wing socialists and liberals to crush the P.O.U.M., with the standard Party line that anyone to the left of them were Trotskyists and therefore \\"fascist traitors.\\"<br /><br />This is a masterpiece which brings history to life. For a truly intense portrait of the period, you can do what I did, which was to read Ernest Hemingway's \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" with \\"Homage To Catalonia,\\" back-to-back.

B00092ZMDY|4.0|My wife and I saw The Eagles 'Farewell Tour 1' live here in Melbourne. Definitely one of the best concerts I had ever seen. Barely surpassed by The Rolling Stones, then again, that's a bit like chalk and cheese. But we thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Looking forward to seeing the DVD to see if we were immortilised on screen
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Dave Grohl and company are back in business!    In Your Honor is an overall satisfying dual album offering one side of loud rock tracks and the other of softer ones.     The loud section features the first single Best Of You, a catchy tune which was the reason I became curious to purchase this album in the first place. Grohl screams and shouts through mostly all of the tracks here, reaching his peak in songs like the title track In Your Honor, No Way Back, DOA, The Deepest Blues Are Black, and Resolve, a song with hit single potential.    The 'not so loud' section features a mellowed out band and a softer pitched Grohl strumming and crooning through songs like Still, a song that sounds like Pink Floyd's \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\", but a very pleasant listen as well as What If I Do?, On The Mend, Miracle, Over And Out, a song that sounds like a good future single, and Cold Day In The Sun, a top notch song that sounds like it was taken straight out of a 70's rock band recording session. However, most of the other tracks are filler: Another Round, Friend Of A Friend, and the achingly intolerable Virginia Moon which doesn't fit the mood of the album as whole with its jazzy edge.     I can see that the Foo Fighters were trying to create their own White Album with this effort. Some tracks on both sides of In Your Honor do score well on the 'It rocks!' scale but others fall flat on their face, which leads me to say that In Your Honor is not an honor roll effort, but satisfying enough to buy.    Track picks:    In Your Honor  Best Of You  DOA  Resolve  Still  What If I Do?  Over And Out  Cold Day In The Sun    Recommended    B

B0000026WD|5.0|Thriller and Bad were back to back enormous hit albums that cemented Michael Jackson as the 80's undisputed king of pop. Both albums made his debut Off The Wall a thing of the past. Now, it's 1991 and Michael has entered a new decade. Dangerous was released by the end of the year and its first single Black Or White shot straight up to number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. The song caused controvery with its spectacular video featuring Michael transforming into a panther and causing havoc in a vacant street with nonstop dancing.     Keeping the controversy aside, Dangerous is a collection of above average songs. Remember The Time is a sweet R&B ballad, Why You Wanna Trip On Me is one of Michael's earliest and best responses to the media, the album opener Jam, a viciously outstanding foot stomper, Heal The World reveals Michael's interest in changing the world to a better place and is one of his finest moments, Who Is It for its strange but wonderful music and a very catchy chorus, Give In To Me with some cool solo guitar by Slash and a song that just kills, Will You Be There with its sweet lyrics and a song that blows up into epic proportions, Keep The Faith with its feel-good vibe, Gone Too Soon an ode to an AIDS stricken deceased young friend, and the title track, the uptempo Dangerous and an awesome way to close up the album.    Dangerous is Michael Jackson's last best effort. Since this 1991 multi-platinum selling album, Michael's albums declined in quality, falling in a trap of self repetition (attacks on the media), however, HIStory did have some golden moments as well, and Invincible just did not reach his old glory.

B00005JNJT|1.0|Batman Begins is another horrid chapter in the butchering of the Batman franchise, easily as bad as the worse outing in the series.<br /><br />The movie is promising in its first half as Bruce Wayne trains to become the Batman.  It has a gritty feel that makes one hopeful this Batman movie won't deteriorate into another flashy, empty spectacle.  But the minute Bale puts on the suit - its back to the old tired routine.<br /><br />What is the deal with the appalling Batman costumes, anyway? The big wigs at Warner must have no confidence audiences will accept the Batman character in his original incarnation; a vulnerable hero - half Sherlock Holmes - half the Shadow.  We have to have an explanation about why he can't be shot - and that's the point guys - he can get shot - and should once in a while.<br /><br />And this suit is by far the hokiest - can you imagine - fifteen years later and they can't figure out how to make him look cool?  Why bother making the movie if the hero looks like a bafoon?<br /><br />Fifteen years later, the suit still inhibits the movement of the actor so he has to rely heavily on gadgets to do what should be done by the actor.  And the directors have to resort to chaotic editing to get around the fact the guy can't move in the thing.<br /><br />Say what you will about the Sixties show, but that costume was amazing.  Maybe Adam West wasn't the most muscular guy, but he added all sorts of nuance to the character when he was in the suit, rather than the suit becoming the character.

B00005JNJV|2.0|There's a moment in this film where Bruce Wayne and Alfred go over the design to the batsuit's mask.  The mask itself is sort of a bloated, hydrocephalic affair, making Bruce's head seem twice as large as it really is.  Then there's the pointy bat-ears at the top.  What are they for?  One would assume that if you're going to go around calling yourself Batman, you'd want to resemble a bat.  Ah ha!  You'd be wrong, because those pointy ears are actually radio antennas.    It seems to be the trend in films today to strive towards a certain hyper-realism with characters and dialogue.  After two abysmal Joel Schumacher films with the Batman film series, the better part of the movie-watching world declared the series dead in the water, bloated by its own design excesses.  This film seeks to go entirely in the opposite direction as 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman&Robin.'  However, if those two movies go to the extreme of being overblown, horribly designed and poorly executed, this film 'Batman Begins' goes to the extreme of being overdone, dry and hollow, and poorly executed.    The plot should be simple enough to anyone who reads the title.  It is the story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.    But just a minute there... why should we be so obsessed with how Batman begins in the first place?  Batman says himself (quite incorrectly) \\"As a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.\\"  Pardon the theology, but with everlasting beings, isn't it not so important how they came to be as is the fact that they exist in our world?  I ignored this line completely.  Not only is it meaningless, but the idea that Batman is a symbol for justice and hope for victims of crime is a complete misinterpretation of what Batman stands for.    But hold on; who talks like this?  We've been here with George Lucas and his new Star Wars films.  I know of not one person who verbalizes the way these people do in 'Batman Begins.'  Why write dialogue that has no semblance of actual conversation inreal life?  You're going for a high-mimetic style, why not make your dialogue to fit in?  It's like they're reading out of some New Age, self-psychiatry manual.      The problem is that too much of this dialogue exists in the film; and even worse, a lot of it belongs to seminal actor Liam Neeson.  Why can't this poor man land a good role?  His job in this film is not only to be a martial-arts instructor (Liam Neeson?), but also as a kind of Zen Dr. Phil.  Basically, Bruce Wayne gets freebie therapy sessions while Neeson beats the crap out of him.  Makes sense to me, especially since Neeson's character Ducard is a commander of the League of Shadows, a vigilante martial-arts group that's been acting as population control for planet Earth since before God was born.  They plan on annihilating everyone in Gotham City because its just got too darn big.  By the way, the slums in this movie give slums a bad image.    After about an hour and a half of pop-psychobabble from Neeson and co., Batman makes his first arrival.  It's quite thrilling to see the Caped Crusader on-screen again, but that energy dies down rather quickly once things begin.  First of all, Christian Bale adopts this raspy, phone-sex offender voice with the mask on, which is corny at best.  His main villain is the Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy, who is about as menacing as moldy cheese.  The Batmobile is completely ridiculous to look at; like a cross between a Lamborghini and a Humvee.  Why they chose this look, I have no idea.  The batmobile in the original had such a unique style, and it was believable.  I would never believe that Batman would drive this thing.  What a stupid idea.    The last part of this film is all mindless explosion, chases, fire, loud-noises, and close-up fight scenes, which couldn't be less pleasing to the eye.  Also, I don't think I'm that old, but it was simply too loud to be enjoyable.  I found myself, for the first time in a movie theater, closing my ears because I couldn'ttake it.  I should not need to do that.    Batman himself is now something of an allegorical hero.  He claims he wants to be a symbol, and that his job as a symbol is to be this incorruptible image of justice in a world of corruption.  Sort of like a light in dark places.  Good vs. evil, that kind of stuff.  How boring is that?  Batman is a character who appeals to the outsider, the loner, the freak who gets shunned by society.  He's about vengeance and personal vendetta, not about the lofty ideals of incorruptibility.  Batman, by his nature, is a corrupted human.  He dresses up as a bat and fights crime with a sort of mob-justice doctrine.  Here in this film, he recruits Sgt. Gordon, and acts in concert with the police to a degree.  This is indicative of our litigious mindset in the 21st century, believe it or not.    What I find most ironic about this film is the fact that superheroes are part of a mythology, apparently, that fits in with our modern times.  Batman is a kind of Zeus, or Apollo, such as Spiderman and Superman are.  And yet this film, like the Spiderman films, seem to be concerned with making everything seem so ordinary and plain.  When you do that, you suck the life out of things.  The original Tim Burton 'Batman' was a success because it had a style, it had a particular energy in the script, and the performances were not overdone--merely spot-on acting from actors working with a director who had some kind of vision for what his characters should be.  It seems as though Chris Nolan has gotten some sort of bullet-proof vest on him for doing \\"Memento\\" which was half-interesting in its best moments.  This film shows that he should probably not be entrusted with the next film.  And that anyone who thought this was good filmmaking should not be allowed to see movies.

0790729652|5.0|This movie was made on the cusp on the '90s, and far before we made our way into the joyless husk of the 21st century.  Back then we were receptive to movies that had a particular style, and not a banal, quasi-realistic patina that passes for artistry these days.  Tim Burton was, and still is, one of the most recognizable stylists of our cinematic era.  Who can fail to recognize a Burtonesque film, with it's towering, grotesque structures that seem to have facial features like eyes and a distorted mouth?  He invented the dark movie, which used shadows and black spaces to provide a kind of gothic, dangerous and enthralling shot.  Unrestrained, Burton tends to go overboard and far beyond the medium he needs to strike to weave a good story.  However, with this first Batman movie, Burton was able to mold his gothic flavorings with subtlety.<br /><br />The film begins 'in media res' with Batman's career not quite in his prime.  The movie opens as a family makes their way through Gotham City's backalleys trying to find a route back after a show.  They are mugged.  As the muggers sit on top of the roof reviewing the take, Batman (Michael Keaton) drops down and reeks havoc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) is being set up by his boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) over a woman that they both are involved with.  He sends Napier to Axis Chemical, and tips off the police at the same time.  Batman gets word, and heads out to catch Napier.<br /><br />All the while Vicky Vale (Michelle Pfeiffer) is following Batman, snapping photos, getting involved with Batman's real identity Bruce Wayne, and screaming and getting in trouble.  The perfect heroine.<br /><br />The way this movie was done, with the dark, gritty, noir-esque settings of Batman and the 'lightness' of the dark comedy from Nicholson's Joker, gives the movie a vitality that all the others have lacked to a certain extent.  Also, unlike the other films, there's actually a point to the proceedings.  With the new film 'Batman Begins' the whole idea behind becoming Batman is wrapped up in an allegorical symbol that's both banal and uninteresting.  In the first 'Batman' here; being Batman is a route to vengeance, fueled by a rage boiling for years.  Batman is not an empty vessel to be filled up with ideals of justice and incorruptibility, but a flawed, corrupted mind seeking a path towards revenge.<br /><br />This makes Bruce Wayne clumsy, awkward; an outsider.  He throws parties that fills his house, yet he has no friends to speak of.  His relationship with Vale is hampered by the fact that he is Batman, and revealing it to her is a huge risk.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson turns in an unforgettable performance as the Joker.  He gives the role the life and free-form that is required.  If the Joker were too restrained, or too out of his mind, then the villian would be ruined.  As it is, the Joker is a characterisation of how genius often borders on insanity.  Nicholson walks the tightrope with ease.<br /><br />Keaton himself embodies the traits of Bruce Wayne.  He's a very quirky individual, both Wayne and Keaton.  Not that it matters in a role; but it adds to the flavor on screen.  A 'straight' man, someone in the realm of say George Clooney, or Christian Bale, aren't exactly what I'd call quirky.<br /><br />I'm not sure when they'll do another Batman, or if it will be any good.  The litmus test any Batman movie will have to face will be this one, because it is so good, so stylistic without being overdone, so enticingly dreary without being saccharine.  Most people say that this 'Batman' is \\"like, real, dude.\\"  Not so, it's a Tim Burton interpretation of Batman's character, and so far, this is the only interpretation that has been right.<br /><br />P.S.- And you can't review the movie without mentioning the Danny Elfman score.  Watching 'Batman Begins' I prayed for just a hint of that ascending theme from the first film.  It was not to be.  No themes, no real drive.  Just sortof swirling and aimless.  Elfman, more than any other conductor, knows how to compose a recognizable theme that fits in with his subject matter.  'Batman' is one of his finest works.real drive.  Just sort of swirling and aimless.  Elfman, more than any other conductor, knows how to compose a recognizable theme that fits in with his subject matter.

B000255LNE|2.0|It's been a long time since \\"Follow You, Follow Me,\\" the gorgeous song once sung by Phil Collins with such emotion and authority...before Disney got to him...before the financial service companies got to him. Now it is perfectly well possible, and horrendous when it happens, to be assaulted by one of many hopelessly sappy and terribly dumbed down versions of a Phil Collins song when visiting a variety of dollar stores, grocery stores or even mechanic shops in one day.<br /><br />What has become ubiquitous is not the Phil Collins of yesteryear - the one who challenged himself and performed music on the edge - but the new incarnation, corporate puppet version, who is churning out watered down goods. When you're not being hit with one of these powerless songs, you are probably being pushed further into soporific stupor by Bryan Adams or Mariah Carey.<br /><br />Let's re-visit one of Collins' peers: Peter Gabriel. Truly an artist who continues to push the artistic envelopes while also making money and working to help the world.<br /><br />Peter Collins has become vapid...the antithesis of what Genesis set out to do so many years ago.<br /><br />The masses seem happy with this, but I am not. So bring on the unhelpful votes; they cannot possibly hurt as much as the let down of this once-promising artist.

B000025XKM|5.0|Pink Moon, Nick Drake's final album before his unfortunate death, is a masterpiece. Recorded during midnight sessions on consecutive nights, Nick Drake sat in a studio with himself and producer Joe Boyd. The only thing that accompanies Drake's voice is the silent playing of his acoustic guitar (and piano on the title track, Pink Moon.) As Drake plunged deeper into depression, he expressed himself by recording the bleak Pink Moon, which stands today as one of the most underrated albums by one of the most underrated singer-songwirters in history. Recommended.

B000005Z0E|4.0|Lyrically spawned from the conciousness of Chuck D and the attitude of N.W.A., combined with a Black Panther upbringing and the rebellious charisma of James Dean he captured to perfection while potraying Bishop in the movie JUICE, 2Pac had all of the elements needed to blow up in the entertainment industry.  Influenced by such lyricists as Chuck D, Ice Cube and Scarface, 2Pac set out to expose the trappings of the inner city to the world in songs such as \\"Trapped\\" and \\"Soulja's Story\\".  \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" shines the brightest on 2PACALYPSE NOW and sets the formula for the inspirational singles on his next couple of albums as well as remaining one of the most heartfelt stories in hip hop history.  N.W.A.'s \\"F*** The Police\\" mentality also reigns heavy throughout the LP forshadowing future legal problems for 2Pac when life imitated the art that was inspired by life in the first place.  The production is  subpar at times, but 2Pac could make an acappella worth listening to.  This album is a good debut revealing a lot of potential for the young MC, but 2Pac would have much greater things to come.
B000005S31|2.0|This was Lou's first album after Metal Machine Music, itself following the severely anemic Sally Can't Dance.  Sally at least was half a great album, though Lou seemed to have been almost a non-participant in its creation.  After MMM, he went back and forth on Coney Island Baby, taunting Lester Bangs as to whether it was going to be more abrasive or a real Valentines Day present. (Love and romance eventually won out.) Listening to it after all these years, it hasn't really held up. She's My Best Friend is a great song, and was a lot of fun when the Velvets did it: a version you can now buy on the first VU \\"missing album\\" released in the early nineties.  Coney Island Baby is also good, but the version here can't compare to the truly great one on Take No Prisoners.  Lou still does Charlie's Girl in concert every now and again, but it was never a great song, seeming more like a throwaway from Sally Can't Dance (which offered enough throwaways on its own). You may want to buy this album just for A Gift, featuring the little omnisexual wonder (remember this is Reed in the seventies, and he'd just washed the peroxide out of his close-cropped hair) crooning \\"I'm just a gift to the women of this world.\\"  It plays more like an in-joke than an actual song, and it did then too.  Kicks is just self-indulgent, Reed trying to be shocking: he did this sort of thing more effectively on a few songs from Street Hassle.  Just about all these songs have been done better in live versions, which you should really track down. The ones that could be considered rarities are justifiably so. They were weak then and weaker now. Reed was to follow this album with another Sally-type record (which ranged from the sublime to the astoundingly ridiculous), the unfortunately titled \\"Rock and Roll Heart\\" before coming back strong with a real masterpiece The Bells.  It's tempting today to count Reed out, and anyone who's tried to struggle through The Raven or has swallowed the pompous meanderings of Set the Twilight Reeling knows that he isn't what he was.  But he never was.  The fact that Reed could come back with The Bells and Street Hassle after a string of albums like this one indicate he can do it if he wants to.  He just hasn't seemed to want to for a while.  Skip this one and buy a copy of Take No Prisoners instead--along with the essential Metal Machine Music, which today sounds fairly MOR compared to bands like Tool.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album is a great album to add to your collection.  I just bought and and every song on the album is great.  My favorite songs are \\"Live it Up\\" and \\"So High\\".  This album is a must have.  John Legend is a rare artist and hopefully he'll be around for awhile.
0312340958|5.0|Deep and honest, THOUGH THE NARROW GATE is the compelling story of a woman who made what might seem a strange choice at the age of 17 -- to enter a convent -- and how it changed her life and furthured/hindered(?) her spiritual journey.  Anyone who has longed to encounter the Divine will resonate with Ms. Armstrong's well-written narrative.  I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />Side note: I more recently came across the \\"sequel\\" (the second attempt): THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE.  It is also excellent, and even more mature.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I love Hans Zimmer, and I think that this collection really embraces the mood of the Batman movie. Very angsty. It is unlike Zimmer's recent releases; it is much darker, less empirical.  Excellent all around, as it tells a story in and of itself.
6305205620|5.0|BUY IT!!!!  Since i live in New Mexico, i rarely get the chance to see great shows so i resort to DVD's.  That said, this is probably the next best thing to a Metallica concert.  The set list was great.  Kirk did mess up his \\"One\\" solo but i think that we can overlook that.  Highly Recommended.  Favorite songs: All tracks.
B000005Z0G|4.0|STRICTLY 4 MY N.I.G.G.A.Z. is possibly 2Pac at his most focused.  Pac on a mission embedded in his head by his mother and former Black Panther Afeni Shakur.  He put blood, sweat and tears literally into trying to make a difference in the world.  \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" is one of the greatest songs 2Pac ever wrote encouraging black women to stay strong and men to respect them, an unusually uplifting topic back then and even today for that matter.  Fellow street poet/gangsta rap peer (and surely one of 2Pac's greater lyrical influences) Ice Cube makes an appearance on \\"Last Wordz\\" pairing two of the most controversial rappers ever together.  The raw production typical of early 90's Gangsta Rap only helps intensify the energy of this album.  By the end of the album 2Pac really only takes a break to clown around with the Underground on \\"I Get Around\\" which by being included on the same album as \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" shows his contradictions and the internal struggle of 2Pac that is familiar to so many of us.  Other than that he remains consistantly on a mission to change the world and make it a better place for the oppressed and at the very least be heard.
B000002MP2|5.0|For those who have become endlessly annoyed with Boulevard of Broken Dreams and American Idiot, it's hard for them to believe that the same band that wrote those songs could have released such a great record. This album was Green Day's third album and major-label debut, and what an album it was. This album includes such great songs as Having a Blast, Longview, Welcome to Paradise, Pulling Teeth, Basket Case (which in my opinion is one of the best songs of the 90's), She, and When I Come Around. In fact, the entire album is great. The last three tracks aren't as good as the others, but in each track you get Green Day's best, and some of the best music you'll ever listen to. This is one album that certainly deserved to be a hit.
B00009UW0N|5.0|First off, the reviewers that refer to this as a \\"splatter flick\\", obviously don't understand the lingo. A splatter film is Friday the 13th, Dawn of the Dead, Maniac, etc. There is only a very quick glimpse of blood, that is why this film delivers. It is built more on mood, lighting, suspense, and excellent camera work. Carpenter studied his Hitchcock films and proceded to make a exceptional horror film for $300,000. Not to mention the great Jamie Lee's screen debut. This film has been copied, duplicated so many times, but you can't top the original, EVER! Actually, quite good acting for young newcomers. Who would have thought that a Captain Kirk mask painted white would be so scary. Take that back, William Shatner is scary. The best scene, when Laurie(Jamie Lee) gets off the phone with Linda,(P.J. Soles) after being strangled, Laurie thinks it is a joke and procedes to go next door to investigate. Very errie and creepy, and what a build up. This dvd plays every Halloween night as a ritual in my home, a classic. The 5.1 is excellent, the score is pure genius, and the picture is beautiful. A must own. Sympathy to Debra Hill, the producer and co-writer, who passed away early this year, she will be missed. A bit of trivia for ya, the voice on the phone with Annie, her boyfriend, is actually the director, John Carpenter. Also the girl that played Judith Myers, was a playmate of the month in 1974. Wish I had that issue.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Hair metal/speed metal/punk rock at its finest!!!!  What other band could fit into those 3 genres?  No one is doing what they are doing, and if you don't recognize that, too bad for you.  Go back to Atreyu and As I Lay Dying and let the rest of us enjoy this.  It does bog down a bit towards the end, but those first 7 songs are way better than can be described in an Amazon review.   <br />
068987474X|5.0|This is a self-help book of a different kind - it is an enjoyable read from start to finish and from the first page you will find your attitude changing and your self esteem returning. The subtitle of this book should have read &quot;He's just not that good enough for you.&quot; Read this book and change your whole approach to men. You'll find the author's words will play in your head like a mantra. Never again feel like you have to take the nonsense that some men dish out. Didn't call when he said he would because he &quot;couldn't find your number?&quot; Unless you have proof he was sitting in the ER with an open head wound, delete him from your quick dial.

B00074CBMY|5.0|These days people my age (mid 50's) are hard pressed to find any worthwhile new recordings to purchase.  That is why I usually revert to buying anthologies.  Joe Cocker's new studio release \\"Heart and Soul\\" is just about the best new album I have heard come down the pike in quite some time.  To begin with, Joe Cocker is not some aging rocker whose skills have diminished and is just trying to hang on.  Rather, Joe Cocker is still a very viable artist who according to my ears has not lost it one bit.<br /><br />\\"Heart and Soul\\" offers the listener a dozen outstanding tracks including Joe's brand new single release \\"One\\" which was written by U2. Nice tune. Most of the rest of \\"Heart & Soul\\" features new arrangements of some very familiar hits sung in the inimitable Cocker style. I found Joe's treatment of the old Ben E. King classic \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" to be absolutely stunning.  I also was moved by his rendition of James Taylor's \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely\\" and by \\"Every Kind of People\\" a hit made famous by Robert Palmer in the late 1970's.  A very underrated song!  Joe Cocker also does a surprisingly fine job on Marvin Gaye's groundbreaking composition \\"What's Going On\\".  And I would be remiss if I failed to mention his terrific remake of the old Screamin' Jay Hawkins song \\"I Put A Spell On You\\".  Joe is one of only a handful of artists who could pull off that one off!<br /><br />So whether you are in the market for some brand new music or find this disc attractive simply for old times sake \\"Heart and Soul\\" is sure to tickle your fancy.  Unlike the embarrassing stuff Rod Stewart is churning out these days Joe Cocker has turned out an album he can really be proud of.  I am quite confident it is a disc that you will play again and again.  Highly recommended!!!
B000002NFM|5.0|An underachieving group before this release, The Prodigy seemed to be waiting for their breakthrough album, making a rise in the music scene following their debut and then Music For The Jilted Generation. They had always had a great skill for the genre, always pushing the sound to further limits than typical Electronica and Techno music. In the case with Fat Of The Land, they powerfully shifted their sound into a much more dangerous, powerful rap-techno style while also making it borderline commercial. The result is an exceptional piece of work, Liam Howlett shifting styles around, whether it's the heavy N.W.A.-ish beats of Diesel Power, or the sensational keyboard vibes of Climbatize.<br /><br />Opening with a controversial enrageful tendencies of Smack My Bitch Up, it becomes near obvious where The Prodigy are looking to take this project if you're familiar their earlier albums. Breathe has Maxim contributing incredibly vicious rhymes, compiled with a delicious mix of drums as a backing tool. Diesel Power is a rap powerhouse, and a great highlight to the album. Funky Shit is an impressive mix of sounds used very effectively. Serial Thrilla remains in the same vain as Diesel Power, a mish-mosh of explosive rapping and a rock-techno style beat. Mindfields is a drastic change compared to the first group of songs, a slower track filled with a wave of electronica vibes. Reaching Firestarter, it carries a the same viciousness as breathe with more convincing lyrics. Climbatize is a nice mix of keyboard use. A higher tuned last track, with a speedy mix of drums and rock like background melodies.<br /><br />Overall, this album represents a completely different style to the Techno genre, exploring with Howlett using a variety of new sounds, experimenting with great effectiveness to produce a top album of the 90's. A highly recommended album for those who are looking into a different wave of Electronica, fans of rap, and those who wish to expand their music listening boundaries.oundaries.

You do, however, need to be a fan of character development and plot. <br /> <br />This is a highly entertaining and addictive series that was unjustly and prematurely cancelled.  The series expertly blends Western and Sci-Fi genres into a believable futuristic drama.  There are no aliens and no photon torpedos.   <br /> <br />Humor, drama, comedy and horror are all blended to perfection in \\"Firefly\\".  The DVD is over a year old and currently #8 on Amazon's Top Sellers list.  This is probably due in large part that a movie based on this series, \\"Serenity\\" is releasing in September 05.

1573223085|4.0|I read this book basically in one sitting, although, as others have mentioned, I have a lot of assginments following up on the porfolio sections in the book. <br /> <br />  By persoanlizing the subject matter, Pink risks trivializing it. Indeed, one of my criticisms is that he perspective is entitrely too parochial; well-educated white males from East Coast suburbs could relate to this well (as I did), but what about people in fly-over country, for example? Likewise, Pink was being prescriptive only in terms of the US (or so it semed); he could have reached out for more global examples, I think. <br /> <br /> The book is certainly recommended as a good jumping off point for adults looking to expand their creative palette. Likewise I'm re-reading this along with ny 17-year-old son who's interested in design as a guide for what his future might hold; as such, this book is a very nice resoruce.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|People ask me what this albums like, and I say, well, its the Foo Fighters. Most people have given One By One and In Your Honor okay reviews because theyre always looking for the next 'Everlong' or 'My Hero'. This is a complete album, one all rock, and one all acoustic, there is not a bad song on any 5 of their cds, this one adds to the collection. The Foo Fighters are one of the most complete bands in the world and in history, they dont need to do anymore, their place has been set. Every song on here is a gem. For those of you looking for the next Everlong or My Hero, then listen to them.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|DREAM Theater are one of those rare bands that can release a completely different album from the last yet still sound like Dream Theater. <br /> <br />It's what we've come to expect from these guys in the past and Octavarium - Dream Theater's latest installment - continues that trend. <br /> <br />From the opening track \\"The Root of All Evil\\" to the 24 minute epic title track, the listener is taken on a sonic journey, never really knowing where they will end up. <br /> <br />Prog fans will find a lot here, and Dream Theater fans will love this latest offering. John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy - usually the dominant musicians in the compositions - take a backseat which gives more space for the keyboards and vocals to make a statement. <br /> <br />Before I bought the CD a review I read said Petrucci doesn't go all out on this album. I was immediately suspicious. But you don't really notice what's missing or what is there because this is an album in its own right. Yes it is less intense than Train of Thought but what were you expecting from a new DT album? The same old stuff? No way. <br /> <br />Only one song didn't do it for me like the others. I Walk beside You is the song that gets the most flak from what I've read and in the main most of it is justified. It does sound a little U2ish and while that's okay I expect more from DT. <br /> <br />Despite what I say about that song I don't skip it when I give the album a listen. DT don't write bad music but with so much great stuff the lesser songs stick their heads out. <br /> <br />Panic Attack, Never enough and Sacrificed Sons are more immediately recognisable as DT songs and metal fans will enjoy them more than the others. <br /> <br />Octavarium the song is very different from DT's usual stuff (what is their usual stuff?) but the Yes/Genesis/Pink Floyd comparisons are valid here.  <br /> <br />There is a bit of an  Images and Words feel to the album and I think it's mainly due to LaBrie's vocals. He has cut back on the harsh, grindy tone of the previous three albums and focused more on his natural range. The result is some scintillating vocals adding to an already polished album. <br /> <br />I've tried hard to pigeon hole this album but the best I can come up with is that it is a little of Scenes from a Memory, Six Degrees and Train of Thought. That really tells you nothing but you'll know the parts I'm talking about when you get to them.
B000002IGP|5.0|Let's get one thing straight here. Ratt may be considered hair metal by today's standards, but coming from that era, they were Metal! Period.  Back in 83-84, there was no such thing as Hair Metal or Hair Rock. Poison started that B.S. all on their own!!! I was a junior in High School when Out Of The Cellar came out and I was blown totally away. Of course, most of the credit goes to Warren, repspecively, but Robbin Crosby did his fair share of great solos 50/50 for this album and the follow up; Invasion Of Your Privacy. Robbin's leads weren't as En Vogue as Warrens, but they were very melodic with some flash and trash as well. I always hoped for a full blown Ratt reunion, but with Robbin gone (for those not aware, he passed away a few years ago; RIP my main  man...), it would be pointless. Besides, the other four can't even stand to look at each other much less play together....such a shame. <br />Okay, back to the record. From start to Finish, Ratt demonstrates some great catch hooks and grooves with great guitar riffs courtesy Robbin and Warren. Every song is great! Like I said, catchy from the first groove to the runoff groove at the end of Scene of the Crime. The other thing that worked so well for Ratt was the bottom groove laid down so heavy and tight by drummer Bobby Blotzer and bassist Juan Crocuier (spelling?). In fact, I will give them the credit for the intense groove that made them so famous. For those aware of the hits; Wanted Man, Back For More and Round and Round..oh...almost forgot...Lack Of Communication, the rest of the tracks on the album are of that excellent quality that only Ratt possesses. Nothing too fancy, just great hooks, melodic vocals and just plain good ol California sunshine fun. For an album that's 20 + years old, it still sounds pretty damn good too. Some albums, sound dated in terms of recording, but Out Of The Cellar still sounds as good as the first day I brought it home...I can only imagine how good it will sound when Atlantic finally remasters it with extra tracks. Too bad their legal battles prevent them from doing so.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand is one of the hottest bands out of the UK. They are from Glasgow, Scotland and they have taken the world by storm. I chose to this album because something new for most people into popular music of today, and it's one of my favorite albums. The songs on this album are very catchy and artistic. The opening track on the album \\"Jacqueline\\"), starts off acoustic and eventually builds into a rocker about living carefree.     The singles released include the smash \\"Take Me Out\\", which starts totally different than it ends, it has been compared to a rollercoaster. You don't know where it is exactly going but you love the ride. \\"Matinee\\" starts off slower building into a chorus which is nearly impossible to not sing a long with. \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" was another single released off the album. It's obviously a sexually charged piece. In the song Alex sings about wanting fantastic passion, the song eventually builds up to the end where the band chants \\"they call me super fantastic\\" in German. Like I said it's a sexual song so you can figure out for yourself what is happening at the end. \\"Michael\\" is a fast song made for and about the dancefloor. It's been called homoerotic; that's not a bad thing either. Finally we come to \\"This Fire\\". This song was remixed and released as a single late last year. It is about having a passion burning inside of you like fire. That's the best way to describe it.     Other songs on the album include catchy pop/rock songs like \\"Cheating on You\\" and \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" remind me of early Beatles songs. They are very catchy and danceable tracks. The song \\"Auf Achse\\" is a cold, dreary song about wanting love. It is one of the best on the album.The two ending tracks \\"Come on Home\\" and \\"40 Feet\\" are fine tracks to end a nearly perfect album. (4 1/2 Stars)
B000957O82|4.0|\\"Hitch\\" is a romantic comedy that has many enjoyable moments, some good laughs, and stops just short of being a chick flick.  Will Smith has a wonderful screen presence as Hitch (Alex Hitchens) who has a private consulting practice of helping feckless men pull things together enough to get a shot at the woman of their dreams.  Not in a predatory way, but because they are men who like women and have what passes today for honorable intentions.  However, because his practice is so confidential there are certain rumors that surface that ascribe all kinds of malevolent power to the \\"date doctor\\".<br /><br />Kevin James is terrific as Albert, one of Hitch's biggest challenges.  Albert is in love with a celebrity far out of his league, Allegra Cole (named after an allergy medicine?) played with humanity and worldly knowing by Amber Valleta.  After Hitch assesses the situation he realizes what a great guy Albert is and decides that getting Allegra to notice Albert would be his Sistine Chapel.<br /><br />Sara, played with energy and charm by Eva Mendes, who is a gossip columnist after stories about Allegra Cole.  She notices this ordinary guy with Allegra and wonders what is up.

B000683VI4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and have seen his other book's movies (A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle) and love both of them.  I didn't read the book prior to seeing the movie, as I did with the other two, so I went into this one not knowing what was going to happen or what it was really about.  This movie really kept me captivated - I love the way it was put together; I love period movies too and this one was enchanting to look at with the swing music and gorgeous shoes and outfits (1940's).  I agree, it is a sappy movie, but most romances are; my husband watched it with me though and didn't complain.  It's a really really sweet story that you have to pay attention to or you might miss something (at least for me anyways, I had to watch it a couple times).  I'm a big fan of James Garner and Rachel McAdams and I was glad to see James Marsden in it (my favorite hollywood hottie!) too as the beautiful rich boy character!  I would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes romantic love stories.
B000002KAT|5.0|My story with this album: ten years ago, when I was discovering a lot of music, I purchased this album. I liked it, and felt something beautiful and great, but also, as a young listener, was getting a bit bored and depressed with it, and ended to resell it. Ten years later, which was last year, I purchased it again, having heard a lot more of music between, and matured as well personally. I would include Tim Buckley's music, and Joni Mitchell's music among those that have grown on me since, whereas I didn't like it enough ten years ago. I evolved from pop and rock music to folk and country, actually, and from energy and youth to more complex, poetic worlds in music. I can say, with this example, that our taste in music can just evolve with the memory of it. Because Astral Weeks grew on me without even playing it. It grew in my memory. I knew I was liking it better before I buy it again. I needed to hear it again. That's when you enjoy it the most. While I was at it, I purchased the first nine Van Morrison albums as well, from \\"Blowin Your Mind\\" to \\"Veedon Fleece\\". After months of listens, I went to this general appreciation: his three best albums from 1967 to 1974 are \\"Astral Weeks\\", \\"It's Too Late To Stop Now\\" and \\"Veedon Fleece\\". However, I don't rank \\"Moondance\\" and \\"St Dominic's Preview\\" as high as some other fans. I think the live album (\\"It's Too Late...\\") is the ideal start with Van. After, his celtic & soul side is my favourite over his rhythm'n'blues one by a wide marge. For rhythm'n'blues, I keep preferring Otis Redding, stuff like that. But \\"Astral Weeks\\" and \\"Veedon Fleece\\" make Van's uniqueness. \\"Astral Weeks\\" is Van's first masterpiece, and remains his most sublime work. I don't know anything else like this. I agree with the critics on that one. The thing is that this record is not just a record. It's too lively, physical, ethereal, experimental, raw, and as a performer Van is at his peak. Absolutely extraordinary. To give you an idea of what I mean: on \\"Moondance\\" you have a beautiful song called \\"And It Stoned Me\\". This song tells an experience ( a strong sensation of natural plenitude, a revelation). But it just tells it. \\"Astral Weeks\\" IS that experience. Van doesn't just tell it, he LIVES it. He gives and SHARES it physically with the listener. I guess I wasn't ready for that, ten years ago. Now that I've listened to thousand other records, I measure \\"Astral Weeks\\"'s absolute greatness.
B0007O38F8|1.0|(BTW, this is Pete \\"Snake\\"'s alternate account) <br />J.C. thank you very much for knocking sense into that idiot liveon14887. Did you even read THE ENTIRE review? Soulfly and...SLIPKNOT talkin about killing? That's just as bad as me saying ALL rap is like 50 Cent. Sure Soulfly does have songs about killing, but the song I'm referring to, \\"Bleed\\", is about getting revenge on someone who killed one of your family members. DM is NOT trash. When I read that part of the review, I laughed for about an hour. I don't EXCLUSIVELY lsiten to DM. My favorite band is Dream Theater, a prog-metal band. They write songs about fantasy related stuff, alchoholism, love, religion, etc., etc., etc. Also, you need to get your head out of YOUR ass, and look up the lyrics of a band called Napalm Death. They're a highly political band. Look up the songs The Code Is Red...Long Live The Code, The Silence is Deafening, C.S., and pretty much any song from Scum or The Code Is Red...Long Live The Code. Also look up lyrics by In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, later albums by Death (now that's what I call musical progression), and At The Gates. And if those don't convince you, look up Nile. They write about egyptian gods. As for Slipknot, I don't even like Slipknot but...look up the song Circle, 'nuff said. Soulfly is tribal metal and Slipknot is nu-metal. Also, I'm 14, so I don't get drunk or stoned. I don't just go to random rap albums and strut on and on and on and on about my superiority, it's just an opinion of mine. I USED to think all rap sucked, buy a reviewer called DukeofEarl set me on the right path (thank you DOE). I DO NOT think all life is about killing and suicide, I'm actually more of an optomistic person. Go look up reviewer called \\"Chris Burton\\" and read his guide on what he thinks of people who critisize death metal. I'm seriously wasting my time here. Thank you J.C. <br /> <br />As for this idiot, instead of this P.O.S., go buy \\"Train Of Thought\\" by Dream Theater.
B0000009SY|5.0|Joe's Garage is a masterpiece. It's as simple as that. While Frank Zappa's material is generally very high end and normally very musically appreciative, Frank Zappa also has an incredible sense of humor, and an even better sense of creativity. <br /> <br />Joe's Garage is split into 3 acts. Listening through all three acts, one might forget where the album started! Joe's Garage progresses from a kid named Joe jamming in his garage, to homosexual robots and machine fetishes, to finally his capture, punishment, and more-than-likely death. Yeah, songs are in German, some songs don't have words at all, and some songs have robots singing in them. Frank Zappa was a really, REALLY weird guy. <br /> <br />In Mr. Zappa's band, we have a fabulous lineup of musicians. It isn't just Frank's wonderful guitar work that stands out - the drumming and bass are also incredibly good. The keyboard also is a very nice \\"filler\\", especially in track 2 of Act 2. In addition to the musicians, the humor is up there in high numbers too. You will hear much satire to do with the censorship of music, and a lot of funny one-liners and very unexpected, sensitive lyrics. Oh yeah, if you're a kid, don't listen to this album. It contains a LOT of highly sexual and adult-rated humor. How Zappa was able to get away with this 20 years ago is beyond me - but I believe that was part of the point of the creation of this album. <br /> <br />Overall, this record is a fantastic place to start with Zappa. It will give you an introduction to all of his main strong points - his musicianship, his composing and writing skills, and his humor. It was my first record from him as well, and I really don't think that I could have done much better in regards to a first pick. <br /> <br />If you are even viewing this page on Amazon.com, you already have a little bit of knowledge in your head - therefore, if you're reading this, I recommend it to you! <br /> <br />Enjoy the music. <br />-Andrew

B00005A3KS|5.0|Growing up in the streets of Detroit, Michigan, I can totally relate to this action packed movie that deals with surfing and robbing banks.  I have been surfing the waves of Lake Superior, Lake St. Clair, and The Detroit River my whole life and am yet to see as realistic of surfing scenes as those portrayed in the film Point Break.  This may be the best cast ever assembled on the movie screen featuring Patrick Swayze (Bodhizapta) and my personal favorite/hero Keanu Reeves (Special Agent Johnny Utah).  This is Reeves at his best, blowing away his performance in the Matrix and Sweet November.  The story takes place on the beaches of Southern California where a group of surfers have been ripping off banks dressed as the \\"Ex-Presidents\\" in order to fund their \\"Endless Summer.\\"  Special Agent John Utah, freshly out of the Academy, hooks up with Special Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) to identify the ex-presidents and end the serial bank robberies taking place before the criminals take refuge out of the country searching for the ultimate ride.  So you may ask, \\"what's the biggest?\\"  The answer is simple, \\"Bell's Beach Australia.\\"  You see there is a fifty years storm that starts swelling up in the artic regions and makes its way to Bell's Beach, Australia.  Just remember one thing \\"If you want the ultimate, you have to be willing to pay the ultimate price.  It is not tragic to die doing something you love.\\"  Surf's up dudes.
B00097DX3U|3.0|Almost EVERY song Tom breaks into his solo of noise making, it's almost like someone from the record company said, alright Like A Stone worked so well, let's make EVERY song sound exactly like it, start out mellow, chorus, build up, chorus, ANNOYING NOISE, MORE ANNOYING NOISE, IS IT ANNOYING YET, back to chorus. They didn't do this with the first record, why this one? I like the first record, all the way through. 04-Doesn't remind me of anything Out of Exile reminds me of like a stone and every song on this disc. The task now, since computers allow us to do the things we can do nowadays, I will take this into Adobe Audition and cut Tom's solos out, then enjoy the album the way it should have been.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Having pulled out of their jazzy era, consisting of their first two LPs, Yes started creating fully original music on their \\"The Yes Album\\". No more cover songs. \\"Fragile\\" was the follow up to this album, and possibly their best LP that they ever made. <br /> <br />Fragile is more prog, and less artsy, than The Yes Album. Roundabout is an eight minute song, with strange lyrics and a fantastic latin-inspired guitar introduction. Each member has very quick solo tracks, as well, which is nice. Though they could have expanded on this feature, the vinyl record may not have allowed them the timeframe which they would have desired. Long Distance Runaround, South Side of the Sky, and We Have Heaven, are all brilliant tracks from this record. <br /> <br />The drumming and percussion, I foumd, were far improved in this record from their last. Lots of great use of the tamborines and exotic drums make the songs unique. The bass stood out even more than it did before, and the keyboards were more musical this time than just a \\"filler\\", sort of like how The Yes Album portrayed them. While nothing could prepare us for Close to the Edge, Fragile was the beginning of the peak of Yes' career. Close to the Edge could be considered the beginning of the end - as it went on to allow Yes to produce other very self-indulgent records that were indeed very musically impressive, but only really apealing to fans like myself. <br /> <br />If you had to get one record from Yes, this is the one. As I mentioned, it was the golden age of progressive rock, and the golden age of Yes' career. If you are a fan of rock music and want to discover the roots of today's more complex styles, give this album a listen. If you want to hear some FANTASTIC jazz and classical integration with rock music, with poetic lyrics, this is certainly an album to discover. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Enjoy the music! <br />-Andrew

1400031087|5.0|I find that I am now addicted to James Frey's articulations of his struggles to put the Million Little Pieces of his addicted, broken life back together. I now find myself \\"buying and selling\\" his work to anyone who listens to a few excerpts and gets hooked themselves.  If anyone has a relationship with an addict and has ever wondered, \\"What, in the hell is he thinking?\\" this book may bring you to tears with some insightful clues.   I kept having to look at Jame's smiling face on the back cover to convince myself he actually lived through the ordeals I was reading about throughout the book. I am grateful he took responsibility for himself and recorded the inspiring results. <br /> <br />
B0000009SF|5.0|Back in the time which \\"The Grand Wazoo\\" was released, Miles Davis' masterpiece \\"Bitches Brew\\" was already a few years old. Davis essentially created a whole new genre which fused jazz and rock music together. It combined the complexity and soul of jazz music, and the attitude and energy of rock music, to give birth to a new hybrid: Fusion. <br /> <br />Fusion music was still a pretty young concept when Frank Zappa relased this ground-breaking title. Similar bands such as The Mahavishnu Orchestra were selling out concerts to a wide variety of fans and gaining popularity. Though no Zappa fans had heard anything like The Grand Wazoo before. The two previous similar albums, Hot Rats, and Waka/Jawaka, were nice - but The Grand Wazoo was a totally different experience. <br /> <br />Combining the tallents of the likes of George Duke and Ansely Dunbar, and numerous other musicians to make an enormous jazz orchestra, Mr. Zappa composed many professional and creative pieces to tell the story of a strange man (who I assume goes by the name of Arwetus). The LP consists of very few lines of lyrics - maybe only five or so. The album is almost completely instrumental, and full of soul and funk it is! <br /> <br />In my opinion, the selling track here is the self-titled song of the album. \\"The Grand Wazoo\\" is a 13-minute construction in which every band members' tallent is used superbly. The trumpet, guitar, bass, and drums in specific sounded fantastic. The other brass instrumentals, and the woodwinds as well, all were a very fitting and complementary addition to this song. The result is a hugely-improvised, energetic, and unique work of art. Zappa fans were simply amazed. It took more than just tallent to make a creation like this - it took Frank Zappa. Of course, this isn't just fusion. It is Frank Zappa's Fusion. It is a whole new sound, which to this day still hasn't been rivaled. <br /> <br />Though it will sound like a few other notable Frank Zappa records, and though it will sound like a few other bands from the late sixties and early seventies, this is an album which all fans must experience. Whether you are a Zappa fan, a Jazz fan, a rock fan, or just a plain open-minded individual, this album is for you. It is weird, eerie, and strange, but it is also impressive, virtuous, and unique. If you already have Zappa's more accessible music such as Sheik Yerbouti and some of his Mothers of Invention work, this album is a must have. For all jazz fans looking to get energized and woken up, this is also another must-have album. If you are an appreciator of any work from Miles Davis, Billy Cobham, John McClaughin, or Tony Williams, this is an album to get. <br /> <br />Who do I not recommend this album to? I suppose people with a closed mind, people that can't stay focused on a song longer than four minutes, and rap afficiandos. <br /> <br />However, if you're looking for an adventure, this album will do it. It is one of my favorite instrumental albums for a very good reason - it is one of the most unique listening experiences that you will ever have. Enjoy the music! <br />-Andrew
B00028HBKC|1.0|What's up with the Jesus visuals???  Were not suppose to make any image of God.  Why do non-Christians understand this and most Evangelicals dont????
B0007YMUZW|4.0|First off, this album is great.  All the songs have a folky, but rocky characteristic.  There is less of the mopey 80's sound from his last albums (sans Rock N' Roll).  The Cardinals, and Ryan himself, sound a lot like American Beauty/Workingman's Dead era Grateful Dead on Cold Roses.  The Dead references are almost too much - Magnolia Mountain? Cold Roses?  However, he pulls it off.  This isn't some hippie-dippie two chord noodly stuff, but good folky songwriting, just like the two albums I mentioned by The Dead.  Everyone knows Ryan Adams is a brat - I once heard he kicked a guy out of his show for requesting Summer of 69' :) - but, you can't help to like him with material like this.  I would rank his songwriting up there with Springsteen now, no joke.
B000000LZV|5.0|All I can say about the Minutemen's 43 song epic is wow.  Wow, this is one of the greatest albums ever made.  Wow, these guys could play circles around other bands of the era like the Dead Kennedy's and Black Flag.  I like both those bands, but this is on a whole different level.   <br /> <br />The music itself is a kind of jazzy funk mix with lyrics and structure that aren't like any other pop music your likely to hear.  The songs are brief, most clocking in at under 2 minutes, and don't feature conventional bridges or choruses.  So if you try to pigeon hole them into the hardcore punk category that critics and listeners try to group them in, then you'll be sadly disapointed.  What they have most in common with the punks of the time are the conscious lyrics and the length of the songs.  If I could compare it to anything, it would be Pink Flag by Wire, with it's precise and energetic sound that zips by at breakneck pace.  Where Wire is thrashy on that album, the Minutemen are smooth and laid back, but not all the time.   <br /> <br />It is impossible to describe this album to someone who hasn't heard it.  Their are slow groovy songs, fast energetic songs, songs about politics, songs about drinking, songs about girls, and songs about metaphysical things that don't really make sense. But all the songs are great.  43 songs and 75 minutes of music make Double Nickels on the Dime a must own for anyone who like alterantive music.  It may be a little daunting for a first time Minutemen listener, but this is the place to start.  Highly recommended.
B0002O06N0|5.0|the only way to describe this album is by saying that it is remarkable in every way an album can be. It ranges from mellow to kinetic, from simple to complex and from gritty to even more gritty. Rubber factory is RAW, fun and is delivered with unbelievable skill. The Black Keys are the best American music act since Bruce Springsteen and will surely get the notoriety they deserve. Every single person that i have played this album for has loved it. You must buy this album now.
B000929AJQ|1.0|One and a half star <br />After a five and a half year wait, I was expecting riots in the streets if Nine Inch Nails' long(LONG) awaited followup to \\"The Fragile\\" didn't live up to even the most rudimetary expectations. But the release date came and went, and lo and behold no riots. But I'm still waiting. <br />I tried every conceivable way to like this record on pretty much any level that a record could be enjoyed. I lowered my expectaions to a level so far down that it would need to be pretty bad to dissapoint me. But sadly \\"With Teeth\\", in my eyes, is a very dissapointing record. <br />What went wrong? Everything that Nine Inch Nails and it's de facto leader used to do so well---dense, layered tracks that can go from brutally aggressive to open calm in a heartbeat, melodic but deceptive songs, occasionally interesting lyrics--- are gone, replaced by a sound that even Marilyn Manson would consider passe. <br />The production on \\"With Teeth\\" is a low for Reznor, who along with producer/ mixer Alan Moulder, usually puts together a pretty impressive package. Here however the songs sound cluttered and busy. Far to often on the record Reznor appears passive about the overall sound quality. Many of the songs don't sound mixed, but rather as if Reznor had merely turned all the levels on every track to the same number and left it at that. <br />Songwritting wise this has to be the laziest group of songs that Reznor has ever put out. For the most part it's a \\"Downward Spiral\\" redux, with occasional parts from \\"Broken\\" or \\"The Fragile\\" thrown in for good measure. <br />\\"Don't You Know What You Are?\\" is as aggressive a track NIN has put out, but instead of feeling cathartic it feels tired and obvious. The title track \\"With Teeth\\" tries to be menacing but instead it kind of funny, ecspeccially when Reznor sings the chorus comes in and Reznor muses \\"Awitha teetha\\". \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is just a bad mash of overly distorted instruments creeping into a My Bloody Valentine-esque chorus, and the two records first two singles, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\"(a fairly silly politcal song, let's all admit it) and the Gary Numen-esque \\"Only\\", sound more like the current new wave revivalist a la The Killers and the Bravery then Nine Inch Nails. <br />But the most unforgivable aspect of the records have to be the cringe worthy lyrics that make up the bulk of the record. Once again Reznor sounds as if he weren't picked for kickball in P.E. and man is he mad, but here he resides to cliches and underdevolped ideas to get his point across. The lyrics, pretty much as a whole, sound like the type of stuff that your average seventh grader would turn in for his English class poetry assignment and still make a C. At the ripe old age of forty, I think it's about time Reznor begins to look to something else for lyrically inspiration. <br />Two decent tracks pop up though. \\"All the Love in the World\\" will sound vaguely familiar to anyone who has given Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" a listen, but even though the lyrics are still pretty weak, the overall vibe and mood of the song hits the right chords. And the excellent \\"Everyday Is Exactly the Same\\" would fit on pretty much any other NIN record well, with the records best production, lyrics and songwritting, and one Reznor's best choruses yet. Hopefully it will be the records third single so I can pick that up. <br />I want to like \\"With Teeth\\" desperatly, but I just can't. It doesn't hit me at all and after a few listens I gladly traded it in for my five dollars credit, three dollars cash at the local used record shop. It is without a doubt the weakest non-remix record of NIN's career, and left with me with only one question: <br />\\"It took alomst six years to make THIS?\\"
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|With Shania's Greatest Hits. Shania comes full circle in her career.  There are songs from every album to date, with the exception of her self-titled, 1993 album, which is suprising because \\"What Make You Say That\\", was a big video hit.  There are classics from \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\",  \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" and \\"You're Still The One\\",(from \\"Come On Over\\"), to \\"Any Man Of Mine\\", \\"I'm Outta Here\\" and \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots\\"(\\"from The Woman In Me\\") and \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good\\" and \\"Forever And For Always\\"(from \\"Up!\\"), that there is enough to go around for everyone.  Plus the three new songs.  I still can not get enough of \\"Party For Two\\"(with Billy Currington),  \\"Don't\\" was really to slow for me to catch on to, but it is a good song, then there is \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\", a song so catchy, and peppy, it's so easy to sing along to.  It's only fitting that we get a greatest hits album from Shania, but she still has much more to give us.  I have in the past doubted Shania, but the album proves that you should not.  This album gets a lot of spins, I only hope that after \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\", that she isn't gone too long, because that will kill me. A+++++++ <br /> <br />\\"Don't\\"  B- <br />\\"Party For Two\\"(Billy Currington) A+++++ <br />\\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" A++++++++

B000002WPI|4.0|When I first heard this album I was turned off for a bit. The more I heard it, when my older brother played it non stop, it grew on me. All the songs are catchy and demonstrated how great each artist was at their prime. Currently as solo artists , they lost their touch, as a collective unit back in the day, they were an unstoppable hip-hopping machine. This album was, and to this day still is, my best friend and my favorite album to look back upon. Wu-Tang Forever is a nice supplement.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|And a show that is in my Top 5 of all time.  Firefly was a thoroughly refreshing and original show that dared to defy the conventions of the genres that composed it.  Namely Sci-fi and the Western.  One departure from the norm--space dramas do not have to include aliens!  This show is about familiar human problems--and responses to those problems--when placed in an extraordinary and fantastic setting.  The characters are incredibly three dimensional (and this includes a wide variety of wonderful character flaws) with sharp dialog and acting that makes the viewer forget that they are watching a work of fiction.   <br /> <br />Yes, the Special Effects are exceptional.  Yes, there is an abundance of humor and action.  Yes, there are high-speed spaceship chases!  These facts are really just a BONUS to a well-written and character-driven show.   <br /> <br />    Firefly premeired in 2002 on the FOX Network.  FOX, being a major network that demanded immediate and equally major ratings, pulled the plug on this show prematurely when the ratings weren't up to expectations (of course, this is due in part to it's doomed friday night time-slot and FOX's decision to show the episodes out of order, but I digress).   <br /> <br />    This show's cancellation is not a testament to the quality of the show.  The DVD sales upon its release were impressive enough for Universal Studios to greenlight the feature film \\"Serenity\\" based upon the series.  There have been three separate advanced screenings so far across the country that sold out immediately.  The release is September 30th.   <br /> <br />    As of this writing, the DVD set of this \\"failed\\" Television show is #4 on the Amazon.com Top Sellers DVD list.  The Serenity movie official fansite (browncoats.serenitymovie.com) has close to 40,000 members and the number is growing every day.  All this is mainly through word of mouth.  Now that is a testament to quality.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I don't know why moderators or webmasters don't delete the Kids Review that was posted 70 thousand times, as it is unfairly lowers the score of the well thought out reviews that people have been posting about Kanye's debut album as a rapper. He breathes life into the crap rap that plagues the mainstream today. After coming out with the beats for Jay-Z and the likes that made my head bob in appreciation, he steps to the mic with an interesting way of flowing, using a near death car accident as his inspiration for this album entitled College Dropout, which smugly features him dressed as a bear; sports mascot sitting at bleachers. I do agree with one review that said that the skits do interrupt the flow of the album.

1400032717|5.0|This book was amazingly and astonishingly good, with a writing style like I've never seen before, well-plotted, capturing, and educational, too. I'd have to say this is one of the greatest novels I've ever read in my life. I'm a very slow reader. For a book this size, I thought it would take me about 2 weeks to read it and then I wouldn't understand it. However, it took me only 4 days (which is a record for me) because it was so good and easy to understand, and I'm not confused about a thing. I recommend it to all.
B000002KEV|5.0|Made in Japan was and remains the ultimate 'definition' of what a live rock album should be: no overdubs, spontaneity, loads of improvisation, rawness, great dynamics and superb musicianship..and on top of all, it was excellently recorded (even to the surprise of Martin Birch, the album's live engineer - who was initially appalled when offered by their Japanese counterparts a cheap looking japanese-made 8-track recording machine.)   <br /> <br />What came as a surprise after I heard Machine Head (which i owned after Made in Japan) was how pale the versions were in comparison to this monstrous live offering. Made in Japan no doubt contained ultimate versions of Machine Head material (Highway Star, Smoke on the Water & Lazy). <br /> <br />The ultimate edition of Made in Japan, however, is the 3-CD 25th anniversary edition which is harder to find these days - which contains complete sets of the Japan tour plus the encores.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't have too much to add to the more than a thousand wildly and accuratly positive reviews of this remarkable achievement called Firefly, but will try anyway! <br /> <br />Every single one of these episodes is brilliant as a standalone story.  Unlike, say, Season 4 of Joss Whedon's \\"Angel\\", a viewer can watch \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\", \\"The Message\\", \\"The Train Job\\", \\"War Stories\\", \\"Out of Gas\\", and all the others and have a richly beautiful TV viewing experience.  However, stitch them together in proper sequence (as FOX did not, damn their eyes) and you're in for the ride of a lifetime. <br /> <br />Which comes to a thudding halt after the superb \\"Objects in Space.\\"  Like the proverbial vaudeville comedians, Joss Whedon left viewers thirsting for more.  Thankfully, and in large part due to the remarkable sales of this beautifully done DVD set, there is more, in the form of a major movie, \\"Serenity\\", to be released in September.  (I've been to two pre-screenings of it and can attest to its own brilliance, by the way.)  The movie is not enough: I want more TV episodes!  I realize it's unlikely that this will happen, but I can dream, can't I?  Firefly should never have died in the first place. <br /> <br />Every character in Firefly is richly drawn and beautifully acted.  Each has interaction with all the other eight (and doing this believably in an ensemble cast is no mean feat) that enriches the already fascinating stories.  Yes, some of them are instantly familiar as western tales retold, but there's a lot of fun in seeing the captain of Serenity crossing a river disguised as a frontier bride...and the hooker with a heart of gold gets an entire new twist...and the Robin Hood legend gets its own brand new treatment...and on and on and on. <br /> <br />The writing is crisp, crackling, and very, very often laugh out loud hysterical.  When truly serious and scary stuff happens, as it often does, the viewer is totally drawn in and captivated.  The sense of honor and loyalty, among thieves, remember, is completely credible, if sometimes bewildering.  And the use of various storytelling techniques (dramatic juxtaposition, flashbacks, etc.) is entirely masterful. <br /> <br />In short, if you simply like excellence in your TV viewing, I can think of nothing better than Firefly.  I have bought at least a dozen copies of this DVD set to lend and/or give to friends whom I believed would enjoy and cherish as much as I do, and nobody's disappointed me yet.  In fact, they have bought more copies to give to *their* family and friends.  It's really that good.
B000286RZM|3.0|several songs here live up to his previous work (before the 6 in a year series of which I've only heard this one). The others seem to meander too much...poetic/introspective lyrics with music that doens't really peak anywhere (nothing to look foward to). Not that any track is really boring, I can listen to the whole thing through. But the standouts are way better/different than the others, see 1, 3, 9, 10, 11. Knowing what I know now, I would have still bought this album, its just a lot different than earlier Frusciante work and takes some getting use to (more so than Shadows or To record..)
B0001XAPX8|3.0|Anthony Hopkins plays a man that is forced to deal with his past, and realize that no matter how much he wanted to hide it, he had to accept it, and move on! Enter Nicole Kidman, a 30-something year old woman, who herself has to deal with her past, a past that is riddled with pain and suffering. The world that these people live in is very separate, but in the course of the film, they suddenly collide.  <br />Overall, the film was prety good, but in my opinion, the content was a bit over the top in vulgarity.  Some of it was very unecessary...and very unwanted...yes it was rated R, but it has been a long time since I have heard the \\"f\\" word spoken more than ten times in a row within a 2 minute span...utterly embrassing in my book.  <br />All actors involved in this project did a great job with the material.  Very dark drama indeed.
B000053GTF|5.0|It is safe to say from the fans and from the music critics that Celine Dion has easily become a legendary artist of the 1990's.With the help of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", Celine secured her spot as one of the best musical talents of the 90s era.This DVD covers the singer's best released and most memorable material and it also features videos perhaps never aired in the USA such as \\"I Want You To Need Me\\",\\"If Walls Could Talk\\",\\"Then You Look At Me\\"...all new songs from the Greatest Hits package.Several live clips are included such as her performances of \\"To Love You More\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".Minor draw back that the video to \\"Because You Loved Me\\" isn't on here but rather the live version clip is.Its a good 5stars DVD where almost everything is included but i also would have liked the video to \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" included but that didn't happen.So overall,highly recommended to all you interested in Celine.
B00003CXCT|2.0|today I went to visit Morty in the home. I took him this collection of Star Wars as I remember he likes captain kirk. We have to watch a movie during his prescribed one hour sitz bath. I am so glad I brought this movie for Morty to watch. It made Morty a little frisky to see that princess gal, he wanted to get into my groceries, hee hee hee...
B00005JNJT|4.0|This is a truly all new Batman that I have never seen before. I am a big fan of the other four films, but this one truly stands out as a new chain of Batman films. I can see filmmakers making sequels to this movie and starting a 2nd series of Batman films. <br /> <br />What really got me in this movie was the Bruce Wayne is how he transformed into the Dark Knight. I've always been interested in how he came about his \\"powers\\" and this really changed my perspective on Batman, even though it's not related to the other films. <br /> <br />Nobody can play Alfred the Butler like Michael Caine. He has the perfect look and an even more perfect voice. I was surprised at the A-list cast of stars this film has. Sure, the other four films have several huge stars, but this one's has truly great actors and not just famouse ones. I would've liked to see a little more of Morgan Freeman since he is great in everything he does. I was especially surprised w/Murphy's portrayl as the Scarecrow. Although, I would've liked to see more of him, he really gave a chilling and eerie performance. <br /> <br />Christian Bale is probably my favorite portrayl of Bruce Wayne. He really gives it the dark edge and, when he's Batman, you can really hear the tone of fury in his voice. <br /> <br />The action scenes were quite incredible. It couldn't of gotten any better with the scene where Batman is jumping rooftops in the, very cool-looking, new Batmobile. Great intensity! <br /> <br />The one thing I am really not looking forward to in the future is what happened at the very end of this film. ---DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE CLIFFHANGER--- I'm not thrilled about the Joker being the next villian. Jack Nicholasen truly captivated me with his portrayl of him and I can't watch anyone try to match it.
B0000004V2|5.0|I must say, I had never heard of this band.  I stumbled on these reviews by accident, read and then listened, and rushed ordered it. I was simply just blown away.  All of the songs are amazing,  It's tough to find something that stands out, but they all do.  I must have played Waterfall, I Want to be adored, Shoot you down, over and over.  I'm upset they are not around (or at least not played).  I missed all of this.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Just when you thought Batman had been relegated to the used video bin, along comes this exceptionally entertaining, brand spankin' new, fabulous new movie.  Everything about it is wonderful - from the engrossing plot and concept to the hyper-cool production design.  The cast is terrific, headed up by a sexy, angry, smoldering Christian Bale as Batman, and Michael Caine, who has a delightful winking humor as Alfred.  This movie, with its attention to detail, its heart-pounding soundtrack, and its smart, comic-book sensibility, gives you what so few summer movies do these days -- a visceral thrill that makes you literally gasp.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This is a great album, Shakira did it again, Her voice still have her scent and sounds strong as usual,She's a genius song writter and you can see that in the lyrics which are deeps,ironics,or funny...My favourites are \\" La Tortura\\" \\"Las de la Intuici&oacute;n\\" \\"La Pared\\" and \\"No\\"...I can't wait to listen her next album in English...I recommend this one, go and buy it.
B000001ZS8|3.0|Funny and well crafted album though not a highlight from Jarre. It is a predecessor of all the altered voice albums we can hear nowadays. The main songs are really funny to listen and the titles say it all. 'Zoolook????', 'Zoolooklogie'?????<br /><br />'Wooloomoooloooo????????'<br /><br />Really funny stuff... I reckon Jarre wanted to get a bit loose in this album after his ambitious project of the Concerts in China, and add a bit of nonsensely, surreal fun factor to his work.<br /><br />The first track, 'Ethnicolor' is strong and interesnting. The second one, 'Diva', although a bit boring it's strange and interesting; as Laurie Anderson speaks a lot of silly noises and some voices say some things. Jarre paints kind of a human jungle with voices for all over the world which is something nobody thought of before.<br /><br />The closing 'Ethnicolor II' is for me a highlight in spite of it's short duration, as it closes the album with a great, strange atmosphere and that cello evoking a lot of different emotions. A nice album, very original and a classic of instrumental synth music as well.
B00005JNJT|5.0|8 years after killing the Batman franchise thanks to director Joel Schumacher and Warner Brothers for giving the green light to do so, Batman is reborn in this exquisite effort by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.  Giving the upmost respect to the DC comic book character, Nolan has created a world that fans have only dreamed of seeing on the big screen in the past, and he succeeds to the utmost degree.  From the creation of a Gotham city that is not only believable but REAL (very limited CGI usage in this film) to the backstory of how Bruce Wayne became Batman to how he was trained and got all the gadgets that he uses as the Dark Knight, everything works in this film.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of comic books or Batman in particular to enjoy this movie, just a fan of being able to sit back and escape for 2+ hours.  If you are a fan of comic books and/or Batman you will be truly enjoying what a comic book film is supposed to be.  It's so refreshing how much time and respect have gone into comic book films the last couple of years and you will be exhuberant as you take in this film.  Christopher Nolan has resurrected a franchise that was dead and buried and improved upon the solid effort that Tim Burton put forth in the 1989 film BATMAN.  Christian Bale shines as Bruce Wayne and I love the fact that he changes his voice and actually acts different when he dons the rubber.  Every acting effort here is solid, as Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Katie Holmes all are great in their roles and they take all these roles seriously.<br /><br />Batman Begins IS the movie of the year thus far and you would be hard-pressed to not be able to enjoy this fantastic film.  One of (if not) the best comic book adaptations of all time, and a solid, solid effort.  I cannot wait for the next film in the series.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION
B000002BFL|2.0|Why is \\"Nebraska\\" great and this not?  Both albums have great stories.  The difference is that you can sing the songs on \\"Nebraska\\", in fact that album has some great melodies. I challenge anyone to hum the tune to \\"Galveston Bay\\" of Baloba Park\\" right now.  Stories are great, but they are only a part of songwriting.  That's why Flannery O'Connor is known as a great short story writer and not a songwriter.  Why does Springsteen not know this?  \\"The New Timer\\" is simply wretched with a vocal performance that is so close to self parody that it would fit nicely on a Saturday Night Live skit. <br /> <br />The title track and \\"Youngstown\\" are good, (the latter is actually much better as a rocker as released on \\"LIve in NYC\\") but they really only stand out because they have discernable melodies.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|is the May 10, 2016 release of DUNE a new remaster or what? the original issue of it has some rather poor reviews --------------------------------from 2004---------------- to the writer asking how the long version can be 2:35 when it was on TV- I suspect that 95% of the TV edition is from existing negatives-and what were they filmed in? -2:35! So they had to crop nearly the whole movie to make a TV version. The few scenes shot 4:3 can be zoomed or whatever.  If the US edition doesnt pan out- there is a STUNNING 3 disc R2 PAL edition that just came out from France (at Amazon.fr)  The remastering of the theatrical cut is amazing. (the TV cut is 4:3) Go to dvd.fr for screen shots/shootout. Get yourself an all-region player!
B000002UAF|5.0|This, the first album to feature all Lennon/McCartney compositions, is a perfect snapshot to the early Beatles music.  From the opening chords of \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" to the somber chords of \\"I'll Be Back,\\" this album catches the Beatles at some of their finest early writing.  One must also watch the movie to full appreciate these songs.  The first seven songs were in the movie, along with other songs like \\"All My Loving,\\" Harrison's \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Man.\\"  The other songs, however, are also very good.  \\"Any Time At All\\" was that rare Beatles all out rock and roll song, \\"Things We Said Today\\" finds the Beatles using some pretty clever chord changes, and the aformentioned \\"I'll Be Back,\\" is a classic Beatles tune, with classic Beatles harmony.  The first half of the disc isn't too shabby either: \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" was one of McCartney's finer rock moments, while \\"And I Love Her\\" was one of his finest deceptively simple ballads.  This album belongs in everyone's collection.
B00005JNTV|5.0|My Friend gets all these DVDs from Singapore, so I went over to his house to watch this movie and I loved it!<br /><br />The S/FX are amazing, especially the fact that this is in B/W with a splash of color! It has 3X story, and the blood looks so cool.<br /><br />But one thing- the UNREALISIM. It's a bit rediculous (I.E. The guy getting shot a zillion times and surviving and The guy surviving being hanged), but C'mon! It's just fiction!<br /><br />The story is about a B&W city called Sin City, and anything can happen! Jackie Boy is the best character, and he's so funny! I like his quotes (you're gonna love this baby).<br /><br />So see this today!<br /><br />UPDATE<br />3/7/05<br />So far only 2/9 ppl found my review helpful. WTF?? I wrote you a long and amusing review but u hate it. WHY?
B000002WYT|4.0|This is my personal favorite album by Dave and company, but musically, it pales in comparison to UTTAD.  Still this has some of his best work, including \\"Crash Into Me,\\" \\"41,\\" and \\"Two Step.\\"  These songs are all staples of his live shows, including the latter two, jam favorites indeed.  Furthermore, relatively lesser known songs like the Sting-ish \\"Let You Down,\\" and the almost 9 minute jam \\"Proudest Monkey\\" show the band's ability to set a mood.  Some of these songs are better live (\\"#41,\\" \\"Lie in Our Graves\\"), but this is their second best album.  The only real subpar songs, ironically, were the two singles \\"Too Much,\\" and \\"So Much To Say.\\"  After this album, the music would evolve beyond these good time mantras.
B00006F7S4|5.0|A truly beautiful open expression of the human condition.  Thanks Beck for sharing your sadness with the rest of the world. Now a question for 85 Delorean who slammed this masterpiece and gave it 1 star... Just how many \\"For Dummies\\" books have you rated 5 stars anyway??? Pretty funny.
0385510438|5.0|You know a book is good when you're sad you've finished it! <br /> <br />I am an avid reader and this is by far one of the best books I've read. <br /> <br />I look forward to more John Grisham novels!
B000268QB2|5.0|took me a while to like and find out about these guys... but i love Keane... it really depends what mood ur in... and their music absolutely fits my state of mind right now... THUMBS UP!
B000000WG4|5.0|For us old farts in the mid 40's, this album brings back many great memories.  This was Sir Richard's first international hit on his new Virgin label and helped him form an international airline.  This is great stuff even though a bit corny.  The last third of the album is a remake of Peter And The Wolf.  Excellent
6300184064|3.0|Jonathan Pryce stars as Sam Lowry, a low level bureaucrat, a small cog, in the big wheels of a l984-ish futuristic society, in Terry Gilliam's bizarre \\"Brazil\\".  Due to a computer glitch an innocent man is arrested by mistake instead of rogue heating engineer Harry Tuttle played by Robert DeNiro.  Pryce sets out to correct the mistake and winds up getting trapped within the mechanisms of the society.<br /><br />The world is depicted as being a robotic, dehumanizing place where individuality is scorned.  Pryce, a frequent daydreamer and escapist, envisons his ideal gal, being Kim Greist in this flick, rescued by him and together going off to a far away place. His mom, played excellently by Katherine Helmond, is evidently influential and this allows him to be promoted within the hierarchy of society.  This makes it easier for Pryce's quest to right the wrongful arrest.  Meanwhile the society is rife with terrorist attacks and Pryce eventually gets branded as one, winding up in cohoots with DeNiro who is one.<br /><br />Gilliams vision of the future is quite disturbing, where an independent thinker like Pryce is ground up like mincemeat and spit back out into society.  Bob Hoskins playing Spoor, an insane heating engineer did a nice job in his role.
B000002H97|5.0|This is the absolute classic Metallica album.  If you are a fan of music period you need this album in your collection.
B000002LMK|4.0|I don't know if \\"Ragged Glory\\" is glorious, excactly, but it is certainly ragged, with lots of gritty power chords and Neil Young's smouldering guitar solos screaming with overdrive.  The tempo is generally brisk, and the tunes are melodic with catchy choruses. They are long, too, clocking in at over an hour for ten tracks, with two closely related ten-minute epics, \\"Love To Burn\\" and \\"Love And Only Love\\".    \\"Ragged Glory\\" is not as varied or as original as some of Young's classic albums, but it has plenty of highlights, and the songwriting is generally strong. The warm, melodic \\"Country Home\\" is one of Neil Young's best latter-day songs, as is the grand \\"Love To Burn\\". \\"Farmer John\\" is another great, tough riff-rocker, and other highlights include the guitar-fest \\"Love And Only Love\\" and the driving \\"Mansion On The Hill\\" (which has nothing to do with the Springsteen-song of the same name).   In short...this is a great record. Not a transcendent masterpiece, but a really fine listen, and Neil Young-fans should not be disappointed.
B00005JLEU|5.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Sirited Away is one of the greatest animated films ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is a master story teller and has a great eye for detail. Little things like hair blowing in the wind or a little girl making sure her shoes fit nice and snug are just one of the many things that bring this film to life. Why can't more movies (even live action) be more like this?
B000002KCI|4.0|One of Neil Young's \\"classic\\" albums, \\"Zuma\\" is named after Zuma Beach, California, where Young had acquired a house at the time.  He is backed by his legendary touring band Crazy Horse on seven of these nine songs, and their costumary gritty, crunchy sound has something of a \\"live\\" feel to it.    Neil Young has always been something of an acquired taste, sort of like Bob Dylan. Even his most accessible albums aren't THAT accessible, an even though he has crafted a number of radio-friendly hit singles, Young has always been more of an album artist.  \\"Zuma\\" is a musically varied record, ranging from the very low-key acoustic \\"Pardon My Heart\\" to the thumping riff-rocker \\"Drive Back\\". \\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" is an upbeat, lively song with an instantly memorable hook. \\"Looking For A Love\\" is an almost Willie Nelson-like country rock song, simple and melodic, while the venomous seven-minute epic \\"Cortez the Killer\\" serves as a vehicle for some smouldering guitars solos by Neil Young.     Oh, and \\"Through My Sails\\", by the way, is actually a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young recording. It is quite rare, at least in connection with CSN&Y, and it doesn't even appear on the Crosby, Stills & Nash box set. Very nice vocal harmonies, not a major song otherwise, but it's okay.  And \\"Zuma\\" is much better than okay. Fans of Neil Young will not want to miss this one.
6304106017|4.0|Two bank robbing brothers and a family of hostages, a Mexican bar just over the border populated by blood-sucking vampires, Salma Hayek in one of her first Hollywood roles, Cheech Marin in several roles, and an ocean of violence and gore mark this collaborative effort by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, but on screen it's all George Clooney's show.  \\"Dusk\\" is actually two hyper-violent movies.  The first half tracks the sociopath Gecko brothers (Tarantino & Clooney) as they escape across Texas with the fruits of their latest heist.  Their goal: Mexico, where they will find sanctuary with a crime lord played by Marin.  To get across the border, they hijack an RV driven by Harvey Keitel (as a lapsed preacher) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).  At first hostages, Keitel and co. bond with the crazy Gecko's if only to keep them from killing anybody.  Once in Mexico, things change quickly - Gecko's meeting is placed at some horrid cross-border bar/strip-club/brothel.  At first, it appears to be the Gecko's kind of place - until the bar's owners reveal themselves to be vicious, blood sucking vampires.  Trapped inside the hellish bar, and barely surviving the first battle with the vampires, the Gecko's forge an uneasy alliance with the remaining human patrons - their hostages, as well as a cool vet named Frost (Fred Williamson) and a biker played by horror legend Tom Savini.  Their goal - to survive the night. <br /> <br />This was not only an extremely violent, gory and supercharged movie, but seems to exist for that alone.  The script posits gratuitous action for no purpose.  Even the vampire plot seems to drop out of nowhere, ending an interesting rapport between Clooney and Keitel.  Trapped inside the evil bar, it's less a movie than an R-rated Haunted-House ride.  That said, the movie is godawful fun, with Rodriguez painfully and hysterically finding different ways for the humans to dispatch the vampires.  The script is laced with wicked lines - most by George Clooney.  This has to be one of the most wickedly guilty pleasures since \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" and about the furthest thing you can get from a chick-flick.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|At the end of \\"The Bourne Identity\\" Jason Bourne told his former employers that he wanted to be left alone.  He made it abundantly clear that if he felt he was being watched again, there would be no hesitation as to how fast he would return to bring the fight to their door.  Well, apparently the CIA wasn't paying attention and now they've pushed Jason Bourne too far and adventure ensues.  With many members of the original cast returning, Matt Damon being most important, and a new director (Paul Greengrass) leading the way \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" will take audiences on another thrill ride that they won't soon forget. <br /> <br />\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" begins with Jason Bourne and his love, Marie enjoying a peaceful life far away from the insanity that plagued them during \\"The Bourne Identity\\".  Sadly, peace was not written into Jason Bourne's destiny, as someone is framing him for murder.  Now the CIA is hunting Jason yet again, and he doesn't know why they didn't listen when he told them to stay away from him, but he's going to hold up his end of the promise and now he's going to make them pay. <br /> <br />A brilliant sequel to an excellent spy movie, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" delivers.  Frantic pacing and camera work do an excellent job of portraying the confused and fractured psyche of Jason Bourne, while not taking away from the movie.  Another terrific story with high caliber performances from the entire cast.  Leaving audiences waiting for the third installment in this hit franchise, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B00009W0U4|4.0|I don't know many who have heard of this film and the ones who have are only familiar with it because of the much talked about acts of extreme violence during the film's climaxes. Because these particular acts are pretty realistic and shocking to those not desensitized to unflinching film violence, many are turned off and will not sit down to view this feature. While this is understandable, and while it can be justified, it is too bad because the film is actaully pretty well made.    Having seen Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' prior to 'Irreversible', I had the assumption it would be a foreign version of a familiar plot (the credits rolled backward, some letters were reversed, etc). Then, while viewing it, I begin to notice the unique style, flair, and an intriguing swagger the film starts to show.    As in 'Memento', the film begins with its brutality in the beginning, and to see why it is happening is the key. Some of this review will give away parts of the film, so if you have yet to see it, I dont wish to spoil anything for you, so consider yourself warned.    The camera work starts off erratic, blurry, and constantly moving, like a fly trying to avoid the swatter. The color pallette is heavily saturated, most notably with a lot of red, which help create the unsettling and violent mood, and there is a significant amount of chaos. As the film progresses, the camera slows down, becomes more steady, clear, and comprehensible. The colors are still vibrant, but they are more soothing and create a peaceful, harmonious feel.     A wicked soundtrack accompanies this film. The eerie opening drone in The Rectum (the club) sounds like something David Lynch would use in his films. Like the camera work, the soundtrack starts off horrifying and uneasy, then begins its unwinding towards the end of the film, and ultimately becomes quite soothing.    While this may seem like a rehashing of such an original idea as 'Memento', there are a few notable differences that set it apart. In 'Memento' there is a narratation by Guy Pearce (great job in that film, by the way) to sort of help the viewer along to understand the story, the situation, and the justification and explaination of certain key events. 'Irreversible' offers none of that; the viewer is almost like that fly on the wall, looking in and trying to figure out what the hell is going on. This also seemingly justifies the violent scenes (I don't intend to offend anyone by saying any violence of this nature is justified, but for the film's purposes...). As brutal as the opening murder is, after watching the rape, if that was my girlfriend, I would probably have the same spontaneous, uncontrollable lust for revenge.    Another thing I find interesting is the very end, when Alex is in her sun dress with her hand on her seemingly pregnant belly, and the scene shifts to the blue sky, orchestra, and relaxation on the beautiful green hill. Then the pretty sky fades into a static-like pulse that brings upon the conclusion of the film. Is it a dream? Is this entire film a dream? It would be nice if it is.     After thinking about it some more, though, I am leaning towards it is Alex as she succumbes to her injuries, since she is found in a coma. Maybe it is Alex fighting for survival, as she holds on to the peaceful feeling in order to keep her life. Maybe it is her last vision before dying, her life as it flashes before her eyes, maybe her intrepretation of heaven, maybe her entrance into heaven. I am not certain, but it's something to think about.    As in the title of this review, this film is overall a well made picture once (and if) you can get past the shock value. Enjoy being the fly on the wall, because you will never ever forget that you are one of the people to have watched 'Irreversible'.    I will most likely check out 'I Stand Alone', although I heard it is not quite as good. And I love how pedestrians are about as useless as they are ignorant.    Thank you for your time.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Spy movies never cease to do big business at the box office, but sometimes spy movies seem like they are all the same which doesn't necessarily affect the box office, but it does affect DVD sales.  There are several highly successful spy movies that have figured out how to keep things fresh for audiences; such as, James Bond, Spy Game, Mission: Impossible.  When it came time for the release of yet another spy movie, this time based on a classic Robert Ludlum novel, people were excited, that is until it was discovered that this adaptation would not have much in common with the source material, then skepticism set in.  However, unlike most cases where a movie tries to be as different from the book as possible this one works and was hugely successful, wowing audiences from day one. <br /> <br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\", based on the first book in the \\"Jason Bourne Trilogy\\" by Robert Ludlum, is about a man who is found in the ocean and has apparently been shot and doesn't remember who or what he is and who or what did this to him.  Now this man must embark on a quest to not only discover who he is, but what he is.  He has martial arts abilities, highly aware of his environment, and is constantly haunted by memories that don't make sense.  Now, the people he worked for at the CIA believe he went rogue, and want to bring him in for questioning or silence him for good.  But upon discovering his name is Jason Bourne, and that he is now wanted by the very people he worked for, though he doesn't remember why, Jason is going to take the fight to the CIA and clear his name once and for all. <br /> <br />Superbly crafted thrill ride that never lets up until the credits roll.  Though it is drastically different from the novel it is based upon, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" still retains the spirit of the novel and sets itself apart in a way that doesn't alienate fans of the novels, but also doesn't require you to have read any of them either.  Excellent cast that is lead by Matt Damon, in arole that no one thought would fit him, but he proves otherwise.  Perfect direction from director Doug Liman (director of Mr. & Mrs. Smith).  \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is an excellent, intense spy thriller, that sets the bar for all other spy movies even higher. <br /> <br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.
0156027321|5.0|This is an amazing book, the way a great book should be written. I picked it us from the airport because I had heard so much about it. However, reading the storyline, I didnt think it was the kind of book that I would enjoy. I don't like animal stories and it sounded too much like one. But, this is such a gripping read, I finished it in a day and a half. I read it again for my book club and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. <br />Some people do say it is a bit boring when Pi is on the boat but I found it to be so real, I had to check up on the net whether it was a survivors real story. And the fact that they leave you wondering whether any of it did happen at the end is a wonderful topic of discussion. The main character of the story is so well defined that you feel you want to meet this amazing boy. The different islands described in the book are so creative that once the book is done, you really do want to applaud this amazing author. Well - Done!!!
B000059XUI|5.0|After the incredibly huge success of \\"Superman: The Movie\\", Warner Brothers decided it was time for the Man of Steel to take flight yet again.  Rejoining Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman for the sequel was the original film's director, Richard Donner.  However, this movie wasn't without it's fair share of troubles, as the produers had frequent confrontations with Richard Donner and eventually replaced him after most of the movie had been filmed, a move that left many in the cast and crew upset.  Though Donner was replaced, I still choose to view \\"Superman 2\\" as another great movie from the great director of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" and the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series.    \\"Superman 2\\" picks up pretty much where the original left off, with Superman saving Metropolis from trouble whenever it arose.  This time however, the love story between Clark Kent and Lois Lane is explored even further when Lois figures out that Clark is Superman and the sparks truly fly.  Superman chooses his love for Lois over his heroic duty and returns to the Fortress of Solitude to have his powers stripped away and become human.  Sadly this comes at a terrible time for both Metropolis and the world, as 3 Kryptonian supervillains escape from the Phantom Zone with one mission in mind, make the son of Jor-El pay for their time spent locked away in the Phantom Zone.  The Kryptonians, led by General Zod (Terrence Stamp) will stop at nothing until Kal-El is kneeling before them or dead at their feet.  Will Superman set aside his love for Lois and regain his powers in time to save the earth or will the evil Kryptonians kill him and rule the world.    An awesome sequel that improves upon the original in every way, a faster paced story, more action, more gripping drama, even better acting, you simply couldn't ask for anything better.  Richard Donner and the cast really outdid themselves here, sadly Donner was unable to finish what he started do to the meddling of the producers.  Maybe if Richard Donner had been able to finish \\"Superman 2\\" the next two sequels would be better; instead of grounding this franchise for almost 20 years, until 2005 when director Bryan Singer (director of \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United\\") would begin production on the appropriately titled, \\"Superman Returns\\".    On a side note, Terrence Stamp who plays General Zod in \\"Superman 2\\", provides the voice of Jor-El on the TV series \\"Smallville\\".    \\"Superman 2\\" is rated PG for violence.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Billie Joe Armstrong and company have made themselves a place amid the pantheon of music's rock deities.  The writing, musicianship, production and all-around message comprise a work that makes you want to break the hell out of your chains and change the world.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Most everyone knows the story of Superman, how as a baby his parents sent him off in a rocket to save him from Krypton's destruction.  How he landed on Earth, was raised by great parents, and became Earth's greatest hero.  In 1978, Warner Brothers wanted to bring this iconic hero to the big screen with \\"Superman: The Movie\\".  Well audiences of course were curious to see if the movie could pull of the seemingly impossible, and to their surprise Warner Brothers proved to audiences that a man can fly. <br /> <br />\\"Superman: The Movie\\" is based, of course, on the DC Comic book character of the same name.  \\"Superman: The Movie\\" is basically an origin film for the hero, which does an excellent job of adapting the legends origins and presenting them on the big screen.  Included are everyone's favorite characters, Lois, Jimmy, Lex Luthor, and of course Clark Kent/Superman.  Once Clark (Christopher Reeve as Superman/Clark Kent) comes to Metropolis to begin his life as Superman he earns the city's admiration as he saves Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) from a helicopter crash.  At the same time, evil genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is plotting to, of course, take over the world and only Superman can stop him. <br /> <br />With great performances from the cast, to great special effects (especially for the time it was made and suprisingly they hold up pretty well today), and brilliant directing by Richard Donner, \\"Superman: The Movie\\" proved you can make a comic book film seriously and it will do big money.  \\"Superman: The Movie\\" is one of the best comic book adaptations brought to the big screen, kick starting a huge franchise, and setting off a trend that continues to this day. <br /> <br />\\"Superman: The Movie\\" is rated PG for violence.
B00026WU82|5.0|\\"The sun's not yellow - it's chicken.\\" <br /> <br />It's a line from Bob Dylan's \\"Tombstone Blues\\" that stuck with me as I was listening to Highway 61 Revisited on the way to work this morning.  <br /> <br />The line was spoken by a military leader, a \\"Commander-in-Chief\\" after berating one of his generals for weakness when the general expressed disgust at having to carry out an order to torture a captive. \\"Tell me great hero, but please make it brief/Is there a hole for me to get sick in?\\" he asks. <br /> <br />The Commander-in-Chief's reply is mixed in with the narrator's voice: \\"Death to all those who would whimper and cry/And dropping a bar bell, he points to the sky/Saying, the sun's not yellow, it's chicken.\\" <br /> <br />It's more than a fantastic play on words. This whole section of the song has so many contemporary parallels, not the least of which is that last line, where, after the leader dismisses ethical concerns, and motions with a pointless show of strength (the bar bell), he issues the ultimate, useless gesture, calling the sun chicken.  <br /> <br />The swagger and hubris involved in that challenge are both revealing and utterly unbelievable. <br /> <br />This is the power of Bob Dylan, and of this record in particular. His words cut deeper and more true than any straightforward newspaper editorial, protest or political accusation.
B00092ZL80|4.0|First, the energy and the musicianship is wondrous, but it does not stop there. These guys clearly love to play and they like being together. EW&F is on fire and vibrate the stage, Chicago is solid, as always,although I wish they had mixed things up a little more with songs not heard in some time, rather than the standard parade of hits. Still, what a band! If you like jazz, if you like horns, if you like positive lyrics then YOU WILL LOVE THIS DVD. Technically, a wonderful package, with the look and feel of being in the 3rd row. Just tell me how many current bands will still be playing in 30 years. How many in 3 years? Long live Chicago. Long live EW&F!!
B000002UC5|1.0|'Maybe I'm Amazed' that anyone would still be listening to this.  With the exception of one song, this simplistic album is loaded with lackluster, weakly written and minor arrangements. That song, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", is the rose among the thorns.  It's like someone threw together scraps from a one man jam session and hurriedly released them.  There seems to have been a race to see which Beatle could get out the first post Beatle album.  Paul really should have waited and put more effort into this.  Definitely not a shining star in his solo career.<br /><br />The reason that this album was critically panned when it first came out was that everyone was familiar with the Beatles' musical persona.  This came out riding on their coat tails. I'm not sure anyone realized that the Beatles were really going to break up. Paul is a much better artist than this shows and his other achievements prove this.  I don't know if he pushed the production of this too fast or what, but this is one album that should have remained on the farm for more work.  A serious collectors album. Buy this only if you must have his first solo album otherwise skip and buy his better produced \\"RAM\\", his second solo work, or move on to his 'Wings' days.<br /><br />1 star for \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" a truly great song.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|There is nothing bad to say about this album, and the good things are abundant. It's moody, it's dark; and like a packaged present, you must take your time to open it and discover what's inside. And believe you me, it's not the same present from last year. The music this band is playing is unlike anything out there right now, so do yourself a favor and get a copy.
0440237688|4.0|This was a rather good book- very intreasting, and it took me to a whole new level!  The characters were well-drawn out, and it was a heart-wrenching story;  it showed you what the world would look like if we were all the same, condemmed to a live of normancy, and also showed you what happens when one person stands up and says this is wrong.  I really enjoyed it, expecially since it's a book that I would not normally read.  The only true promblem that I had with it was the end-I felt that it did not tie up the book as well as I might have wanted it to.  It was much like the book Troy by Adele Geras- not the ending persay, but the way it was ended-it left the ending up to the readers, so  that you constantly go back and forth between what could have happened, without ever knowing what actuaally did happen.  Besides this fact, I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend anyone and everybody to read this book, as well as The Times Series(The first book being A Wrinkle In Time) by Madeleine L'Engle.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|It's hard to not refer to previous DT albums when talking about new ones; but this one's simple. This is easily one of the top DT albums. The beat is relentless and the melodies are near perfect. The essential song is \\"Stream of conciousness\\", an 11 minute epic, which moves you, and makes you close your eyes to appreciate it more. It's the instrumental they've been waiting to make since, well, ever! I haven't heard one more enrapturing than this one, folks. But enough talk about melodies, let's talk about lyrics.<br /><br />\\"As I Am\\" makes you wonder what really makes a so-called \\"christian band\\" christian? I'm not even sure \\"christian\\" is the right word. But this song proves that saying (or singing) really honest things about your higher power does not imply you're necessarily religious. It's truthful and direct. On the other hand, the relevance of the 9/11 actions are still important for the band, and they're trying to get their viewpoint made seen. \\"In the name of the God\\" talks about the real use of faith and religion. Do these always lend themselves to manipulation? Make your opinion be heard.<br /><br />Overall, the disc is a must in your collection. Get to know your progressive.
B0007O38F8|2.0|50 Cent - The Massacre (G-Unit, 2005) <br /> <br />You love to hear the story. MC New Jack drops a great debut album but slips up on his second album. Yes, this is what's known as the sophomore jinx and it happens to a lot of your favorite rappers: Snoop, Nas, Jay-Z, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Nappy Roots, Da Brat, etc. Well, you can add 50 Cent to the list with his weak follow-up to Get Rich or Die Tryin called The Massacre. <br /> <br />Don't get it twisted, though. It is far from a flop because it went platinum in the first week and will continue to sell based on 50's name alone. But this is one of those albums that you'll buy and ten years later you'll look back it saying either, \\"Man, I listened to THIS back then?\\" or \\"G-Unit/Shady/Aftermath was really falling off back then.\\" <br /> <br />The first problem are the beats. Since Fiddy doesn't stray from his usual subject matter (blasting guns, getting high, telling girls to \\"shake it\\", dissing others), he needs dope beats to hold the listener's attention. Dr. Dre's presence isn't felt as much as on his last album and although 50 doesn't need all Dre tracks to have a hot album, it sure wouldn't have hurt. Mediocre production plagues the album throughout, even with the well-known producers. Eminem slips with \\"Gatman and Robbin'\\" and Hi-Tek's bad luck continues with \\"Get in My Car\\". <br /> <br />The second problem are 50's lyrics which, as I said before, haven't changed much. They are all rehashed topics from his first album. His diss track, \\"Piggy Bank\\", is aimed at Fat Joe and Jadakiss. Although this beef is old news now, I find it funny that 50 is mad that the two rappers guested on his foe Ja Rule's \\"New York\\" song, and that song wasn't even a hit. Oh well, it got people to buy this album. If you do a few fast-forwards, there are a couple of good songs like \\"Ski Mask Way\\" (the chorus is based off of a Biggie line from the \\"Flava In Ya Ear\\" remix), \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\", the remix to The Game's \\"Hate It of Love It\\", and \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\". The latter uses the same marching band sample that Ghostface used for \\"Metal Lungies\\" last year but to 50's advantage, more people bought this album than Ghost's album so the beat might as well be new. <br /> <br />But that's it. There aren't many dope gangsta tracks to keep the thugs interested and the only singles released so far are for the ladies (\\"Disco Inferno\\", \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Just a Lil' Bit\\"). And judging from Eminem's mediocre album, Game's overhyped album, and Lloyd Banks' and Young Buck's album sales not even totalling as much as what 50 sold, the G-Unit/Shady/Aftermath dynasty seems to be fading. If you haven't picked up this album yet, just listen to Get Rich or Die Tryin' instead. You'll get the same effect but with better production. -EJR
B000683VI4|5.0|Nowadays, due to the fast paced modern life that we are in. It is very rare that movies with such haunting yet sweet perfection ever made the big screen. The characters show such depth of understanding when it comes to the bittersweet taste of falling in love, loosing the person you love and finding each other again that you can't help but cry and cheer with them. The story line is so beautiful and unforgettable. The Notebook has the best scenic backgound I've ever seen in awhile. It also makes you believed that love can create Miracles..... <br /> <br />For people who loved this movie. I would recommend \\" The Love Letter\\" from Hall Mark Collection and \\" The Promise\\" starring Stephen Collins and Katherine Hickland ( this came out around early 80's based on Danielle Steele novel with the same title.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is a true classic that really made Arnold famous. The visual effects may look cheesy now but for 1984, it was revolutionary. That's 21 years ago! The movie was directed by James Cameron and was followed up by an even better sequel. Buy this one and Terminator 2: Judgement Day and rent T3: Rise of the machines, and you'll be in for a true treat.  <br />This one is about a cyborg sent from the future in the past/ present to kill Sarah Connor because she would give birth to a son that would lead the resistance against the machines. Arnold plays the machine/ Cyborg/ robot and he's big, mean, and just awesome. He tears out a page from the phone book, and decides to kill every Sarah Connor. The movie is absolutely wonderfully made. But a man is also sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor.  <br />The movie is very suspensful and absolutely brilliant thanks to Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and Arnold Schw.. as the evil cyborg. Arnold barely talks but has an evil stare with a very mean look. He does have some awesome catch phrases such as \\"I'll be back!\\".  <br />When you watch this movie, remember that it's a classic and that it made Arnold famous. Just look at his eye contact and facial expressions. That shows everything. Also, don't laugh at how cheesy some scenes are, it was made 21 years ago! The special effects in this movie were AMAZING FOR THE TIME! So, just sit back and enjoy a classic.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|Folks, I like movies. I like good movies. I don't care what kind of movie is out there, if it is good, I'll like it...and if it is a bad one, I won't like it. Pure and simple. <br /> <br />What kind of movie is Finding Neverland? In short, a very bad one. I believe this movie has snob appeal. Just as wines gather a certain amount of snob appeal, so does Finding Neverland gather its share of snobbery moss. There is no denying that the idea of the movie is a good one, and that is where the positives of this movie end. The acting is just horrible, or maybe it is the directing that stinks. The movie never grabs you and is as phony as a three dollar bill. Just because a movie seems foriegn, does not make it a good movie. Some people have touted this movie as a great family movie. I would think that watching grass grow would be more fun. Your kids, (and adults, if they are honest enough) will see through this sorry excuse of a movie and see it for what it is, a snobby 'art' film.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Well, this movie obviously isn't as good as the first two but it's still a pretty good movie. I mean, without James Cameron, it obviously couldn't be as good as it should have.  <br />The movie has basically the same plot as the others with one person sent from the future to protect someone and one person sent from the future to kill that person. In this one, Arnold is sent from the future to protect Kate, the would be wife of John Connor. But he must protect both of them but can only take orders from Kate. In the meantime, the female TX is sent back to kill her. So, there's going to be some rumble.  <br />The movie has awesome special effects and some good action scenes. The famous chase is great and the action is nonstop. But, in this one, Arnold actually tries to be funny. His line \\"talk to the hand\\" was just hilarious but I like it better when he makes me laugh on accident. So strap yourself in for a god movie with great special effects and good action. The movie isn't as good as the first 2 but blows away must # 3s in a series.
B000002JSN|4.0|It's an embarassment to read a review when someone who can't spell to save their life, tries to write a review, especially when such a first - rate piece of music such as this is the topic. I had to get that off my chest.<br /><br /> It's called \\"pretentious\\" , \\"nothing but filler,\\" and \\"not true rock,\\" in comparison with later bands. Those bands wouldn't be here without Zeppelin, Sabbath, and the like. Here is a band that achieved PHENOMENAL success in the 1970's, and this is their chance to breathe, to experiment. A monotonous rhythm, like the one in \\"Kashmir\\" is the groundwork for incredibly beautiful string arrangements, via the mellotron. Nobody uses the mellotron anymore, too bad, but keyboard players say it's not a reliable instrument.<br /><br />For some reason, \\"Down By The Seaside\\" has lived inside my head from the first time I heard it, all those years ago.<br /><br />Just take each selection for what it is, don't make any unreasonable demands,let the boys in the band show you what they're made of.<br /><br />I gave this a 4 out of 5, because there are no half-stars, and I don't care much for \\"Black Country Woman.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000002AH1|5.0|This is the sound your brain might make if you dropped acid then your afro caught on fire. Slices and dices culled from LIVE jams and studio takes of atmospheric funk that were so far ahead of their time, that SETI was sending this across the galaxy. Extraterrestrials heard it and have been afraid to respond ever since.<br /><br />How far ahead of his time was Miles? I disagree that the LIVE jams outweigh the studio tracks. Sample the ambient trumpet of studio takes SELIM and NEM UM TALVEZ. They're filled with quiet atmospheric BEAUTY. The sound is remarkably similar to the kind of ambience that's being recorded now, 35 years later by ambient artists such as Steve Roach. They didn't call this cat a genius for nothing.<br /><br />THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO BLOW YOUR TOP WITHOUT SMOKING CRACK. For the best results mix this with a hookah pipe, an Indian meditation pillow, door beads, a blacklight, and a naked afro-chick poster.<br /><br />Looking for the best LIVE 70's fusion from electric Miles? I also recommend LIVE AT THE FILMORE EAST, MARCH 6 1970: IT'S ABOUT TIME, DARK MAGUS, and AGHARTA. You simply can't go wrong.<br /><br />ENJOY.
0778321606|5.0|I love books where chapter by chapter I have to find out \\"what's next?\\" Debbie builds that in all her novels, while still managing to make each story fresh.  She creates worlds that incorporate sets of characters that readers care about and communities we like to revisit.<br /><br />Another such community is created in THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET. I recommend this book to any reader who enjoys the same qualities mentioned above.
B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie Minouge's Fever is a CD that is perfect for working out in the morning. The tracks are fast-paced, but have a relaxing quality.  Fever revitalizes you rather than gets you leaping in a frenzy.  Minouge's whispering voice, the shimmering electronics, and a bass providing most of the rhythm lead to the restrained yet energetic songs.  WARNING:  The music is will cause you to attempt the robot dance, no matter how ridiculous you look.<br /><br />The CD insert booklet has more photos of Kylie and a mini-centerfold of her sexy pose featured on the back cover, dressed in a little white scarf, showing off her ASSets.
0805028846|1.0|Thats what the title says and hence i bought the book.<br /><br />Its not exactly step by step.  The cards i liked didnt come with any instructions at all!<br /><br />Its very frustrating---because you can see the card but cannot make it.<br /><br />The directions (wherever you are lucky to find it)...are not very helpful also...for eg---there are drawings for the cut out but no dimensions...it didnt help me at all.<br /><br />I would recommend this book only if you are a accomplished paper engineer and can \\"see\\" the technique of making these cards
B0000844I8|3.0|Amazon Lists several DVD extras that do not appear on what they send you.  The DVD you get says Ultimate Edition, but I see nothing \\"ultamate\\" about what arrives.  It only had the featurette \\"Is there A Stargate?\\"  The \\"Making Of\\" featurette isnt on this, which is upsetting because I really wanted to see that.  It def doesnt come with the gold embossed cover but i dont care about that.  There is also only one version (not director's and theatrical cuts).  There may be other discrepancies that i didnt notice cause i dont pay attention to those aspects, so if i didn't mention it, and it is important to you, i'd ask BEFORE buying!  Just be warned that is is a baiy and switch!all in all, it is a decent movie though.  Dont njoy all the subtitles when they speak in egyptian.  some parts are confusing and some are dark and difficult to see.
B000002H33|5.0|Battery - I heard this song on internet radio and wondered how the rest of the album could ever live up to it.  Well, for the most part it did.  Battery is an fast, aggresive song with some of the best drumming on the album (at parts the drums sound like fireworks); probably would be great to listen to before a football game (or a battle). <br /> <br />Master of Puppets - An anti-drug song, but instead of just telling kids not to do drugs, it tells a sort of story narrated by the drug (the master of puppets) about what happens if you get addicted (you lose hope of attaining your dreams and die quicker).  Although there are no explicit references to drugs, read the lyrics and you'll understand. <br /> <br />The Thing that Should Not Be - My least favorite track, it deals with monsters.  Not to say it's bad, probably as I listen to it more I will enjoy it more. <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - Narrated from the perspective of a mental hospital patient who desperately wants freedom. <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes - About how soldiers are used as pawns by thier commander without thought for thier lives.  The album's cover is based on this song; note the helmet on the left cross, the dog tag on the middle cross and the government's hands holding the strings to the crosses. <br /> <br />Leper Messiah - A song about the perpetrator of a psuedo-religion designed to take money from it's followers. <br /> <br />Orion - An excellent instrumental. <br /> <br />Damage Inc. - Another adrenaline pumper like Battery.  Sounds like it's about an mercenary group. <br /> <br />Most people who wrote negative reviews about MOP seem to either be unhappy that Metallica later changed their style so they would appeal to a wider variety of listeners (I prefer not to judge music by the band that created it) or be unhappy for how long most of the songs are (5-9 minutes; that's how they played metal back then).  Although not everyone will like it, MOP is an essential speed/thrash metal album, perhaps the best ever.  In any case, it's my favorite album ever.
B000002LIX|3.0|I bought this CD on the strength of the reviews, but find it to be nothing special at all.  Basically, the lyrics, on which all the music hinges, are juvenile and amateurish.  I expected real creativity like that found in nirvana, pearl jam, ratm, or the chili peppers, but this is nothing close.

B0009NCQJ6|4.0|I never heard of Bond until my parents bought their \\"Live at Royal Albert Hall\\" DVD at a promotions sale 2 weeks ago. Although some of the compositions in that DVD were over-orchestrated, I found \\"Victory,\\" \\"Dalls,\\" and \\"Alexander the Great\\" to be unique enough to get me interested. Therefore, the timing of this \\"Best Of\\" CD/DVD couldn't be better, in that I get to sample their best works and save myself the money for 3-4 CDs at the same time.  <br /> <br />So, I rushed to Borders the day of the release. Then, after listening to the CD a few times, I found most of the songs to be quite excellent, with the three DVD tracks being the best (with that, why are \\"Dreamstar\\" and \\"Dallas\\" missing?). They are all very upbeat, technically impressive, and (mostly) expertly orchestrated. The \\"Bonus\\" DVD MTVs are also very well done, with none of the classical rigidity that usually bores me to sleep. If you like a more rhythmic/powerful version of music like Yanni, Taliensin Orchestra, and Enya, this is for you. I just wish I had known this group earlier.    <br /> <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|I must admit that I am going through a phase of Oasis-mania right now brought on by my recent attendance of their gig in Detroit on June 18, 2005. But I dug this CD the day I bought it (one day after its release) and it has only grown more dear and essential to me as I've given it multiple and closer listens ever since. <br /> <br />Is this the disc that's going to restore Oasis to the world-dominating (morning) glory they enjoyed in the mid-90's? No, times have changed and more importantly, many of today's music listeners don't have much appreciation for the rock style that Oasis specializes in. But I would dare say that this is a must-buy album for anyone who still cares for the sound of majestic guitars, anthemic choruses and the bigger-than-life persona that epitomized rock and roll in its heyday. This ought to be a more popular (sales-wise) album than it will probably turn out to be, because Oasis won't get the record company hype to push it to million-seller status and a lot of the youngsters who might normally dig this band are getting bland corporate rock like Three Doors Down and Nickelback shoved in their face instead. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are \\"Turn Up the Sun,\\" \\"Lyla,\\" \\"Keep The Dream Alive,\\" and \\"Let There Be Love.\\" But \\"A Bell Will Ring,\\" \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" and \\"Love Like a Bomb\\" also stick with me. And the other songs are worthwhile too - they're all strong cuts, actually, worthy of inclusion. This sounds like a band that had a lot of solid material to choose from and I would say they chose wisely. <br /> <br />Basically, if you are an fan of large-scale, audience pleasing and accessible rock music created with intelligence, performed with skill and created with careful but gritty professionalism, there's no excuse for you not buying this CD! I recommend the dual disc over the regular CD because it's compatible with all the devices I've tried it with, and the videos are better to watch on your TV than on your computer.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I've been a Pink Floyd fan for a very long time.  I bought the Wall when it was new, which was right around the time I started High School.  As a kid when this was new, that album was very influential in my musical landscape.  I'd heard of Pink Floyd before, but it wasn't until the Wall that my appreciation of them crystallized.  Right around the time the band started to implode, but that's another story for another time.<br /><br />Anyway, since the Wall had already been released, I was waiting for the next \\"new\\" Pink Floyd release after the Wall.  That ended up being a rather disappointing greatest hits album called \\"A Collection of Great Dance Songs\\" (which in itself is a joke, as you can't dance to Pink Floyd).  So I waited.  We then got the Wall movie, and to that there was a single released.  It was called \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\".  This was an extra/new song for the Wall movie.  The single said \\"From the forthcoming album 'The Final Cut'\\".  At the time, the album The Final Cut was to be a soundtrack to the movie, as about 60% of the music wasn't from the original album.<br /><br />So time went on, and the soundtrack was never released.  The Falkland Island War came around, it got Roger Waters to write some new songs, and those were coupled together with some leftovers from the Wall sessions to make what was released in 1983 as The Final Cut.  It really feels more like a Roger Waters solo album than a Pink Floyd album.  At that point, the Keyboardist (Rick Wright) was gone, there were some real personnel battles behind the scenes - any semblance of \\"Band\\" left was destroyed during the making of this album.  But out of the sessions came some really good songs for me.  Not Now John (the hardest song of the lot), The Final Cut (a Wall leftover, so much so that the lyrics say \\"behind the wall\\" in them), The Gunner's Dream, The Fletcher Memorial Home (named after Rog's dad, Eric Fletcher Waters)..  All good.<br /><br />What's odd is I love the thing despite it's wonderfully depressing atmosphere.  The music is minimalistic, I think it fits the theme of the lyrics well.<br /><br />In 2004, the album was remastered again, and after all this time, the song \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" was finally added back into the album.  I'd been listening to it for 20 years, so having Tigers in there really jarred me in terms of what I new was coming next.  But now that it's been out for about a year (I'm writing this in the summer of 2005), I have to say it fits well.<br /><br />So much so that I probably can say the song \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" is the one Floyd song that envokes the most emotion for me out of any Pink Floyd song - and there's a lot of them.<br /><br />So yeah, I love the masterfully depressing album The Final Cut.  It was about the death of Roger's dad, it was the death of Pink Floyd, and my favorite song on the album (Tigers) is all about death and sadness.  Go enjoy the album - if you put some thought into it, I think you'll like it too.<br /><br />I should point out that the album was also remastered in 1997 as well.  The 2004 edition has a better sound, I think.  The Tigers song does not appear on the 1997 version - make sure the version you're getting is the 2004 release.ng atmosphere.

B00005JLO2|4.0|the story could have been dramatically heart wrenching if it weren't quite so vague on certain points (\\"i was scared\\" mmmmkay...), the characters had so much potential to be people you couldn't help but empathize with, and plot was somewhat unpredictable. But Kate Hudson's acting was a nice try but she belongs much better in ditzy comedies.  Heath Ledger just didn't really seem to have the \\"air\\" or dogged determination of a military man.  Wes Bently really steals the show here, giving a powerful performance of a man with everything and yet nothing. the relationship between Kris Marshall's and Michael Sheen's characters is touching and Michael Sheen gives a good run as the funny man with a temper and real heart...it was a decent movie but could have been better.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|...then it's a beautiful place to be, \\"Bedlam\\", of the title was the 18th Century lunatic asylum in London.<br /><br /> This debut album from  this ex-British Army Soldier is stunning. A kind of modern day folk with painfully accurate commentry and poetic lyrical scribes on modern life and relationships. His voice is just stunningly georgous, it has a pained and fragile quality but with a sublime hypnosis that will have playing this album repeatedly. He sings like a wounded Angel.<br /><br /> Mr Blunt has been so successful in his home country (The UK) that he was recently headlined at the famous Glastonbury Festival, he deserves every success in his music career. I have seen him interviewed a couple of times on TV and he is a thoroughly nice Bloke too. Anyone who was blown away by Damien Rice will adore this! A MUST HAVE, MUST LISTEN TOO AND MUST PLAY AGAIN AND AGAIN!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The original Let It Be album was a mess: the silly and irrelevant dialogues, the fragments of songs (\\"Dig it\\") and the overproduction of songs (\\"Across the universe\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\"). <br />Now we have something that sound like a real album.  <br />This versions of the songs and the new track list brings new life to The Beatles. They sound like a vital and poweful band again. <br />The low points of this release are: the bonus CD (It doesn't add anything), the cover, and the title. It seems like a limited edition that will disappear soon. This CD should be release like a definitive replacement to the old album, with a good cover and a good name (\\"Get Back\\", maybe).
B000002UJQ|1.0|i brought this albumn mistaking it for local hip hop group of the same name. a ... i was not taken by the noise and poor vocal skills, they need some lessons on how to play and write reeal music. BEP to the end
1401200605|5.0|Batman> Hush, is very good in many ways. I LIKED IT, The story  and the art are fantastic. all sides of batman/bruce wayne, alfred, gordon, robin, nightwing, catwoman, jocker  and all were ilustrated on the dot. if jim lee and Jeph Loeb would team up on a single comic book for a longer run they very well could be the new Chris Claremonth and Jhon Byrne, im not kidding. <br />any way. This book is good for many rasons... <br />1.-because you get fantastic vissuals. <br />2.-because the story is goooooooooooood. <br />3.-because if you dont realy know who or whats up with robin and got no idea how come there have been diferent robins, and dont understand the diferrence between them this story line will ilustrate you well on it (as it did to my non comic fan friends). <br />4.-This is also a good introduction to the batman world for new comers and a good catch-up read for former batman fans.  <br /> --even people who dont like comics say thats its preaty good. <br />5.-mistery, action, love, honor, revenge, redemption, and tons of awwsomeness will be found on this book as well on the second paperback, but dont worry is not over saturated its balanced just fine. <br />and thats all folks. <br />...by the time you read this part you will find out that i have nothing else to say and it will be to late because you have already read it.

B00003CWTI|5.0|The nineties Decade aroused the greatest interest all over the world. The American Cinema fortunately, decided to bet for risky and innovative themes: Consider this brief list of the most remarkable and original films since 1990: Schindler's list, Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, Brave heart, Silence of the lambs,  Seven, American beauty, Goodfellas, Twelve monkeys, The Green Mile,  Matrix, Devil's advocate, The man who was not there, Madison bridges, Leaving Las Vegas, Crossing Miller, As good as it gets, Thelma and Louise, The Truman Show, In search of Richard III, State of grace, Short cuts and this one are undeniable a convincing evidence that a new generation is fighting hard to establish new codes.<br /><br />Magnolia was somehow, a work that clearly anticipated related films (The butterfly effect, Memento) and became a mainstream within the ambit of a new approach narrative as well a true rearrangement of the classical structure, kinetic frenzy, ellipsis and aggressive camera angles, but mainly a real concern for expressing, exploring that confirm that old statement of Orson Welles: \\"The cinema is a ribbon of dreams\\" .<br /><br />For some reason or other, you feel there is an evident close to the literary genre. The film is extremely ambitious: to face the challenge to tell twelve stories, linking them and focus about the little triumphs and failures, of the merits and miseries of the common people. The hidden side of the soul of apparently top personalities of the big show (Tom Cruise's character), the bitter critic of the TV show and the breakthrough of a genius child, as well as the not planned evolution of irrelevant facts will constitute in a real tour de force for the viewer. I mean this is film you must watch free of problems, and far to consider it a simple entertainment. It is mature movie without special effects. And far beyond the fact of being nominated for the Academy Awards, the picture will show you the importance of the crossed incidents that may cause the interruption of a successful life, or the turning point of an peaceful existence.<br /><br />Dazzling edition work and brilliant performances of Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise.interruption of a successful life, or the turning point of an peaceful existence.  <br />Dazzling edition work and brilliant performances of Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise.           <br /> <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is just the kind of music that I wish for at the end of a long day at the office.  I just want to put on some of his tunes, and have a nice cocktail and just mellow out with the dames.  Listening to this music makes me feel like a man and makes me appreciate being one.  Awesome.  Simply awesome!

B000000H42|5.0|Despite what the reviewer \\"Hot Rats\\" says below (and how seriously can you take a person who classifies Dio as aggressive metal anyway?), this album is awe inspiring.  While I don't doubt that there are more than a few people who can't stand King Diamond, I can't see how anyone can love Rob Halford and hate the King at the same time.  King has arguably the scariest sounding vocals in metal history.  One moment he sounds like an angry beast, then instantly he jumps 10 octaves and sounds more like a voice out a demonic nightmare.  He doesn't let completely loose here like he does in his later, post Mercyful Fate albums like \\"Abigail\\", but you definitely get the idea.  This album was so ahead of its time, it basically spawned the genre of black metal.  MF's first album, \\"Melissa\\", is great too, but the better production and songwriting makes \\"Don't Break the Oath\\" an all-time classic.  If you consider yourself a fan of black metal, I highly recommend checking this out.  As you listen to it, just think how good it would sound if it were re-recorded by some of today's producers.  \\"A Dangerous Meeting\\" and \\"Desecration of Souls\\" are the best songs on the album for my  money.  Take a listen to those, and, if you like them, pick this CD up immediately.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a different kind of comedy that you would have to get or you will not like the movie!!!!!! I found it really entertaining to watch and i love his catchy talk through the whole movie!!!!!! Napoleon Dynamite is a whole new kind of hero to his school and who knows he may be the next for your school!!!!!!!! I was reading some of the reviews and some of them were bad,but take my advice and go buy this movie it is so worth your money and time and it will keep you laughing the whole time!!!!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|This review is for people who don't know much about Coldplay, and are considering buying this cd from Amazon. Because if you are a fan from the previous two albums then you already own this cd like it or not. <br /> <br />Most of the songs are very good; mellow and relaxing, but the others are loud and annoying with lyrics that are hard to follow and incoherent. I mean the song has to be able to tell some sort of story or call forth memories, images and feelings. Half of the songs on this cd don't do that.  <br /> <br />There is an immediate lack of the piano, which played beautifully in the prior two albums. A lot of lyrics about fixing things. There is a track called \\"Fix You,\\" and then in X&Y lots of lyrics about fixing things. Needless to say, lyrically weak by their standards. And melodies were also slacking, loud when they didn't need to be and quite when they needed to be loud.  <br /> <br />There are a few songs where everything works beautifully; Talk, Swallowed in the Sea, Speed of Sound, Till Kingdome Come, and What IF.  <br /> <br />What makes a cd worth buying? --> Good songs outweigh the bad ones, and this cd is worth buying because the good songs outweigh the bad ones.  <br /> <br />Even though this CD is not as good as people expected, in all honesty it still is better than 95% of the albums put out this year.  <br /> <br />Concluding...if you're curious, I strongly recommend \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" and \\"Parachutes.\\" And I'll bet you, you will be so captivated by them that you'll eventually purchase this one (maybe not).  <br /> <br />I love the first two albums, and in my honesty this isn't as good as the other two, but it's still a decent album that you can listen to.  <br /> <br />In My Humble Opinion
0805076476|4.0|Great book. It is a unintimidating book that can easily be finished in a day. However, in this short book is a well, uniquely written novel bringing interesting social commentary into the plot. A lot deeper than guys beating he post-digested matter out of each other. Besides, any book that teaches you how to make napalm and nitro is worth a read, right?
B00097A5I6|3.0|These are facts: in the 5 years since 2000, Oasis has released 2 albums, on which Noel Gallagher, the band's main creative force, wrote exactly 11 songs in total, half of the songs on those 2 albums. In contrast, in the 3 year span 1994-1997, Oasis released 3 albums and multiple B-sides, and ALL of them (about 50 songs or so) were written by Noel.<br /><br />\\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" (11 songs, 43 min.) has been hyped by the Gallagher Brothers as \\"the best album since Definitely Maybe\\" (just as was Heathen Chemistry supposedly was). Is ANYONE really buying that? They really are urging us to \\"[Not] Believe the Truth\\"... All that said, there are some pleasant moments on the album, this is Oasis after all. If you can get over the blatant rip-off from the Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man\\", then \\"Lyla\\" (first UK single) is a pretty good stomper. \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" (second UK single) is a bit quirky but pleasant enough. \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" is a surprisingly strong contribution from Andy Bell. The closer \\"Let There Be Love\\" sounds out of place (and it is--it's a song rescued from the \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" sessions).<br /><br />Look, the problem with Oasis today is that the muse has left Noel, it's that obvious. And until that changes, nothing is going to bring Oasis back to their former heydays. Compared to the majority of music out there, \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is not a bad album. But the truth is also that, in comparison to the rest of the Oasis catalogue, this is unfortunately the weakest album yet.<br /><br />I have read that the songs from \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" translate surprisingly well in a live setting. I have not had a chance to catch Oasis in concert this year, but would love the opportunity to find out for myself...
0393314804|5.0|First, let all people interested in reading this novel know that, as the title of this review mentions, there IS a glossary in the back. I tell you this because I wish I knew this while I was reading the first half the book. Second, many people would rather not refer to a glossary while reading a book. I must urge you to step out of your element, otherwise you will miss out on an excellent novel. I've talked to some people that feel this book encourages drug use. I wonder if they have read the book? After seeing the lives these brothers and sisters lead, you'll never wanta touch the stuff. One chapther that particularly stands out is 'Bad Blood'. If you read nothing else in this book, go to your local book store or library and just read this chapter for it does not require any previous knowledge of the book...gives a brother chills.
B0007PALRU|4.0|Aside from the movie itself, disc 2 has an excellent documentary \\"The Force of Destiny: The Science and Politics of Climate Change\\" that is well worth seeing, should be seen by anyone remotely concerned about life on earth as we know it.
B000002NJS|4.0|Another very good album by Madonna.  Four singles were released from the album: \\"Frozen\\" (#2 hit), \\"Ray of Light\\" (#5 hit), \\"The Power of Good-Bye\\" (#11 hit) and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" (#93 non-hit).  Very mature effort from Madonna.
B00000J7SS|4.0|Miles Davis was always known for being an experimental artist, but when he released this in 1969, many people were confused. Wheres all the melodies of \\"Kind of Blue\\" or the cool feeling of \\"Birth of the Cool\\"? Well, it was just another step forward in the evolution of Jazz, which, for better or worse, brought in Fusion. The album may sound like a mess on first listen, but it isn't. Miles Davis put a good amount of time into conceiving this album, which he hoped would change Jazz. They aren't merely jamming here, it's all part of a greater purpose. In addition to creating Fusion (probably my least favorite style of Jazz), the album also set the blueprint for Funk-Jazz. Herbie Hancock as we know him today wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this album. This was probably the last great Miles Davis album, but it is one of his best, and therefor a must-buy for his fans.
B000002UD0|4.0|But in a good way, if you know what I mean. This album was made when John had broke up from Yoko, and had went off with May Pang (Avoid her horrible book at all costs) to L.A, where he hung out with several musicians including Who drummer Keith Moon, and Elton John. In fact, Elton John had a big impact on this album, in addition to backup vocals and piano on Whatever Gets You Thru The Night. John had originally envisioned the album more as an acoustic Dylan-type offering until Elton John came in and suggested to make it a more upbeat, almost disco-ey type of album. <br /> <br />The opening track, Going Down On Love, has a brilliant sound to it and is one of John's more underrated songs. The next song is Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, which was John's first number one single. It's a fun song, but it's hardly one of his best. Old Dirt Road, which is the next song, is a beautiful, quiet piece. What You Got goes back to that disco feel once again, and is one of my favorite songs on the album. The next two songs, Bless You and Scared, are two of John's lesser known songs and I wouldn't listen to them unless I was listening to the album as a whole, but they're still good songs. #9 Dream is probably the best song on the album, and is a love song to the number 9, to put it in a weird way. It's a great song, and definitely the most playable on the album. The next song Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox) is another of the lesser known ones on the album, and not one of John's best. Once again, I would probably only listen to it if I was listening to the album as a whole. Steel and Glass, however, is another great song, it's a hate letter to Allen Klein (although John later said he wrote it about himself, but I get the feel he was just trying to play down the hatred), and is very reminiscent of How Do You Sleep? on the Imagine album. Beef Jerky is a forgettable instrumental, but Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out) is another great song, and finally the album is capped off with Ya Ya, a cover of an old rock song, with John's son Julian on drums. It's not really a proper song, just a little bit of fun they had in the studio, but it's nice to have anyway. <br /> <br />John always said he was in pain when he made this album. Split up from Yoko, essentially an alcoholic, it's an album where you feel the pain that he was going through, but it's still a very memorable album, and one worth picking up.
B000002KB8|5.0|This refers to the import version. This debut cd of the self titled album (made on a low music budget) rocks after 35 years! The guitar of Iommi soars, the bass of Butler thunders, the drums of Ward provide a heavy beat and Osbourne's vocal were in their prime (regardless of what one thinks of his vocal skills now). The import version has a song called \\"Evil Woman (Don't You Play Your Games With Me) that will blow the b---s off of anything that purports to be \\"heavy metal\\" now. Along with Deep Purple, and others, including Dio, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, W.A.S.P., and a few others, very few, Black Sabbath proved that four lads from Birmingham England (originally known as Polka Tulk, later Earth, then (finally) Black Sabbath) could explode and rock (as nobody could). Try to get the import version (as it has remastered and superior sound and the aforementioned extra song [for the U.S., for the U.K. Wicked World was the extra song]. Critics can say what they will for my money nobody rocks/rocked harder than these guys in their prime (which this cd clearly demonstrates) [not that they couldn't now]. It also features lyrics (though not complete on some songs) no matter, Ozzy had clearer vocals then, so it's easy to follow along, and it also has background on the music, in the import version's booklet, and an inverted cross (which was supposed to be in the original album (as a \\"gatefold\\" sleeve, in the lp days) but the Warner Brothers in dear old U.S. changed it to a single cover front and back (with no interior). (Unlike the NEMS lp.) Enough said-get this sucker. You won't be disappointed.
B00006L3S3|4.0|A lot of people consider Mind Games to be another Lennon \\"flop\\", coming after Sometime In New York City, which is also considered to be a bad album. However, Mind Games is, without doubt, a stronger album than New York City and while it isn't as strong as some of John's other work, some other artists would probably kill to have an album like this. <br /> <br />The first song is the most well known on the album and wouldn't be out of the place on his Imagine album. It's a nice, relatively slow, upbeat number and always makes its way on to Lennon best-of compilations. After that, the songs aren't as well known. Tight A$ is a fun rocker, but not one of John's best. It seems to wear off its welcome fairly quickly, but the next song is much stronger. Aisumasen (I'm Sorry) is a great love letter/apology to Yoko, and one of the strongest songs on the album. One Day (At A Time) is another good song but is followed by what I consider to be the best song on the album Bring On The Lucie (Freda People). It's a fantastic little number and the only song on the album that has anything \\"political\\" in it at all, and it's not even a political song. It's definitely a classing John song, and it is very underrated, much like the rest of the album. <br /> <br />For those wondering, the Nutopian International Anthem is a 5 second long silence, and was the anthem for the conceptual country that John and Yoko created in 1973. After that, we have Intuition, which has always sounded to be like something off of Plastic Ono Band, except a little more upbeat than most of the songs on that album. Out Of The Blue is another of my favorite songs on the album, and is sort of like an upbeat love letter to Yoko. <br /> <br />Only People and I Know (I Know) are fairly good songs, but are hardly the best on this album. However, the last two are definitely classics. You Are Here is a quiet, beautiful song and Meat City is an absolutely fantastic rocker, and a great way to end an amazingly underrated album. <br /> <br />This remastered edition also has three extra tracks. Home demos of Aisumasen (I'm Sorry), Bring On The Lucie (Freda People), and Meat City. They're fairly rough but they're goopd to listen to a couple of times. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend picking Mind Games up. It's not one of John's most famous, but it's a fantastic album, and it is very underrated.
0553296981|4.0|I think it is a very good book and anyone should read it. As a book it is very nice to read, Anne describes her growing up in such extra ordinary sircumstances and with only the regular residents of 'het achterhuis' to interact with.<br /><br />Bigger than te book is ofcourse the story and the big picture behind it. Also it contains a lot of hope and optimism, sadly we know how the true story ended.<br /><br />Do read this book! And when you find yourself in The Netherlands visit the house where she was hiding in for so long.
B000021YQV|3.0|Alright, here's my review of the 2001 album by System of a Down \\"Toxicity\\". Let's get straight to the point... <br /> <br />Song 1: \\"Prison Song\\": great fast song with 16/4 hi hats and bassdrum inferno and a sick bridge. deals with the drug policy and prison system in the US  8/10 <br /> <br />Song 2: \\"Needles\\": After a short intro the riffs just smack you in the face and offer march-like rhythms in the verses and fire in the chorus. Very good drumming by John.  9,5/10 <br /> <br />Song 3: \\"Deer Dance\\": Classic SOAD rocker with great vocals and similar content as Prison Song. Funny how the mood in the hookline changes in the middle of the song. Trashmetal at its best!  8,5/10 <br /> <br />Song 4: \\"Jet Pilot\\": 2nd worst song on the album. Just straight up hammering and slight changes in the typical SOAD-Armenia-style. Music for the highway.  7/10 <br /> <br />Song 5: \\"X\\": Perfect name for the song. This is just usual stuff with high bpm and nothing interesting to it.  6,5/10 <br /> <br />Song 6: \\"Chop Suey!\\": Probably the best known song by SOAD. Named after a chinese plate it is a masterpiece with fast-paced parts and an angellike hook. Great intro and funny use of many guitars and even strings. Becoming a very passionate one at the end, but y'all know it.  10/10 <br /> <br />Song 7: \\"Bounce\\": The funniest one which simply animates you to bounce and bang your head.  9/10 <br /> <br />Song 8: \\"Forest\\": The intro sucks but what comes then is gigantic. I Think it's the most underrated on this record with a great chorus and breaks combined with Darons solo at the end.  9/10 <br /> <br />Song 9: \\"ATWA\\": An up and down of feelings with pretty nice backing up by Daron who interacts very good with Serj's lower voice. Hymn for big stages.  9,5/10 <br /> <br />Song 10: \\"Science\\": Daron starts the helicopter (it sounds like this) and Serj dennounces the failure of modern day science. Very remarkable second part with the eastern melodies. Once again Dolmayan did it!  9/10 <br /> <br />Song 11: \\"Shimmy\\": Another one in the tradition of \\"Ddevil\\". Funny hook!  8,5/10 <br /> <br />Song 12: \\"Toxicity\\": From the 3 guitar intro to the best drums on the record to the increasing vocals to the riff-thunder. Everything is perfect and makes SOAD a real standout band. \\"Now hat do you own the world? How do you own DISORDER??\\"  11/10 <br /> <br />Song 13: \\"Psycho\\": Shavo feeds into your head with a mean distortion bass, srj drops another stakkato and Daron provides everything from weird accords to his best solo ever. About psychotic, cocaine addicted whores. Stunning. Period.  10/10 <br /> <br />Song 14: \\"Aerials\\": As you've recognized, the last couple songs are real standout and so is this one. Starting like a ballad and becomes a almost \\"classic rock\\" performance. Hard to decribe this incredible piece of art so I just end with a quote : \\"life is a waterfall, we drink form the river then we turn around and put up a wall!)  10,5/10 <br /> <br />All in all: 126/140. Almost flawless crossover record and the seond best fron SOAD (Mezmerize tops it). Pick it up instantly if you do not own it yet, it will capture you like it did me!!
0553208845|5.0|I thought I had life sussed -- I thought I was enlightened already with just a little tweeking necessary -- I secretly thought I was \\"evolved\\" and \\"special\\".  I know the book is just someone's perspective but for me there were many passages that occurred like I knew them but didn't know I knew them.<br /><br />When I started reading it, I was full of conflicting opinions (with me being right, of course) and it was about half way through that I started to understand the journey of the book - a journey that ended up being my own too.  The last half was a greedy read for me with a wonderful sense of well-being encompassing me in the last few pages.<br /><br />What I got out of it is that one of my longings has been that I can share the knowledge and wisdom I have attained over my 55 years.  It is liberating to acknowledge that Who I actually am is ordinary... one of the 'child people' mentioned in the book and not the would-be guru I've set myself up to be to inform people of how wrong they are doing things.  I came to that I am content with being ordinary - who I am and where I am ... and life will change like the water of the river depicted in the book .. always there (life) but never the same water and no doubt, I will change with it.<br /><br />Who I am being about it is that I am setting myself free to just be me .. all that I am and all that I'm not and I know that will be a journey in itself.<br /><br />I'm really glad I had the opportunity to read the book .. as you can probably tell.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead was a hilarious twist to the zombie movie genre. Simon Pegg stars as Shaun, a working class man, unhappy with his job, fighting with his girlfriend, and for some time, completely oblivious to the world quickly becoming overrun by flesh-hungry walking dead. The movie made great referances to George Romero and his start of the whole genre with 'Night of the Living Dead' when all the while cracking up the audience with the witty brittish humor director Edgar Wright brought to the film. It's definately worth checking out. To put it best, the text on the cover explains it right, \\"It's a romantic comedy, with zombies.\\"
B000002JR8|4.0|this was a good album but like i said in the title not that good there was too much spoken word in it \\"im broken\\" really held it all together but the cover of black sabbths planet caravan was pretty good and not enough guitars mostly bass and drumlines good album but it doesnt surpass the first two albums at all <br />
B0000009SM|5.0|This is a watershed for Frank Zappa in his unique musical catalog.  It's so together on so many levels it became a standard by which I measured all subsequent releases by other artists.  Unfortunately, in this day and age of singles (mp3) the art of putting together a work that moves you from beginning to end is becoming less frequent. None the less this album is a one of the best examples of where pure art and commerciality live side by side. <br /> <br />Where to start?  Let's look at the packaging first. A big maroon sofa floating in space. A Zappa mythology brought to life for the eyes by the brilliant artist Cal Shenkel. God's sofa. One Size certainly fits all. Hilarious subtle pseudo scientific sketches abound along with continuity clues in the form of astrological hokum. Tremendous detail. Giant ants rip apart Hollywood under a blanket of absurd sounding constellations many of which are subtle references found on a myriad of FZ cds.  Inside we have the credits and lyrics written on Fresco in a calligraphic font (refers to the actual vinyl record), almost to indicate a sort of religious reverence of the music contained herein.  And it certainly is.  This album sealed my fate as a recording artist.   <br /> <br />The active mixing of Kerry Mcnabb, the colorful instrumentation, the climaxes, the solos, the absurd clever lyrics, the continued air pressure /segues  from one song to the next.  It was all here. FZ put all the cards on the table and presented his ideas not as just a composer but in capturing a group effort of amazing musicians.  All these pieces are so strong melodically and rhythmically it's a real testament to FZ's genius as a composer.  The forms are so clear and memorable it's no wonder it hit the top 40 in 1975.  Quite an achievement for such a left field player as FZ.  But it's all great music. No sell out.  It's excellent hard rock, fusion, comedy and a bit of classical, dancing in the pop world.  Like the best of FZ efforts there is somethinghere for everyone.  And it's only 42:58 !  Not one minute is wasted. <br /> <br />Highlights:  Inca Roads.  Not only one of FZ's most beautiful melodies but contains one of his greatest guitar solos interspliced from a live concert in Helsinki. Brilliant.  For me, there aren't many rock guitarist who can sustain such an inventive electric solo over 7 minutes.  It's so melodic you can practically whistle it verbatim. It's supported by Chester Thompson's tasty funk driven drumming, Ruth Underwood's amazingly precise mallet playing and of course George Duke adding his genius to the keyboards and vocals.  The whole whirling flying saucer of a tune crashes into one of FZ's most harmonically complex rock songs where there is a modulation almost every measure.  Yet the melody is so concise and memorable it's completely listenable, wrapped around some of FZ's most socially conscious observations about the state of the union.  Can't Afford No Shoes indeed. The piece ends with a dashing maniac guitar meltdown that cuts off for a second and strikingly pushes us into classical rock at it's best.  It's Sofa No. 1.  A stoic little waltz played with panache and intricate precision.  It's such a strong piece it reprises itself as the last tune with lyrics that add to the already brilliant bizzareness.  Only Zappa. The piece doesn't seque.  You have a second to stop conducting and then it's minor blues time.  Po-jama People is FZ at his most sarcastic yet he doesn't take himself seriously and you can hear this in the outro chorus where the group is riffing off the basic hook.  Catchy number with a superb frenzied FZ solo joined by Duke's piano, Thompson's drums and Tom Fowlers bass.  Classic rock Zappa.  Next, (which used to be the start of side 2 on vinyl) The awesome \\"Florentine Pogen\\". Another Zappa classic.  A rhapsodic mini rock symphony with some of the strangest FZ lyrics.  The music is incredible here (recorded live no less at TV station KCET) with overdubbed vocals by Nappy Brock, Duke and FZ. Chester Thompson plays a tasty drum solo.  After all the bells and whistles we hear: Chester's gorilla - she goes quack...oink...moo...she go Haratche- platche etc...fade... More conceptual continuity for ya ass.  What could follow such an odd piece?  Where do you go when you spill out so much music?  Where?  Another multi layered piece?  Of course not.  FZ surprises us with \\"Evelyn A Modified Dog\\".  The esoteric tale of one of his pets over a beautiful harpsichord accompaniment. The perfect humorous release after the the intense Florentine.  FZ's voice doubled here sounds so commanding you have to listen to it. He ends with \\"Arf She Said!\\" Quick edit into \\"San Berdino\\", a manly redneck romp with FZ playing twisted slide guitar. Something about it reminds me of the Eagles guitar laden \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" which did not come out until 2 years later! Was this an influence?  Captain Beefheart injects his quirky harmonica playing through out and Johnny Guitar Watson does the best outro scouting on a rock record since McCartney's frenzy on \\"Hey, Jude\\"!  It ends with  \\"Bobby, I'm sorry you have a head like a potato - I really am\\"... Heh- heh... And then it's an awesome segue that really picks up the pace.  FZ takes it up a bunch of notches with this other worldly intro in \\"Andy\\".  A rhythmic masterpiece with Duke and Brock trading vocal sections. Tense snare drum rhythms against a beautiful melody played on an organ broken into a million pieces by FZ's nebula sounding guitar break. The piece just cooks.  It's angry but beautiful. Towards the end we're pumped with a slick drum break down with Johnny Guitar Watson spewing vocal craziness on top and the whole band chimes in and rocks. FZ flies up and down the fret board bringing us to an exhilarating conclusion which sort of just disintegrates with pure joy and laughter.  Just as we take a breath of relief so does George Duke who begins:  \\"I Am The Heaven\\"...  \\"It's Sofa No. 2\\".  This time with wordsin English and in German. It's a majestic hoot.  Such a fitting cap to what went before.  The waltz takes us for a three minute ride and then ends with a totally over the top black sounding absurdist line - \\"Yeah my sofa - Ya -ha -high!\\" <br /> <br />It's too good. For a young boy of 14 back in 1975 there was no rock album like this.  Nothing that could sustain my interest every step of the way for 42 minutes straight.  To me it was a mystery how it was done, how it was captured.  But it was expected.  FZ had, and continually produced some of the most entertaining records of the 20th century. This is one of them.  Timeless music.  Definitely a keeper in any serious progressive music lover's collection.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|dave mustaine and marty friedman have written not only good riffs but virtuosic solos as well the best solo is on ashes in your mouth where friedman has on then mustaine the they have a duet it may seem weird but its awesome this is a good megadeth album to start with i say that because this was my first megadth album
B0000026KQ|5.0|This is a great cd. Better than Wired, better than Blow by Blow, almost as good as Who Else. Bozzio is, as always inspired, and Jeff, as always, plays from the heart with the best technique on the planet, ever. Buy this.
B000002JNJ|5.0|this album is one of the greatest i own. i love pantera and they never come short of amazing on all their albums. dimebag darrells guitar work was mind bending. it really shot them from their glam metal days in the eighties. although on some songs phils voice still had times where he sounded like some cheap hair metal singer. all in all great album
B0000714BP|5.0|I hardly recommend this movie, you can see Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo and Wesley Snipes in drag, and it`s hilarious!!!!!  <br />Vida Boheme, Chichi Rodriguez and Naoxeme. Great performances. <br />Vida is an absolutely LADY! <br />One of the funniest films I`ve ever seen!  <br />They said that they were inspired by Julie Newman, they said \\"it`s so escultural\\" (or something like this)  <br />I didnt know she was Cat woman  <br />
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris does as good a job with this film as he did with The Thin Blue Line. Actually, it's better. He is perhaps the best documentary director I've ever seen. His choice of score composer in Philip Glass added to the whole mood of uncertainty and painful retrospect that made this movie an Oscar winner.<br /><br />I do, amazingly enough, and after watching this film FOUR TIMES already, have a slight beef with McNamara. He recalled rembering the parade in NYC when he was only two years old, the parade that culminated World War One. Yet, he can't remember if he gave the order for Agent Orange, a toxic chemical that stripped leaves off of trees but left thousands dead after Vietnam? Talk about selective memory.<br /><br />I felt Robert put most of the blame on others. Be it General LeMay in WW2, or LBJ in the Vietnam War. He doesn't hesitate to take credit when its warranted though, as he did with Ford Motor Company as its president or as he did with the Cold War Crisis in Cuba.<br /><br />Admittedly, Morris does a fine job of backing up most of McNamara's claims, making him guilty when he obviously was, and innocent when he blatantly is - as some audio files depict LBJ ignoring McNamara's lucid advice on gradually withdrawing from Vietnam.<br /><br />The film will likely change your position on Vietnam, or at least challenge it - as it did mine. It shook me deeply, and left me with a higher view of McNamara and a lower view of Johnson.<br /><br />A brilliant film, with or without the few cases of selective memory.
0451526384|5.0|Just what you'd expect from a Jane Austen novel.  Romance, suspense, jealousy, unrequited love, all of it.  By far one of the best books I've read since Pride and Prejudice.  Jane Austen's books really draw the reader into the story and cause the reader to empethize with the heroine.  She knows just how to tug at a person's heart strings through the plight of the main characters.  A wonderful book, and one that I will read again and again.
B000002U82|5.0|I had a ten-speed and lived on the edge of a little town called Olivette, Illinois.  My hair was long and it was a very hot summer when I walked into a head shop in Danville, Illinois.  It was in a basement area of Main Street and was lit by black lights and smelled of incense.  To the left was drug paraphernalia in a glass case and to the right was tye-died t shirts and then on the carpet in the middle of the floor were these stacks of square cardboard 12'' vinyl records.  I picked up a Status Quo record and then this cool looking black album with a triangle on it.  I went home and closed the door of my room, put on my heavy-duty KOSS headphones and the rest was history.<br /><br />Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town<br /><br />Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.<br /><br />It showed me the way all right.  I fell for Mr. Roger and Company's elegant art folk techno rock hook line and synthesizer.  I went through two copies of that album and when my English teacher asked me about what made Dark Side of the Moon so great, I went out a bought him a copy because I had a minor scratch on my latest copy.<br /><br />Those were the days when albums were ALBUMS.  They were thematic, mysterious, and obviously well thought out from first song to last.  They weren't put together stupidly like they are now where Artists are afraid their badly-produced studio efforts aren't good enough so they have to include \\"acoustic\\" or \\"live\\" versions right along with the studio drivel.  (You think Roger would have ever have included an \\"acoustic\\" version of Money at the end of this one?)<br /><br />Yes, the 70's were filled with pretentious, excessive musicians who actually believed way too much in their dime-store observations and two-bar dronings, and it was nothing but good to see Punk spit in the pompous faces of these hyenas, but for a brief moment in time back in 1973 an album struck a spark that would burn in the souls of millions for many years to come.<br /><br />And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear<br /><br />You shout and no one seems to hear.<br /><br />And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes<br /><br />I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.<br /><br />See you there....come.<br /><br />And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear<br /><br />You shout and no one seems to hear.<br /><br />And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes<br /><br />I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.<br /><br />See you there....
0671027344|5.0|The first time I noticed this book was when one of my classmates had it laying on their desk. The minute I read the title, I was intrigued. It took me awhile to get around to it, but finally I bought the book, and as soon as I received it, I began to read. This book has genuinely made me laugh out loud, and begin to cry silent tears. I can relate so much to the main character, Charlie, and his absolutely brilliant observations whilst living life as an observer. I truly believe that this might quite possibly be one of my favourite books of all time, though it is the last one I've read :) The true angst and pain that comes from Charlie's devastatingly succinct writing in his letters makes this novel all the more enrapturing and engaging. The philosophy of a teen wise beyond his years radiates from each intimate entry of the novel, and subjects that all of us can relate to are a constant throughout the book. I cannot express how deeply this novel has moved me; it is unforgettable and truly haunting. I beg you, if you have ever considered yourself shy and reserved, please consider this book. It is one that has had a profound impact upon my perspective, and one I will always cherish as a true novel about growing up.
6304708491|5.0|I completely loved this film! I laughed so much! The plot was really weird, but that was something that made it even more fun! And those who doesn't see that have watched a film in their wrong genre, end of. If you like the Beatles music and the charming Beatles boys, this is something you're gonna like! Perfect on a rainy day when you have nothing to do. Unfortunately I haven't seen \\"A hard day's night\\", but after've seen \\"Help!\\" I definitely want to see that one too.
B00028HBKM|1.0|From the stand point of cinematography this movie has some spectacular scenes. Also putting it all in dead languages is a nice touch. However the plot is quite bad. The movies is basically the brutal touchier of a man for hours on end. That is not entertainment it is a kind of punishment. One goes to a Hollywood Blockbuster to be entertained. To watch a fight or hear a joke, see special effects, watch a love story develops from hate to true love. While I could be argued that this movie does have a love story because of some peoples god love for all people. From a story stand point though it is predictable and uneventful even for one who has not read the bible. I know many people disagree with this and some may accuse me of religion bashing but this is how I feel and I do not want your pity or for you to pray just try to consider a view of this movie other then your own.
B00005A46T|4.0|slipknot have now released 3 major albums, IOWA being the middle one.  <br /> <br />it is good, quite good in fact, but does not contain those ever so famous and catchy songs such as \\"wait and bleed\\" \\"spit it out\\" \\"diluted\\" and \\"eyeless\\". it does however, come with great tunes like \\"left behind\\" \\"the heretic anthem\\" \\"my plague\\" and of course, everyone's favourite sing-along song \\"people=sh*t\\" <br /> <br />music wise, i have no real problems with it. most of the songs are tight and as always with joey, the drumming is fantastic. corey's voice is just as good as on the previous release and all songs keep to a heavy pattern. the only downside of this album (why i only gave it 4 stars) is the fact that it contains some boring and useless songs.  <br /> <br />\\"515\\" is an interesting intro, but it's not like you would listen to it again and again.  <br />for the first half of \\"disasterpieces\\" you get to hear the worst chorus ever thought up, but luckily the song changes into something much more listenable. <br />\\"the heretic anthem\\" is one of those songs that you can listen to time after time and not get sick of it. the line \\"if you're 555 then im 666\\" will be forever bedded in your head. <br />\\"left behind\\" is the 'popular' song from the album, with its catchy and unforgettable chorus. <br />\\"i am hated\\" might have a lame title to it, but the song doesn't let down. the verses are fast, as with the song. <br />the longer track \\"skin ticket\\" is structured differently to the rest, but still as good as most songs on the album. it starts off slow but gradually gets heavier and invites more screaming. <br />the next couple of tracks are just good to listen to, nothing amazing, yet nothing terrible. <br />i generally don't listen to the last song \\"iowa\\". 15 minutes is too long for one song and the track feels all-over-the-place. <br /> <br />if you are new to slipknot, i suggest their first release, but this album does not disappoint, at all. <br /> <br />...and to those metalheads who like in flames, soilwork, dark tranquility and whatnot, who bag slipknot day after day, i tell you that slipknot are more talented than what you make them out to be. don't get me wrong though, im no nu-metal fanatic, i too love DT, in flames and many other bands from genres such as power/prog metal, christian metal, melodic death, gothic, hardcore/metalcore and even just plain rock.
0812550706|4.0|i would like to first say that i am not a sci-fi fan. I am in love with fantasy and always will be.  <br /> <br />But recently i read farenheit 451 and fell in love with human rebellion and human freedom. I went from Farenheit to 1984 then to Atlas Shrugged. My english teacher saw my love in these books and decided to have the class read Ender's game.  <br /> <br />My first thought was \\"what an immature book\\" and  \\"just another star wars\\" (nothing against star wars or anything). Then i read the first chapter and felt the beautiful balance of action and meaning. It was the best book i had read in school.  <br /> <br />I was not the only one who fell in love with this book. Every one in my class could relate to the kids in the Battle school if not the experiences. We even had a mock trial and my group was the prosecution of Ender on counts of murder, which was impossible if i might add. But to say the least every one from every group found this book to be amazing.  <br /> <br />I will critic that the characters seemed almost all alike. Valentine was like Petra, Dink, Ali, Graff(in a way). Bean and \\"the last teacher\\" were like Ender. All the bullies were alike. Then there was Peter, who was like a force of evil instead of a human.  <br /> <br />The story was wonderful though and the writing was beautiful. I try to mimic how he can combine first and third person points of view. Much of it was phscology and how a genius child has to struggle so much in his head and in reality. It is like creating a whole other race of beings (well not including the Buggers)  <br /> <br />As i said before it was an amazing action book, but it also had certain facts in it that easily linked it to the great works of George Orwell and Andrew Huxley. It was amazing and i belive i will not come across another like it.  <br /> <br />no wonder it got such amazing awards! It can truly be read by anyone!
B0009X1SKY|4.0|This is a 1951 Met performance of the Ring with an impressive cast.  The sound quality varies from one CD to the next (there are 11 CDs in all).  Ferdinand Franz is excellent as Wotan.  Kirsten Flagstad appears as Brunhilde in Die Walure and give a decent, though not exciting, performance.  Helen Traubel as Brunhilde in Gotterdamerung is wonderful.  Her rendition of the immmolation of Brunhilde is quite moving and very well acted as well as sung.  The conducting by Stiedry is lackluster.  Set Svanholm as Siegfried does a great job and was a pleasant surprise since I had not heard him perform previously.  I also enjoyed the singing of Deszo Ernster as Hagen and as Fafner -- very well done.
B0007P3582|3.0|Okay as a man who lives in the bronx(New york)  i have to deal with thugs and wannabes blastin this cd in their cars and i got basically sick of this album before i even listened to it.Well i borrowed this cd from a friend and i gave it an honest listen before judging it as a piece of crap like most of you morons who give one star reviews on image alone.I learned alot of things from listening to this cd. <br />1- I am now a gun expert knowing almost every type of gun. <br />2-Dont visit southside jamaica queens because the people are \\"grimey\\" <br />3-Dont play dice with 50 cent. <br />4-Dont mess with shady. <br />5-Feds are called jakes <br />6-50 has alot of \\"paper\\" <br />7-50 had sex with most of hollywood. <br />8-50 who is supposely rich still blasts his tech 9 in the hood. <br />and alot of other things. <br />The production also on this cd is very average. <br />The part i most enjoyed on this cd was the bridge/breakdown at the end of \\"ski mask way\\".Hi-tek gives a good beat on \\"get in my car\\"and Scott Storch is becoming a household name with beats on candyshop, just a lil bit, and build you up.So to wrap it up most of this cd is about drugs(HELL on \\"Balitimore Love thing\\" 50 cent talks as if he is the actual drug of herion)Guns for ex on songs\\"in my hood\\" \\"this is 50\\" \\"guns come out\\". And he gets soft for the ladies on \\"candyshop\\" \\"just a lil bit\\" \\"build you up\\" and the very soft \\"so amazing\\" featuring olivia.Eminem drops by on \\"gatman and robbin\\" and drops beats for \\"im supposed to die tonight\\", \\"gatman and robbin\\" and \\"my toy soldier\\"While only 2 DRE produced tracks in \\"outta control\\" and \\"guns come out\\". I really dont know what to say if to buy or not buy this cd it all depends on your taste and how much you can take.
B000005DSN|5.0|Visions re-defined the sound of 90's Power Metal. One of the greatest albums in this genre and the one that inspired many forthcoming bands, and sadly yes, copied by so many bands nowadays. Visions totally blew my mind when I first heard it and \\"Kiss of Judas\\" is still one of my very favourites with unbelievably haunting melody and superb guitar solo and drumming. Other great songs are \\"Black Diamond\\" (or is it \\"Live Diamond\\", heh), atmospheric \\"The Abyss of Your Eyes\\", catchy \\"Paradise\\" and beautiful \\"Coming Home\\". I've always liked more of mid-tempo and emotional Stratovarius songs over those speedy ones.    I still rank Episode a little higher than Visions, because it was more emotional and humble effort with better lyrics. Visions is somewhat easier and slightly more commercial than previous albums. Still, all Strato albums following this one feel more or less insignificant and I think Stratovarius will never achieve the same sheer power of Visions. It's almost perfect album when it comes into this kind of music. Recommended!
B0000X61VE|3.0|...on her other 2 fitness dvds. here, on her first workout dvd, cindy's lithe, long, limber body speedily sways and swoops like a slinky! her royal gorgeousness is shown alternately working out on a beautiful beach and a not-so-beautiful warehouse. while watching (and admiring) cindy, i figured out that doing full sit-ups, reverse crunches that bring the legs all the way down to the ground then back up, and full body rolls, is probably not safe for my lower-back; lunging at high-speed could probably hurt my knees; and racing through 30 \\"girl\\" push-ups and doing free (light)weight reps faster than i can blink is only getting my heart-rate up. but i quickly modified cindy's moves and customized them to benefit me: instead of sit-ups i do crunches; i don't lower my legs to the floor on the reverse crunches; i don't lift my whole upper body off the mat on the rolls; i lunge slowly maintaining proper form; i do fewer, slower \\"boy\\" push-ups; and half the reps with twice the weight on the arms. in general, i do half the repetitions on all the exercises to really \\"feel the burn.\\" for me, rushing through the reps might be good for cardio, but that's about it. besides, you could hurt yourself. but then i look at cindy and figure that she's doing something right.
B000001G16|5.0|That sounds grandiose, but it isn't for this CD.  Stranger in this Town is a masterpiece.  It flows. It is high art. Richie's guitar is weeping, sighing, shouting, ripping, slamming, scorching, shredding, blazing and simply out of this world. Vocally, at times he sounds like Robert Plant, and other times he sounds like an ancient soul reaching in to you where you live.      As a professional musician myself I love the many subtle ways his strings are reverbed and at times makes you feel like you are in outer space with the resonant reflections. The layering of this mix with all the tools of magic used in recording studios is immaculate. I love the artistic treats scattered here and there that amp up the glitter. Do yourself a favor and listen to it the first time with digital headphones. It is a whole different world than listening through room amps.    \\"Stranger in this Town\\" is dazzling.     I feel at times like I am seeing sound painting with the way Richie sculpts his sounds. His music is very visual. Wait til you hear \\"Father Time\\" it will dig deeeep into your soul. My visual was Dali's melting clock with this wrenching piece.    Richie's CD is a true Masterpiece. It never overwhelms yet is continually evolving like a kalaidoscope of sound morphing into ever fascinating patterns, rhythms, perceptions, moods. Like a fine, rare vintage of, pick your pleasure, his music pleasures the ears. I'm smiling.     Check him out on Bo Bice's hit single \\"Vehicle\\".  Richie scores again.  Incredible work.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This album will always be compared to the one that came before it.  But it shouldn't be. <br /> <br />Maiden are in good form here and there is a freshness to their sound. <br /> <br />The best cuts are the title track and Paschendale.  The chorus on No More Lies kind of ruins the mood a little (comes in too heavy too soon) and Montsegur rams the point a home a little too many times. <br /> <br />At times they are teetering on becoming a little too Spinal Tappish (I could almost see the Leprachauns dancing around stonehenge on the title track)- But - and this is the importnat point - Iron Maiden are in on the little joke - there's some humour here about what they are doing - and dare I say - a lightness of touch, like they're not taking themselves too seriously.  And that's what makes this CD enjoyable. They sound like they're having fun. <br /> <br />
B00082IJ08|4.0|Demon Days improves on Gorillaz'sself-titled debut from 2001 with its ultra-funky and hippy sound track. Untypical of what Damon Albarn has done with Blur, Demon Days is more than an extension of their 2001 effort.<br /><br />Though titles like Every Planet We Reach Is Dead, Kids With Guns and Last Living Souls aren't exactly cheery, the album has its fair share of great vibes and grooves. The most outstanding track for me would be Don't Lose Your Way In Heaven, a I-Like-To-Teach- The-World-To-Sing, shake-your-head kind of song followed by the equally uplifting title track backed by a gospel choir. First single Feel Good Inc. robes in 80's soulster De La Soul for an uber-funky track that's bound to make you shake to the infectious beat. Dirty Harry brings in a children's choir and fuses it with rapping by Bootie Brown to great groove.<br /><br />A fantastic album.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|OV is getting better... it's not as bad as their previous 5 studio albums! In my opinion this band hasn't been truly good since Kevin Moore left!  I can't stand Jordan Rudess.  I hate the albums where they overplay just for the sake of it. It's like geez.. WE KNOW you're accomplished musicians but PLEASE focus on writing GOOD material and not just showing off your chops and endless guitar noodling - that pisses me off!  This is why bands like Kansas, Saga, Yes, and Rush have always been far better than DT, because those bands consistetly write great lyrics and the music isn't overblown just for the sake of it.  When Dream and Day Unite and Images And Words are the only 2 albums that I truly LOVE from this band.  I follow what they release but I haven't been happy since.

The tail...., the whole damn thing.\\"<br /><br />- Captain Quint gives a hint at what will be the daily special at the Amity Fish Market the day after he catches \\"Jaws\\"<br /><br />Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, \\"Jaws\\" has the small coastal community of Amity under siege by a great white shark feeding off of swimmers, & boaters alike. Its up to the town's Chief Of Police (who's afraid of the water), an ictheoligst, & a modernday Ahab to take down the shark.<br /><br />First off, I will always give \\"Jaws\\" its much deserved five star rating (hence the rating above). Its still, after thirty years, one of Steven Spielberg's best films.<br /><br />What I don't condone is what \\"Universal\\" & for that matter, all home video companies are doing with there titles. Basically, taking great movies and releasing them every other year, on DVD, in different packaging, telling the consumer of the new features when their aren't any. It sucks, its false advertising, & its some sort of prostitution. As a consumer & film buff this is bulls*it, plain and simple (the latest release to \\"First Blood\\" is also a good example).<br /><br />The new 30th Anninversary two disc release to \\"Jaws\\" should have been retitled \\"Flaws\\" because \\"Universal\\" can't seem to get all the material on one film together in a definitive & final edition.<br /><br />Disc one has the film in all its glory with the exact same \\"interactive\\" menu from the 25th anniversary edition. All the audio tracks are here with Dolby Digital 5.1, 2.0 Mono (people actually wanted this!), & DTS 5.1 (the DTS track was sold seperatly last time. Assinine, right?). The film is the same transfer as the previous release & still looks good.<br /><br />Disc two is where the real problems lie. The menu isn't \\"interactive\\" (no movement at all) with the sound of the ocean & seagulls playing on the audio track (this is really cheesy).<br /><br />The complete unabridged documentary is finally released & it is good. The problem here, is that the documentary is from the 1995 special edition laserdisc release to \\"Jaws\\". Thats right this documentary is ten f*c*ing years old! This is pathetic, because at the recent \\"Jaws-fest\\", to celebrate the film, Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, & others gave interviews during the festivities, & they look different then they did 15 years ago.  The deleted scenes are included & are the same as the previous release. The trailers & the trivia game are gone (these were cool features, & I truly can't understand why they were omitted).<br /><br />The new nine minute featurette that was newly discovered in England is nothing to write home about, but, I think, this is the only behind the scenes footage that might exist to \\"Jaws\\".<br /><br />The packaging is even the same as the 25th anniversary release with a few changes. The slipsleeve & coverart has a black foreground & has a photo-journal that contains photos & quotes from the film. The artwork isn't even the same as the artwork from the classic one-sheet to \\"Jaws\\".<br /><br />If you don't have this in your DVD collection, get the 25th Anniversary Edition. That has a bit more bite to it. As for this edition, stay away from these waters.dged documentary is finally released & it is good.

B000002UAX|5.0|ok this is ridiculous. how can amazon have a spotlight review that gives this album a meagre 4 stars. what an abomination! how dear anyone traduce the beatles with that score? the beatles should never be exposed to slander. rather, every review should be brimming with servile blandishment. flattery is what they deserve. are you kidding me? this album is one of the best ever in rock history and has been aped over and over again by practically every alternative band that has ever existed. the most hilarious part is that they never even come close to touching the brilliance of this album. they are mere adjunct to the superior original. despite the propinquity they aspire to, few actually attain that kinship or nearness. really, the beatles are/were on another level. unless they now suffer from dotage, anyone alive during this period could tell you how they remember the cultural impact of the beatles. how the beatles would attract these obstreperous crowds that were noisy and uncontrollable. some people might say it was the closest we ever came to Shangri-la. yeah, it's an exaggeration, cause we all know that an imaginary lost paradise is unattainable. still, everything since has been a poor imitation. why settle for less, when you can have the beatles? <br />now for all of you who think the beatles are old people's music that maybe you hippie parents listen to, wake up! you don't not read catcher in the rye (damn mark david chapman!) because your parents might have read it. some works are timeless and this is one of them.  <br />i'll warn you - this album requires sedulous listening. you just have to pay attention to get the most out of this album. i'd even go so far as to say this album has magicial powers. in some of the lesser-developed countries they use it as a panacea. of course, we in the states are a little more advanced. we recognize that there is no such thing as a remedy for all diseases. among some tribes, this album is a vital component of mating rituals.for some reason, it has been know to arouse the prurient desires often necessary for copulation. that is also why it has also been blamed for turning some men into philanderers. apparently, this establishes a tenuous link been excessive lustful desires and infidelity. some men have been known to betray the trust of an inamorata, simply because they became obsessed with the white album. and finally, i needn't mention how that complete retard charles manson went on a killing spree inspired by some songs on this record. after listening to the songs in question i could not imagine how a person could be dumb enough to miscontrue any of the lyrics. i hate charles manson and i hope he is executed some day for his boundless stupidity, which, no doubt, helped put an end to one of the most wonderful decades in the history of humanity. <br />i'll move on to a few comments on my favorite songs. \\"savoy truffle\\" is such a smart ass song by lennon and directed at eric clapton's chocolate fetish. who would ever think to write a song about such a thing? it's hilarious! also, we've got \\"sexy sadie\\" on this album too. it's another smart ass song by lennon. this time it's directed at one of those silly guru frauds the beatles visited. you know, the ones that thrive on verisimilitude. you know, they all have the appearance of truth. this guru in particular was making sexual advances as a the teenage sister of one of the stars the beatles were traveling with. lennon really sticks it to him on this song. the songs just fulminates with denunctions. really, i could go on forever about this album - it's just that good! so, do us all a favor and let's stop dissimulating that the beatles are not the best band ever. it's no figment of the imagination, there is no need to pretend. if this continues, i'll be forced to engage in a disquisition of the matter. if i can't do it myself, i'll devolve the responsibilty to someone else. still, no one wants to see that formal systematic inquiry take place. i'm not a choleric person, i assure you. i am almost never ill-tempered or irritable. i am wont to be calm and contemplative most of the time. it's just become my custom. i must say i think i'd make a good potentate. though, i have no aspirations to become a monarch or sovereign.   <br /> <br />

B0009ML238|3.0|Yes these guys can play, but there is little here separating Circus Maximus apart from the hordes of Dream Theater and Symphony X clones out there.  I'm at the point when I purchase a progressive metal album where I want something new and original: Ark Burn the Sun, Redemption The Fullness of Time, Extol Synergy, Andromeda II=I, Zero Hour The Towers of Avarice.  I was really hoping The 1st Chapter was going to be something a bit more original, but after many spins it's nothing more than an amalgam of Dream Theater and Symphony X, and no it's not a covert rip-off, it's blatant theft!  You can take Symphony X's The Odyssey and any one of Dream Theater's albums and literally match up many of the melodies and arrangements with The 1st Chapter.  This is not a coincidence.  There are many bands that do the same thing, but for some reason Circus Maximus is getting praised for it.  Maybe it's because they are young and from Norway, but I'm baffled by the many people salivating for these rip off bands taking material from other bands, mixing it up a bit and throwing a different vocalist in the mix.  For Christ's sake, do something original!!!!!  If I want to listen to Symphony X or Dream Theater, then I'll listen to one of either band's amazing albums!  But that does bring me to the vocalist.  In my humble opinion, Circus Maximus' vocalist is exceptional, and yes, to the bands credit, they did write four songs (Sin, Alive, Why Am I Here and Glory of the Empire), granted they are hardly original in sound, that really accentuate his voice amazingly.  In fact, the only reason I even keep listening to this album in any capacity is because of these songs and the vocalist.  Guys, for this I'm giving your album three stars (2.5 to be exact), but I really hope you all come into your own on the next release.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|One of the sickest albums of the year. EASY. I have all the avenged cd's and this one BLEW MY FRICKIN MIND. Im a fan of metal AND hardcore, and this cd is one of the best. <br /> <br />The CD hasnt left my cd player since i bought it the day it came out. Seriously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, this thing is playin. <br /> <br />If you like metal...iron maiden, guns n roses, ANYTHING, get this album.  <br /> <br />You wont be dissapointed. <br /> <br />I would do a detailed breakdown of each song but id be writing all night. <br /> <br />I cant even pick out the best tracks, because id be listing the whole cd basically.

B000002MP2|5.0|If you don't own this record yet, you should!     Green Day's \\"Dookie\\" is a punk rock classic, and a must-have for anyone's collection. It's very simple, three chord bratty punk rock in the vein of the Ramones, given a bit of a 1990s recording studio sheen.  Dookie was the album that put Green Day on America's radar with hit singles \\"Longview\\", \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", \\"Basket Case\\", \\"When I Come Around\\", and \\"She\\" (not to mention nine other single-worthy songs) and spawned countless imitators. Each song is brimming with irreverance and backed by extremely catchy hooks - all of which sound just as fresh and invigorating now as they did ten years ago when the album was originally released.  Before their complex rock opera masterpiece \\"American Idiot\\", there was the straight-forward, turbulent Dookie.      More than 14 million copies of this record were sold and with good reason: it's darn good and darn good fun. Essential listening for anyone.
B00006X06U|2.0|She ransacked her music, turning it into kitsch more adroitly than most hack cover-artists could have done.  Wasn't anyone around to tell Joni that less is more?  The best thing are her paintings, reproduced in the insert.  They are spare.  The musical arrangements are unbelievably pretentious and self-indulgent.  The lapse of her characteristic taste is astonishing.  For that reason, the CD has some interest, perverse interest.  This is a side of Joni that maybe we really didn't want to know about. Unlike what some people say about her music in her early singer-songwriter days, this recording really is embarrasing to listen to.  Graceful retirement, please.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just pulled this set out and watched it all again cause it had been awhile since i saw it.Forget Saving Private Ryan,forget all other war movies for that matter,no 2 hour movie can capture the true feeling of what it must have been like to be there like this mini series does.I am not even really a war movie fan or anything probably mostly because of failed attempts by many movies to really drive home the point of how it must have been to actually be there and experience what the soldiers went through in WW 2.Band of Brothers is special because many things right down to the dialouge is used by actual accounts of the veterans who were actually there.The actors were great at bringing it all to life,they made you feel for them and at times make you believe they were the actual soldiers there rather then just guys protraying them.The way they shot the film really fits the mood and the era that the actual war took place.Its not black and white or anything like that but you'll have to see for yourself to understand what i mean.If you have a surround sound system  it really enhances the experience as it feels like the war is happening right in your living room.The great sound doesn't just end with the sound of artillery,even just the music they use during opening of each episode,everything just somehow fits perfect like a puzzle.Normally i wouldn't spend no 80 bucks on some DVDs even for like a whole season of a favorite show,but i have no regrets buying this set at all.Its probably not just my favorite war mini series but probably my favorite movie/mini series ever.Im sure i'll watch it all again numerous times,it never gets old for me.
B000002KO1|5.0|Chrissie Hynde and her Pretenders blaze like red hot demons in this scintillating cocktail of new wave and punk rock ecstacy.  <br />Chrissie is all attitude drenched in unadulterated palpitating savory lust.   <br />She huffs and puffs and purrs like a ravenous sex kitten then proceeds to rock you with the ferocity of a sabre toothed tiger. <br />\\"Precious\\" opens up the festivities with a blast as it pounds away fearlessly with a stiff middle finger proudly held high in the air and \\"Tatooed love boys\\" chugs away like a hell bound punk train on steroids. <br />\\"Mystery achievement\\" is pure uninhibited off the chain rock n' roll anthem glory blended with a smokin' sexy rhythm and blues groove that climaxes with a thrilling guitar drum dual workout. <br />\\"Pretenders\\" can also dish out the soft touch as heard in the gentle yearning \\"Kid\\" and in their sensitive rendition of the Kinks classic \\"Stop your Sobbing\\". <br />The top 40 breakthru hit \\"Brass in pocket\\" rounds out this rock n' roll classic as it exhibits Chrissie in full sexy siren mode with a sprinkle of vulnerability pleading hungrily that \\"I'm special, i got to have some of your attention...give it to me!\\"  <br />Sounds like an offer that's hard to refuse. <br />Go ahead and give it to her.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The soundtrack to the Oscar winning \\"Chicago\\" is one of those you can listen to all the way through and feel satisfyed when the last track finishes. Track eleven, \\"Class\\", is a hidden gem that should have made it into the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah belt out a haunting ballad of dispare and unsatisfaction. Although the track is littered with swears, it's great nonetheless. Every track is a stand-out with the exception of the final two. These songs were not in the movie, but were instead \\"inspired\\" by the movie. They were sung by main-stream artists, along with Queen Latifah. These seem like an attempt to make the soundtrack appeal to more people, but they just end up cheapening the other tracks in the process. My personal favorite is \\"Cell Block Tango\\". Overall, a very good soundtrack, with the exception of the final two tracks.
B000274THQ|5.0|As Goodbye Lenin opens, we learn that Christiane Kerner is a mother of two children, Alexander and Ariane, living in East Berlin in 1978.  Following the flight of her husband to the West for another woman, she focuses on raising her children and being a dedicated German socialist.  In other words, she becomes the bride of East Germany, being a teacher and helping dictate letters of complaint.<br /><br />Eleven years later, on the eve of a demonstration in October 1989, she sees her son Alex being arrested, and collapses from a heart attack.  However, she ends up in a coma due to her not being resuscitated in time.  When she wakes up eight months later, she is in for a surprise...<br /><br />Or at least that would've been the case.  Under orders from the doctor, to keep her from anything stressful or exciting lest she suffer a second and ultimately fatal heart attack, Alex, with the aid of his new West German friend Denis Domaschke, with whom he works flogging off satellite dishes in the newly liberated East Germany, contrives to make sure that in her eyes, nothing has changed.  This means restoring her bedroom back the way it was, furnishings and all, with no radio and TV.<br /><br />This becomes a vehicle for Denis, who aspires to be a feature film director, to edit some news footage and himself as news anchor, for the East German news videos for Christiane's eyes only.  When Christiane accidentally catches sight of a Coca Cola banner outside her window, Denis comes up with a propaganda news broadcast that it was actually East Germany that had invented Coca Cola!  This is just a series of well-meaning lies Alex constructs to keep his mother alive, to the consternation of Ariane, who is put out with the inconvenience of having to live back into a Stalinist East Germany by choice after having a taste of real freedom.  He also tries to get a few of his mother's old colleagues to go along with the farce, not to mention paying off some kids to dress up like the Young Pioneers, the communist youth, and sing communist songs to his mother.<br /><br />Yet while Christiane has been sleeping like Rip Van Winkle, she misses the resignation of General Secretary Erich Honecker, the collapse of the Wall, which led to a \\"unique recycling project,\\" her son's newly found liberation, such as going to the West, and meeting Lara, a beautiful Russian student nurse.  Ariane, in the meantime, drops out of college to become part of \\"economic circulation,\\" translation:  \\"thank you for choosing Burger King.\\"  She herself finds a new flame, her co-worker Rainer.  The country itself becomes transformed, its supermarkets into \\"gaudy consumer paradises, where the consumer was king,\\" and in addition to Germany being the center of world attention, the country's victories in the World Cup adds to the excitement, where West Germany eventually beat Argentina 1-0 in the finals.  So when Alex goes to the supermarket to find Spreewald pickles and Mocca Fix Gold coffee, he's SOL.<br /><br />Speaking of music, if the piano during the scene when Christiane is being taken to the countryside is familiar, it's because it's by Yann Tiersen, who did the music for Amelie.  In fact it's the same music used in the open title sequence of Amelie!  What was that earlier about recycling?<br /><br />It's apparent that the old East Germany before the wall is symbolized by the well-meaning Christiane, and the new liberated East Germany, soon to be unified Germany on 3 October 1990, by Alex, Ariane, and Lara, for whom the future is bright.  But along with capitalism comes higher crime, greed, and decadent entertainment the likes of which had never seen the light of day since Weimar Germany.

B00005JNJT|5.0|You have to at least like Batman to enjoy this, but if you hated the other Batman movies, you might enjoy this one. The story is intriguing with a few really good surprises. The action and dialogue is all directed toward advancing the plot and there is very little in the gratuitous eye-candy department - just enough special effects to pull the audience in.<br /><br />The theme of fear is powerfully developed in the movie in Bruce's character development. He uses his fear of bats, something we discovered in the first minutes of the film, to strike fear in the hearts of criminals. A minor theme placed in opposition to fear is that of hope - the good people of Gotham have hope in the face of the troubles of the city while the villians wish to use fear to destroy the city as a kind of \\"cleansing process\\".<br /><br />This film is incredibly casted and directed. I never would have believed Liam Neeson could do such a job in that type of role. Also I didn't even realize that Gordon was played by Gary Oldman until the end of the film. I wished we could have seen a little bit more of Morgan Freeman who was perfect as always in the role of a genius scientist who designs all of Batman's gadgets. But even amid these greats Christian Bale steals the movie with the most convincing Batman yet - brooding yet driven to action, living a dual existence yet focused in his mission.<br /><br />The friendship and tension between Bruce and Alfred, well-acted by Michael Caine, are both portrayed well as we are shown Bruce's coming of age as a rich orphan. His self-disdain and self-acceptance as an heir to a fortune are realistically demonstrated as part of the overall character development. If I have any complaint about the movie I'd say Katie Holmes performance, although passable, is somewhat ancillary to the rest of the plot and the film can't \\"decide\\" whether she is a heroine who can take care of herself with an electric stun gun or the obligatory female victim for the hero to save from danger.from danger.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|If you're interested in independent films that provide something more than the typical blockbuster fanfare, this film is for you.  The things I heard about the film before the theatrical release were:  Christian Bale was in it, he lost some 60 lbs, and it was about a man who hadn't slept in a year.  That was all I needed and it's all you need in order to spark a desire to watch the film.  Don't spoil the plot for yourself by reading too much about it.  Enjoy!

0451526384|5.0|Sometimes there's nothing better than settling in with an old favorite.  Austen's Persuasion is a story of rediscovering what is lost.  More than lost, what was let go.  With her apt view of society of the day, the story still bears out all these years later.
B0002UOK04|5.0|The vocalist returns to bring total mayhem.  There is still some folk injected, but not as much as Ensiferum's stuff.  It's highly melodic, most definitely melodic death.  If you are into Finnish metal as well as Swedish, you need to get this.
B000929AJQ|5.0|However, if you understand that good musicians evolve and change, then pick up \\"With Teeth.\\"  The first thing to note is that this album doesn't sound like Pretty Hate Machine or The Downward Spiral.  Those albums are over a decade old and people should quit complaining because this album doesn't sound like NIN's older stuff.  People change.  Music changes.  Do you think the Beatles would have stayed so popular if they had kept cranking out albums that sounded exactly the same as their previous album?  Get over it.  You can't stay in a whiny high-school mindset forever. <br />It's good to see Trent try something new.  This album isn't as layered or melodic.  Where the Fragile had a tendency to wander around and get lost, With Teeth is stripped down, much more focused and gets straight to the point.  Dave Grohl lends his drumming talents to a few tracks which is quite pleasingly noticeable.  Lyrically, Trent delivers the same as before, with a little less darkness.  There are a few tracks that do sound like old NIN, such as \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\" or \\"All the Love in the World\\"  Then there is \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" which is definitely a more popish song than NIN has brought out before. <br />All in all, this is a great album.  Trent has certainly changed over time, and hopefully his music will continue to do the same.  But if you really need to hear someone crying about the same things over and over and over again, go listen to your Korn albums.
B00005JMX6|4.0|I wouldn't call it this generation's \\"Breakfast Club,\\" like another reviewer did here, just for the simple fact that they're two completely different movies. However, I would say that I really enjoyed this movie. So much so that I just want to hug it. It made me talk back to the movie with my gasps of \\"oh no!\\" and \\"hell yeah!\\" all the way through, which is pretty good in my standards.  <br /> <br />I went into this movie pretty hesitant, thinking it was going to be bad but I'm surprised, and kind of glad that I actually enjoyed it. It's a mix between the unrated version of \\"American Wedding\\" and any '80s movie. Not to mention Emile Hirsch is absolutely gorgeous as well Elisha Cuthbert. They make a great couple in the film. Sure you have some bad reviews here that make sense, but not enough to bring down the quality of this movie. It's absolutely great to watch. It's a fun movie with a lot of laughs and it's not for those who are too critical to know what a compliment is. It's basically a feel-good movie with a lot of left turns and enough memories in it to make you want to watch it again and again.
B00007BKVC|4.0|Great movie, but we can't find some of the \\"Extras\\" -- Glen Frey's music video \\"Part of Me, Part of You\\", story-board for chase scenes, etc.  Where are they???
0060930187|5.0|I bought this for some summer reading and was done within about a week cause it was so hard to put down. The book is really good at giving an inside look on how people dealing with depression or a mental health illness see the world. Would not recommend this to anyone who is depressed though.
B000002U82|5.0|Right now, Dark Side Of The Moon is my favourite album. It's more than just music, it is an experience. From the opening arpeggios in Breathe, I knew I had done the right thing by buying this album. <br /> <br />Throughout the album, from the relaxed opening of Breathe to the climatic ending in Eclipse, Roger Waters and David Gilmour sing about everyday life. But they are not singing about drugs, sex or rock n' roll, they sing about time, money and lunatics, adorning it with polished guitar solos and delicate percussion, and adding a bit of groove with the keyboards.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are some of the best I've heard, Time is a great song for thinking about your life, and Money, man, it's so true! Though the lyrics in Us And Them are a bit forced to the music, they have also got a deep meaning. <br /> <br />The lyrics alone would make a great book. But the music is great. As I mentioned, the band adorns the music with constant riffs and melodies. There are solos everywhere, the final part of the solo in Time is one of the best I've heard. Us And Them has got a great power in it. There are three and a half instrumentals in this album; On The Run is pretty repetitive, Great Gig In The Sky is, indeed, in the sky, the endless solo in Money has got a lot of rhythm and the guitar part in Any Colour You Like is really good.   <br /> <br />The album flows in no particular order as it enforces its concept, up to the point of Brain Damage, the lunatic song, which states, if your life gets screwed up, just disconnect and go into the Dark Side Of The Moon. That's what you've got to do to listen to this album, by the way. And when Brain Damage ends, we get one of my favourite tracks in the album: Eclipse. If it wasn't so short, it could be my favourite song ever. An anthem about everything you do, closing with those immortal lines:  <br /> <br />And everything under the sun is in tune <br />But the sun is eclipsed by the moon. <br /> <br />So true! An amazing follow-up toBrain Damage. Both a lyrical and musical masterpiece, Dark Side Of The Moon is an album you must listen to. The next album you buy, have it be this one. It will change your life, I promise. You won't regret it.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a fan. That being said, I don't think this is a classic. I reserve those titles for albums like \\"Thriller\\" and such that are recognized all over the world for being a great album. I still think this is a great album. I bought it when it first came out (after going to 3 stores because they were all sold out) and I have been listening ever since. The point of my review really isn't to talk about the CD, but to talk about all the people who are being negative.  <br />1. People complain that she screams: Hello, dumb arses, this is a Mariah record. Everyone knows what her trademark is. This is not new. If you don't want to hear her scream then don't buy the record or waste time and space on this message board complaining about it. Also, the same people that complained in the 90's that she belted too much are the same people that complained that she whispered too much in her more recent albums and are STILL complaining that she is too loud on this album. What the hell is she supposed to do? Maybe you people should look within and try to find a reason why you're always dissatisfied.  <br />2. Her voice/style has changed: Back in the day she was in the same category (but more popular) as people like Jon Secada, Celine Dion and Michael Bolton. Where are those people today? I know Celine is in Vegas, but I can't tell you what the other two are doing. The whole landscape of music has changed and people don't want to hear adult contemporary anymore. She had two choices, either adapt or fade into oblivion like everyone else. It took her and her fans awhile to adjust, but she has finally gotten the formula right. Her voice has aged and is a lot raspier now, but she has been singing for 15+ years. Your vocal cords would be tired too.  Despite this, she still sounds better than most people in pop today. And this change has happened with other artists. Listen to Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" and you hear Steve Tyler sounding more youthful and a lot lessraspy than he does now. But no one is talking trash about his voice. She needs to stop saying yes to every promotional opportunity and take a breather to rest her voice. The album is a huge success, so sit back on your tail and enjoy it! Emancipate yourself from working yourself to death!  <br />3. She's \\"sold out\\" by singing fluffy pop: There is a reason why pop music exists. It's for fun. It's for those times when you don't want to be all deep but just relax. Imagine a life where all you ate were vegetables and other stuff that's nutritious and never any fun things like pizza and hamburgers. Wouldn't it be dull? Exactly. You need both for more balance. If I want to hear social commentary I'll listen to System of a Down's new CD. But I don't want to hear that mess when I am just chillin and getting ready to go out and get some from my man. Also any one of you complainers would sell out in a heartbeat if you had the ability to. Let's see, you could be like every other average joe (like me) and spend all day stuck in a cube like a rat, trying hard to find reasons why not to stab yourself in the eye because of boredom (and live paycheck to paycheck), or you could go and jet set around the world and be able to buy and have anything you want. If singing derivate pop music is what gets me option two, then sign me up. Unfortunately, God decided he would bless me with a big chest, but not a big voice. <br />I'm done ranting now. Go out and get the CD. It really is good. <br /> <br />
B000024LML|5.0|dre should had kept his beats this the way snoop should still rap this way snoop dogg sucks but snoop doggy dogg is off the chain you got ta get this album you can lisen to this album all the way throo get this g 2 me piece.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD is a must have, especially if you are an Eagles fan. This is a two disc set with 30 songs and behind the scenes interviews, etc.<br /><br />This show is like having three shows in one. What I mean by this is the fact that not only do the Eagles perform their music as a band, but the DVD contains a great mix of Joe Walsh's solo work, Glenn Frey's solo work and Don Henley's solo work. So all their individual's hits are performed here as well.<br /><br />The concert itself is so well arranged. The band is at its peak, in its perfect element, and these guys are simply playing great music and having a great time doing what they do best. In fact, I would go so far as to say the band sounds better here than any other live performance I have heard them do in their 30 year career.<br /><br />All the music is well arranged in a great order of sequence. The band sounds very tight, very well harmonized vocally, etc. I could go on for pages on end about how wonderful I think this DVD is, but I will simply tell you to buy it, you will not regret it, in fact I bet if you take my advice and buy it, you will send me an e-mail and thank me for the recommendation. I highly recommend this DVD.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is an excellent album. I didn't take to it immediately but after 4 or 5 listens all the way through I warmed to it immensely. Bearing in mind the amount of stale, re-hashed rubbish being put out (For heaven's sake, Nelly singing over Spandau Ballet samples anyone?), then Coldplay's drive to continually push forward, innovate, grow, is something special. It takes longer for them to produce the material but that's true of many great artists and I'm pleased they take their time. The emotional connection that the lyrics, music and general tone make with so many people can be an uplifting, reassuring and ultimately inspiring experience and I for one think the music scene is infinitely better off with Coldplay there. Long may they continue.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|I was blown away by Persona. There is really no words to truly describe the haunting, poetic, and erotic mood, feeling, and plot of this entire film and it's two exemplary female characters. This is truly a visual feast, at times cringing, beautiful, haunting, sad, erotic, and at the end, profound. This is a film that will truly make you think. For instance, the boy in the beginning can symbolize two things: Elisabeth's neglected child, or Alma's unborn child. And of course, the most haunting scene in cinema is when Alma, dressed in the same black clothing as Elisabeth, talks about Elisabeth's neglection of motherhood and marriage, while to some degree she's talking about her own naive view on both of these topics. Then, at the end, both of their faces emerge, exemplifying the exploration of a psychoanalysis breaking into subtle madness! That scene will always remain in my mind, it's so haunting in a deep and profound way. This film truly has the immense emotion and intensity that is highly rare in movies today. The end is even just as profound when we are back at the scene with the boy watching a screen of what appears to be the face of Elisabeth (or Alma? Both?), but then the reel breaks apart, and then the light that was lit in the beginning of the film suddenly fades into darkness. If you want to watch a film that is not cliche and predictable, watch PERSONA. But beware, a film like this should be watched with an OPEN MIND. If you look at it too seriously, or not seriously enough, you won't get the point and will lose the purpose and the meaning that this film has represented. Truly a masterpiece of cinema.
B000000OSE|5.0|To call this album the band' greatest work is not a true statement.  Every album Guns N' Roses released is their greatest work.  Not one song from one record is an underachievement, (with the possible exception of \\"One in a Million\\" on GNR Lies, great song, unhealthy lyrics).  This album, and here I must agree with some of Amazon's other reviewers, is not simply part of a two album set, it stands out in its own right.  From the juggernaught opening \\"Right Next Door To Hell,\\" to the perinoia inducing finish \\"Coma,\\" UYI1 is a fire bomb of rock n' roll unmatched in anything that has come before it or after.  \\"Back of Bitch,\\" a classic break up song and a personal favorit, has some of the best guitar rifts and dark humored lyrics I've ever heard, and what makes it stand apart from the violent women hateing work of artists like Emenem is: 1) It's not rap, and 2) It has a sudulty to it.  Instead of screaming about how he's going to tie the bitch up and slit her throat, really tossing it all out there, W. Axl Rose does more of a hinting at the violence he wants to impose on whomever he's singing about.  It's more effective that way.    Classic MTV ballard \\"Novemeber Rain\\" is touching, but also has real bite, since it came not from some song-writer for hire, but straight from Axl's heart.  And the creative vibe between Axl and Izzy Stradlin is strongest on the album's second MTV ballard \\"Don't Cry.\\"    Of course Slash is one of the most powerful lead rock guitarists of his time, and all those who have heard him know what I'm talking about, so no need for details.  I'll let his work speak for itself.    Drummer Steven Adler was very good, but drummer Matt Sorum is a personal idol of mine, so when he joined up it just helped to elevate the band even further.  The smooth crack of his snar, his gut busting rolls over the tom toms, and his crash work rival that of Neil Peart (Rush).     Duff McKagan, one of the most versitil musicians in music history, (I don't think there's aninstrument made that he can't wail on), meshes with Sorum so well it is like they were made for each other, (a fact that is even more evident in their new band Velvet Revolver).    I am not a Beatles fan, or really a Paul McCartney fan in general, but the Gunner's do an excellent cover of his \\"Live and Let Die.\\"    This is a powerhouse album, one no true rocker should be without.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Im 37 and I was intoduced to Dream Theater in 1996 ever since that, that was all I would listen to. But every album they put out I like less.  What happened to the great fast guitar riffs and killer drums.  Keyboards and guitar running together note for note.  Come on guys,  I really hope anyone in DT reads this, get back to the awake, images and words material, or even the liquid tensions work.  I love all you guys I think that there is not one person in this world who is better than any of you guys on your instuments. Mike you are the best drummer in a long time and for years to come Im sure,  John Petrucci , the best guitarist I have ever heard and myung is totally awesome.  Rudess is I think the best I have every heard. But I think we are hearing more keyboard solos than guitar.  Should be guitars and keys .  I think this album is ok butI expected awole lot more from DT.  You guys every want an opinion on your material before release I will help.  Maybe they could get better on track if they would give up the side projects and stay with each other and create music.  They seen to be bringing in outside materials into the dt band which me and alot of others dont like,  And maybe control freak mike could sit back a little and let other people get some action.  Personally i think you guys should rethink this over and work together in the basement on 8-10 new songs and do a new album,  let this one go down the drain.  Never thought I would ever say this about DT but this album really bits. Now I have wasted 15 dollars and will have to wait another year or so for another album.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Tsk,Tsk, I have been reading the reviews (some of them very funny I might add) and it is amazing to see all the one star ratings. These seem to be coming from all the intelligent people who have actually listened to and analyzed the album for what it truly is(a total disgrace to rap) and not the fools who rush to give albumns 5 stars and such based on the artist's name or what they see on TV. This album to me is a really ridiculous effort by 50 cent. He must have used up all his brain power on the last cd to even put this trash on the market. I heard on MTV that he has plans to release this album with all new songs. Most likely more gangsta violence, gun totting, fake ja rule imitating singing and so on from him. Hope that one flops even worse. I used to like 50 cent when his Get rich or die trying came out but he has shown himself to be an arrogant prick who has no respect for other rappers who are far his superior(like Jadakiss and Nas). He pretends to be Tupac and he isn't even worthy of kissing Tupac's feet. I must agree with some of the other reviews that state that 50 cent should be shot for the 10th time then the world will be rid of his existence.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Radical and wonderful and exquisite!  A totally different take on the classic ballet in a powerful homoerotic dream world of powerful male swans, mother as madonna/whore, forbidden desire, lust and irresistable force.  Left me breathless.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This is a bit different from omst of the other nonsense rap that seems to be the norm coming out these days. Kanye actually has something significant to add on alot of his tracks unlike most of the crap u see on TV these days and his raps stimulate the mind. I like the following tracks best: All Falls Down, Spaceship, Jesus Walks, Get Em high, Slow Jams, School Spirit, Breathe in Breathe out, and Last Call. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the misses. Kanye West as many have said seems to be a bit too arrogant and ignorant. He even acknowledges this in the last track, Last Call. I especially don't like the way that he derides Academic learning. I am currently in University looking forward to earning my Bachelor's Degree and putting in hard work to get it so it is highly displeasing to hear him talk about college as a waste in his school spirits skits(even though the song itself is catchy I must admit). Just because he wasn't able to finish college himself gives him no right to mock those of us who can. Infact he looks very foolish doing it. Another point to note is that this album has an explicit lyrics sticker but WHY ARE SOME OF THE SONGS CENSORED? That's makes absolutely no sense at all. If I wanted no cursing, I would have bought the clean version. Some of the guest appearances work but not all. Jayz is totally useless on the Nver let me down track and by listening to that track , one can tell that around this time Jayz was losing whatever talent he had as Kanye easily outshines him in terms of lyrical content and flow. Hova is dead. Common's verse on Get em high didn't appeal to me either. Common seemed very off flow and didn't say much of anything on that track. very bad.Ludacris does nothing for the chorus of Breathe in/Out and he should not have even been considered to appear on this album. Kanye should not have put that workout plan song on here because it is totally ridiculous and offensive to women. But then again what rap isn't nowadays. First he talks abouthis girl in through the Wire but then talks about having sex with numerous hoes and PhD standing for pretty Huge D*ck.  He is confused. He is still alot beter than most of the garbage rap but he still has some way to go before he reaches the conscious level of Talib Kweli,Mos Def and others.
B00082IJ08|3.0|This is a really good album...if the first Gorillaz did not exist, then I would easily give this 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />But the problems is this: The first Gorillaz seemed like a true collaboration of artists who wanted to make something different...something hybrid...something cool. Dan the Automator, Del the Funkee Homosapien, Damon Albarn, and that chick from Cibo Matto...it was a crazy explosion.<br /><br />This time around, this album feels more like a solo effort from Damon Albarn.  As a matter of fact, if Damon had just released these songs under his name as a solo set, it would not make a difference, and I would like it just as much.<br /><br />Darker, yes.  The beats are...more mainstream.  Dangermouse has a more, contemporary/commerical style of producing, kind of like NERD (the Neptunes).  You could imagine a lot of these beats under...say, A Jay-Z or Ludicrous record.  Dan the Automator has a flair for the cinematic, while being able to keep a stranglehold on some real, make you wanna move hip-hop.  The difference is notable, and ultimately effects my opinion of this.<br /><br />It's still one of the better CD's released this year... if you're a HUGE Damon Albarn/Blur fan, don't be afraid to pick it up. If you like the first Gorillaz, you'll be able to enjoy this, but you might notice it's not quite the same.  I subtract 2 stars that would've made this a 5-star review: Minus one star for no Dan the Automator (boooo!) and minus a half star each for no Del The Funkee Homosapien and too much Damon on this one. lol.
B00008CLOA|4.0|I own the British SQ Quad and Japanese QS LP's of this classic album, and the Alan Parsons quad mix, used on both of these versions, is superior to the mix used on the SACD reissue. In fact, the QS record decodes perfectly when played through a Dolby Pro Logic II processor. The localization of sounds, although not quite as discrete as in the SACD, is clearly defined. The opening sequence of \\"Money\\" moves the sounds of the registers and change around the room in a figure 8 pattern; the SACD seems disjointed, and there are no sounds in the left front speaker until well into the cut. If this were to be a true reissue for surround update, the Alan Parsons mix should have been used. The sound quality of the SACD is otherwise superb.
0142004235|5.0|I enjoyed Steinbeck's big novel.  I once lived not far from Salinas and the feel of the land and people came back to me.   <br />     The characters seem to live soap opera lives, though this novel could not have been faithfully filmed in 1952.  Some of the language seems orotund, but Steinbeck is careful to put such talk in the mouths of exceptional \\"characters,\\" purposefully stylized to carry the novel's ideas.  (I wish I knew men like Samuel and Lee.) <br />     Steinbeck's prose rarely draws attention to itself.  You keep turning the pages because of the couplings, shootings, deaths and inspirations over three generations.  I am uncertain if the casual style is to his credit.  I think the book could have been better written, yet kept its commonplace language.  But, how much can you change something before a new essence is created? <br /> <br />     That question goes to the heart of this book.  From the outset you know this work is highly ambitious.  Genesis contributes symbols and nudges themes.  For most of my life, I have brooded over events and tried to track down their causes.  Are things pre-ordained or is volition real?  Do people have an immutable nature or does the warp and woof of becoming change their being?  This argument continues to rage and one can find it beneath many disputes in biology, religion and politics.  As I read through the novel, I kept a mental balance sheet to see how Steinbeck would ultimately apportion it.  Would the mark of Cain be passed on or would sweet love and reason triumph?   <br />     I am happy in the outcome.  Neither side wins, but both remain on the field.  It's an American ending from this most American of novelists.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I love in flames etc., but why the haters?  I felt like writing a review to combat the criticism based on some sort of delusional sense of elitsm regarding originality. Centered on swedish bands supposedly owning this genre.  There seems to be much confusion among metal fans as to what is original. I'll tell you.  Black Sabbath.  More or less all the descendants of Sabbath are what we have today. <br />   <br />The good bands are excellent song writers. But they're working from the basic blueprint which Sabbath laid out.   <br />The poor bands have awful sounding singers or can't manage to compose compelling songs. <br /> <br />Unearth writes outstanding and energetic music.  The singer is solid and there's nothing obnoxiously trendy or whiny whithin the music.  There are also some of the best solos I've heard in years.  Something even Metallica fell for axing from their last record thanks to Lars, against Kirk's wishes. <br /> <br />Metallica started by covering only diamondhead.  Slayer was influenced by Venom.  In flames was influenced by Maiden, metallica AND Slayer.  But you get these kids slamming most of whats coming out of metal right now with the uneducated notion that in flames is the original.  No. They write great songs and possess a unique combination of styles.  Something that Unearth possesses as well.
0451529308|2.0|I found Little Women okay, but a bit boring at times. There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters. <br /> <br />The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once. <br /> <br />However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.  <br /> <br />In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it. <br />Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)
B000002KHH|5.0|Even though this isn't the greatest Sabbath album, it's still one of the great classics in Rock and Heavy Metal history. Since I have the remastered PARANOID now it sound's amazing coming thru my four INFINITY speakers. &quot;War pigs&quot; sound's great turned up loud on a quality system like I have. I definitely won't fault you, if you think this is the best Sabbath album of all time. I kind of get sick of &quot;Iron man&quot;, and &quot;Paronoid&quot;, being played constantly on my radio stations, but truly they are classic tracks. I haven't seemed to get tired of hearing &quot;Fairies wear boots&quot;, to this point in my life. &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; is a little weird and freaky, but still classic Sabbath. This their second album is what really sent them to the top commercially. Their first just didn't have any smash hits, like PARANOID did. YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GO WRONG, BY PURCHASING THIS HEAVY METAL CLASSIC. LONG LIVE BLACK SABBATH!!!
B00097A5HW|5.0|Definitively it is one of the best albums in the year in Spanish, sincerely it is noticed the work and the dedication that Shakira imposed in this work, it is also necessary to stand out that it is the first album it is Spanish that it has been able to debut among the first 10 positions of the billboard 200, around the world  has had excellent sales and its Single La Tortura had had great acceptance everywhere, this omens good expectations for its disk in English that will be thrown in November.     <br />This album is a mixture of Rhythms like the Reggeaton, Bossa Nova or other, The Second it Single of this Album No, has the collaboration of the Legend of the Latin Rock Gustavo cerati this Argentinean one who was part of Soda stereo, In few Words this album it deserves A 10/10
0743454537|2.0|This book actually started out well - jumping right into the plot and told through the eyes of the 13 year old girl who doesn't want to be a medical experiment for her dying sister anymore.<br /><br />THEN it went on and on and on and on... This story was dragged out so far, I could never really get into it.  It was told from the point of view of everyone, and I mean EVERYONE who was involved.  And how cute - each storyteller got their own unique type face, which just struck me as cheesy.  The only real character seemed to be the father, although the fact that he and his wife NEVER had marital problems, giving many of the story lines we were presented with was very unrealistic.<br /><br />The romantic subplot between the lawyer and the guardian of the child was completely pointless and should not have been included.<br /><br />We are also forced to read about the out of control son being completely ignored so he sets FIRES to get attention of his FIREfighter dad. Wow - that's really complex imagery!<br /><br />There is never a moment when I strike a connection or understanding with any of those characters. Thankfully, we weren't subjected to reading from the point of view of the lawyer's dog!  Many of the medical jargon was unnecessary as well.<br /><br />Basically, I ended up skimming over a lot of the \\"filler\\" parts in order to get to the real meat of the story, which could have been interesting if the writing wasn't so distracting.  There were even a few chapters that were peppered with astrological and mythological metaphors that were interesting but proved to be nothing but distracting because they interrupted the flow of the storyline!  Bottom line - the abrupt and far fetched ending was ridiculous, although I did like the plot twist beforehand.  When I finished reading the book (finally!), all I could do was slam it down and say \\"What a waste of time!!!\\"<br /><br />.... by the way... I think the people who have found my review unhelpful probably only do so because they actually liked the book!  just because i offer a different opinion (with many examples of why i feel this way) does not mean that my review is not helpful!  grow up!cause they actually liked the book!  just because i offer a different opinion (with many examples of why i feel this way) does not mean that my review is not helpful!  grow up!
0446310786|5.0|<br />           <br />Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.  <br /> <br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.  <br /> <br />A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.  <br /> <br />Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.  <br /> <br />I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.  <br />
0060005696|5.0|A typical supermarket has more than thirty thousand items.  A college catalogue may be characterized as shopping for knowledge.  There is no fixed curriculum.  Harvard instituted general studies requirements so that the students could talk to each others about their courses.  Studies have shown a small array of choice is more satisfying than a larger array.    Decisions for retirement depend upon the options offered by employers.  Employees tend to place a portion of their funds in each of the plans offered.  Medical patients prefer that others make treatment decisions.  They want their doctors to be competent and kind.      Losses have twice as much psychological impact as gains.  There is an aversion to loss.  Such an aversion is why the concept of sunk costs is a meaningful way to predict human action.  People remember experiences at the peak and the end.  In making choices people may be divided into two categories, the satificers and the maximizers.  Perfectionists, like maximizers, seek to achieve the best.  Rules, presumptions, standards, and routines bear upon when and how to make choices.      In a case where there are trade-offs, many people will avoid making a decision.  Individuals are not all equally susceptible to experiencing  regret.  Seeking to avoid regret, a person might fall into inaction.  Social comparison and positional competition are discussed by the author.  The difference between happy and unhappy people is the ability happy people have of distracting themselves from thinking about negative experiences, rejection and criticism, and moving on.      Rising expectations may cause one to feel disappointed about a particular experience.  The success of modernity is bitter-sweet.  The problem of excessive choice has to be managed.
B000002NE4|4.0|If there was ever a modern day Edgar Allen Poe, Nick Cave would probably have to be that person. With his rich baritone vocals and often bittersweet lyrics, his music is what I consider great rainy day music, let alone any day music. Nick Cave is one of my personal favorite male vocalists today, along with Andrew Eldritch (The Sisters of Mercy), Ronan Harris (VNV Nation), Robert Smith (The Cure), Dave Gahan (Depeche Mode), and Voltaire. His voice sends chills down my spine. And on \\"The Boatman's Call\\", Nick doesn't fail me at that. I absolutely adored \\"Murder Ballads\\" which was my first exposure to Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds' music. I didn't think he could match the intensity of that album with \\"The Boatman's Call\\". Although there isn't any songs as morbid as \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\" and \\"Stagger Lee\\", Nick still succeeded in releasing a classic album with \\"The Boatman's Call\\". He gets the album going with the wonderful ballad \\"Into My Arms\\" and the songs just gets better and better one song after another. I especially love \\"People Ain't No Good\\". I consider it one of my personal anthems. \\"Brompton Oratory\\" gives me this image of being in church and listening to church music with the lush organ sounds. Nick's bittersweet lyrics never ceases to amaze me, and the fact that he puts them to such beatiful, lush music makes him an absolute genius in my book.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I still remember being blown away in the movie theater by The Terminator in 1984, and again, by Terminator 2 in 1991. Both are incredible films by James Cameron. <br /> <br />Having said that, I believe Terminator 3 is a better film. This entry holds the same place that Episode III does in the Star Wars saga. This is the film that pulls everything together. In this movie you get to see the key events unfold that give rise to the Machines. In that respect alone, it took my breath away. It's like watching a global train wreck in slow motion without being able to do anything about it. You're not watching dream sequences or listening to a back story. This is the real deal, from Skynet going online, to the cyborg infecting the systems, to nuclear Armageddon. As they say, this one has \\"the money shot.\\" <br /> <br />Terminator 3 is also the most watchable of all three films. It is simply more entertaining. It is a real feat to create a film that works so well, balancing bits of humor with action and profound questions about space and time. <br /> <br />The Earl Boen cameo was a great touch! <br /> <br />Arnold really wanted to make this movie, and it shows. He went into a vigorous exercise program for this movie, attaining the exact weight and measurements that he had in 1991. There is virutally no difference in the cyborg you see in Terminator 2 or 3. <br /> <br />I have been watching this film repeatedly since 2003 and am still not tired of watching it! This is everything that I had been wanting to see since the original film from 1984.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Long known to be one of the most perfectionistic bands of their day, The Eagles have followed in their own tradition of creating and releasing pristine perfection with \\"Farewell 1.\\" This is a group that may show its age visually, but when they are doing what they do best, they transport their listeners to a time gone by.  <br /> <br />One of the most interesting and astounding achievements of the Eagles is their ability to perfectly recreate their songs onstage, while injecting serious feeling and heart at the same time. This is something that cannot be said about most groups, old or young. Some groups favor extended live jams that differ from the studio recording, such as The Grateful Dead, Phish and Eric Clapton (earlier in his career). Many other groups opt to perfect the craft of re-creation, feeling that their fans simply want to hear the songs as they are on the albums. Both routes can be very satisfying, but remain very different. The Eagles were sometimes criticized in their heyday for simply playing their songs exactly as they were on the recordings. This was an extension of their perfectionistic tendencies, and the sometimes volatile partnership of Henley-Frey, which might have spontaneously combusted (and probably did from time to time) had any member strayed from the game plan on stage.  <br /> <br />With Farewell 1, however, as with Hell Freezes Over, The Eagles have shown an ability not only to provide fans with live performances of their hits, but also to color those performances with intensity and fire. This combination can be attributed to a man by the name of Joe Walsh. <br /> <br />Walsh's entre into the band while they were recording Hotel California was a natural progression from the band's early sound, carefully constructed piece by piece with the help of producer Glyn Johns, toward a more free and rollicking sound with the help of producer Bill Szymczyk (starting with \\"Already Gone\\"). This spark provided by Walsh (and lit by Szymczyk) can be seen throughout the DVD, especially on Frey's only solo hit, \\"You Belong To The City.\\" Walsh turns this formerly-forgettable tune into a smoldering showcase of talent and emotion. The title \\"forgettable,\\" however, cannot be applied to any of the other songs on the album, minus the new tracks (whose fate can't really be decided until they are given enough time). Speaking of the new songs, \\"Hole In The World\\" shimmers with unbelievable harmonies which successfully overshadow the marginal lyrics. The classics are everything you hope they would be, and the crowd is appreciative. Henley's voice hasn't lost anything, and neither has Timothy B. Schmit's.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: They're still the songs you love, but they've been made even better (I know it's hard to believe) with the maturity and devotion of Henley, Frey, Walsh and Schmit.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|so there are around 240 reviews of this album as i write the 241st.  since almost every review lands between four and five stars, i would say that this record speaks for itself. <br /> <br />with that said, the cross-hairs of my review are centered on the clueless individuals who have taken the time to try to rag on this record.  to those who are even thinking of taking those reviews seriously, check out the other albums that these people have reviewed.  some guy reviewed a STYX record along with funeral.  seriously?  would you even want to TALK to someone who had listened to a full STYX record and then felt compelled to write about it online?  i didn't think so. <br /> <br />funeral speaks for itself.  the only other record in the last 10 years that hit me as hard as this one was 69 Love Songs.  funeral is beautiful in too many ways to really even write about.  not to mention the 240 before me do a pretty decent job.  there are certain songs, and hopefully you know what i'm talking about, that when you hear them, the hair on the back of your neck and arms stand up just from the sheer emotional power that they invoke.  9 of the 10 songs on funeral do that to me, and have done that to me, even after listening to the album upwards of 50 or 60 times.   <br /> <br />so, to the cluelessly lame and obviously intelectually lacking individuals who have taken the time to attempt to \\"save\\" people from hearing such \\"awful\\" music, do yourself a favor.  go back to your room, tell mom you're skipping dinner tonight, and listen to that STYX album.  but please, for the love of God, stop trying to claim that you know even a shred about music.  you don't.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby marked a shift in U2's career path, and a significant risk. Their enormous success due to The Joshua Tree and Unforgettable Fire albums produced a huge and loyal fan base, and one that could have revolted at the warning of a dramatic shift in style. Apparently, however, listeners of U2 are as dedicated to understanding their music as the band is to creating it.  <br /> <br />Much has been written about this album, simply because, like all great works of art, it inspires many reactions. My reaction is that this album is important because it proved that U2 could be relevant in arenas previously unexplored by their music. The Amazon review was somewhat accurate in labeling this album as \\"postmodern,\\" and I think another great adjective would be \\"murky.\\" Many things can be taken from this artwork, and that's the beauty of it. Much more cerebral in approach than thier earlier efforts, listeners are slowly drawn into the vortex of \\"Zoo Station,\\" which the band continues to perform live. Bono's voice is deep within the sound of the band, masked by a scratchy reverb. This leads into \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing,\\" which includes octave seperation of Bono's voice, something he has employed often on U2 records. The initial impression of a new element of depth being added to U2's music is solidly reinforced in the first two songs. \\"One\\" is a standout, seen by many as possibly their greatest song. Lyrically it is definitely a gem, and the production stays true to the new musical approach. \\"Until The End of The World\\" is an interesting dialogue, and the live version performed on the Boston DVD gives it great perspective. The climax of the album is by far the bittersweet \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.\\" This song sees Bono finally really letting loose with his voice, and the lyrics are interestingly blunt in the verses, juxtaposing with the very poetic lyrics of the chorus. The jolting moment comes right at the end when he plaintively asks \\"Who's gonna take the place of me?\\" <br />\\"So Cruel\\" provides a transitional piece into the second half of the album, leading into more great lyrics and murky musical production. \\"Love Is Blindness\\" is a deceptively bitter and intriguing ending, with the mellow music in diametric opposition to the cutting lyrics.  <br />I see this album as the \\"Revolver\\" of U2's career. Experimentation was rampant, and with wild success. Most importantly, it ushered U2 into a new era of relevance, success, and musical honesty, which has always been their aim.
B00079018K|1.0|I rarely review items, let along leave negative reviews, but the copy protection on this CD prevents it from working normally on many players.  Very frustrating to spend $17 on music, only to not be able to play it.  Obnoxiousness of this sort should not be rewarded.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I bought this record after reading such great reviews about this band and the album on amazon.com and I caught a glimpse of the band performing on Conan O'Brien one night. It totally blew me away that it seemed like twelve people in the band can make a noise so unheard of and unique. One of my favorite songs on the album is \\"Neighborhood 2 (Laika)\\" and I also love \\"Rebellion (Lies).\\" Besides those songs the album is one that can be listened to from start to finish. This is one of those Canadian bands that get overlooked by the public because they believe that everyone who lives in Canada sounds like Alanis Morrisette. I recommend this cd to anyone who listens to garage rock, indie rock, alternative, and even pop-rock. I actually think that anyone can like this music no matter what your preference is. \\"Funeral\\" by Arcade Fire is one of the best records I have heard of in 2005.
B00005KB9T|5.0|This is a great album, what more can I say, also consider buying \\"Live at the Roxy\\".
6305971099|2.0|With the success of the Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, it was inevitable that the money hungry boys in Hollywood wanted him to come back. First of all, how he came back from 200 bullets at the end of 4 is beyond me. When they replay the scene in 5, they made it look like 20 bullets, but nonetheless, he's back and alive and well.<br /><br />The problem with 5 is that it's simply not very scary. It takes place a year after 4, and again, Michael is after \\"the little girl from part 4\\". It's a pet peave for Halloween fans, but the mask in 5 is the worst the series as seen. It looks like a mask I could buy at Kmart on a blue light special. It looks nothing like the mask he had on in 1, 2 or 4. But annoying mask aside, the real sense of chills and thrills is really missing from this cheap imatation. They even infected the classic Halloween theme music with a horrible casio keyboard and is sorely missing from the already boring movie.<br /><br /> Even Donald Pleasance (Loomis) looks bored throughout his stay in 5. Again, Michael is after his little niece (Laurie Stroade's daughter), sigh,again. She obviously got away in 4. This time around she's a mute and she only regains her speach near the end of the movie. A crying shame becuase she's a good little actor.<br /><br />Michael once again goes on another killing spree on Halloween to get the little girl in his clutches. Plot is weak, acting is subpar, and the murder scenes are anything but creative. They actually made it more gory than 1, 2 and 4 combined, but once again, gore does not mean better, its' about suspense, and Part V has none of that.<br /><br />The best movies in the series are 1, 2, 4 and H20. Other than that, steer away from the others, especially this one. Yawn.
B0007YXREA|5.0|Being somewhat of a fan of puppets and puppet shows especially marrionettes, I was really curious to see what the southpark guys would do with this movie and already had expectations of its being fairly entertaining. Well I wasn't dissapointed. <BR>I laughed  histerically throughout the whole thing. Imagine Mel Brooks meets Howard Stern making fun of American military patriotism, terrorists, celebrity and Hollywood all at the same time, but doing it with the naturally ridiculous body language of puppets on a string. <BR>This movie is intelligent in it's satirical portrayal of worldly  and everyday events. I was crying I was laughing so hard at times. The puppeteering is brilliant and the characters are perfectly stereotyped.<BR>  If you have a problem with swearing, some adult like portrayel of puppets or Don Rickles type humour and don't care to pay attention to detail when watching a movie, then this may not be for you otherwise I highly recommend it!!
B000777J2S|4.0|After having seen a beautiful appearance at the Jools Holland (BBC UK) show of this special artist, I became really curious to listen to his latest album, I Am a Bird Now. Most of the songs hit you right in the heart, the beautiful voice moves your senses and the easy sound of the piano makes it all very pleasant listening to. The only song I do not like is the song together with Lou Reed, because I personally think Antony's voice is not a rock voice.
038572179X|4.0|Some sin is born of innocence.  Imagine a young girl whose mind is a lush, fantastical playground, filled with romps through history, alive with visions of chivalry and love.  Her world is one apart, the realm of a nascent writer, where the possible, the real, the truth and the lie play out on an ethereal plain of mystical logic.  In the throes of discovery, amidst the first strange stirrings of love and desire, she does something horrible.  Her crime, which in her eleven year old mind comes to life wrapped in a mantle of courage and outrage, lives on past her time of delusion, beyond her ability to control, unleashing forces that destroy those she loves.  Its consequences become her world.  <br /> <br />This is the trap Ian McEwan sets for his heroine Briony Tallis in his masterful novel \\"Atonement\\".  Told in different stages in time, the novel opens during a torpid English summer in 1935 at a non-descript country estate, where various members of an unsettled family of landed gentry have gathered in an desultory attempt to vanquish the season's languor. It's hot, stifling, bursting with the possibility of searing summer storm.  And with a playwright's sense of timing, Briony unleashes one that never ends. <br /> <br />Gathered at the Tallis home are a restless group of family and friends including mother Briony's mother Emily, sister Cecilia, family protege Robbie, gadabout brother Leon, and Leon's pompous friend Paul Marshall.  The adults move about under the careful eyes of Briony and the other children, her cousins Lola and Lola's twin brothers.  When Briony's attempts to produce her first play in the mansion's basement fall apart, she turns her attentions to the real world with a vengeance, slandering her sister's lover Robbie with a charge of something so awful that, in Briony's feverish imaginings of evil, it has to be true. <br /> <br />Five years later, Briony has grown, war has arrived, and all the realities she's staved off for so long have come to terrifying life.  Her victims, the steadfast lovers Cecilia and Robbie, have lived past her charges, spent time in prison, pledged undying love for each other, begun to grapple with the horrors of war.  But the scars Briony inflicted are open and oozing, and she has come to acknowledge that healing those wounds must be her life's work.  But how? <br /> <br />McEwan has an answer for us, but it's not the one we yearn for.  Throughout the book he plumbs his characters' minds with internal dialog so intricate the sentences feel like threads in an enormous tapestry of language, telling a story of sweeping tragedy and personal innocence.  But it's not only the workings of the psyche where McEwan's formidable strengths as a writer evidence themselves; his description of war, its vagaries and cruelties, serves both as powerful metaphor for his characters' internal struggles and a reminder of the ease with which delusion can become hideous reality. <br /> <br />The novel concludes in contemporary times, with Briony on the verge of senescence and dementia, pining to change what memory tells her is true.  Does she gain redemption?  In a sense, though McEwan leaves his readers with a vague feeling of unfulfillment, an ethereal satisfaction that seems as transitory as the pages of a yellowing fairy tale.  In his renderings of human imperfection and the pain and pathos they bring to bear even in the lives of the good, McEwan has crafted a powerful testament to the fragility of preciousness of life.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002HEP|5.0|Wake up call everybody. 'Whitewater' is the long and beautiful final Kyuss song on this album and the little ditty that follows is called 'Lick Doo'. This is the lounge singer/piano combo of a guy singing 'Honey you know that you can and will lick my doo-ah doo-ah' and 'Whitewater'is the one with the faded in drum beat with guitar lick slowly building over it that comes in with Josh's baeutiful spidery riff and then John Garcia's Jim Morrison/Ian Astbury-esque wail comes crooning slightly under it with the 'You move your own mountains...'. <br />Enough said!
B0007MVXQG|3.0|I'll start off by saying I actually give this album 3.5 stars. At first listen (other than the first song) the album is quite dull and boring. By reading other reviews I was expecting the songs to have some monster, super-catchy riffs that Priest is so famous for but instead you get some songs that sound very nu-metal-ish (especially \\"Revolution\\" and more or less \\"Deal With The Devil\\") or sound like some of the not-so-better songs off of the late 80's Priest albums.<br /><br />But bear with me. After a few more listens to the album you get a better feeling for the album and I actually found it to be quite catchy and a pretty decent album. The album is a pretty straight-forward metal album with a few low points but a fair share of good songs (e.g. \\"Judas Rising\\", \\"Worth Fighting For\\" and \\"Hellrider\\"). \\"Hellrider\\" actually reminds me of the classic Priest song \\"Night Crawler\\". In any case, the album definitely doesn't compare to Maiden's comeback album \\"Brave New World\\" but it's still great to see Priest back and defending the faith.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|If you're looking for ACoS II, you won't find it here, this is nothing like any of their other albums, and if you're looking for the classic D.T sound, as said before, this ain't it. <br /> <br />That being said, anyone who likes Metal, a bit more technical than Metallica, this is a great album.  I think people only disliked this album because, it doesn't sound like their favourite D.T, really Progressive Metal albums.   <br /> <br />But seriously, if you want a good Metal album, this is it, as many people other metioned, I just wanted a classic Prog Metal D.T album, not a Metal one...
B000002H6C|5.0|metallica is the father of thrash metal, they had some great albums and songs (kill'em all, ride the lightning, master of the puppets).  This album though, definitely gets the award for best song writing and sound.  The reason for this is because metallica took some soft guitar parts into the album, leaving some of their somewhat juvenile history behind.  But you cant really say that because they kept the core of their thrash metal throughout the album.  so in the end the perfect balance of thrash and soft was made in this album.
B000002HK4|5.0|Anyone who doesn't get shivers running down their spine when they hear ACoS is not sane.  The song is absolutely technically, songwritingly perfect.  Everytime I listen to this I break out in a  seizure.   <br /> <br />I can't say the same for the covers, however, I thing they could have chosen some more appropriate songs, but the Big Medley is quite enjoyable.   <br /> <br />Buy this album just for the title song.
0802130208|5.0|<br />One of the funniest books ever written.  <br /> <br />The author, unfortunately, committed suicide after failing to sell the book. It was sold by his mother, after his death, and won a Pulitzer. The story behind the book is almost as good as the book itself.  <br /> <br />In any case, it is a comic masterpiece. It includes some of the most original characters in literature, involved in situations which should (if you posess any sense of humor whatsoever) have you laughing aloud many, many times.  <br /> <br />I envy you, if you have not read this book yet, but are about to do so. You are about to discover a tremendous joy.
B0007P3582|4.0|Look...Alot of people say that all 50 cent raps about is money, guns, women, etc. I agree he does rap about that stuff alot, but considering the life he had before he became famous and the life he has now, wouldn't you. When he was young he had nothing and now hes got what alot of people dont have. If you had the life he had and now you became famous wouldn't you talk about your life in songs? Thats part of the reason why I like 50, beacause he raps about his life. Most rappers rap about nothing at all. 50's unique and I hope he does well.
B00092ZMDY|2.0|I remember in the 80's, when the Eagles broke up.  There was a quote in People Magazine from Glenn Frey.  It said something to the effect of, \\"The Eagles are a young band.  You'll never see us getting back together for the 'Lost Youth and Greed Tour'.\\"  I guess you should never say never.  They fire Don Felder and still carry on with this tour.  Sorry, it has turned into a Vegas act.  How many side musicians do you need, anyway?  They are still the single most boring band I have ever seen live.  And I first saw them in 1977 on the Hotel California tour.  The two stars are for Joe Walsh (rocks!) and for the sound.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return to their Ray-Ban glasses and Armani suits in the 1997 sequel of Men in Black.<br /><br />New creatures, special effects and lots of humor characterize this adventure of director Barry Sonnenfeld. Capturing the ability of its predecessor, the movie finds a way to play with the relationship between agents J and K.<br /><br />The movie starts with J, who has been going through a lot of partners since J retired. A new villain named Serleena comes to Earth looking for something called Zartha's light, and the only one who can stop her is K. Obviously, the agent returns to MIB headquartes and alongside partner J, will try to stop Serleena.<br /><br />MIB2 exploits comedy from K's amnesia and how he assumes the leader role in his partnership with J. On the screen, Jones and Smith relieve his weird chemistry and take us to the crazy infiltrated-alien city of Manhattan.<br /><br />The movie clearly was made to get more money out of its predecessor, but at least is not cynic. The complete lack of seriousness is a favorable quality in MIB2, because is in sync with its intention: get easy laughs from the spectator.
B00097A5HW|2.0|I've been a shakira fan since her debut album \\"Pies Descalzos\\", but it seems she's gone out of focus, first of all the album only has 10 original songs wich is actually pathetic, and of the 10 songs only 3 are worth listening, i know she's really in love with Antonio but COME ON!! WE'VE BEEN LISTENING HER LOVE STORIES FROM THE BEGINING!! THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING MORE TO WRITE ABOUT, I'M I RIGHT?
0393035158|3.0|Sam Harris' \\"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Furutre of Reason\\" is in many ways a solid philosophical work.  However, several key weaknesses in the book overall make it an unfortunately less than rock-solid foundation on which to base too many conclusions.  While I found that I did agree with the author on many points, his logic at times seemed forced at at the very least underexplained.  While this might seem acceptable for a scholatic, academic work in which certain key concepts are mutually understood by all readers involved, for a work of popular nonfiction, these imprecisions are very damaging as Harris comes off as not following his thoughts to their full conclusion.  A few central criticisms. <br /> <br />1)  Harris tends towards uncritically accepting certain emotional concepts such as love, compassion and hate, as well as certain branches of discourse as ethnics as universal constructs shared by all humans.  As such, while he makes a valiant effort to prove that, for example \\"honor killings\\" of muslim women are not acts of love but of hate, he fails to reasonably address the arguements raised by comparative anthropology and postmodernism.  While the generalized \\"we\\" in the west would be far and large agree that honor killings are horrific acts of vengeance and not acts of love, that universally-shared concept of love is an assumption that simply cannot go unchallenged, yetHarris fails to mention it.   <br /> <br />2)  At times, Harris lacks precision and fails to establish baseline definitions.  While he claims that moderate believers of religion are at least as dangerous to the safety of humanity as religious fanatics, he later in the book complains that the Muslim faith is \\"worse\\" for it lacks an outlet for moderation like the Christian sermon on the mount, which he sees as a convenient escape clause for many Christians.  Furthermore, in failing to establish a truely baseline definition of what a religious moderate or fanatic is, he allows theedges to remain fuzzy and as such weakens his arguement by over relying on the idea that the readers will automatically share his definitions and leave it at that.  (ex.  We know that he thinks of Osama Bin Laden as a religious fanatic, but what about Billy Grahm?  Is he better or worse?  Or how about someone like Jesse Jackson?) <br /> <br />3)  Harris has some very strange ideas concerning logic: in order to be logical, one can only be 100% consistent.  If we are willing to inflict pain in war, Harris reasons, we must be willing to inflict pain in the form of torturing prisoners in order to be 100% logical.  While it is entirely possible that Harris is just casting a line in an attempt to open the reader's mind to several different trains of thought, this is never made clear.  While it is quite possible that Harris genuinely believes this, I am at a loss as to how  a person as obviously  intelligent and well-spoken as Harris could subscribe to this clearly flawed position (If I am willing to spank my baby to punish him, should I be willing to decapitate my adult son if he commits a capital crime?) <br /> <br />4)  Finally, Harris is somewhat disingenous and academically dishonest with his sources.  One item that caught my eye immediately was the way he at one point defends Israel as a model of restraint by citing a quotation as though it were an academic, unbased fact, when it in fact comes from Dershowitz's \\"The Case for Israel,\\" hardly a non-polemical, unbiased source.  Furthermore, he critisizes the war on drugs by using figures from [...] hardly an academically accredited, peer-reviewed repository of inromation.  While neither of these citations are key to butressing Harris' claims, his willingness to use this academic sleight of hand causes him more damage than any weaknesses in the logic or writing themselves. <br /> <br />  All in all, a decent book, but nothing spectacular.  Harris is obviously a brilliant, well-educated, well-spoken man and I commend himon a valiant effort, but just the same I would only be able to give it a solid C due to some flawed arguementation and intellectual conjury.
1590861515|5.0|I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!<br /><br />As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)
B000065LZE|5.0|In the history of rock and roll this album (known variously as \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" \\"Runes\\" and \\"ZOSO\\") is one of the great albums of all time. The sales figures certainly back up that idea, with 22 million albums sold since it game out in 1971. When \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine listed the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" came in at #66, while \\"Physical Grafitti\\" was #70 and \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" #75. Much higher on the list was the group's debut album at #29, which makes sense since the list favors albums that were influential and importance, which is why the Beatles have three of the top five (four of the top ten, five of the top fourteen).<br /><br />If you do not like Led Zeppelin, then there is no earthly reason for this album to change your mind. But if you like their mix of rock, blues and folk, then you would definitely have to count this as one of their best albums. One of the things I find most interesting about this album is how each side (remember, it was actually a thing called a \\"record\\" way back when it first came out and there was an \\"A\\" side and a \\"B\\" side) is set up the same way: two hard rockers, an acoustic piece, and then a much longer track. \\"Side 1\\" ends with the classic \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" while \\"Side 2\\" brings Robert Plant's harmonica out of retirement for what might be the heaviest song in Led Zep's repertoire, \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" Jimmy Page always did pay attention to the order of the songs and this album clearly evidences the point.<br /><br />Bonzo's drums on \\"Four Sticks\\" provides a nice contrast to Page's acoustic guitar on \\"Going to California,\\" just as the dueling voices of Plant and Sandy Denny, the queen of British folk rock, on \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" (with its Tolkien references) fade away to set up the start of \\"Stairway.\\" We actually used \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" for our homecoming song one year (we had a VERY good high school band teacher), so it always been a special song for me without bringing in the entire \\"most played song of FM radio\\" bit.<br /><br />This is an atypical Led Zeppelin album in one significant regard in that it does not have a blues track (their best one, \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" was on their previous album). So put this down as the best rock album by one of the best rock bands. Just because I do not want to anoint their feet with oil does not mean I do not think that they were damn good at what they did. One thing we can agree on: Led Zeppelin engenders strong feelings from both sides.\\"most played song of FM radio\\" bit.  <br /> <br />This is an atypical Led Zeppelin album in one significant regard in that it does not have a blues track (their best one, \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" was on their previous album).

1932100660|4.0|Dr. Campbell documents the methods and findings of the prestigious China study, and points out what he feels is the relationship between a diet containing too much animal protein and disease. A chapter or two is devoted to the history of research regarding animal protein's (casein presumably from cow milk cheese) affect on tumor growth rate, providing corroborative evidence for the findings of the China study. There is also discussion on the difficulty of making this information \\"heard\\" in Washington due to special-interest lobbies. In my opinion the book is interesting, helpful, and motivational reading.<br /><br />However, the people in the healthy areas of China were likely eating a natural diet very low in refined food and tran-fats, similar to their primitive ancestors. I understand that many researchers have written that modern diseases such as constipation, arthritis, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and etc. were never found in primitive people, regardless of the content of animal fat and protein in their diet.<br /><br />With regard to the studies with mice and tumor growth, I wonder if animal proteins other than cow milk casein, would cause the same effect. I also can't help but wonder what other factors were different between the areas with the highest rates of cancer and the lowest, besides the consumption of \\"animal protein\\".<br /><br />I would venture to guess that if one could duplicate the details of the diet of the rural Chinese it would be a healthful thing. However, I feel it is doubtful that most people's implementation of veganism, using grocery-store foods, would result in such great improvement. BTW, it is my understanding that the rural Chinese traditionally ate a diet of rice and vegetables, some fruit, a little meat or fish, and no dairy at all, and certainly no trans-fats or MSG or the like. That I think is a healthy diet.
B0009I7O7A|1.0|as with all the SONY/BMG titles on the dualdisc format, this one is also crap, and i will be honest i only buy these so i can return them and complain, i already know they are not enhanced, i figure the more people i complain to, the sooner sony will have to listen, so far BEST BUY, CIRCUIT CITY, MEDIAPLAY, SAM GOODY AND NOT TO MENTION QUITE A FEW OTHERS, already know about this, and i am slowly starting to plant the seed about sony and their lies, so far so good. some of you may think i am being petty, but the bottom line is this:dont call something enhanced when it really isnt, be honest and tell people that the dvd and cd layers are identical. and if enough people dont care than it will be fine, but give people the chance to know before buying. sony continues to make things difficult for the consumer and they should be held accountable. <br /> <br />by the way, i love this cd. but the dualdisc sucks!!!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This CD is a great collection of some of Jimi Hendrix's best songs.    There is a wide variety of his styles present from his hard-rocking \\"Voodoo Child\\" to ballads like \\"Little Wing\\".  All the songs are great, and for just $10 I don't think you can go wrong.  Hendrix's music is timeless.

0345404475|4.0|Androids takes place in a not-so-distant future where a world war has spread a cloud of radioactive dust across the globe, many forms of animal species are extinct, many of the survivors have emigrated to colonies on Mars and the remaining humans are encouraged to emigrate, except for those who have been tested and classified as \\"specials\\" meaning the ones with diminished mental abilities because they have been affected severely from radiation. Emigrants are given androids, very sophisticated robots, as slaves. As the technology gets better, newly manufactured androids become more and more human-like, both in appearance and behavior, to the point that they are very hard to distinguish. Discontented androids sometimes kill their masters and find ways to smuggle themselves to earth, in hopes for a better life. In the post-world war earth, life is regarded so precious that owning and caring for an animal is both considered a highly moral life and a status symbol. Because real animals are so rare, many people have fake, very sophisticated and real-like electronic animals that they care for and hide from their neighbors the fact that their animal is fake. On the one hand there are bounty hunters who catch and kill androids, human robots which dreamt of a better life, evidently with some feelings. And on the other hand there is the value which people place upon animal robots. On the one hand there are intelligent, sophisticated androids like the one who made a successful carrier on earth as an opera singer; on the other hand there are hunters who emotionlessly kill her without regard to her artistic talent, or there are simple-minded specials. Throughout the plot, readers are given a lot to think about questions like what is life, what is empathy, where do you draw a line between the value of real and artificial life? It is a philosophical novel and the author puts all these questions before us with brilliant comparisons between characters. The only negative feeling thatone might get is the unusual, somewhat simple prose style but overall, a very good, thought provoking novel.
1400079179|4.0|If you are of a certain age you'll recall a gimmick of circa about 1970 - the \\"Pet Rock\\". The Pet Rock was, if you hadn't heard, an actual pebble. It was packaged into a little cardboard box. I don't remember what it cost - but word was that millions of them sold. People everywhere I went marveled for a moment - they didn't so much WANT a \\"Pet Rock\\" as they wanted to come up with something that EVERYONE WANTED and were willing to pay for.<br /><br />Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is the literary equivalent. It is not great literature by any means, but neither are Grisham, Clancy, etc. It's a reasonably well-told, well-thought out story that hits people in a way that makes them want to get the book, read it, then tell their friends \\"you've GOT to read this book\\".<br /><br />In telling his tale he recycles some old obscure religious thoughts that absolutely flies in the face of the Catholic Church and what everyone \\"knows\\" about Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail. He must be laughing all the way to the bank at the many Catholic and Historic scholars who are heaping tons of free publicity on his book, thinking that they are trying to dispute his fictional tale.<br /><br />It's a quick read - about 450 pages with 103 chapters. He writes his chapters with little mini cliff-hangers the way Entertainment Tonight goes into a commercial break with a teasing line like \\"wait 'til you SEE what Britney/Tom Cruise/Madonna/Kobe Bryant\\" did! It does make it a page-turner.<br />I was burning through about 100 pages an hour, and it kept me engaged.<br /><br />So - if you haven't read it, should you? There are better thrillers. If you have staunch religious beliefs you may be offended. If you like sticking it to the Catholic Church it may tickle you. If you want to know what the buzz is about, it only takes a couple of hours to find out...
B00000GAIW|5.0|Three facts about Jethro Tull. One , Jethro Tull is not the name of a member of the band , it is the name of the band , the chap that is always pictured leading the band is actually called Ian Anderson , Who is still leading the band today in 2005 ,( In-between his main occupation now as a salmon farmer!) he is the rather odd looking chap ,usually pictured standing on one leg, wearing a rather shabby, ill fitting rain coat,  whilst playing the flute. Number Two fact is that although Jethro Tull's line up has been extremely mercurial , they have only ever had three lead guitarist's , the first was the brilliant blues guitarist Mick Abrahams , who left after the first album,\\" This Was(1968) to form his own band Blodwyn Pig , who were to have their moment in the spotlight in the early seventies. , the next guitarist lasted only for a month , before deciding that Jethro Tull's take on the blues was not quite him and moving back to his old mates ,and forming Black Sabbath, a certain Toni Iommi, ( Toni Iommi's only real contribution was miming with the band to the band's latest single \\" Witches Promise\\" on the Rolling Stones Rock'n' Roll Circus film.) He was then replaced by Martin Barre, who is still with the band today 37 years later. Fact Number three is that their fourth album written completely by Ian Anderson , who by now was definitely the leader of the band , is a five star classic that can easily be said to have changed the face of Rock music as we now know it .<br /><br />Jethro Tull were formed in Birmingham ,England in 1967, to cash in on the burgeoning British Blues Boom,they were an instant success with their first album going into the British Top Twenty , their second album \\" Stand Up ( 1969) reaching the top of the British Charts , whilst also reaching the Top Twenty across the Atlantic in the good ole U.S of A. , Their third album \\"Benefit\\" ( 1970) went straight to the Top Ten of the Charts World wide, by which time their reputation as a live act had put them amongst the Rock Giants of their Day , it is actually quite surprising that they managed to record so much high quality music , taking into account the number  of live concerts the band were doing in their early years .<br /><br />In early 1971 Jethro Tull went into the newly opened Island recording studio's for three weeks  to record their new album , ( The other band in residence at Island at the same time were Led Zeppelin laying down tracks for their fourth album.) When they came out again they had recorded one of Rock's great moments . \\"Aqualung\\" was released to it's adoring public  , and in reality gave Ian Anderson and his bunch the right to lifetime Superstardom. Never mind how much the line up changed and Boy ,did it,by the time of this release there was only one remaining original member of the band apart from Anderson left ,Clive Bunker the drummer, and he was to leave before the release of Tull's next album \\" Thick As A Brick\\" ( 1972 ), But no matter how many Bass players , Keyboards ,and  Drummers ,they had as long as Ian Anderson, wrote ,arranged and sung the songs ,with his flute giving Tull their distinctive sound , and his right hand man Martin Barre stuck with him to give the band genuine rock credibility, the band over the next thirty years turned out a constant stream of quality albums and live concerts . But Aqualung was certainly a defining moment , and is crammed full of classic tracks many of which are still in Tull's live set today.<br /><br />The album is split into two parts , in the days of Vinyl Side One and Side Two , throughout which Anderson, and Barre's playing is inspirational , whilst the supporting musicians turn in  fine performances.<br /><br />Track one is the albums title track , starting off with a typical Tull guitar riff before the band break in , and Anderson starts his story telling.<br /><br />Aqualung is the album's lead character, and is so named for his hacking cough ,and dishevelled appearance .Side one deals with his life story ,full  of seedy vignettes drawn from modern secular English life . the title track has actually got three sections as the mood of the narrator unfolds the music changes accordingly , the first melodic statement sung in a harsh surly voice is ugly and jarring on the senses,it then turns into a completely different beast far gentler and easy on the ear before rising to a rockin' finale featuring the first of the musical duels between , Anderson's flute and the mighty axe of Barre.<br /><br />Side two subtitled My God ,deals explicitly with religion , there are more questions asked than answers given , which leaves the album topical ,and soul searching today . Again the structure of the songs is constantly shifting . There are stately hymnal changes, a jazzy flute break, and many pomp-and-circumstantial motif's which, when inverted ,assumes more chromatic, and modern queasiness. Altogether a very satisfying and complete package .<br /><br /> With this new 30th Anniversary edition not only do you get the entire original eleven tracks clearly re-mastered ,all of the artwork reprinted , the front cover alone puts shivers up and down your spine  but a bonus of five extra  tracks including the glorious 'Bouree ', delightfully credited to Ian Anderson/Johan Sebastian Bach , plus an excerpt of an interview with Ian Anderson on his recollections of recording Aqualung . All in all , a grand package.<br /><br />Mott the Dog.of seedy vignettes drawn from modern secular English life . the title track has actually got three sections as the mood of the narrator unfolds the music changes accordingly , the first melodic statement sung in a harsh surly voice is ugly and jarring on the senses,it then turns into a completely different beast far gentler and easy on the ear before rising to a rockin' finale featuring the first of the musical duels between , Anderson's flute and the mighty axe of Barre. <br />Side two subtitled My God ,deals explicitly with religion , there are more questions asked than answers given , which leaves the album topical ,and soul searching today .

0385720920|5.0|I am an avid Palahniuk reader, and must say that Choke was my first read.  Anybody who says that this book is mediocre is fooling themselves, because it was certainly one of the best books I've ever read.  Not only is the story unique and unconventinal (but which of Palahniuk's works is!?), but the language...ohhh the language...its amazing!! I would recommend to read all of his books (with the exception of his 2 non-fictional books).  My favorites are Choke, Fight Club, Survivor, and the latest HAUNTED!!!! Cmon join the fan club, and grab that book off the shelf!!!!!! You won't regret it!
B0009A1AS2|3.0|The reason people have scenes from a memory so rated high, is that you see all of the full talent. they are all the masters of what they do but the last few cds they are not showing that. I saw Pertrucci on the g3 tour with joe and steve, and he is just as good as them but you cannot tell on these last few outings, this one is heavier than the last one and John is doing heavy chords, but if I wanted to hear a heavy rythem guitar Ill go for jon schaffer of Iced earth. John is classicaly trained but we do not see it here, and keyboardest master jordan ruddess does little to impress, Of the last cds since \\"scenes\\" the one band member who hs not dissapointed is john myung. I would say avoid this get and evening with petrucci and ruddess and of course, \\"scenes from a  memory\\"
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Firstoff, I agree with the reviewer that said basically \\"No **** this isn't a kid's movie.\\" I'd like to add that, even if you didn't know about Southpark etc, who the hell takes little kids to see a movie called \\"Team America: World Police\\"? Did these people even bother reading the title? Or did they just see puppets and without using any mental capacity at all jump straight to \\"puppets... -> kids!\\" Oh, and newsflash, puppets aren't to today's kids as they were to  you as a kid anyhow. <br /> <br />Anywho, as the title states, I found this movie to be quite funny but goes too far in places. I don't mean too offensive by quality. I mean by quantity. Off the head example... \\"America, F**K YEAH!!!\\" is pretty much all you need to get that point across in that song. The rest (while potentially funny) is going to just be filler. The \\"when we come for you\\" part was funny, but the whole \\"Lick my butt and suck on my balls\\" is redundant. We already got the point (and cracked up), but thanks. <br /> <br />This is common with offensive/funny shows/movies though. It's hard to walk the line without teetering to either side. It didn't keep me from liking it in this case though (obvious by my review). I was laughing through most of the movie even if it was sometimes psuedorandom laughter stemming from previous moments in the movie. (I loved when the guy \\"acts\\" his way into a terrorist hideout. That was great.) <br /> <br />If you're easily offended by crude jokes, don't watch this. If you don't like your beliefs being satired, don't watch this. And, while the title should make it clear for many of you your beliefs are going to be made fun of, be sure even if the title sums up your opinion of politics, you're still going to be made fun of. That's one of the things I like about this: it's equally irreverent to everyone. If you like or can ignore crassness and still enjoy yourself, this movie will probably have you in tears.  <br /> <br />I'll put it this way: I wouldn't call my grandmother (upper 60's) a prude or prissy by any means... but I would say she comes off as... aristocratic. She told me she saw this movie over the internet one day and I immediately thought \\"Oh God... >.&lt;\\" only to be surprised with \\"It was extremely humorous. It was a bit... crass in places... but I enjoyed it.\\" <br /> <br />So there you have it, even grandmothers like Team America: World Police ;) ;)
0307120007|4.0|My 1 year old loves this book so much she tore it to pieces. It has many touch and feel items such as 1) a soft bunny and \\"daddy's\\" scratchy beard to touch,  2) flowers to smell, and 3) a boy who has a cloth over his face to play peek-a-boo with. It is truly a classic!   <br /> <br />I did not give this book 5 stars because of its plastic ring binding, which allows children to easily tear the book apart. I have had to piece this book together several times and at this point it is beyond repair.
B000002UAX|4.0|I'd like to begin saying that the \\"howard tuttleman\\" person really has nothing else to do with his life than write a -really lame- bad review for the best band ever. Have a nice day. <br />I think I recall Ringo saying the White Album should have been released separately because it was too much information for one record. George Martin agreed, while George Harrison justified the double album by saying that they all had a lot of songs and had to record them to move on. Paul said he loved it the way it was. <br />I love the White Album for its diversity, because it contains so many legendary songs that have earned their own hype. You have Helter Skelter, a song by Paul mainly, that had the Beatles exhausted for recording one of the first, if not the very first, hard rock track ever. Along with Piggies, it was interpreted by serial killer Charles Manson as \\"messages\\", and consequently inspired him to... well, kill. <br />Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da is a beautiful song of the classic Beatle sing alongs, with its hidden clues to confuse the listener. I personally love that one, along with Back in the USSR (awesome). Other songs I love are Everybody's Got Something to Hide... which its really tongue-in-cheek title referring to the Maharishi. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is a classic. Dear Prudence, Happiness is a Warm Gun (one of my favorite songs ever), Sexy Sadie, I Will, which is a lovely song Paul wrote in India, Julia which is a heartfealt song John wrote for his mother, among so many other beautiful tracks.  <br />Some people don't like albums to be catalogued as legendary. But this one is, sorry.
B000002J27|4.0|Recorded at Trident Studios, London in October-November 1975 after the departure from the group of lead singer Peter Gabriel, and released on February 2, 1976, this is the first Genesis album with the band's drummer, Phil Collins, on lead vocals. It's a 51-minute album, and reached #31 on the Billboard 1976 Pop Albums chart.<br /><br />This and the sister album, Wind and Wuthering, are the last truly progressive studio albums by the band before the departure of their guitarist, Steve Hackett, and their subsequent pop stardom. The lyrical themes have an English-folktale quality similar to their classic early-70s albums. My favorite songs here are \\"Dance On A Volcano\\", \\"Trick of the Tail\\", and \\"Los Endos\\".<br /><br />The songs:<br />\\"Dance On a Volcano\\" describes some type of chase and flight to the top of a volcano where the flowing lava causes the hero to do a \\"dance\\". In 7/8-tempo, it features some heavy prog rock keyboards, and became part of their regular concert setlist for the next several years.<br />\\"Entangled\\" is a 6/8-tempo ballad with acoustic guitar and ending with a nice keyboard solo.<br />\\"Squonk\\" tells a myth about a tearful fairy being hunted by following his trail of tears. The lyrics don't quite fit the music rhythmically, causing alot of Collins' vocals to be indecipherable. On the other hand, it has some of Collins' most propulsive drumming on this album.<br />\\"Mad Man Moon\\" - a Tony Banks song.<br />\\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\" is an upbeat 7/4-tempo song with a lively keyboard solo in the middle.<br />\\"Ripples\\" is a relatively longer song at about 8 minutes. It has a calm, dreamlike feel with lyrics about sailing away and some extended keyboard solos. It was played in concert until the early 80s.<br />\\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" -- a mid-tempo 12/8 shuffle about a satyr's encounter with people. It has several key changes, and some doo-wop background vocals.<br />\\"Los Endos\\" -- a Phil Collins drums workout (no lyrics) that was played by Genesis on tour throughout the 70s and 80s, usually at the end of the concert before the finale (which was often \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" in the late 70s and \\"Turn It On Again\\" in the 80s).end of the concert before the finale (which was often \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" in the late 70s and \\"Turn It On Again\\" in the 80s).
B00000099Y|5.0|First, I don't view Maynard as some kind of prophet or deity. Second, I understand that not everyone shares the same taste in music. That having been said, anyone who listens to any Tool album only once and writes a negative review is a waste of precious oxygen. The brilliance of Tool's music doesn't always show up the first time. <br />On to Aenima: this album is fantastic. The best tracks are \\"Aenema,\\" \\"Stinkfist,\\" \\"Eulogy,\\" \\"H,\\" and \\"Forty-six & 2.\\" I will admit, some of the \\"filler\\" tracks are annoying, but that doesn't drag the whole album down. Many of the songs have deeper meanings that aren't immediately apparent (especially in conjuction with the song titles).
B00025ETIW|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of rock this heavy but you can't help but love My Chemical Romance.  The energy of the songs just picks you up and carries you along for the ride.  The songs are heavy and loud but are still very melodic (an absolute must for me) and each song tells it's own story. <br /> <br />1. Helena- 5/5 Great way to start out.  They kind of sound stoned at the very beginning but it picks up to a great chorus and a major adrenaline rush. <br /> <br />2. Give Em Hell, Kid- 5/5 Wow.  I don't know how they manage to keep up this energy throughout the whole CD but it's really flowing by this second song. <br /> <br />3. To the End- 5/5 Probably my favorite song on the CD but it's a hard choice.  It talks about a very screwed up marriage.  Kind of gives you the creeps at the beginning, goes into a slightly pop (but still pretty heavy) verse and moves on to top the whole thing off with another great chorus. <br /> <br />4. You Know what the do to Guys like us in Prison- 5/5 First MCR song I ever heard.  My friend made me listen to it and I was immeditely impressed but still kind of intimadated by the look of the CD.  The words in this song are amazingly clear and you can understand a lot the first time.  Anyway, this is another high energy level chorus but the beginning of the song is about as soft as MCR ever gets. <br /> <br />5. I'm not okay (I promise)- 4/5 A good song but probably the lightest one of the album (which really isn't saying that much).  It's a pretty good song but, in my opinion, doesn't really compare to the first four. <br /> <br />6. The Ghost of You- 4.5/5 I have no idea why I love this song so much now.  I didn't really pay much attention to it the first time.  Probably because it sounds a lot like lostprophets and I'm a huge fan of theirs.  It's kind of on the slow side and has a chorus of \\"Never coming home, never coming home\\" <br /> <br />7. The Jetset life is Gonna kill you- 3.5/5 Starts out with an organ.  Another kind of slow song (kind of.  MCR doesn't really have any slow songs).  It's a good song and if it were on another CD, I would probably give it a higher rating but I feel like they can do better.  My favorite part of the song is a very short phrase during which they say \\"Check into the Hotel Belle Muerte\\" with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br />8. Interlude- 3/5 Really random to smack down in the middle of a hundred mile per hour songs.  It lasts under a minute but is kind of pretty. <br /> <br />9. Thank you for the Venom- 5/5 Really good, really heavy fast-paced song.  Full of energy. <br /> <br />10. Hung Em High- 3/5 Starts out with a cool kind of Israeli sounding intro and then the guitars all come in on a really heavy note.  I like this song but it's not a favorite. <br /> <br />11. It's not a fashion statement, it's a death wish- 4/5 This should have been called \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" and been the title song because it's all about revenge.  Really, really good intro (probably my favorite intro).  The actual song itself is not one that stands out but it's still good. <br /> <br />12. Cemetary Drive- 4.5/5 I really like this song.  Probably because it's really sad.  One of those sort of slow songs (most of the songs which could be slow pick up the pace at the chorus like this one).  About missing his dead lover. <br /> <br />13. I never told you what I do for a living- 5/5 About being a assain and constantly feeling dirty (\\"The kind of dirty where the water never washes off the clothes\\").  A really good quick song with some screaming. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great buy.  Although it's parental advisory, it's very low on cussing.  Probably parental advisory for the subject matters of the songs (most of the songs have something to do with death or being a criminal.)  The only thing which this could possibly be lacking is an actually slow song but it's a very, very small hole.  I doubt MCR could make a good slow song but their fast paced songs really more than make up for it.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Is this the same coldplay that released Trouble, or Green Eyes, Or In My Place?  This album is a huge let down, but due to their past great songs i couldnt bring myself to rate it lower than a 3. <br /> <br />It would have been nice if the band decided to show up for a few tracks.... <br /> <br />Coldplay tried too hard on this album, all the lyrics sound so forced.  Speed of Sound is a nice song, its alright (it aint clocks tho). Fix You is a really nice song, probably the best.  Everything else is pretty bad.  They tried to have abstract, yet comprehensible lyrics, all they turned out was crap. <br /> <br />Coldplay is still a good bad and i'll still be listening to their old songs but this album is a HUGE let down...
0805066691|5.0|This book tells the Indians' side of the story and therefore is very biased.  It does not try to hide that fact.  Not included are atrocities committed by the Indians against settlers.  But it is nevertheless a viewpoint that needs to be told, and Dee Brown tells it well.<br /><br />It's not the first book that reports from this viewpoint.  This book is similar to Helen Hunt Jackson's book which was written almost a century earlier.  Despite Jackson's depiction of unforgivable behavior, it not only continued but got worse as Dee Brown eloquently describes in his book.<br /><br />This book is easy so easy to read it almost seems like a novel, but unfortunately it is nonfiction.  The book is peppered with footnotes and references to documents that support the accounts, a quality that is often lacking in other books on this subject.  I've researched other issues at the National Archives, and let me tell you, it is time consuming and a pain in the neck to request a few documents.  The volume of material that Dee Brown cites in his book definitely took a lot of painstaking research and patience.<br /><br />I have two complaints:<br />1) It ends in 1890: atrocities and mistreatment of Native Americans continued for over a century.<br />2) It doesn't tell the many GOOD things that the evil white man has done.  Yes, there were people who did not kill, rob and/or imprison Native Americans.  Some were honest and treated them fairly, and some, like Helen Hunt Jackson, petitioned Congress and the President on behalf of Native Americans.  I wish those acts were included also.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I refused to see this film in the theater and only watched it on DVD when a friend got it with a free rental.  I haven't seen such such blatant and unapologetic propaganda since my World History Professor screened the films of Hitler in class.  Moore is like a spoiled little brat who likes to sit in class and heckle the teacher.  I was fortunate enough to have already downloaded copies of \\"the 59 Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11\\" for myself and my friend.  Moore's self-righteous attitude and condescending demeanor with those he talks to in the movie actually caused me to feel physically nauseous. <br />He not only ignores facts and leaves them out of his film, but makes up information and uses editing tricks to manipulate facts for his personal gain.  The quality of the film and the choppy editing made me feel like I was watching a film version of a Schizophrenic's scrapbook. <br />Moore's winning the Cannes film festival Palmes D'or doesn't prove that he is a great filmmaker but rather exposes the political leanings of the judges.  I wonder, would they have awarded a film expose about Bill Clinton? <br />Moore's movies are not documentaries.  They are propaganda for anarchists.  I fyou truly want to see a documentary, I suggest renting any film by Ken Burns.  His films are entertaining, educational and thought-provoking. <br />Moore's film is pornographic recruitment material for terrorists.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead isn't the scariest zombie movie ever made. It's probably not the funniest movie ever made. Frankly, I don't care either way. This is a great movie. Its off-the-wall humor, endlessly quotable dialogue (Pete's 4 AM freak-out is my favorite), and subtle references to other horror films make Shaun of the Dead worth watching over and over again.
B00003CX9E|3.0|The reviews on this site are either \\"best film ever\\" types, or \\"this is garbage\\".  In each camp, the reviewers insult the other camp.  Each camp screams that the other camp has no taste.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is not, in my opinion, anywhere close to being the best film ever.  I've seen several movies in the last few weeks that I believe are better - Amelie and Aguirre The Wrath Of God.  I'm sure there are dozens more I would place above Citizen Kane.  But it does have some points in its favor.<br /><br />It is the story of an extremely egocentric man.  Maybe that is redundant.  Aren't we all extremely egocentric.  Most of us are.  I don't think we can comfortably point at Kane and say we are so different, that we can't be compared to him.<br /><br />One of his traits was a desire to show how right he was, how \\"good\\" he was.  That is why he finished his employee's negative review of his own wife's singing, despite the fact that it would hurt his wife's feelings terribly and even make himself look bad.  He did it to demonstrate how wonderful he was.  Don't we all like to be right, to show people up, to win every argument.<br /><br />Despite his egocentricity, Kane wasn't a bad man.  He was actually a very good one.  Better than most.<br /><br />Apparently the one thing he cherished most was the joy of childhood.  I'd go along with that.  I think the happiest times of my life were in childhood too.  Once we grow up, things start to get complicated and go bad, and we start to make mistakes and get hurt.<br /><br />I never trust cliches, and it is a cliche that this movie is the very best film ever made, and it was produced impeccably.  I disagree on both points.  My biggest criticism of it is that it doesn't reach me, on a gut level, or on an emotional level, or even on an intellectual level, as much as some others do.<br /><br />The first time I saw it, many years ago, it disappointed me very much.  Parts of it dragged, parts of it were draining.  I would have described the slow parts as ponderous and tiresome.<br /><br />Seeing it for a second time, I thought it was worth 3 stars out of 5.  It is not the masterpiece it's cracked up to be, but it does have its strengths.<br /><br />I will not join the masses bowing to the genius Orson Welles, just as I will not join the masses bowing to the genius Stanley Kubrick.  I think they are both overrated, particularly Kubrick, but when it comes to the word \\"overrated\\", Orson Welles and Citizen Kane come quickly to mind.<br /><br />Another film that is often called the greatest of all time is Casablanca.  I'd have to take Casablanca over Kane.ld have described the slow parts as ponderous and tiresome. <br /> <br />Seeing it for a second time, I thought it was worth 3 stars out of 5.

B00005N7Z1|4.0|All I could remember from the first time I saw \\"Robocop\\" was blood.  Gunshot wounds, dismembered limbs, you name it.  I decided to rent this movie again to see if there was more to the story.  Surprisingly enough, there WAS more to it than just the violence.  In a futuristic Detroit, officer Murphy(Peter Weller) gets blown to bits(and I mean BLOWN) by a very vicious group of drug dealers led by Kurtwood Smith.  The city's officials decided to combine Murphy's body with machine parts(Kind of like the old show \\"The Six-Million Dollar Man\\").  After the makeover, Murphy's bloodied, disarayed body stood as the new defender of justice, Robocop.  This film has some very dark humor that I missed the first time I saw it, which makes \\"Robocop\\" a little smarter than most action flicks.  Of course the collection of big explosions, lethal gunshots, and bloodied bodies that get thrown around like paper dolls shouldn't disappoint action buffs in the least.  No one on the cast of \\"Robocop\\" really impressed me, except Kurtwood Smith.  I was so used to watching him on \\"That 70's Show\\", that when I saw him in this film(as a bad guy) I was so shocked.  His character was so evil that I actually felt good when Robocop finished him off towards the end of the movie.         \\"Robocop\\" turned out to provide better viewing the second time than the first time(for me).  It should be noted, however, that this movie is rated \\"R\\" and should NOT be watched by children(or the squeamish).
B0006L16N8|4.0|Everyone gives Chris Martin so much credit that the music of Coldplay almost goes unidentified. It's the music WITH Martin that makes Coldplay so unique because the focus isn't just on the voice itself, but the melodies, the timings, the pauses, EVEYRTHING! <br />Although \\"Speed of Sound\\" isn't my FAVORITE song on this album,  i went out and bought the CD hoping i would hear more great songs! I absolutely love this album and would recommend it to anyone because Coldplay has a cool sound that's right for your ear. Not too loud, and not too soft. Chris Martin's voice on \\"What If\\" is absolutely haunting. These guys play their instruments like they mean it, and when Chris sings, you can seriously feel it. \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" is such a great ballad, it's like a lullaby <br />All in all, this album is great.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is the pinnacle of Tool's evolution as a band. It's not as heavy as their previous albums, but that's okay. Lateralus continues the Tool traditions of thought-provoking lyrics, excellent drumming from Danny Carey, and bizarre song titles. Simply put, no one should give this album less than a five-star rating. This IS the best album of all time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|*WARNING: MINOR SPOILER* Every person I have introduced to this show (approx. 6 people) has fallen in love with it. It has everything; action, adventure, suspense, mystery, scifi, romance, humor, social commentary, drama, crime drama, ... there's more but I don't have the right words to define it. I knew I'd like this show when Captain Malcolm kicked the antagonist into the engine at the end of the first aired episode. I knew I'd love this show when I could distinguish each of the nine characters and cared about each characters individual storyline. That was about the third episode.

1573223026|3.0|<br />In his fourth novel, Nick Hornby tackles a very weighty subject; writing a book about suicide ultimately means writing a book about the value of life. In this sense, \\"A Long Way Down\\" starts off with promise, but ultimately ends up feeling rather empty.  <br /> <br />The book begins on New Year's Eve, when four very different people meet on a London rooftop, each planning to commit suicide. Instead of going through with their plans, however, they form an unlikely support group of sorts. \\"A Long Way Down\\" follows these four characters as they deal with the reasons behind their suicide attempts as well as the new bonds they form with one another.  <br /> <br />The narrative passes between the four main characters, with each relating a consecutive chapter in their story. By designing the narrative in this way, Hornby deals with the difficulties of having four main characters quite well; I felt an intimate attachment to all four without the plot losing a sense of urgency. Indeed, the narrative style is one of the high points of the book.  <br /> <br />Overall, though \\"A Long Way Down\\" gets off to a great start, at some point it loses its ability to inspire sympathy in the reader. The main failure of \\"A Long Way Down\\" is the same as in every other Hornby book: the ending just cannot live up to the first three-quarters of the book. Hornby sets up a story that is both innovative and engaging, and addresses perhaps the most interesting questions of his writing career; everything falls flat, however, when he attempts to bring it all together.  <br /> <br />Hornby creates characters that the reader can both understand and identify with; the reasons each character attempts suicide are communicated honestly and with heart, and the characters always seem more than their suicidal tendencies. However, at some point, I began to feel disconnected with the characters; they lost their realness, and seemed to evaporate before my eyes. I know what each character ultimately chooses, but I have no idea why; I can guess, but a large effort is necessary to pin these characters back down and flesh them out again. I cannot say exactly whether this is because Hornby's answers are too trite or too glib; either way, his answers failed to inspire reflection in me.  <br /> <br />In short, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is a very entertaining book, but entertainment is ultimately all it has to offer: don't read it expecting insight. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|WHY did Fox cancel this show?  It had SO MUCH potential!  I watched the \\"Making of Firefly\\" on the DVD last night, and I could tell that Joss was frustrated with the Fox upper brass from the start. <br /> <br />Fair warning for anyone who purchases this DVD:  It will leave you wanting more.  I've also seen the movie (was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview) and, while the movie was great, it was different from the series.  The series was all about character development and making you fall in love with the crew (which Fox so irresponsibly denied us the chance of fulfillment).  The movie is more plot-driven.  So, while I loved the movie, I sincerely hope that the result is MORE EPISODES! <br /> <br />Enjoy it!
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is definetely a demonstration of what a Coldplay album should be.  <br /> <br />1) Square 1: Great opening, intro is similar to theme from 2001: Space Odyssey... <br />2) What If: Wow, great song, nice piano, just gets better and better... <br />3) White Shadows: Good, but not really gonna get anywhere... <br />4) Fix You: Probably the second best song on album, great organ in it, too... <br />5) Talk: Okay, not that great... <br />6) X&Y: Like it very much, great use of instruments... <br />7) Speed of Sound: Probably best song on album, new big hit, too... <br />8) A Message: Same old, same old, pretty good... <br />9) Low: Very good, recommend it... <br />10) The Hardest Part: Love it! Great song... <br />11) Swallowed in the Sea: Third best song on album probably, really good... <br />12) Twisted Logic: Also very good use of instruments... <br />13) Till Kingdom Come: Nice closing song with guitar.. <br /> <br />Well that's it! This is a very well-made album. I think it may be the best seller of the year so far.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Not since the days of the original Batman feature film adaptation back in 1989 have fans of the Cape Crusader experienced joy with the venerable franchise on the big screen. Burton's follow-up to the perennial favorite entitled Batman Returns did not quite live up to the expectations that had been set down for it. Maybe too much had been demanded of it to live up to the greatness of the original or two major villains in one picture was bit much for audiences to handle. Whatever the reason may be the Batman franchise was never the same from that moment on. When Burton dropped out, director Joel Schumacher stepped in to take over the directing reins. And in spite of Batman Forever's success, grossing twelve million more in domestic box office receipts then the previous installment, fan fervor over Schumacher's neon obsession began to boil over and came to head with the introduction of the `nipple suit'. Director Christopher Nolan, the man behind the critically acclaimed Memento and Insomnia, now returns fans to where the legend began to return the Dark Knight to his beloved glory. <br /> <br />The story for Batman Begins strays dramatically away from the direction in which past franchise films have been forced which, thankfully, is a good thing in this instance. Batman Begins harkens back to the gritty atmosphere that was so abundant in Tim Burton's original adaptation and even proceeds to take audiences one step further. Though dark in tone, Burton's Batman remained set in the realm of fantasy which, in its own right, was fine at the time but Christopher Nolan makes the Dark Knight real, which in effect strikes a stronger tone with audiences. Knowing that the Cape Crusader is made of flesh and blood, that he can be knocked down or burnt to crisp and left for dead like the rest of us and yet get up and continue the fight to win the day makes him a far more captivating mythological figure then if he were invincible. <br /> <br />Christian Bale, a rising performer who to the surprise of many has been in the movie industry for several years now, has at long last come into his own in the role of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne which is merely an alter-ego for the Dark Knight who battles crime and injustice on the streets of Gothem when the sun sets. Bale is nothing short of remarkable in his portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, a more realistic and gothic style version then modern audiences, plagued with the nightmarish images of neon splattered Schumacher creations long gone, are not accustomed to, even those who are old enough to recall Tim Burton's adaptation of the Cape Crusader in the late-1980s. Bruce Wayne is an inordinately conflicted man, battling not only the crime lords and the gangsters for the streets of Gothem City but also with his alter-ego, Batman, for control of his personal life and even with himself for the direction in which his life after his parents' deaths is to proceed and in what capacity. Bale, like Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise, proves effectively, both through heart-wrenching emotions and body language, that the life of a superhero is not what it is cracked up to be. <br /> <br />Liam Neeson is positively impeccable as Ducard, the mysterious and often deceivable assistant to Ra's Al Ghul who tracks down Bruce Wayne so that he may train him in the ways of the League of Shadows in order to overcome his fears and enact justice on the city of Gothem. Though he undoubtedly has the talent capacity to successfully pull off a performance like this one, it remains a bit unnerving, at least for some, to see him in a role as this, especially after his powerful role in Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning film, Schindler's List. Ducard is the type of character who presents a truly emotional roller coaster attraction for his audience. He clearly has the right intentions in mind, wanting to combat injustice and stave off evil, but as Bruce Wayne discovers he takes his dedication to preserving justice to an unhealthy level in which the `heroes' are almost as bad as the villains themselves. Just as you grasp the concept he is advocating he goes and says something that touches a moral nerve. Easily the most diabolical villain in the Batman film franchise to date. <br /> <br />Alright, putting it as concisely and politely as possible, Katie Holmes' performance as the persistent and slightly perky, particularly near the end of the film if anyone noticed, assistant district attorney Rachael Dawes is not exactly as prestigious as her newfound beau Tom Cruise built it up to be but neither was it as disastrous as it certainly could have been, especially given her track record of `distinguishable' projects. The romantic aspect of the storyline between her and the Cape Crusader's alter-ego Bruce Wayne, though undeniably evident from the beginning, is quite possibly the most downplayed of the Batman franchise which to say is not a bad thing given that its audience cares more about the story and the action then anything else, particularly romance. All in all, Miss Holmes, likely to be Mrs. Cruise soon, will not be missed terribly given she was the only cast member not to be picked up for the upcoming sequel, likely to the fallout caused by her relationship with Tom Cruise. But it is tradition, in much the same vein as the James Bond franchise, for the Batman films to interchange the love interest of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne to keep things flowing, so for fans this will be use to this. <br /> <br />Two villains which fixture prominently into the Batman Begins storyline appear to be quite underutilized, at least from first glance. These would be Dr. Jonathan Crane, more commonly referred to as the Scarecrow, played fiendishly by Cilian Murphy and Ra's Al Ghul, a stylized performance commanded by Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe. However, it would seem as though Crane is used merely as a distraction, and the same can be said of Ken Watanabe's character as well, and was never meant to be used tohis full capacity in this chapter of the Batman saga. Given that he was never officially captured at the end of the film, the Scarecrow may play a part in pictures to come, with two sequels already in the works with Nolan at the helm, but with The Joker clearly being the featured villain in the second movie, it doesn't seem likely. <br /> <br />The always entertaining British actor Michael Caine brings to the role of Bruce Wayne's faithful butler Alfred a style that is all his own. For the first time Alfred is not exclusively viewed as only Bruce Wayne's dear friend and close confidante but also the lone father figure following the deaths of his parents. Gary Oldman scores a home run performance in the role of Sergeant Jim Gordon. Fans of the Dark Knight will certainly be taken back a bit by the lackluster appearance and stammer of Jim Gordon, clearly noting how far he has come from when the comic book superhero's story began. Those unfamiliar with the Batman legend or the feature film franchise will view Gordon, the only good egg in the bunch as far as the police force in Gothem is concerned, as a pathetic sap, in spite of his willingness moral standings, which only increases the audience's anguish for the prospects of the city. Though Morgan Freeman is delightful as Lucius Fox, he is not seen in quite the capacity audiences may expect, which is a bit disappointing to say the least, but there is hope his character's role in the Batman legend will expand with the upcoming sequels. <br /> <br />Overall, Christopher Nolan at the helm of Batman Begins triumphantly returns the Dark Knight to his long since forgotten former glory which existed in the time of Tim Burton's original big screen adaptation and even exceeds expectations by taking the Cape Crusader to a level which he has never experienced before - the real world. True, not everything which takes place in Batman Begins has its basis in reality but the characters and their actions are more intone with our worldthen in any other film present in the franchise which makes it so poignant and insightful. These individuals, these human beings, are easily vulnerable and are not the squeaky-clean heroic figures your parents grew up with. Though Bruce Wayne eventually finds the path of justice which would lead him to become the legendary figure he is seen as today, he contemplated killing his parents' attacker in cold-blood as he left the courtroom and would have gone through with it if it were not for an assassin sent by the mob boss of Gothem. And in spite of their perceivable evolution in character and spirit as the film progresses towards its climax and beyond, the closing credits of the picture hardly mark the end of their progression, which will continue through the rest of the series. Likely the most frequent complaint from audiences will be that there exists not enough action in the storyline to make the film as interesting in terms of scope as the rest of the franchise. There is a reason the film is called Batman `Begins'. Starting from scratch, Christopher Nolan must develop these characters from the ground up and, through the process of a few sequels in the near future, make them into the mythological figures we have come to cherish. We can only hope, not expect it if history has taught us anything, that the integrity of this new chapter in the Batman film franchise will remain intact as the series continues and not deteriorate in light of its public and critical success.
B00008A7QK|5.0|T Rex's 'Electric Warrior' is one of those rare albums (The Beatles' 'Sgnt Pepper' and Pink Floyd's 'Darkside of the Moon' come to mind) that really stand the test of time. It is unbelieveable how this album still sounds 'fresh' and 'innovative' now as it did over 30 years ago! <br /> <br />The album contains great mix of songs from 'hard rock' (Jeepster, Rip Off, etc...) to 'ballad' (Girl, Life's a Gas, etc...). I honestly think that Marc Bolan is the most underrated song writer (and guitarist) ever! Give it a listen and you'll see why.
B0002OERI0|3.0|There are a few good songs on this album, which saves me from endlessly bashing it. However, everything that made Green Day brilliant is gone. What we saw back in albums like Dookie, Kerplunk, Insomniac and even Nimrod is gone. American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are incredibly annoying, and Holiday isn't great either. Well that rules out the singles. <br /> <br />There are some good songs, like I said earlier. We are the Waiting is a decent song, and I used to love it, but I became tired of it. <br /> <br />Despite the incredibly annoying and childish intro, Letterbomb is a pretty good song. Whatsername isn't bad either. <br /> <br />Overall, a so-so album. If you want a good example of what green day can do, get one of their first four albums (1029/ Smoothed out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, Dookie or Insomniac) instead of this one. This is what happens when you feed a good band to MTV. Their music suffers a whole lot.
B00005JKJA|5.0|One of the greatest films ever made manages to explore Hollwood's dark side, take you on a thrill ride and leaves you wondering at the end, \\"Say What.\\"  There is one thing made clear, however.  Hollywood,  David Lynch tells us,  is actually a car wreck in which one vehicle  going 100 miles an hour  smashes  into a another car that's stopped.  And guess what?  You're in the stopped car!  If your a young, attractive babe dreaming of being star, you better think about  that stopped car. That's the overall, riding message from director Lynch.  Now to the film. You like Brian DePalma's Hitchcock stuff. Yeah? Well watch how it's really done.  Try to take your eyes off the screen when our two leading ladies, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring, pay a visit to an address found in a phone book.  Here  the Angelo Badalamenti score,  the Peter Deming photography along with the stars and the Lynch direction make this scene and this movie a classic.  After this scene the tension breaks and the erotic scene that soon follows is set up perfectly. What a movie!  There's an unforgettable \\"Cowboy.\\" There's Ann Miller. There's a classic song from the 50's.  There's so many extra parts that are played so great, it would take a separate review alone just for that.  There's the Naomi Watts/Chad Everett scene.  And all the time, Lynch keeps telling us, Oh yeah, by the way, Hollywood is the Pit of Hell.  So I only have one question.  What's next Daivd?
B000002LIM|5.0|Since Batman Begins, the 1989 Batman and the 1992 Batman Returns have been the best visually dynamic representations of what Batman should look like on the silver screen.  Danny Elfman was, bar none, the absolute best choice as composer for these two movies.  From Batman's loud and bombastic fanfare to the utterly creepy rendition of \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" for Joker's theme, Elfman blends nuances and creates a new taste of movie soundtracks.  Without doubt, this is the most interesting and innovative soundtracks I have heard in a long time.    Unfortuantely, the music sampler above does not allow near enough time for one to fully appreciate the different tracks.  So if you're a Batman fan, a Danny Elfman fan, or just someone who enjoys buying movie soundtracks, be aware that you will be getting much, much more than what you previewed above.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is simply beautiful.  It is rare to run across something like this.  It is challenging, difficult and complex.  It is not a \\"listen once and decide\\" album.  This will require some work on the listener's part, but it is WELL WORTH THE EFFORT.  The rewards for your work are great.  Once you really get into \\"OK Computer\\" then go check out \\"Kid A.\\"  That one is even harder, but I love it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album changed my entire taste in music. It encouraged me to explore other genres and to search for new music. This album is a journey, and an intense one. Right from the incredible intro \\"son et lumiere\\" that flows into \\"inertiatic ESP\\" up till the incredible finale \\"take the veil cerpin taxt\\", this album will blow your mind. Worth every penny and then some.
0446678430|1.0|If you want general perspectives or approaches, do not buy this book.  <br /> <br />To sum it up -  this book goads readers to cheat on taxes and invest to the hilt in real estate. This could be great unless real estate prices start going down and as the US government starts closing the loopholes for their so called \\"passive income\\". <br /> <br />May be the tax laws in the US have enough loop holes but not sure if this is a general book for a world audience.
6305428522|5.0|A movie like Quiz Show is entertaining on so many levels...where to begin.<br /><br />The opening sequence; I don't know what it is about Bobby Darin singing Mack the Knife and the behind the scenes look at America turning on their TV's, but the opening few minutes pull you into a period of history.<br /><br />From that sequence the script moves swiftly, the characters are tightly drawn, and the stage is set for a morality play asking viewers about the nature of integrity.<br /><br />While all acting in this movie is outstanding, the direction almost transcends these solid performances, making the actors look like they are simply doing their job rather than carrying a story.<br /><br />That said, I really enjoyed Rob Morrow, perhaps for the surprising depth of his acting ability (I didn't know he had it in him). Ralph Fiennes seems like an actor you expect greatness from (and he delivers). Hank Azaria is great. And John Turturo is outstanding.<br /><br />Overall there are few movies I will watch repeatedly just to follow a sequence or hear an actor utter a few lines of dialog. This is certainly one those movies.<br /><br />After A River Runs Through It and Quiz Show, you'd think Robert Redford can do no wrong. But then you watch the Horse Whisperer...
B00005JNJT|5.0|I agree with all the positive reviews of this entertaining and well-acted movie.  The previous Batman movies were lukewarm whereas Batman Begins is BURNING HOT!  There's no comparison.<br /><br />I am very glad I saw Batman Begins at the IMAX.  The sound was big and rich, the images crystal clear.  I did hear a little boy cry for a minute at the very beginning because the colossal screen and full sounds are a new experience for those of us who do most of our viewing in front of a comparatively much smaller TV screen.  And children if not adults do fear most things new. (by the by, FEAR is the main subject of this enjoyable movie) If you're unusually sensitive to booming sounds, be advised that the sound is louder but not more offensive than most standard movie theaters.  That's one of my big gripes of the standard movie theaters, whenever the volume increased, the amplifiers could not handle the extra noise volume and all I could focus on was the annoying tinny noise & the vibrating speakers.  It was a relief to actually watch a movie and not be distracted by noticing something wrong with either the theater or the movie itself.<br /><br />The best way to experience this ab-fab movie is @ the IMAX.  As soon as the movie ended, most people could not help but clap.  Rare for a movie relesed these days.  It is an all-over physical/mental experince not to be missed.<br /><br />p.s.  when I got home from the IMAX last night, I turned the TV on and the Batman Begins movie commercial was on!  I was amazed at how much of the experience was sacrificed on the reduced images.  There's no comparison.
0345457684|5.0|This book is tremendously entertaining and wonderfully thought provoking. Morgan carefully constructs a brave new world for mankind and thrusts Takeshi Kovacs as our ever-resourceful \\"guide.\\" This book is more than a SCI-FI, murder mystery... well maybe not murder, because the murder victim has been \\"sleeved\\" back into his clone and seeks to find the person who killed him... well, killed his former body anyway. The book deals with social issues like morality, religion, cloning, prejudice, and wealth. It is these conflicts that drive Kovacs from one high tech adventure to another.  <br /> <br />Morgan paces the story quite well. The suspenseful passages of the book are heightened with atmosphere and deliberateness. The action sequences in the book are fast-paced with high-octane conflicts. The villains are ruthless and unforgiving. And,  Kovacs is the reluctant but dynamic hero who gives as much as he gets, and then some. It should be noted that a few sections of the book are quite \\"rugged\\" and not for the squeamish. <br /> <br />Morgan is true to the SCI-FI genre by presenting a futuristic world with refeshingly bold and innovative technology concepts. Morgan also writes a fine \\"who-done-it\\" with many twists and conspiracies to thrill the reader. Best of all, the author resonates with the thunder of H.G. Wells as he wrestles with social mores that conflict society. <br />
B0000942QM|4.0|The true highlight of this recording is the 2nd track, \\"The Murder Of Love\\" - this CD is worth the price just for that incredible composition all on its own. Otherwise, an amazing listening experience from start to finish, best played uninterrupted with a great set of headphones.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I missed this movie in the cinemas and regretted it so much. Needless to say, I have been waiting for this DVD release for a long time and was very excited when I finally got hold of it. You have to know, my expectation for this movie was over the roof...and normally, movies with that much anticipation has always disappointed me. But here, I'm happy to say that it was justified. This is a superb movie, beautiful in so many levels. <br /> <br />First, I think I need to say this so that you'll know where my point of view is coming from. I'm in my early 20's and I know very little about Howard Hughes. People like Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner ring a bell, but I've never seen their movies, nor even knew how they looked. So basically, I am reviewing this movie more for it's entertainment value than it's historical accuracy. <br /> <br />The movie starts with a young boy, being bathed my his mother. She creates horror stories about diseases and plagues surrounding the world today and immediately, we get a sense of where this movie is heading. The next scene starts with the filming of Hell's Angels, and it looks grandiose, it seems something only Howard Hughes is capable of doing. That sets the tone for the whole movie and we then see the life of Howard Hughes unfold, and guess what...it's a thrilling ride full of awe and excitement. We are given glimpses of his playboy life. What happens when his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder kicks in, and how it affects his life. And how much of a perfectionist he was. This movie provoked so much emotion and fascination that, believe me...after watching it, I was actually browsing the internet for more about Howard Hughes, I wanted to know what happened in the remainder of his life. Honestly, few movies stir my curiosity as much as this. <br /> <br />What keeps the movie afloat is the story of Howard Hughes himself, and the fantastic performances from everyone in this movie. This was supposed to be Leonardo DiCaprio's passion project, and it's not hard to see why. Howard Hughes' life was every guy's dream. The rise to power, the ability to achieve greatness. The underdog that defies all odds. Yet, the question nagging us at the back of our head, can he do it? Will he realize his vision or will his disease be too much to handle? This separates The Aviator from any other biopic out there. In the more than capable hands of Martin Scorsese, the story comes alive. The era of the late 20's to the 40's is represented very well. Of course, I'm not from that era...but from what I've read about it, that would be exactly how I imagined it to be. There is so much life and color to this movie, it amazes me everytime I watch it. Strengthening the movie are also breath-taking special effects and Howard Shore's sweeping score. Although this movie runs for about three hours, there is never a dull moment. And trust me, I'm not usually a fan of long movies. <br /> <br />The stellar cast of The Aviator is led by Leonardo DiCaprio. Though there are many DiCaprio haters out there, giving all kinds of excuses like he looks too pretty to be taken seriously, or he's too short to play Howard Hughes....there remains one undeniable fact, he delivers a magnificent performance in this movie. Although I hated him in Titanic, DiCaprio has really impressed me lately, giving really good performances in 2 of my all time favorite movies, Catch Me If You Can and Gangs Of New York. Something I've always respected about him is that, while actors his age are doing romantic comedies, no-brainer horror movies and thrillers, he takes risks by playing tough roles. He's lucky to have worked with amazing people like Spielberg and Scorsese and he shows no signs of slowing down. Playing Howard Hughes, his acting would eventually make or break this movie, but fortunately everything comes together brilliantly. I believe this to be his best performance yet. That's not saying there's no room for improvement though, give this guy about 5 years...I won't be surprised if he goes down as one of Hollywood's legendary actors. Playing a man who is unbelievably great but at the same time going insane, is not an easy task but DiCaprio pulls it off very well. They say that there's a fine line separating genius from insanity, and Howard Hughes is the perfect example. The scene in the bathroom, where Howard Hughes washes his hands till they bleed, and then is afraid to open the door for fear of germs on the knob, is classic. Watch the movie, and you'll understand. <br /> <br />Backing DiCaprio is a plethora of talented actors, the who's who of Hollywood, namely Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich (the ever supportive Howard Hughes' right hand man), Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe (the head of Pan Am, Howard Hughes' competitor), and Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. In smaller but no less impressive roles are Frances Conroy, Willem Dafoe, and Jude Law. Special mention about Matt Ross, who played Howard Hughes' chief engineer, Odie...exceptional performance. As you can see, how could anyone go wrong with these people...each of them delivers memorable performances. <br /> <br />Ultimately, to me, everything in this movie comes together in perfect unity, thus the 5-star rating. I haven't been enthralled with a movie like this for a long time. I watched it three times in two days. It's movies like this that raises the bar for American cinema. Kudos to everyone involved in The Aviator. Don't listen to the naysayers, this is highly recommended!
B0007P3582|1.0|When are people going to wake up and realize rap music is more pathetic than anything else? 50 cent can't pronounce two words in a row correctly and should be *#@*@ slapped. This is the most homosexual music ever. Lame lame lame.
B000002N2P|5.0|Don't get me wrong by the title, this is one of my favorite Green Day albums. If you're a true Green Day fan, you'll notice that this album contains heavier, punkier, and somewhat emo music. It stands out from the rest of Green Day's albums. The reason this album is so heavy is because Billie Joe's first son had recently beeen born. His son cried throughout the night, so Bilie Joe would often write songs since he couldn't sleep. The song \\"Brain Stew\\" is supposed to describe how he felt.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is a perfect CD already but it's just not as deep as Dido's No Angel. But it does have many more good differences. First, it somehow has a sense of freedom, which seems to be a big step in Dido's song-writing skill. It uses easier and more simple words so the lyrics are more understandable and the melodies of the songs can easily step in people's minds. Overall, this is a good CD as I see a lot more life experiences. 5 stars.
0375703764|5.0|A playfully haunting read. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without the patience for po-mo high jinks, but I loved it. I woke up one night after reading myself to sleep and scrawled the following in my journal: \\"Up in the middle of the night -- the early of the morning -- thinking about House of Leaves: Kafka described it in \\"The Bridge\\": the untenability of living as we do, in houses of language. To realize this is to fall into the cracks between words and meaning -- cracks that open into impossible chasms from which no light escapes.\\" After finishing the book, I decided that was as good a description as any. I highly recommend Kafka's (very) short story \\"The Bridge,\\" by the way. Also, Danielewski's sister Poe's companion album, Haunted.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When you first listened to the videos which were shown on TV, you might have thought the songs were so weird and non-sense. But as you listen more carefully to the lyrics, as you realize the reasons of all the sounds in the songs, you will find every song a big treasure. The songs totally reflect the big work the traslators have done to change the language of the can't-be-deeper lyrics from Russian to English. This is totally worth buying. I'm sure t.A.T.u. won't have to be afraid to be forgotten or defeated by the other music bands because they have already created a unique place in the fans' hearts.
038572179X|5.0|This is a beautiful novel.  I read it because someone told me that it uses the same device as Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey and Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote -- two of my favorite 18th-century novels. It turns out that, while the narrative owes something to the 18th-century novel of sensibility, stylistically, it owes much more to Virginia Woolf -- one of my favorite writers of all time. In this, it is much more successful than Michael Cunningham's The Hours, which I liked okay, but which I found to fall very short as a reincarnation of Woolf. Towards the end of Atonement, as it gets all meta and begins to think aloud about its literary lineage, the writing brushes up against the gimmicky, but McEwan is such a controlled writer that it never quite goes over the edge.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has really taken me to the feelings and motions of all the songs in this album. After the last track is played, something still remains in my mind that makes me think and try to understand. This is the most fantastic artistic piece of work I've ever seen. But beware that the very deep moods in the song can keep you out the reality, the practical world. Isn't this what some busy people want to get? 5 worthwhile stars.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Director Christopher Nolan (director of Memento, Batman Begins) struck gold with his second big screen foray with the incredibly tense thriller \\"Insomnia\\".  A virtual nobody in Hollywood until his sleeper hit, \\"Memento\\", Christopher Nolan appears to be the go-to guy for murder/mystery thrillers.  To Christopher Nolan's credit, after making the incredibly confusing \\"Memento\\", he chose to make a more straight-forward mystery thrill ride and the move pays off big time.    \\"Insomnia\\" tells the story of LAPD detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who along with his partner, are sent up to Alaska to solve a startling murder of a teenage girl in a small quiet town.  The cops of this small town aren't sure what precipitated this murder, and they're not sure about the odd circumstances that surround the two LAPD detectives presence here, other than Dormer is a friend of the town's chief of police.  Things quickly get out of hand when a tip is given, as to the perpetrator's possible location, and a friendly fire accident leaves Dormer's partner dead and Dormer to blame for the shooting.  Things are only complicated further when the killer is the witness to the accidental shooting and knows that Dormer is trying to cover it up, because the reason LAPD sent them to Alaska, besides assisting in a murder investigation, was to get them away from Internal Affairs, and a \\"friendly-fire\\" altercation would seem greatly suspicious.  To top things off, it's the time of year in Alaska when there is constant sunlight, leaving Det. Dormer suffering from insomnia, and growing increasingly withdrawn and somewhat crazy.  With all of that occurring the killer chooses to use Dormer's guilt and cover-up as leverage in assisting him in placing the guilt of this small town girl's murder on someone else letting him off the hook.    \\"Insomnia\\" is superbly acted and directed, with stand-out performances by Al Pacino (no surprise there), Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank.  Excellent cast, with great material towork with, all held together by an incredible director.  This is one thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat and is not to be missed!    \\"Insomnia\\" is rated R for violence, language, and minor sexuality/nudity.
B0002BO0AS|3.0|The first time I listened to this cd it knocked my socks off. I was way impressed by how much better Unearth had gotten since their previous full length album. But now when I listen to it, I just can't seem to make it all the way through. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the music is way cool, I love most of the riffs, but as I am more of a \\"metal\\" kid than a \\"hardcore\\" kid, I can't take all the incessant breakdowns. I find myself constantly skipping the first song simply because I can't stand the weak political message (c'mon! what the heck does \\"does hate mean freedom\\" even mean???). That's actually a lot of my problem with this album, the lyrics just are so dark and mean and depressing and straight up brutal that I can only listen for so long. Plus, I completely disagree with most everything Trevor has to say (anybody see that pic on the Unearth site with him wearing a shirt that says \\"Listen to Michael Moore\\"...sorry Trevor, I ain't listening to either of you two!). <br /> <br />Tracks 2-5 are just fantastic though, whenever I listen to this album, I listen to those songs. When \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" wraps up what I would call an almost perfect EP (I know, it isn't an EP, and I know \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" isn't the last song on the album) I switch to some other, more uplifting music. <br /> <br />These are my problems with this cd, with different lyrics and less breakdowns (they seem like filler to be, to be honest) I would be much more satisfied with this album.
0440419514|4.0|I purchased this trilogy because of George Beahm (\\"Muggles and Magic\\") cited Philip Pullman as a possible \\"next J.K. Rowling.\\"  While Pullman is a gifted writer of great imagination, he is NOT Rowling, nor is \\"His Dark Materials\\" at all like the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Pullman's trilogy is stunning in his fashioning of a universe comprised of many parallel worlds inhabited by armored polar bears, angels, witches, and other fantastic creatures.  The love story of Lyra and Will is touching and ultimately heartbreaking.  In the end, however, I am put off by Pullman's rabid hatred of Christianity and Christians.  Under the guise of being a trilogy about and for pre-teen children, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is really a retelling of John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost,\\" in which God is the imperious tyrant/bad guy, and Satan and the other rebel angels are the good guys.<br /><br />It is true that the Christian church & clerics had committed evil in the past and present (think The Inquisition and today's pedophile priests).  However, Christianity has also been the cause of much good in history: Charity for the poor; orphanages and schools, especially in poor countries; great works of art (The Sistine Chapel!); West Europe's (and the world's) first universities; and nothing less than the preservation (by Irish monks) of Western civilization in the Dark Ages.  None of this can be found in \\"His Dark Materials.\\"  Instead, the Church (and Christianity) is portrayed as all evil, without exception.  But the fact of the matter is that no group is entirely good or evil.  Instead, good and evil people are found among all groups.  There are good and bad Christians, as there are good and bad Muslims, Buddhists, atheists, men, women, children, blacks, whites, gays, or straights.  No group has the monopoly on either virtue or vice.  It is Pullman's blanket portrayal of Christians as all evil that reveals his hidden agenda in \\"His Dark Materials\\"--an agenda that leaves a decidedly sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />A self-described atheist, Pullman is a very angry man.  As for the reason for his anti-Christian venom, perhaps one must look to his childhood and the dark recesses of his psychology.taste in my mouth.   <br /> <br />A self-described atheist, Pullman is a very angry man.

B000000OQF|5.0|If you are a fan of 80's metal, then \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" ranks right up there with Judas Priest's \\"British Steel\\", Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" as a must have. From the opening chords of Welcome to the Jungle to the final strains of \\"Rocket Queen\\", GnR's \\"Appetite\\" is just great. There really isn't much to reveiw on a song to song basis, because if you were alive in the 80's, then you heard almost all of the songs on this album countless times. \\"Appetite\\" was a metal-radio staple, and tunes like \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" are still played in heavy rotation on radio, and appear on quite a few movie soundtracks. The great thing about this album though, are all of the songs you might have forgotten about. Tunes like \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Night Train\\" can still get the blood pumping, and will have you playing air guitar all day.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|The cd doesn't even do him any justice comparing to actually seeing him live. But if you can't make it to a concert near you this is definitly a must have in your collection.

B00005U122|5.0|Holy Cow,  I saw the Floyd back in 94 and came away thinking something was missing.  I do know the history of that band and after watching this I came to the realization Roger Waters was the great big hole that couldn't be filled by all of the musicians that Gilmour, Mason, and Wright brought along for the tour. I did have the chance to see this tour back in 2000 and passed on it like a dummy. This is a great DVD, two and a half hours of music performed beautifully.  Doyle Bramhall II and Snowy White do adequate guitar work but are nowhere near the caliber of David Gilmour.  Still to hear these songs, some of which the Floyd didn't or wouldn't play in 94, done live is beyond words.  It's a Miracle to quote a song from this DVD. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a huge fan of Firefly and I anxiously await the release of Serenity in Sept 2005. I will be having a Firefly viewing of these DVDs for my friends soon. I think that Fox was insane for letting this show go--The Sci Fi channel will benefit greatly from a bad decision by Fox. <br /> <br />Cheers.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Have to say I'm big fan of DT classical releases (Awake, Metropolis, Images and words) and I believed these guys reached the bottom line and wouldn't do worse than they did in \\"Train of Thought, how wrong I was, the only talent put here is the talent  to make the entire album boring and disappointing, This is a class of what ..you young rock musicians reading this.. shouldn't do. Every single song is a crap. What a waste of money I did.  <br />I can't explain in more details this album cause my lack of English, but If you want to buy it anyway  I suggest you see the lower rated reviews first...believe me they express accurately what this title is .  <br />

B0006L16N8|5.0|While I love the sound of Coldplay, so far I have not been able to listen to the album in my laptop or in my ipod. <br /> <br />The record company have Copy Control software so that you cannot listen to the album as most of us do, in ipods or on laptops. <br /> <br />Well done EMI, I for one will never buy any copy controlled CD's again, as my rights were totally taken from me with this album and Gorillaz latest. <br /> <br />Beware buyers, you are being cheated big time.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am a fan of all War Movies but this mini series Band of Brothers is the best of all time. You really get to know the soldiers of Easy Company and you basically feel what they feel. I've already seen each episode at least 4 or 5 times. I Love it. There is also a documentary, which is very good. It is the actual men of Easy Company telling there story. If I were you i would buy this mini series.
B00004YM0D|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. However, I must note that there is one song missing from this wonderful soundtrack and it is the only song which would have \\"made\\" this one for me. In the movie, as the team was practicing at camp, a song I can only recall as \\"Time\\" was being played. I have wracked my brain trying to find the song and I have only found it in the movie. Why was it the only song in the movie not included on this great album?
0446608955|5.0|In his 3rd novel, New York Times bestselling author Nicholas Sparks makes it unequivocally clear yet again why he has been crowned the King Of Romance. The story is set in Beaufort, North Carolina (aren't all of his novels set there?) in 1958 and follows a young man, Landon Carter, a reckless, girl-loving knucklehead who swears he's been in love. That all changes when he's assigned to work with \\"Plain Jane\\" Jamie Sullivan for the Christmas play, written by her father, the town minister, who dislikes Landon for reasons of his own. Jamie, however, is a \\"Shy, pretty, almost ethereal\\" kind of girl and that is why Landon finds himself falling for her. Against the growing envy of his \\"Friends,\\" with whom he used to make fun of Jamie, he starts not caring what people think about them being together. It is a great read. Almost made me cry at the end. 256 pages of great reading and not one boring sentence. In the prologue, Mr. Sparks makes an ambitious promise, but, as always, delivers the goods. Read \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Message In A Bottle\\" for a warm-up to his most well-conceived and tender love story yet. In \\"The Guardian,\\" Mr. Sparks throws in the here-to-fore unseen element of suspense. \\"Get ready for a little heat.\\" Mr. Sparks describes everything with meticulous detail, which serves to enrich the story even further. Read my review of the movie for more information. Rated PG for thematic elements and some language.
0876855575|5.0|This book covers Charles Bukowski from his earliest memories at the age of two, up until he is twenty years old. Every part of this book is entertaining, from his classroom antics and lineup of outcast friends, even down to his frequent beating at the hand of his father - which he get so used to, that they didn't even affect him after a while. What a miserable first twenty years he went through. Just when he starts to hit his stride, he comes down with what a doctor decribes as the 'worst case' of acne vulgaris he had ever seen. He didn't catch too many breaks in life - seemily not until the times he experienced in his novel \\"Women\\", another great book. I'm reading HoR again and I just finished it a few weeks ago. <br />
B00005J6T0|3.0|Madonna's career would transform from the \\"Underground Dance Scene\\" to full-fledged pop superstar on her sophomore album \\"Like a Virgin\\".   Madonna would burst on to the music scene with her debut self-titled \\"Madonna\\" album.   This album would clearly play a role in bringing this \\"underground\\" movement into the pop music mainstream as well as catapult her own career.   Along the way, this album would garner some commercial success - and by the way would be a pretty good album in its own right.  When \\"Like a Virgin\\" would appear, it's controversial title track and video would help feed the commercial success of Madonna.  However, \\"Like a Virgin\\" would bring Madonna much more toward the mainstream away from the \\"Underground Dance Scene\\" roots.   By going more mainstream. the quality of her music product would diminish.   By 1986, Madonna would now face the task that many artists face - finding commercial success for the third album in a row.    Madonna would have no problem achieving album sales with her third album \\"True Blue\\".    This album would continue the keep Madonna in the Pop Music mainstream, but also would allow Madonna to introduce some fresh ideas to her music.   While I give Madonna credit for doing some new things, I can't say that the quality of this album can match the enormous commercial sales it generated. <br /> <br />One problem I've seen with Madonna's first three albums is that she has brought in different producers each time.   On her first album Reggie Lucas, Jellybean Benitez, and Mark Kamins shared production duties.   On her second album, Chic's Nile Rodgers would handle the production duties.   For \\"True Blue\\", Madonna shares production duties with Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray.    While I don't think Leonard and Bray do a bad job, I don't think they did as a good a job as the producers on the first two albums.  Artists truly benefit from having continuity with \\"the outside\\" voice of a producer over several albums.  On this particulareffort, I think there are some tracks that don't live up to expectations and could have been better. <br /> <br />The one positive thing is that Madonna does try some fresh ideas - both musically and lyrically.   In some cases, this works - in other cases, it doesn't.  Inconsistency seems to be the name of the game here.  Here is a look at the nine tracks: <br /> <br />\\"Papa Don't Preach\\":  This was a big hit song.  Madonna did contribute some additional lyrics to Brian Elliot.  We see Madonna tackle a \\"more serious theme\\" than on previous albums as she sings about an unplanned pregnancy.   This song does feature some string arrangements.   Madonna's debut album was such as success because of the raw emotion she brought to the vocals.   I don't see that emotion on a song with a serious theme.  This might have been a hit, but it is overrated. <br /> <br />\\"Open Your Heart\\": This was another hit song.   This is the opposite of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\".  I found Madonna's emotion level higher on this track.  The music has a lot of intensity as well.   It might have a pop feel, but there is some decent guitar work.  This is a very good track. <br /> <br />\\"White Heat\\": This is a tribute to James Cagney and features some spoken words from his movies.   I didn't like this track at first, but it grew on me and I can say it's a pretty good track.  I'll fault Leonard and Bray somewhat because I don't think this song was mixed very well.   Richard Marx contributes to the background vocals that compliment Madonna well.   <br /> <br />\\"Live to Tell\\": This was a song from the motion picture \\"At Close Range\\".   Madonna brings her raw emotion to this song.   This collection includes the uncut version that is far superior to the radio edit.   The haunting synthesizers are perfect for Madonna's vocals.   I think this song could have worked without a Drum Machine. <br /> <br />\\"Where's the Party\\":  There are some horns on this song, but it overall this song doesn't do much for me.  Definitely the weakest track on the album. <br /> <br />\\"True Blue\\": This is another weak track.   The background vocalists - Edie Lehmann and Siedah Garrett do an admirable job.   I felt this song suffered from \\"campy\\" lyrics - something that has become common on Madonna albums. <br /> <br />\\"La Isla Bonita\\":  Songwriters Madonna, Patrick Leonard, and Bruce Gaitsch hit a homerun on this song.   While the lyrics aren't the deepest ones, the songwriters do a beautiful job in creating a Latin/Calypso/Tropical song about a place called \\"San Pedro\\".    Madonna's raw emotion is right on form with this song.    The Latin feel of the song is genuine - especially Gaitsch's guitar and some terrific percussion.   I like how some spoken Spanish words are put into this song.   With \\"Live to Tell\\", this is the strongest track. <br /> <br />\\"Jimmy Jimmy\\":  This is a retro-style song that goes back to the 1960s girl bands.   This is heavy Synthesizer-laden song.   Madonna does all of the vocals and seems to be able to pull off the \\"girl band\\" style.   I was very surprised this song didn't garner radio airplay or get released as a single.   Again, not the strongest lyrics - but Madonna is able to give this song an genuine flavor. <br /> <br />\\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\": This is the album's wrap-up track.   To some extent, there is a Latin influence on this track.   However, this track didn't have me doing handstands.   Like \\"White Heat\\", I didn't feel this was mixed very well.   <br /> <br />This CD also features some remixes of \\"True Blue\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\".  The liner notes include the lyrics, songwriting, production, and musician credits.  Overall, while this album was a huge success - I found some tracks were better than others.   I'm not sure if Madonna gained new fans because of this album, but her most loyal fans are not going to be disappointed.   However if you are a mainstream Madonna fan - most likely it is going to be pick and choose.

0151008116|4.0|I am such a picky reader.  There are just too many books out there to read to spend time on one I'm not enjoying.  Those were my thoughts at about page 50 of \\"Life of Pi.\\"  Page 50 was \\"do or die.\\"  Either I was going to read this book or give up.  I read it and I'm here to tell you to stick with it!  In the end I really enjoyed it.  When I was away from it I couldn't wait to get back to reading it.  (Isn't that one of the points of reading?)  One reason I wanted to read it was that somewhere I read you would believe in God after you read this book.  Well, it's not that wonderful but one of the best parts about the book is Pi's descriptions of being a Hindu, Christian and Muslim.  I loved the descriptions of life on the lifeboat with Richard Parker and didn't find any of it boring.  I can believe surviving on the lifeboat with a tiger but I had to really stretch my imagination with the meerkat island.  (And the other castaway.)  While reading this book I wondered about my review for Amazon.  At first I thought 3 stars, then 3 1/2, then, finally 4.  I know we need the first 50 pages to set the stage and find out about the zoo but I felt it was rather tedious.  Other parts, such as the meerkat island were also tedious at times but, overall, this is a delightful book.
B000066NW0|5.0|I really liked this CD.  I got it basically for my 3 favorite songs on it: Losing Grip, Complicated, and Sk8ter Boi but found several more favorites and I ended up liking almost every song on it.  Each song has a catchy tune and a lyrics that you will be singing along with before long.  Every song is great, except I wasn't to fond of \\"I'm With You\\" and found it a little dull and boring with nothing to it except hopeless whining.  All the others were exceptional though and I urge you to get this CD!!

I realize that it's a bit over the top for traditionalists, but it is ENTERTAINMENT. Remember, when Shakespeare's plays were written they were thought to be gaudy, trashy melodramas fit only for the \\"lower classes.\\" The Globe theater was not a ritzy place. So lighten up. It's a good movie, your kids will like it, and you won't have to associate the name \\"Romeo\\" with a guy wearing tights.

B0002EXH40|5.0|I'll admit. When I first listened to this album, I liked only 3 songs. I thought the rest of was just stupid depressing commercial crap. After about a year, I gave another listen all the way thru one day, and well, I was amazed. Definitely the most emotional Megadeth record, as this was made after Dave Mustaine had died and was then revitalized shortly after.  <br /> <br />1. Reckoning Day: Good solid rocker, good solid opener, I personally really like this song because it is a really really good song for people to listen to who think Megadeth is just all about death and stuff.  <br />Rating: A-  <br /> <br />2. Train of Consequences: Probably my favorite song on the cd. Starting from the catchy opening riff, to the emotional chorus, and to in my opinion one of Marty Friedman's best solos ever! A nearly perfect song.  <br />Rating: A+  <br /> <br />3. Addicted to Chaos: The saddest verse of any song I have ever heard. But it shows the song is a story, beginning from despair (the intro and verses) to making a comeback and not giving in as shown by the choruses in the outro.  <br />Rating: B  <br /> <br />4. A Tout Le Monde: What could have been the hit single from the cd had MTV not banned the video due to the song being about suicide. Definitely Megadeth's most emotional song, and it can be really moving at times.  <br />Rating: B+  <br /> <br />5. Elysian Fields: Just a weird song with some kinda \\"end-of-the-world\\" vibe to it. Really really catchy chorus though, but no guitar solo :(  <br />Rating: B  <br /> <br />6. The Killing Road: Ah, old school Megadeth style here. Killer riff and an absolute shred-fest guitar solo from Marty Friedman (and then another cool solo by Dave after that). Not to be missed.  <br />Rating: B+  <br /> <br />7. Blood Of Heroes: Another cool song with some cool riffs and catchy parts all the way around. A good rocker and sounds a bit different from the rest of the songs on here.  <br />Rating: B  <br /> <br />8. Family Tree: Second bestsong on the cd, featuring the super-catchy intro and then into a very emotional song, however unfortuantely about incest. The lyrics however cannot prevent a masterfully written song from getting an A by me though.  <br />Rating: A  <br /> <br />9. Youthanasia: This song really bores me until it picks up mid-way thru, or basically to the super-cool bridge and then to a really sweet solo spot. The solos arent to be missed, but the rest of the song kinda is.  <br />Rating: C+  <br /> <br />10. I Thought I Knew It All: These three songs, Youthanasia, I Thought I Knew It All, and Black Curtains all bore me very much. There is nothing outstanding or different on this song except the chorus, very good lead part during the chorus.  <br />Rating: C+  <br /> <br />11. Black Curtains: Eeek, the verse is cool for a while but the rest of the song is sheer boredom. One I tend to skip often.  <br />Rating: C  <br /> <br />12. Victory: Now this is where its at, and a great song to close the album. Fun lyrics but nothing amazing, and the whole song is just a very high-quality commercial song with some AMAZING guitar solos by Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman.  <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />The bonus tracks, such as Millenniumm of the Blind and Absolution are nothing special, but they provide a nice addition and some cool demos along with it.  The remaster however is very solid and the drums sound far better than before. <br />
B0009HLDFU|2.0|Like many other reviewers, this CD works on about one of my players, and the rest seem to think I am not authorized to play it. Ahhh, remember the good old days when you shelled out cash for a CD and it actually played on any CD player you happened to own? <br /> <br />Then oddly enough, I was able to import CD 1 successfully to my iPod, but when I try to play songs from CD 2 on my iPod, they sound as if the disc was rubbed against a cheese grater for a few hours. The disc plays fine in my one CD player that \\"authorizes\\" me to play it, so I am guessing all this copyright protection that they have thrown on there is interfering. <br /> <br />That being said, the quality of the music on these CDs is hardly worth all the effort to try to get the darn things to play and import to iPod. There are some nice moments on the acoustic disc, but thus far nothing from disc 1 really leaps out at me like it has on the Foo's previous CDs. <br /> <br />So my advice is: if you haven't already bought this, DON'T. You will most likely just get overly pissed off trying to get it to play, and when it finally does, you'll find that the songs weren't worth the effort put into it. Your efforts could be better put to use searching for a way to download it for free online. That way if you end up liking the songs, it is kind of like a nice little bonus for you!
0670033375|3.0|After Guns, Germs and Steel, which is a fascinating account of world history comprised of all the really important missing pieces that don't fit into neat academic or ideological categories and thus don't make it into most history books, Collapse had tremendous promise as Diamond's latest. <br /> <br />And we should expect no less than that Jared Diamond takes on the most essential issue of our time, the fall of societies due to ecological failure.  He does so with clarity, depth of research, and fascinating historical examples.  He has been criticized as being overly detailed, but this is what Diamond does- he researches the hell out of things, drawing information from as wide of sources as possible.  If you are looking for a light read this is not the book for you.  But those seriously interested in the subject will find that it is treated with care, patience and skill. <br /> <br />His analysis of the causes of these disasters is no less compelling, and his ability to see the patterns of causality for disparate societies and situations is what makes him a genius. <br /> <br />In short, all is great until he gets to present environmental dangers and possible solutions.  And here he fails not in his geography or his history, but in understanding our economic system.  Diamond takes great care to claim that he is not beholden to powerful business interests, but I don't think that he has to be to make the short-sighted assumption that since big business is _the_ powerful force in the world today, that it must be the source of solutions to our ecological problems.  This is wishful thinking at best, and shows a critical lack of vision.  <br /> <br />Maybe Diamond should broaden his reading a little to include more Marx, Malthus, and other controversial thinkers, because he underestimates the stage of global capitalism that we are in, one that is based upon unsustainable use of resources and exploiting the tragedies of mostly unguarded commons.  It doesn't take a Ph.d tofigure that out, or that any effects of reformist \\"green\\" consumerism are far too little and too late.  Thinking that corporations would or could be any real force for sustainable use of resources is unbelievably nave and dangerous. <br /> <br />Diamond's incredible research and analysis of the failures of past societies make this a must read for those seriously interested in this issue.  Because of all of this, and because he does seem to grasp some of the seriousness of the situation that we are in, it is all the more shocking that he fails to understand how our economic system is inseparable from of the problems that we face.
B00011CZRE|5.0|If you ask ten movie fans what their favorite David Fincer movie is, eight are probably going to say 'Fight Club.'  I am one of the minority.  Seven is not only my favorite Fincher movie, but it is one of my favorite movies ever.  It is so much more than a crime drama.  It is nothing short of a masterpiece.   <br />Seven follows two detectives, the calm, wise, and soon to retire Somerset (Freeman) and the young, gifted hotshot Mills (Pitt).  They arrive at the scene of a particularly grisly murder or a morbidly obese man.  I will not disclose details, but the killings are reminiscent of the style shown in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and years later, \\"Saw\\".  During a second inspection of the crime scene, prompted by plastic shavings found in the stomach of the dead man, \\"gluttony\\" is found carved into the wall behind the refrigerator.  Soon after, a lawyer turns up dead in another bizzare murder, and \\"greed\\" is spelled out in his own blood on the carpet.  The killer chooses victims who embody the Seven Deadly Sins.  Somerset and Mills take the case.  They pick up on the pattern and know that the killer will strike agian and follow his trail.  It becomes evident early on that this is no ordinary killer, though.  He has every move plotted well in advance, and his killings make a stark commentary on the flaws of society today.  He uses each victim's sin as the central instrument in his elaborate, almost artistic executions.  He offers an alternate and thought provoking viewpoint on justice.  It makes the viewer think more than any standard fare thriller ever would.  The ending is superb.  Don't listen to any of the other reviews, it comes as a complete shock.  It is so different than the rest of the crime movies you have ever seen, and so chilling and thought provoking.  If you don't want to know it, I suggest you don't read the rest of the page, as Nikola Tesla's review will spoil it dead for you.  With luck, Amazon will remove that retard's post from the forum before thisgets posted and/or he spoils this masterpiece for more viewers.  I want to say more on the plot, but you really need to experience it for yourself. <br /> <br />The Final Word - An absolutely amazing movie that will floor you with it's originality and intelligence.  It is mainstream cinema at its absolute best.  A must have for any true movie fan.
B00024BHTC|5.0|It's completely brilliant, I love Nightwish because of the haunting operatic music mixed with the gothic metal melodies. Nemo is one of my favorite songs, I often listen to music as I draw my books or drawing in general and NightWish really inspires me into drawing more of my older comic DreamWorld. It's quite hard to explain in words sometimes the feeling you can get from music and the inspiration, but if I had to define a band by the amount of inspiration they give me, NightWish would be in the top 3.

B00008BXJJ|5.0|I just picked up this CD today to hear one of rocks most raw bunch of badboys on the planet play live and see how it turned out.  Well, I can say with all honesty this may very well be the best live album I've ever heard.  I am still listening to it right now.     <br /> <br />This CD went into my system and I played it all the way through without skipping a single song!  Every song I heard left me begging for more and kept me reaching for the volume knob turning it beyond sane levels.  The recording is top notch and exactly what I look for in a live recording, it sounds....LIVE!   Not pumped through a mixing board with a little audience put in for good measure like most live CD's.  The power of this CD is intoxicating and sure to keep a party rocking into the wee hours. <br /> <br />Run...don't walk to your nearest CD haven and buy this CD now if you're an AC/DC fan or just plain love ass kickin rock n' roll.  Be sure to buy the collectors edition which has almost double the music. <br /> <br />R A W K !!!!
B000001DQI|4.0|A 1973 chart-topper and one of Elton John's best-known and certainly most succesful albums, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" was originally issued as a double LP, but the 76:20 just fits onto a single CD. <br />It's a slightly kitchy collection of pop, prog-rock, hard rock and novelty items, and it really defines what Elton John was about at this time in the 70s...big pop hooks, lavish arrangements and a musical diversity which doesn't always hold together too well. <br /> <br />He still performs several of these songs in concert, from the pretentious 11-minute opener \\"Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)\\" to the stuttering \\"Bennie And The Jets\\" and the inevitable \\"Candle In The Wind\\". I have a somewhat ambiguos relationship with Elton John's music...in a way it's much too slick and glitzy, but it's also hard to argue with his abilities as a tunesmith.  <br />Numbers like the hard rocker \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" and \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" are among Reginald Kenneth Dwight's most beloved tunes, but there are some really good lesser-known songs here as well. The playful reggae of \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\" is infectious and fun, and the slightly folkish mid-tempo rocker \\"The Ballad Of Danny Bailey\\" and silly but melodic \\"Roy Rogers\\" are worth a listen as well. If you're into Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this is a must-have, and if you're just looking for a sampler, the \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" is as good a place to start as any. It is really Elton John in a nutshell.
B00003CXCT|5.0|i think you are not getting it right, the title \\"Return of the Jedi\\" refers to the jedi as a whole, is not the return of \\"a jedi\\"(in this case neither Luke or Anakin) but the return of the Jedi Order or at least a new beggining of the order, which in the movie is represented by Luke. BTW, i saw EP 4 in theaters in the 70's and i love it today just as much as i did then, as well as EP 5 and 6 when they came out.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Something about Beck's Sea Change will forever have me confused. Prior to its release I had this strange philosophy about music, that was perhaps a bit too logical... I believed that there is no place in my mind for the melancholy. It's not that musicians can't be sad or express sorrow. I just didn't want that to be the dominant emotion in their music. I felt that if I were happy, I wouldn't want to be weighed down by sad music. And if sad, I'd like to be picked up by something.    Then came Sea Change. It's all sad. Every song is sorrow. 8 years of a relationship gone forever and I couldn't blame him. But that's not why I was open to Sea Change, by any means.     There is something completely untouchable about the album that lends a unified sadness that actually serves to lift instead of weigh. Perhaps it can be called sheer beauty. But I think that is too simplistic. There is an orchestration within each song and throughout the form of the album that transcends anything melancholy I've ever heard before. It is beautiful, but it it's also...weird...for lack of a better word. Beck's sound has always been offbeat and often humorous. Here, maybe it's not funny, but it is certainly atypical. The unique lens Beck offers to view the world never ceases to be both overwhelming and enthralling; which is how I would choose to describe Sea Change.    Since then, I have opened myself up to music of the more melancholy mood and seem to be one of the few Beck fans to consider Sea Change the most masterful, as well as quite possibly my favorite of his albums(though that is a tough one)...    In case it's of interest...

B00005JNTX|5.0|I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD so I can watch over and over and over...
B00092ZL80|4.0|This DVD provides some excellent concert footage of a spectacular band still very much in its prime as performers and musicians. Simultaneously, it provides concert footage of another band that has clearly lost a little bit of its edge. The concept is excellent--take the two bands that defined the concept of the horn band sound (in very different ways) and put them on stage together. Some of the music is transcendent, some above average, and some mediocre.    Beginning with the opening tracks, featuring both bands on stage together, the listener is instantly reminded of some of the best aspects of both bands. Robert Lamm, though stiff in appearance, sings absolutely beautifully. His voice has some lounge-ish qualities to it, but his tone and phrasing is exsquisite. He sings the first verse of \\"Beginnings\\", then Philip Bailey sings the second, and the audience is reminded of how great his voice is also. The band(s) sound unbelievable. The double and triple layering of background vocal parts makes the combined ensemble sound huge, and the horn overdubs from the album can finally be played correctly (anybody who has played this tune in a band is aware of the difficulties in deciding what to leave out from the ending). The combined ensemble continues with \\"In The Stone\\" and \\"Dialogue\\", and the vocals get passed around to several other people. From his first lines in \\"In The Stone\\", it is obvious that Bill Champlin no longer posesses the requisite control over his voice to sing live. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop him.    When EWF takes the stage by themselves, the result is spectacular. After an intro rev-up of the crowd by vocal fill-in B. David Whitworth, whose mannerisms are more than a little obnoxious, Philip Bailey and Ralph Johnson retake the stage and absolutely kill while running through a sequence of the band's classic tunes. The tunes are linked together, but not like a medley; each tune breathes its own life. The ensemble interplay is great, with Bailey, wife Krystal, Johnson, and Whitworth providing percussion to fill out the band's sound. This isn't the classic horn section, but the new guys do a more than adequate job. The only time the old horn section is missed is during the sax solo on \\"After The Love Has Gone\\". Gary Bias does a good job, but he lacks the passion of Don Myrick (sadly gunned down by the LAPD about 12 years ago). Russian fat guy Vadim Zilbershtein simply rocks on his guitar solos and proves once and for all that white guys can be uberfunky; Al McKay never sounded this good. Keyboardist/musical director Myron McKinley only features himself once, and would do well to lose a little modesty; he solos like a cross between George Duke and Herbie Hancock. This performance is a staunch reminder of why musicians should learn to play their instruments; everybody excels at what they do, and several do two or three different things.    On the second DVD, Chicago takes the stage with a medley of somewhat lesser-known tunes. They play them well, but c'mon guys. Medleys are musical fascism. Either play the song or don't. The band then works through several of their better-known tunes, including a couple that are clearly musician's favorites. The band plays well, but the singing is subpar. Jason Scheff does his best singing when he isn't trying to imitate Peter Cetera; unfortunately he tries way too hard to do just that on several tunes. Bill Champlin was brought into the band in the mid-eighties to compliment Peter Cetera as a second baladeer when the band forsook its jazz/rock leanings for a more commercial pop sound. With Scheff doing a mediocre Cetera impression and Champlin unable to conjure up the vocal power that he was once known for, many of the tunes (particularly the ballads) are lackluster and at times borderline bad. Musically, the band is tighter than it has been since Terry Kath and Danny Seraphine were members. While Scheff is able to hold his own on bass (his father was Elvis's bassist) and often downright outplay Cetera on parts that Cetera wrote, Champlin's contributions on keyboard are average at best. Champlin often looks like the odd man out, unable to contribute anything of great meaning. Walt Parazaider's flute playing is excellent; his contributions are probably overlooked far too often.    After a half dozen tunes, Lamm sings Saturday In The Park. The 30 minutes between his vocal contributions only highlights how much better a singer he is than Scheff or Champlin (guitarist Keith Howland actually does Cetera justice on his one vocal lead, and he does it by singing with his own sound rather than imitating Cetera's). After a few more tunes, the combined ensemble retakes the stage for six more tunes. The Lamm/Bailey vocal interplay is once again excellent, and Scheff, unencumbered by the need to sound like a certain other vocalist, shines again. The sax duet on \\"Free\\" shows Parazaider coming with a much hipper concept than Bias, playing a half step below the key and thus providing some interesting dissonance. On \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", the three guitarists have a showdown of their own. Howland plays something reminiscent of Kath's original solo, but much more polished and precise. He plays all the licks good guitar players practice hard to play, and plays with great swagger (despite having a rather metrosexual hairdo). EWF rhythm guitarist Gregory Moore comes next, and his playing is adequate. He's clearly better suited as a rhythm guitarist, however. Next up is Vadim, and he absolutely kills. His concept is otherworldly. He makes me proud to be a fat guy playing guitar. They close by soloing together, which is also a treat.    Overall, EWF kills on all levels. Chicago plays their instruments well, and Lamm's singing is sadly underrated. Unfortunately their performances are marred by inadequate vocal performances from Scheff and especially Champlin. The combined ensemble performances are surreal; this is a musician's wet dream come true. Regardless of what instrument you play, any musician can take something valuable away from this DVD (even vocalists; Bailey's falsetto solo on the first disc is jawdropping). If you're not a musician, you'll be entertained also. Bands and songs haven't been this good for quite some time now. Remember when musicianship ruled the earth? These guys do.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|This is the film that introduced the world to STAR WARS. The classic story of boy on Tatoonie who becomes a powerful Jedi Knight and begins to deliver the galaxy from the wrath of the Empire over a period of a few years. We all know how it begins. Stormtroopers fire pistols at the door and break in. Blasters raised, rebels prepare to fight. After a short battle scene, Darth Vader walks onto the screen, a squadron of Stormtroopers on his heels. STAR WARS was like nothing that ever appeared on the bigscreen. Now, digitally remastered and uncut, you too, can join the battle! I would recommend buying the bundle with all 3 in the Trilogy series. May the force be with you!
B0007P3582|2.0|Interesting to see so many reveiws saying \\"rap equals crap its not music.\\" I listen to all forms of music from rock/classic rock (Pink Floyd *reuniting for live aid including R.Waters*, Led Zep, Nirvana, Sabbath(going to be at Ozzfest'05 nice, Alice in Chains, Tool, Deftones, Faith no More, Dead Meadow, etc..), jazz(Coltrane, Keith Jarrett, Brad Mehldau, Bill Evans) metal/industrial (Opeth, Nin, Fates Warning,Mudvayne), classical(Choppin, Debussy), and ofcourse rap; you name it I probably listen to it. This is music, and the reason why is because its entertainment. Yes the lyrics talk about murder, sex, and drugs, but if your foolish enough to beleive in what they are saying then you have problems. I go to the movies and see the same subject, because its entertainment and thats what its meant for. However, I do agree that most rap artist dont have much creative talent,and it is sad to see a musician like Keith Jarrett selling less than a million albums for some of the most creative music ever played (check out Sun Bear Concert box set- amazing music). With that said this album lacks in several categories mainly lyrics. However, it does have good sound production i.e. beats. The sound production alone does not save this album. There are better Hip Hop artist worth listening to, Common, Mos Def, 50 has become stale and repetitive..G..G..G..G. Unit......WACK... im tired of hearing it.  <br /> <br />P.s. I have a great appreciation for musicians, I know how much effort it takes to play an instrument well...I play the piano
B000002MU3|4.0|<br />This is one of my favorite REM albums. It has some bite to it that few others of theirs do. Although not as much bite as unbridled Punk Rock, but you get the idea (if you've heard this album in relation to the rest of REM's catalogue). \\"What's The Frequency\\", \\"Bang the Blame\\", and \\"Let Me In\\" are songs I really like. Ironically \\"Let Me In\\" is dedicated to Kurt Cobain (a selfish little imp I could never stand), but musically it's a great song. It has some fan-tabulous distortion provided by a guitar that was actually owned by Cobain that Stipe acquired. I know. I'm torn.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great album overall. Buy it along with Automatic for the People. Use your discretion if buying anything after Monster. There's some dull sh*t to be found in the \\"new\\" REM.
B0007P3582|4.0|I believe this is a good CD, The songs, Disco Inferno, Just a Lil' bit, Hate it Or Love it, and Candy Shop are some of the best songs on this track. God Gave Me Style isn't really a good song, Gatman and Robin has a very catchy beat.
B000002KKD|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. The B-52's are so strange and unhip that they are adorable. I love all the songs on here. \\"Hero Worship\\" is a mite slow, but it's still quite good. Most of the the songs on here are silly and fast-paced; Almost like proto-Punk Rock but more intelligent and thoughtful. My personal faves on here are \\"Rock Lobster\\" and \\"606-0842\\". The off-key wailing on the cover of \\"Downtown\\" is priceless. Great stuff. If you get one B-52's album, make it this one (and be sure to pick up the single for \\"Love Shack\\"). Cindy, Kate, and Fred... thanks guys.

B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana was one of THE most popular, boring and predictable bands to come out of the 90's. And while Kurt was still alive, he constantly touted how his music was supposedly \\"Punk\\". Sorry, but there are no similarities between Kurt Cobain and his idol Henry Rollins. Rollins is an anti-drug, muscle-bound powerhouse that does great Rock nowadays, but did even better Punk in Black Flag. Rollins even wrote a song about Kurt on his End Of Silence album. Kurt was just a whiny little sh*t that wanted to score heroin all the time. Kurt's music helped him fufill that \\"life goal\\". Nirvana's the band jocks listen to score with trendy goth art chicks. <br /> <br />Here's the Henry Rollins song \\"Low Self Opinion\\" that he wrote in Kurt Cobain's memory... <br /> <br />\\"I think you got a low self opinion man <br />I see you standing all by yourself <br />Unable to express the pain of your distress <br />You withdraw deeper inside <br />You alienate yourself <br />And everybody else <br />They wonder what's on your mind <br />They got so tired of you <br />And your self ridicule <br />They wrote you off and left you behind <br /> <br />You sleep alone at night <br />You never wonder why <br />All this bitterness wells up inside you <br />You always victimize <br />So you can criticize yourself <br />And all those around you <br /> <br />The hatred you project <br />Does nothing to protect you <br />You leave yourself so exposed <br />You want to open up <br />When someone says <br />Lighten up <br />You find all your doors closed <br />Get yourself a break from self rejection <br />Try some introspection <br />And you just might find <br />It's not so bad and anyway <br />At the end of the day <br />All you have is yourself and your mind <br />The self hatred that blinds you <br />Binds you grinds you keeps you down <br />The world falls down around you <br />You build up walls around you <br />You wear disgust like a crown\\"
B00005JLD4|5.0|According to Molly's own daughter, Doris, Molly said 'this is not my story' because her story did not end at the happy point that the film stopped on. Unfortunately Molly later lost 2 daughters to that self-same Moore school. Simply watch the film, and the special features (which are excellent). Listen with your ears not your biases and you will hear for yourself. <br /> <br />This is a touching, moving, unforgettable film about another appalling moment in human history. A must see. Thank goodness the filmmaker chose to end on a high note, anything else would have been unbearable.
B000002LOE|1.0|The only good song on Out of Time is the fantastic \\"Losing My Religion\\". The rest is filler. The stupidity of \\"Radio Song\\" gets things off on the wrong foot. There's the cheesy gimmick of using turntable scratching and a few rap \\"shout-outs\\" in \\"Radio Song\\"-- telltale signs the song was is dead in the water to begin with. I finally got to \\"Losing My Religion\\" a few songs later, and thought things might pick up afterwards. I was, of course, wrong. I made myself sit down and listen to the whole rest of the album just to make sure I heard everything so I'd be fair in my opinion of it afterwards. The bottom line is that, despite Out of Time having one of REM's best songs, this still is a one-star album overall. Like a previous reviewer stated, Automatic for the People and Monster are your best bets for solid REM albums to get (the songs \\"Nightswimming\\" \\"Everybody Hurts\\" and What's the Frequency\\" are unbeatable). Just buy those two REM albums instead, and don't let \\"Losing My Religion\\" tempt you into thinking Out of Time is worth buying. If you love that song as I do, just get the single; it has some great b-sides too.
044024157X|2.0|I usually enjoy Grisham's books and even tolerate his political views but this book was dreadfully boring.  The story just lacked the thrill and suspense of his former books and the plot was just too predictable.  The end was so disappointing that I kept thinking that I missed something.  Would not recommend this book unless you need something to put you to sleep.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I can still remember listening to TAKE IT EASY 33 years ago on a crummy sounding radio while I was painting hotel rooms one summer when I was in college.  I wouldn't have thought then that all these years later they would put out one of the best concert DVDs ever.  God after all, the Beatles were only in our world for a bout 7 years, how could a band stay virtually intact and this good for this long (OK only 2 original members are in the band, but we'll pick that nit if we have to).   <br /> <br />This was a good show on NBC, but a great DVD. Band sounded great, looked a little long in th tooth at times.  Excellent production values.  Great value for the price. <br /> <br />Growing up outside of Cleveland, I  especially liked the inclusion of some old James Gang songs, but like many others have said in other review, lose the horns.  Hearing horns play the lead guitar line on FUNK 49 would bring tears to the eyes of all of us who grew up on Joe and the Gang in high school.  And I don't mean that in a good way.   <br /> <br />All told, a good time will be had by all Eagles fans who purchase this disc.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|As I sometimes find is the case with certain albums I wasn't instantly sold on either disk of this two record set. However after listing to the first album about 3 times it began to hit me how powerful and well constructed this work really was. Songs like deepest blues are black, now way back, DOA  resolve and hell really grow on you. Last song I think still seems rather forgetable. The second album (acoustic) took me a few listens to warm up to as well. Songs like miracle quietly sneak up and punch you in the face it sneaks by a couple of times. My advice. Buy it. There are few american rock bands that can devlop this kind of sound and feel. If I had reviewed this after the first listen I would give it a 3 But give it a chance you won't regret it. Is it rock solid stem to stern, no. But the good far outshiners the mediocre. I give it a 4 and in a few weeks who knows?
B00005JNTX|4.0|Well I'll admit I went to see this flick because of Rourke, <br />yeah I'm one of those people who thought Rourke's early <br />work was Deanesque.Basically the movie has 3 complete sections <br />Willis was OK as Hartigan his storyline average,Clive Owen was <br />good his storyline was better,but Rourke did in fact as the majority of reviewers suggest steal this movie.He was so good that as some major newspapers suggested that the Marv character <br />should have been the WHOLE movie.It's great to see an overrated actor like Willis (who I like by the way) get totally blown out of the water by Mickey Rourke.I will buy this DVD for Rourke's acting alone as he was that good.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I was 7 years old when this thing came out and remember seeing it on TV and how it impacted me. I wasn't scared, just very awed. My parents were back and forth in letting me watch it in the first place. But in the end, I was able to see it. Growing up my parents were careful in what they allowed in the home from the outside world such as violence, promiscuity...you know, the typical. But when it came to 'real issues', they were a little more open. They taught us to never feel \\"too comfortable\\" with life because you never know what can happen. A good example, 9/11. They taught us to be prepared mentally and physically in case a catastrophe hits. But at the same time, they also taught us a balance that we need to live by as well. Because one cannot be too paranoid so that it takes over our lives, that in itself can be as bad as the catastrophe. This movie is a good wake up call for all of us and how we all need to be prepared.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Zoolander is a movie in which Ben Stiller did more than just star in. He wrote it and co- directed it. First off, for those of you that say that this movie is REALLY STUPID AND IDIOTIC, guess what you're right. And that's what makes it so funny. It just bugs me when people say that it's so stupid because that was the purpose of the movie. That's what made me roll on the floor in laughter. <br />The plot is about male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) who is basically a complete idiot. And when he is brainwashed to kill someone, he must get help from a reporter and his arch model rivel Hansel (Owen Wilson). The movie is absolutely is absolutely hilarious with many awesome comic moments. Just to make you rent or buy this movie, I'll write down just a couple funny moments: <br />- Derek has a REALLY TINY cellphone <br />- Gasoline Fight! <br />- Derek complains about a model for a school he wants to build because it would:\\" need to be at least 3 times that size!\\" <br />And much, much more. This movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen because it's just so stupid. And by the way, it also has a great cast with Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell along with many cameos.
0743454537|3.0|I should have liked this book. What an interesting idea--a teenage girl conceived to be a bone-marrow match for her sister finally loses patience when she is expected to donate a kidney. She files for medical emancipation so her parents cannot force her to have surgery. Each chapter of the novel is told from a different perspective--the girl, Anna; her parents; her brother; and her lawyer (but only twice do we hear the dying sister's voice). I had some problems with the tone, as disparate characters often sounded similar. The juvenile delinquent older brother was a bit cliched. And a subplot about Anna's lawyer being reunited with his prep school sweetheart was unnecessary. Yet I found myself fascinated with the novel and the ethical implications at its core. I was all set to give \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" a solid four stars.    And then, the ending. Good Lord, that ending. It nullfies the rest of the book so effectively that Picoult may as well have ended with the revelation that it was all a dream. You will either be outraged or laugh at the absurdity. Please, if you are reading this book, stop reading twenty pages from the end and invent your own conclusion. It will be better.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens is the sequel to the original classic which I fell asleep during. After watching the first one, I wasn't expecting much but what I saw was awesome. Aliens is in my opinion a lot better than the original and is one of my top sci-fi movies of all time. Not to mention, the aliens do deliver quite a few of scares. The movie is about Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver, who wakes up to find out that she has been hibernated and that everyone that she knows is dead because it's a long time after the original. Ripley then accompanies a group of marines to a planet where aliens are located. And once there, these aliens are really mean.  <br />This movie is so great because the aliens are actually really realistic. This was made 19 years ago and it's still a freaky movie with some terrifying aliens. I mean they are wonderfully made. The movie has this group of marines fighting against loads of aliens and Ripley must take charge in order to save a stranded girl. The ending is awesome with some fantastic action scenes. This is one DVD that you must have in your collection.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I believe the greatest achievement of this movie is for almost three hours not boring me. I have watched long movies ( magnolia) though great are a bit slow but this movie never stopped moving. It always kept my attention. I sat riveted looking at the screen delighted with the beauty of the film, the presence of the actors, all of Scorsese's tricks. I was glued. More so when Cate Blanchett was first seen, she is beautiful. I kind of wish she didn't go off with Spencer Tracy so that way she would be in the screen longer. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in his best performance in the picture. Even better than (What's eating Gilbert Grape?) The repetition of random sentences, the way he pees in to those bottles, can't help that man in the restroom, exiles himself into his own screening room. He gives it his all. The most touching performance besides that of Cate Blanchett who I adore is that of none other than Kate Beckinsale. \\"You can buy me dinner.\\" She shaves Howard after he becomes a recluse after the crash. She refuses his gifts. she's superb. I don't want to describe Cate Blanchett's performance as Katharine Hepburn because I don't think I could do it justice. \\" Do your Worst.\\" This one is one for the ages. Scorsese's most accesible movie, one of his best.
0767803434|4.0|This movie is a good, solid movie but it's really unrealistic. Like the president could have really taken down a large group of terrorists. I mean he's not Arnold or a military expert. He's the president for God's sake! Like any president could have done this! The movie's simply about the air force one plane that's hijacked by Russian terrorists and the president decides to stay on board and not go in the ejector seat and kick their buts! Which he of course does! Gary Oldman, Glenn Close and Harrison Ford star in this good but completely unrealistic movie.  <br />Can you see Bill Clinton or George Bush beating up terrorists like Harrison Ford did? Maybe he should be our president, lol.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend first single was weak. I dismissed him as a cornball singer. \\"Ordinary People\\" was okay. I was more interested in him until, they played it on the radio 30x's a day. I saw him on the BET awards and decided to buy the CD. IT IS GOOD. HE sounds a lot like CARL THOMAS, but he is so very good. For those who like Musiq, or Jill Scott you will love John's Melody. My only beef with him as a woman is that he has too many songs about cheating. <br /> <br />Pick up Kindred & Jaquar Wright classics
B000957O82|5.0|I won't go into the details of the movie since other reviewers have already done so.  I would just like to say this is a great clean commedy, with the exception of one curse word.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend that anyone looking for a great laugh, see it!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Thank heavens the world has finally gone batsh@$ crazy.<br /><br />If you grew up with the Batman comic books, you're in for a double-whammy of Batman nostalgia. And even if you've never read a DC comic book, you're still in for a very pleasant movie experience.<br /><br />We've had Batman films before (Michael Keaton starring in the first rubber suit, then Val Kilmer, and finally the hunky George Clooney), but here we've got a more obscure actor --- Christian Bale --- whom many film-watchers probably have only scant knowledge of. But he's just about as perfect a Batman I've ever seen. He's not George Clooney gorgeous, nor does he have the versatility of Val Kilmer (i.e. Doc Holiday in \\"Tombstone\\", and Jim Morrison in \\"The Doors\\"). But what Mr. Bale DOES have is a really great persona that accompanies the dark-style films he chooses (please see \\"Reign of Fire\\" if you haven't already).<br /><br />The filming of this Batman is dark, moody, and not too far removed from the previous films; but where it excels above its predecessors is in the story being told. For those in the know, Batman has some less-than-humble beginnings. He's a strange character who has walked a fine line between slipping into the dark underworld versus becoming an obscurely disturbed superhero. In this film, we get to see a bit of both of these sides.<br /><br />Also notable is the all-star cast that graces the silver screen. Michael Caine is PERFECT as the stodgy yet affable butler Alfred. Gary Oldman stars as officer Gordon, whom we all know will eventually become the Commissioner. Liam Neeson gives a fine performance as both Batman's mentor and nearly his demise into darkness. Rutger Hauer plays the stuck-up role of the director of Wayne Enterprises after the death of Bruce's parents. Morgan Freeman plays a Q-type character (ala James Bond) who helps Bruce Wayne with his nifty gadgets. Katie Holmes plays the love interest but is nearly forgettable against the backdrop of this powerfully told story and the more seasoned actors.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan (Momento) pulls off the best Batman movie EVER. And the amazing thing is that it's not JUST for Batman and comic book fans. Several of my friends and co-workers who've never touched a DC comic have seen the film and are singing its praises.<br /><br />Go see it on the big screen.

B00004S6GL|5.0|I don't see much point of discussing which Elliot's alubum is the best and which is better than the other, although it's amusing and interesting to read through these reviews and share the perspectives.  <br /> Elliot Smith is not for everyone. So I wouldn't say like, buy this album and you'll love it! I don't think Elliot wouldn't say so, either, except when he is speaking in front of his record company or something. If you're attracted by his music, you'll naturally want to listen to all of his recordings available (and they are limited). While it is definately true that he is such a talented musician and his music itself is worthwhile listening to every professional musicians or music industry people, I have a feeling that his fans, including myself, are more touched by his own person or his soul. And it doesn't take a whole album to want to be near his world, it was only a few phrases within a song to get me. Just like you can't be a friend of just about everyone, <br />his music is not for everyone. There are too many people out there who obviously won't like it and start insult about it. <br />I personally don't think the sales record (like, \\"sell more CD and DVD!) was Elliot's foremost intension of his making music. <br />Besides money don't go to him any more. If you like him, buy and listen, if you don't have money, borrow one.I found out that even local library had 'from a basement on the hill'.(Oops, I am writing for a rerail) <br />Find out on your own if it fits you, might help you to know more about yourself. <br />
B0007YMUZW|5.0|If you gave this album anything lower than 5 stars, then you don't fully understand music and its purpose, but then again that seems to be the trend nowadays. Cold Roses is a modern masterpiece. Each song is beautifully written.
B000002GB9|5.0|I tend to only write reviews of things that I really like, and this is no exception.<br /><br />\\"The Grand Illusion\\" came out when I was 15 or 16 years old, when I had a whole life of possibilities in front of me. I never thought I'd be sitting here, almost thirty years later, writing a review about it. What can I say that hasn't been said already? The production is good, the band is tight, the material is strong. I first heard this at a friend's house, in the Summer of '77 or '78, not sure, side 2 was playing, \\"Miss America,\\" was the first track I heard, and I liked it. Then, \\"Man In The Wilderness\\" came on, and I was floored. How can you follow that? And then, \\"Castle Walls\\" came on, well, that's how you follow it.<br /><br />As a kid with no money, I taped it, and didn't get the record 'till years later,and only regretted not getting it sooner.<br /><br />There's not one \\"clunker\\" in this whole set, from the opening track to the closing number.<br /><br />God, I miss bands sounding like this!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away was my introduction to Miyazakisan.  The animation is gorgeous. The Spirit-world Chihiro enters is at once familar and out of the ordinary; just beautiful.  The flying sequences are beautifully done.  The story is excellent, it touches my heart every time I watch it.  In my opinion, the Disney-dub actually works, I thought the English casting was inspired. A friend told me they didn't like how the American actress performed Chihiro/Sen; she was too hyper, too loud.  But if you've ever been around girls that age, you'll know sometimes that's how they are.  I think the film is flawless and highly recommend it to anyone looking to see good cinema.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is an ode to the highs and lows of sheer wretched excess. There's an incredible amount of what can only be called overload here - too much extemporizing, too much pop philosophy, and too much bloat. But the action here really is too much - in the best way possible - and that saves this movie. <br /> <br />\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" begins with an overwrought and over-philosophized first act, mostly set in the \\"real world.\\" <br />We see the last human city, Zion, which is a giant cave set deep within the Earth.  <br /> <br />Unlike the Matrix, where everyone drives cool cars, wears Armani, and can fight like a bionic version of Bruce Lee, Zion is not a cool place to be. It's rusty, dingy, dark, and depressing. Not surprisingly, nobody smiles much there, even when they're coming on to each other. Honestly, I was expecting Charlton Heston to make a cameo at any moment and start yelling out, \\"Soylent Green is people!\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the good citizens of Zion apparently have few outlets. One of them is chronicled in an extended sequence that combines a combination revival meeting and sweaty rave party with hundreds of thousands of participants (all of which happens in a giant cave), intercut with a pretty explicit lovemaking scene. The rave reminded me of a Grateful Dead concert, but without the beach balls and prospect of a nice, clean hotel room to go to afterwards. There's only so much togetherness you can take with your fellow humans, particularly when there's hundreds of thousands of them all around you, and they all smell like vegetarian burritos.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the whole first act of \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" set in this dingy \\"real world,\\" and the film almost sinks under the weight of the depressing environment, the silly political wrangling, and the bloated, unneccessary cavern rave party scene.  <br /> <br />But when the action switches back to the sleek, almost magical world of the Matrix, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" kicks inwith a ferocity and precision of a well-oiled machine gun. <br /> <br />The highlights are two brilliant set pieces, one involving a martial-arts contest between Neo and hundreds of clones of his nemesis from the first \\"Matrix\\" film, Agent Smith; the second is a car chase so brilliant and audacious that Steve \\"Bullitt\\" McQueen probably watched it from beyond with a big old grin. This is the kind of scene that the directors, Larry and Andy Wachowski, are absolutely brilliant at doing, and it makes you wonder why they spent the entire first act in the dingy, depressing space of the \\"real world.\\" <br /> <br />There's also a terrific sequence featuring a character called \\"The Merovingian,\\" (Lambert Wilson), an oily-smooth Matrix denizen who is actually a computer program, and likes to spout curses in French because \\"it's like wiping your ass with silk.\\" He and his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci), have a relationship driven by their enjoyment of their mutual distrust of one another, which serves as a counterpart to the trust-driven relationship between Neo and his beloved Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  <br /> <br />This sequence, which plays out in a brilliantly sleek set, evolves into a remarkable martial arts contest between Neo and the Merovingian's henchmen. This scene, which comes right before the big car chase, is where \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" really begins to kick in. <br /> <br />In retrospect, I suppose the over-the-top action sequences set in the Matrix, and the whole sequence with the Merovingian are just as bloated as the tedious first act, which is set in the \\"real world\\" of Zion. However, there's a critical difference: the Matrix is a cool place to be, and the \\"real world\\" looks a one-way trip to chronic depression.  <br /> <br />All this made me wonder why the humans were at war to save Zion from the machines who control the Matrix. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to defeat the machines, take over the Matrix, and plug everyone back in so they can stopliving the Soylent Green lifestyle of Zion and start living the good life?  <br /> <br />Still, with all the brilliant, groundbreaking action any movie fan could want, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is ultimately a rewarding film, worth three stars out of five.
B0007YMUZW|2.0|Ryan Adams has run out of steam - It took a lot of effort to even give this album one listen. Song after song seemed to go nowhere and did not warrant a second listen. Ok, now before all you Ryan Adams fans start writing me hate mail - have a good long hard think..do you really think this album is that good? <br />Be honest - NO! For all you people that think, I must really dislike this 'GOD' of yours - I was there from day one. I have all the Whiskeytown stuff..(Even the Out Of Print Stuff!) and all his solo CD's as well..I know my Ryan Adams. Yeah sure, I thought he was pretty cool - wrote some good stuff, but his head has now become too big for his own good. One famous record producer, once said \\"If Glenn Frey and Don Henley 'farted' on tape, they could sell a million copies\\"! Its sad that it has come to the same point with Ryan Adams. Once poeple are so convinced that you are the 'Best' in your field - you don't actually have to write a good song to sell an Album.. Well Ryan, this one sucks. (So did the 'Long Run' Glenn) <br />I hope the next one is better. Yes I will probably buy it as well (Im in the music retail trade), but rest assured if I don't like it - I will let you know. If this is your 'Good Work', please..don't keep it up. Oh yeah, if you would like to make an offer on the left over copies of your album I have in stock - let me know, cause they ain't sellin' buddy.
B0002ZYE1Y|2.0|I agree with the last review.  This is a goodish album but the lyrics are stupid.  I'd actually be embarrassed if I were to be playing this to somebody and they asked me what the song(s) were about.  If Nightwish could put together some sensible chorus lines to their tracks, then they would most probably have more appeal.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I was recommended this film by others. So going into the movie, I had very high expectations. The first time I viewed it, I was a bit disappointed. The movie is definitely disturbing. Different. So back then, I would have given only 3 stars. But after a couple months, I went back and viewed the movie again. I don't know why I didn't like it the first time around! I can't describe the movie in one word. It has dry humor, violence, bit of comic book element to it, but it also carries a deep philosophical weight to it that cannot be ignored. I absolutely love it now, and I will be viewing it many times over in the years to come.
0754006735|5.0|Woolf's work is always more of a journey than a read and as such, as with all journeys, you need to stop and take stock along the way to make sense of your experiences, digest what is and learn to love and to appreciate it. The simplist and tiniest of actions are examined in microscopic detail so as to capture the finer feeling of the moment and what it is to be alive, here this concept is fully realised juxtaposed against terrific loss and the emotion of carrying on into newer less certain times and with assumed constants gone.<br /><br /> Enriching and beautiful. Once you reach her pitch, Woolf is a joy to read.

B0006L16N8|1.0|...for is not often the case that things which are keenly awaited are such a dissapointment when they arrive?<br /><br /> Personally I have never found musical satisfaction in this band and I cannot understand quite how others do. The lyrics are the most contrived agony, anxst and neurosis, they are delivered with the kind of howling whine that would put a dying man in pain to shame and the monotony, oh god the monotony! It's like having to go on an endless walk in driving rain with no hope of ever finding shelter, a warm cosy fire and something nice to listen to!<br /><br /> Time Chris the misery hung up his prozac and just stopped laying his highly glossed, depressive episodes at our feet, surely he has made enough money by now to leave us all alone and pay for some decent therapy? Oh and by the way Chris, buy a manual of Children's names while your at it and best you book Apple some self esteem classes, poor kid's gonna need em!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|A large number of people apparently hate this movie.  How can you hate something completely original?  If you're going to hate something, at least hate \\"From Justin to Kelly\\" or \\"Spy Kids 3D\\" or \\"Monster-In-Law\\".  I understand not liking it.  I didn't like the original \\"Matrix\\" when it came out, but I gave it originality points at least, and I understood why people might like it.  ND is assuredly NOT the worst movie ever.  I happened to like it very much.  It's surely quirky, and it's pretty deadpan.  I've read two reviews already that disagree and that name \\"Airplane\\" as real deadpan.  Well, you can define it how you want, but I'd call \\"Airplane\\" and \\"Holy Grail\\" (both great movies) more absurdist and silly than deadpan.  The ability of the characters to keep a straight face and of the film to feign seriousness is not necessarily deadpan in my book, but ND, on the other hand, takes itself absolutely seriously.  There is no implied wink-wink at the audience.  Others who've defended the film, and some who don't, are right to say that there is nothing to \\"get\\"; it just is.  ND exists in an absolutely serious world not very much unlike our own.  That world, inasmuch as it's a mirror of our own  and expertly highlights certain quirky, hilarious aspects of it, makes for an engrossing little film that simply cracks me up.  I suppose that if you can't find anything recognizable to relate to in ND, then maybe you won't \\"get it\\".  Or maybe you're just being stubborn.  The reaction to ND reminds me of \\"Titanic\\"--most everybody liked it until it became a cultural phenomenon, and then there was a big backlash, especially from those who saw it after everybody else, in the post-phenomenon stage (usually on the recommendation of people who saw it pre-phenomenon).  I'm not ashamed to say I liked \\"Titanic\\" a lot when I saw it (opening day), and I loved ND just the same.

B00005Y7KX|5.0|If you love the Highlights CD and are wondering if the DVD is worth the exorbitant price - the answer is yes.<br /><br />The DVD includes several songs that are not on the CD.  Some of them are a little \\"talky\\" - sung dialog that's needed to move the story along rather than real songs.  But there are some really good songs too.  I think my favorites are two pretty Julie Zenatti (Fleur de Lys) duets, Il Est Bon Que Le Soleil and When We Marry (I'm guessing - I don't remember the French name), also a couple of songs by Bruno Pelletier (Gringoire).  And I was really impressed by Garou's performance as Quasimodo.  I like being able to view French or English subtitles too since I know only a little French.<br /><br />If your only exposure to this story has been the Disney cartoon, read the book (or the Cliff Notes) or invite someone who has done so to watch the DVD with you to understand the story better - it is very different than the Disney version.  My only complaint about the DVD is that the edits tend to be very fast.
B000957O7S|2.0|I cant really say this is a great flick because at the beginning when he meets the girl you know he will win her at the end. Everything is standard fare in this flick and it has some mild laughs but, it really fails to bowl you over. I cant say much else.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Off the bat (no pun intended), you know the music will be more epic than Danny Elfman's theme. In my opinion, if you have Hans Zimmer as the composer for the movie's musical score, then its in good hands. Consider that he has done Gladiator, The Last Samurai, and King Arthur, his music brings the movies to life even more. I'm not too familiar with James Newton Howard's work. Each song carries its own story that correlates to the film. The songs help express the emotions conveyed whether it'd be fear, loss, strength, love, the score brings it to life even more. This is absolutely gorgeous movie score that is definitly worth picking up.
B000000993|4.0|Tool emerged from nowhere (L.A., that is) in the early 90's first with an EP, Opiate, which briefly showcased Tool's signature sound (especially on the title track), but which also showed the lack of depth and polish that the band was characteristic of at the time.  All of a sudden 1993 came and with it the first Tool LP, Undertow, which surprised listeners with its impressive musicianship and Maynard's sharp lyrical sense, but now seems a little shallow and amateur (of course, when compared with Tool's later monumental works Aenima and Lateralus).    Tool establish themselves as a riff band on this record.  Each song displays Adam Jones' riff-writing sensibilities and the swagger of the rhythm section of Danny Carey and Paul D'Amour in supporting the principal groove.  Musically, this can be described as Rush Sabbath; take the heaviness of Sabbath's best work and pair it with the virtuosity and intellectual complexity of Rush, and you have an accurate blueprint of the musical side of things.    Vocally, Maynard sounds like he's still deciding what influences to follow; his ability is distinct, but the instinct and melodic sense that took hold on Aenima is not quite at fruition here.  To his creative credit, Maynard's lyrics are better than his singing on this release; songs like \\"Sober\\", \\"Intolerance\\", and \\"Prison Sex\\" were probably shocking back in '93, but today seem to hit the mark quite well, as if Maynard's probing and introspect over 10 years ago somehow hit the mark exactly, without any false steps.  The general themes here are of abuse, intolerance, religious hypocrisy (some things would never change), and overall nihilism.  These themes apparently were in the early stages of development; a quick listen to Aenima verifies that perhaps Undertow was the buildup and Aenima a final release, in terms of Maynard's demons and sharply pointed verbal barbs at anyone and everyone who failed to grasp the true meanings behind his themes.    Several critics have heapedpraise upon the production of Undertow; I see nothing special about it, except that each instrument has a clear spot in the mix, sometimes cuttingly-so; the overall sound doesn't quite blend together or mesh as it sometimes did on Aenima and especially Lateralus.  Whether it was because of the simplicity of Tool's harmony or because of the bare-bones mix, I have no idea, but the production sounds like a typical early-90's alternative sound (with razor-sharp gain instead of fuzzy, overdistorted tones).      Undertow is an excellent chronicle of Tool's early career; it shows how far ahead of the game they were even at such an early point, and in retrospect, how far they would (and continue to) come ahead of their earliest achievements.  It's not a timeless masterpiece like Lateralus or a brilliant social and psychological treatise like Aenima, but it is a straight-up Tool record; one that is a little sonically simpler, but still enjoyable.  And, it's THIS sound that most bands have copied from Tool; none of them can get ahold of the perfection of their later work.  For these reasons, and many other valid ones, Undertow is an extremely worthy purchase.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|Bond is fantastic, and this cd puts some of their greatest hits on one cd. Whoever wrote the review above this one is very wrong, the DualDisc is great, this cd didn't cost any more than any other cd would, but you get awesome music videos and pictures. It is an awesome disc that everyone should try. Yay Bond.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|For those who think Michael Crawford was the best Phantom....you are in for a surprise.  The deep sadness of the character finally comes through and the story takes on a new dimension thanks to the performance of Mr. Butler.  <br /> <br />The entire film is amazing and Mr. Shumacher has been sorely overlooked for his attendance to detail, musicality and overall brilliance. <br /> <br />If you are a Phantom fan....don't write this off because Michael and Sarah are missing.  That would be a big mistake and loss for you! <br /> <br />All of the principles are magnificent......enjoy!  Don't miss the cut scene which is on the special features...No one Would Listen....touching and telling.  Great!
0385510454|5.0|I feel sorry for for those who didn't appreciate the devotion to detail regarding the protagonist's short stay in Italy. I found the Italian flavoring most delicious and memorable, the writing beautifully descriptive. In some ways it may be better than being actually being there. One might say this is like \\"The Last Juror\\" meets \\"Under the Tuscan Sun.\\" I often recommended this one, especially to anyone interested world travel (a little education along with your fiction doesn't hurt a bit). This is a terrific book!
B0009NSE1K|5.0|This album rocks. <br />The Underground's best kept secret won't be for much longer.<br />Brothers and sisters; praise the name of Clutch.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|The initial shots with the nervous camera, showing the adventures of these original criminals, constitute a visible homage to the Train Great Robe: the initial seed of the cinema: when the movie was born in 1897.<br /><br />The enormous and everlasting attractive of this masterpiece, resides in the happy blending of action, and comedy. It just a nostalgic gaze about two outlaw, wanderers, Butch and his fellow friend Sundance Kid, who goes from town to town, making the best they can.<br /><br />Butch's great project is Bolivia, his personal paradise, far from the madding crowd.<br /><br />This amazing portrait, this charming and even candied vision of the world in the last days of the XIX century , agree totally with let's say the landscape of the Wild Bunch, where the main values had a clear counter flow direction with the rules of the establishment: easy money through the minimum effort.<br /><br />This film is not only an exultant gaze to the life but besides, another unexpected angle vision about the classical bad guy stereotype: humor. They own good taste, even they are lovable and charismatic: Redford and Newman had never been best: they established an immediate rapport in camera, that allowed to win three years later in The Sting under the service of the same Roy Hill.<br /><br />A true American icon!
B0000028M7|5.0|It almost pains me to write about this album, now over ten years old, thinking about where music (and the world) is today. <br />These songs may be brutal at times, but that is only because they are completely honest. AIC had found solace - see Junkhead, yet they also knew it was unsustainable - see Godsmack. <br />This is a perfect album that they were never going to be able to top and they didn't need to because they said it all in the 13 tracks. They screamed at the world, articulated perfectly who they were and why. Dirt is a journey.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have been a huge Coldplay fan since day one, having now all three albums, and I have to say that they get better and better.  I personally enjoyed every song on this album, it was a mind blowing experience!  The lyrics are so intelligent and the composition of the actual music itself is excellent.  If you are just getting familiar with this band I definitely recommend getting this album.
0385510454|4.0|This book is a riot.  Grisham has moved away from courtroom drama and into international intrigue.  The book appears to be loosely based on the Bill Clinton pardon of Marc Rich, the international financier/oil trader/arms smuggler who was on the run but bought his way out of hundreds of felony indictments via his blonde wife who Clinton may have had more than a passing relationship with while in the Whitehouse.<br /><br />It all boils down to an undeniable fact: If Vince Foster had a gun, he would still be alive today...
B000005JA8|5.0|The best album ever. Comparable only to Lick My Decals Off, Baby by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band. If you can hear music you understand them after several listenings, and more - you can see that Pink Floyd are not avant guard and are only pseudo progressive group without individuality and greater musical skills. If you can not hear music - you have to listen to Trout Mask Replica thru several years. An maybe suddenly - you will understand. Oh!!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|George was a great Beatle. George was the most talented MUSICIAN of The Beatles. This is a very compelling concert performed at Royal Albert Hall one year to the day that he passed on to the ages. Everyone who performs are George's friends performing George's music. The headliners are many but Eric Clapton organized a proper tribute to his friend, by his friends and his son Dhani. Also included are George's favorite comedy act, Monte Python. The beginning of the show is the Eastern music that George loved and worshipped followed by most every song you've heard George sing. If you NEED this, you may want to consider The new George Harrison documentry. I was fortunate to get to see this a week ago (prior to it's July 12, 2005 release) and it is good however there is a great deal that has been used in other Beatle documenties.
B000002LUB|5.0|What do you get when you bring back the Mob Rules lineup?  You guessed it.  You get another great Black Sabbath album.  The band was in top form this time.  From the get go, Computer God grabs you and the album is so heavy that it doesn't let go.  How I wish I had been able to catch this tour because there will never be another like it again. <br /> <br />The best way I can describe this album (in hindsight at least) is that it was a massive missed opportunity.  Dio could not lose after leaving Sabbath in the early 80's.  His solo efforts were nothing short of superb and Sabbath had transformed into Tony Iommi's solo act following Born Again.  Dio breathed life back into the band, but the manner of Sabbath's demise during the tour damaged Dio's career until Jack Black came along.  He did not want to open for Ozzy.  Iommi hated Dio fans.  Plus, there were just too many wives involved here.  This return to form was bound to fail. <br /> <br />But more from the Mob Rules lineup would have been incredible.  Dio's only good solo album after leaving Sabbath again was Killing the Dragon.  Perhaps he should have swallowed his pride.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I'd have to say that out of 20th Century Fox's big budget 2004 sci-fi trio this would be the best.  Day After Tomorrow would come second, and AvP very last.  This is an interesting story that is a little different from what trailers and tv spots promoted discouraging me from actually seeing the movie.  I thought it was going to be just a crap cop movie in the future with a robot as the criminal, it really isn't that at all.  There isn't alot that I can say without spoiling the plot, but I think that you'll like this if you like Independence Day and some other ones.  I hate CGI, but this movie uses it very well (like Minority Report).  I encourage even the stubborn to see this, I think you'll like it better than what people have been saying about it.
B000002KKS|5.0|A lot of people claiming that Black Sabbath died when Ozzy left the band don't seem to understand the reasons why Ozzy left.  Black Sabbath was evolving into a more technical band and Ozzy couldn't stand it.  Of course, it's ironic that Ozzy would later team up with Randy Rhoads, but that's another story. <br /> <br />I will admit my bias here.  I am unashamed to be a fan of Dio.  But give credit where credit is due.  Whether or not you consider this to be the \\"real\\" Black Sabbath, this is an incredible album. Tony Iommi and Co. delivered a powerful effort with Heaven and Hell.   Neon Knights, Children of the Sea and the title track are true staples for classic rock radio and I can't imagine a Dio concert without a performance of Heaven and Hell.  This album was quite simply the greatest of the band's career and many Ozzy only fans just have trouble accepting it. <br /> <br />It's really too bad that personalities clashed yet again.  We'll never get another Rainbow reunion thanks to Blackmore and this lineup will probably never appear again because not only are Iommi and Dio unable to get along, but Iommi would stand to lose too much money if he reunited with Dio.  Fans are wanting another Sabbath album with Ozzy.  I'll admit to wanting that myself, but as a fan, I can always hope that Iommi and Dio can at least make up their differences.
B000244EMO|5.0|Very sweet movie, one of my favorite Arnold action classics.  Everyone of the main 8 characters does a good job of acting (even Sonny Landham who I recently learned was a porn star).  The special effects will still stand up today against modern action pictures.  The movie quality is pretty good, but I don't really have any good sound systems to test it with.  The documentary on disc 2 is a little sub-par of what I would expect.  I'd rather see something more in depth like on the quadrilogy discs, those are documentaries.  The deleted scene + outtakes are pretty interesting along with the test footage and other featurettes.  What I find most puzzeling is that there isn't a single trailer for this movie, just a quadrilogy trailer.  Everyone should see this movie, and if you like it, than this DVD is great for you.  If you don't like the movie I have pitty on you.
B000005RFQ|4.0|After Ronnie James Dio left Sabbath to pursue his solo career, Ian Gillan of Deep Purple was brought in to fill the shoes of the previous frontmen.  As far as I'm concerned, this album isn't a bad effort.  Trashed and Zero the Hero happen to be my favorite tracks, but there seems to be a bit too much filler for my tastes to get a five star ranking. <br /> <br />It should also be noted that Guns N' Roses took the main riff of Zero the Hero and used it in their hit Paradise City.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I always felt that \\"The Final Cut\\" was a somber continuation of the \\"The Wall.\\" Well, maybe it was \\"The Wall: Part 2.\\" A lot of the same themes are there, isolation, sadness, fear, etc.. Gone was the old Pink Floyd of extended instrumentals. The Final Cut was in the vein of Animals and the Wall, centering around emotionally charged lyrics and themes of heartache. It was really quite daring for Roger to put so much of himself out there. Moreover, there is some politics mixed in to boot. I know that a lot of Pink Floyd fans resent this album. They feel that it was the tyranical Roger dominating the group for his own personal goals. Well, as a big fan of Roger, I did not mind. The last four albums by Pink Floyd with Roger had been dominated by him, where was the complaining over those recordings? This album is so deep and so emotional that I don't know how anybody who has really took the time to listen to it, could not like it. Moreover, there are plenty of classic Gilmour riffs mixed in. I love this album and wish that Roger had stayed on board to make a few more. The added track is very nice as well. One of my favorite Floyd albums ever.
1567184855|5.0|My favorite book ever!  I've bought this book over and over again to either lend or give to others who need to know answers to the after-life.  This book is a must read for anyone questioning what happens to us at the time of death and after that.  I've re-read this book several times and now I've started reading \\"Destiny of Souls\\" by Michael Newton and so far, it's just as amazing as \\"Journey of Souls.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Well, I may have some watchers who go, \\"Wow, that chick is an idiot for giving it 5 stars.\\" and I might have some on the contrary. \\"Wow! Go you! MCR Rocks!!\\" But really, I don't care what you think of my post. ;D Anyways, let me get to expressing /my/ own individual opinion. <br /> <br />I had heard My Chemical Romance on MTV before. Their single \\"Helena\\" was the one I actually paid attention to. I thought from what I heard before turning the channel was that I just didn't like their look. Oh, I know, not a good way to judge a BAND. But it just reminded me too much of other bands. A couple days later while watching MTV again (I think it was a comerial after the Real World..) I saw that same video clip. I groaned slightly but just waited for it to be over. It /was/ sorta catchy but I'm not usually into that kind of music. It was getting late, and hell knows I had a huge test that day. (Which I didn't study for mind you.) So I was working on studying; twiddling my pencil and dancing my fingers across the desk in my room. The usual. But this time I found myself starting to mumble the lyrics to the song. I was suprised I picked that up so fast when I couldn't even remember a word for my Humanities English test. I mean, I was sorta, maybe, possibly, liking the song,...But why now!? It was all just too catchy. (Before I go off on another subject, I passed the test. =D)  <br /> <br />Normally though, as my friend refers to it as, \\"Catchy songs are songs that have a good beat, and I can sing along to.\\" I agree,..sorta. I mean, first off, Nobody wants to hear me sing along to anything. And while the vocals of MCR are wonderful, you still have to get used to them. Some parts of songs (or full songs) are hard (for at least me) to understand word for word. But sometimes it is for the best of humanity. Or more like, my-anity. And as well as sorta hard to understand, some of the beats sound alike. My friend and I were looking through the 30 second clips before buying it. We wereconstantly going, \\"This one will be different.\\" \\"This will be the lucky one.\\" But as we later found out, only the chour sounds similar with the drum and guitar beats. The songs are all much different sounding in general. But we still voted against buying it, since I'm not making much money at my part-time job and Highschool is getting harder as I progress through the years. Plus, I just payed off payment for my car.  <br /> <br />For a while we lost track of the band, forgot about them and such. Until one day I was recently talking to a different aquaintence. They said something along the lines of, \\"Ooh. I love this song, it is so catchy.\\" Curiously I asked what song. She replied, \\"\\"I never told you what I do for a living\\" By My Chemical Romance.\\" \\"I remembered hearing that band name, but never the song. So she showed me the lyrics to refresh my memory and,...nothing. So being the curious low-minded being I am I looked it up to buy it. Nothing. I did find it on Yahoo! But alas, it didn't load correctly. What a waste of a dollar. All I could manage from the song (my now standing favorite) was 30 seconds. And a good 30 seconds it was. I had myself (pathedicly) replaying and replaying the sound clip. Ooh, and I ended up doing it the next day too. And well, I checked out some of the other songs on the CD to refersh my memory. And as I didn't pay much attention the first time to them, I fell in love with them that time. And believe me, I'm not some Punk, Emo, Rock, Metal, Whatever you refer to them as girl. I listen to whatever is really on the radio. I have the Usher CD, with its R&B beats, Liz Phair's pop sounding lyrics and catchy tunes, as well as Maria Mena's slow meldoic songs. But yet I still liked My Chemical Romance. I find myself weird in that way. My friend even commented oddly on it, \\"You don't seem like the Rock type.\\" I really don't, I seem like your average pop/rap girl. But I like everything. And as redundant as it sounds, I do. Save oldies.  <br /> <br />Anyways, I bought the CD and found myself constantly listening to it over and over. And over and over and...etc. etc. I mean, some songs got old pretty fast, but if you give it some break before listening to it over and over then they are wonderful songs in my ears. Those 30 seconds where what grabbed me and made me get the full version of my favorite. And no matter how many times I listen to it (studying, in the car, so on and so forth.) I still love it. The words are meaningful but yet they keep me interested. The beats are just amazing as well as the guitar solos. The vocals you ask? Mind-blowing. <br /> <br />Sure I mean, there are good things about the CD and bad things about the CD but I still love it. If I said it were perfect I'd be lying. But I'm not. So if you like the 30 seconds, or a song or two on the CD I'd say you should buy it. All of the songs got me by the string. And while this poppy-princess 16-year old is telling you what to do, remember, My Chemical Romance is good in amounts. Don't overdose. I still listen ot Shaggy and  Brittany Spears at times. But let's just say, whether you are working or studying,...if you're like me...You'll get hooked. <br />-- Kisses and Hugs
B00000I07Q|4.0|Lay Your Hands On Me: A long instramental intro with kind of a church feeling to it. But it's no church songs with lyrics like \\" <br />Bad Medicine: Incredible drums, fast lyrics, and doing it one more time with feeling. They got it bad and it feels good. <br />Born To Be My Baby: It has Bonnie and Clyde feel to it. An us against the world song. I love the opening of \\"1, 2, 3, 4\\" followed by a fast beat. <br />Living In Sin: A nice love ballad, the music video was deemed too inappropriate for MTV and was banned. <br />Blood On Blood: A high energy song about the band's wild boyhood. Jon is still just a singer in a long-haired rock 'n roll band. <br />Homebound Train: I never really listen to this one, so I don't really have much of an opinion. <br />Wild Is The Wind: Very catchy, and fun to sing along with. Easy to get stuck in your head. <br />Ride Cowboy Ride: Recorded in mono, this minute long acoustic song is a nice cowboy prelude to Stick to your Guns. <br />Stick To Your Guns: Another nice cowboy song. <br />I'll Be There For You: Their fourth number one hit, this love song has nice guitars, great harmonies, an unexpected key change in the end. It has some cheesy lyrics when read off a piece of paper, but when you hear them sung by Jon, it's very romantic and sentimental. <br />'99 In The Shade: A fun song, but not one of the best. <br />Love For Sale: It sounds like this song was just put on the record for the fun of it. They were just goofing around. It's a fast, funny, kinda country song. Richie and Jon's conversation at the end is also quite humorous. <br /> <br />
B0009MDPYM|5.0|i hear everyone saying that this is stupid and not scary, well, its not supposed to be. this movie is more like a sci-fi matrix time and a damn good one at that.
B00000I07P|5.0|Let It Rock:It has an unexpected opener from them and takes a while to get into the song, but does a great job kicking off the album by showing how fun it will be. I love the mention of Captain Kidd and the King of Swing also. <br />You Give Love A Bad Name:The song starts out fierce with no intro beats. It was one of their biggest hits, and the lyrics are awesomely naughty. <br />Livin' On A Prayer:I am in love with this song. I may just have to call it my favorite. It helps you get through life a little bit easier just by know that you're halfway there, wherever \\"there\\" is... It's uplifting and richie's talkbox rocks. We start to see Springsteen's influence in this one. It's the favorite among Jovi fans even though Jon doesn't really like it and never thought it'd make it big. <br />Social Disease:One of their many songs that relates love to a sickness. The intro is filled with sex noises...Anyways, it's not the best, but I love the call for \\"Dr. Bon Jovi\\" and then the prescription of \\"nothing a shot can't cure\\" in the end. <br />Wanted Dead Or Alive:It's a classic. One of Bon Jovi's many cowboy songs. It was basically a journal of how their lives were at that point in time. Jon dared by saying \\"i've seen a million faces and i've rocked them all\\" early in his career before they were headliners, but luckily he can truthfully make that claim now. It's always nice to hear Richie too! <br />Raise Your Hands: This one rocks when played in concert, especially Richie at the beginning. I love how everyone raises their hands together and all the cities are mentioned in it, especially Sayreville, New Jersey at the very end. It's a really fun song. <br />Without Love: It's okay, it's the kind of a song for when you don't care about the rest of the world and you're just in complete bliss. <br />I'd Die For You: This song is a great pledge of love with awesome keyboards, it was one of my favorites in earlier days. <br />Never Say Goodbye:It would make a wonderful graduation song. There are a few inappropriate mentions...drinking, smoking, sex......but still a great grad song.  <br />Wild In The Streets:Another song talking about remembering the good ole times.They always like to end the albums with fun and energetic songs. <br />

B00006ADFL|3.0|HEAVENLY CREATURES is one of the films Peter Jackson directed before he reached superstar status with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Jackson gives us a bizarre, insightful, but ultimately, dissatisfying look at two young girls who think murder is the answer to all of their problems.  Knowing that one of the girls (Juliet) grew up to be acclaimed mystery novelist Anne Perry adds a sense of irony.  Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet give flawless performances, eliciting that awkward innocence of youth, but their chilling deviousness in plotting the murder of Lynskey's mother gives an underlying chill to this innocence.  Jackson's fantasy scenes are marvelous, presaging his finesse to come.  But can one really sympathize with these two girls?  I didn't...Lynskey's mother is nothing more than a concerned mother who has a right to question her daughter's rebellious behavior...she is no more callous or harsh than any one's mother.  The brutal murder comes after a painstakingly deliberate pace which adds an even more hideous reaction to these young girl's actions.  From a filmmaking standpoint, HEAVENLY CREATURES is exceptionally well done, but for entertainment value, it's hard to be entertained by such self-centered youngsters.

Now remember, this is the best Metallica record that you'll ever find.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Over the last two years, a handful of various friends have been urging me to see Donnie Darko. I asked them what it was about and they said, \\"It's about this guy who sees a demon bunny.\\"<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />It's about so much more. Mental psychosis, time travel, and yes, a demon bunny. But mainly, the story deals with a teen who seems to remind you of a certain Holden Caufield - strange considering Jake Gyllenhaal and lookalike Tobey McGuire both mention Caufield in two films they were in - The Good Girl(Gyllenhaal) and Pleasantville (McGuire).<br /><br />Donnie, the name of the character played by Jake G, is being stalked by a human-sized demonic bunny that tells him to do things. Donnie makes himself listen because the bunny, named Frank, saved his life from a plane engine that crashes into his room. But Frank wants Donnie to do more things, seemingly evil things.....<br /><br />Okay, now that we've officially got the originality factor into play, let me just say that this screenplay, the acting and the mood compel you to watch more. I went from laying on the ground as I watched this film to sitting up on my dumpa at the end, bracing for what might happen next (well, not bracing, but close).<br /><br />The musical score is amazingly fitting, and the acting - even from Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, is first rate. This is a film that will make just about anyone keep sitting and watching.<br /><br />Warnings to those who care - LOTS of profanities in the beginning of the film. Not much violence throughout. A few sexual references while Donnie's in psycho therapy, and no nude scenes but there is one sexual scene that lasts maybe ten seconds but involves kissing on a bed - nothing more.<br /><br />I've seen Bully, At Close Range and War of The Worlds in the last three days and this was hands down better than all of them.<br /><br />One last parting shot - if you don't pay attention all the way through, you'll miss out. Yeah, it's one of those films. So don't watch this with a room full of your A.D.D. pals. And if you're one of those A.D.D. pals, good luck, man! You gonna need it!of those films. So don't watch this with a room full of your A.D.D. pals. And if you're one of those A.D.D. pals, good luck, man! You gonna need it!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Wow! What an amazing record! Twelve tracks of everything from screaming to soothing melodies all in one. In some places it can be found for only ... I dare you to find a better deal or a better band!!! A Perfect Circle found their way into the (almost) mainstream with their legendary Mer de Noms LP. This album is sure to bring much attention to A Perfect Circle with songs like \\"Weak And Powerless.\\" So, get off your computer, and go buy this album. GET YOUR COPY NOW!

B000089CJI|4.0|Sometimes I am skeptical of bands made of various members from other already proven bands.  I previewed a few tracks of this album online, and then went out and bought it on a whim. For weeks I couldnt get it out of my cd player. Everytime I listen to it, it is as relaxing and enjoyable as the first time.  If you like Death Cab, Modest Mouse, or anything remotely close to their genre.......get this album NOW.
B00006879E|4.0|Everyone likes maroon 5!!! who doesn't? if you don't i think your mentally disabled really. These songs are pure pop gold!!! Alright i'm joking about the mentally disabled part don't get your panties tangled in a bunch i'm just saying it is so hard not to like these songs.The first song \\"Harder to breathe\\" is just pure adrenline from start to finish. \\"This love\\" you know for sure but come on you can listen to that song forever.\\"Shiver\\" with its funky guitar riffs to great chorus, just amazing.\\"She will be loved\\" is another classic that just oozes sexuality and just makes you want to cuddle with your women.\\"Tangled, \\"Must get out\\" and \\"sunday morning\\" all deliver great music and great hooks.On the song \\"Secret\\" the guys change up the style to make a slow, creepy, haunting song but still manages to be a great song.\\"through with you\\" is short but fun\\"not coming home\\" is good also and \\"sweetest goodbye\\" delivers such a great hook. <br />So okay what really makes maroon 5 a good band is their choruses! A great hook can save a song and it is evident here with every song having a catchy hook that will stay in your mind when you are not listening to this cd!But i do not recommend this cd for one reason. There is a much better copy of this cd which is the asian version of songs of jane which lucky for you is available here at amazon/cdnow. The asain version contains an extra 4 songs which is Ragdoll, harder to breathe and this love acoustic versions and a kanye west remix of this love which dare i say is almost as catchy as the original. So Songs of jane is a great cd to pick up but in my opinion the asian version is better but if you can't get your hands on it this version will be just fine.
6304806418|4.0|Evita is one of my all-time favorite Broadway shows. The movie is really good, but there are a few problems with it..... <br /> <br />First, it would've been so much better if the original Broadway cast (Patti LuPone and Mandy Patikin) got to play the two main roles (Eva and Che). But, Madonna and Antonio do a fairly good job. <br /> <br />Second, Madonna's voice. It's not that she doesn't have a nice voice because she does. It's just that her voice doesn't fit the character of Eva peron. Again, this problem could've been solved by casting Patti LuPone. <br /> <br />Third, this is my BIGGEST problem with this movie- I don't like the changes they made from the original play. Others movies have been changed and it worked out fine, but this one........is another story. I do like the new song they put it- the kind of rockish one that tells about the problems with the country. However, every other change they make, gives the wrong impression of Eva Peron. The movie makes her out to be a whole lot nicer than she really was. I just don't like this portrayl of Eva Peron because it's not who she was. I also don't like how they portrayed her husband, Juan Peron. The movie made him seem like a straight, grown-up man while in real life, he was actual very childish and immature.  <br /> <br />All in all, I love this movie and can watch it over and over again. But whenever someone watches it with me, I always have to point out \\"Well, Eva wasn't really like that, that's just how they made it in the movie.\\"

B0008G2IRO|5.0|When i visited Border's in Evaston at night , I saw Gorillaz's second album in the racks and it costs 18.99 . I begged my mom to get it but she told me that we don't have time . So i was really angry at the hotel we were staying for my sister's graduation in June. I am still angry at my mom for not buying it for me.Doesn't she know that i love this cartoon band so much since i was watching their video Clint Eastwood when i was only fifteen in 2001 and got the first album . Now i am nineteen and i have been very patient for Gorillaz to comeback with a second album in four years. When i saw the video Feel Good Inc. in mtv.com I couldn't believe that Gorillaz have matured alot and Noodle looking older before my eyes brought me back memories of watching their videos at the age of 15 . Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn have done such a good job doing a cartoon band that everyone will enjoy in years to come and Iam very proud of them for doing it.I hope I will follow in their footsteps to make my own cartoon band someday for the future to enjoy like Gorillaz was and do the very best for my future.When i saw Gorillaz announced as a cartoon band ,i thought to myself that this is what i have been waiting for in years.I loved the animation of all the videos and making my own cartoon band will be my first goal into becoming a cartoonist.When i heard the first album i was hooked and images of them flashed in my mind and i was wondering if they will make another album and in 4 years they did . i hope to get the album soon as possible and i do like Noodle at fourteen years old wearing light blue eyeshadow with blush , She looks cute and as for the boys they are pretty much the same . Sorry 2D , Murdoc and Russel ,but girls rule !
B00008BXJJ|3.0|I have heard Highway to Hell for 30 seconds to see if it was good as the Bon version. Pretty Good. I want this CD.
0385659792|1.0|This book was horrible, unless you enjoy reading something which sounds like an eight year-old wrote it. The story is flat, and seems to go nowhere. The worst was the vocabulary [or lack thereof], which, although appropriate to the narrator's mindset, is almost painful to sit through. I persisted only because I had some bleak hope that the ending might be what everyone loved about the book, but I was disappointed in that as well.
1573223026|4.0|<br />I never read a Nick Hornby book before, and I was not prepared for the sharp satirical eye and keen observational skills he adroitly displays here. The title of his novel refers to a suicide jump from the roof of a building known as Topper's House, where four characters, three English and one American, come on New Year's Eve to commit suicide. They attempt to talk one another out of the fateful deed, but the lingering threat of suicide haunts their tenuous friendship throughout the story, as voiced by the alternating voices of the four disparate narrators. Predictably the plot focuses on the characters bonding and discovering, through connections with each other, reasons to go on living. The concept sounds trivial, almost like a fable, but the execution is quite plausible, sensitive and sometimes quite amusing thanks to Hornby's quicksilver writing style and consequently allows each character his or her fair share of humanity and humor.  <br /> <br />The four sound a bit like stereotypes in a mid-1970's disaster movie. Maureen is a meek, sanctimonious woman whose life has been devoted to caring for her profoundly disabled adult son, comatose since birth. She wants to jump off the building holding a copy of Richard Yates' novel \\"Revolutionary Road\\" as a means to boost sales for the author. Perhaps to enhance the melodramatic possibilities of his premise, Hornby has painted the remaining three as semi-famous celebrities at the beginning of the story. Martin is a familiar TV talk show host and tabloid columnist until an affair with a fifteen-year-old girl obliterates his career and family. He has been reduced to interviewing nobodies on an obscure cable-access channel, FeetUp!TV. JJ is a young American musician so rocked by the rapid collapse of his band and his love life that he resorts to delivering pizzas for a living. Foul-mouthed and drug-abusing Jess is the unstable daughter of a young politician, whose big sister has disappeared and may be dead.  <br /><br />All four seem like soloists learning to become an ensemble who get past a lot of prejudices and not without incident, like flawed singers trading dissonant but heartfelt solos. Unsurprisingly, they all wind up some place quite different at the end of the book from where they expected. They eventually reunite even attempting a group intervention at a Starbucks when things go south for their burgeoning friendship. Such is Hornby's dry sense of humor. Despite the rich comedy, there is uneasiness in the subject matter. While Hornby's sensibility is perfectly matched to the quirkier elements here, he seems less comfortable with the subject of suicide itself. He generally opts for the comedy than dealing with the darker elements, and the novel simply tapers off in a pat manner with hints of reluctant affirmation among the characters. Hornby makes me care about these four failed suicides because he realistically illustrates how their lives improved almost imperceptibly. It's a subtle growth that signals a major writing talent. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Buffy and Angel are two of the best shows ever aired on TV.  But since I was turned onto Firefly, I have to say that it seems like they were the shows where Whedon honed his phenomenal skills but that Firefly goes to a whole other place starting with the benefit of all that experience. <br /> <br />This is the first show where I've purchased *two* sets of DVDs, with the second set reserved for loaning out to friends and co-workers.  this show is THAT good! <br /> <br />Enough said.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Jurassic Park 3 is an ok adventure flick.  Once again, dinosaurs are out to hunt people.  Will they make it off the island?  Jurassic Park 3 is much better than the second Jurassic Park.   <br /> <br />PG-13 Moderate violence, mild language and suspense.  It's not terrible like the 2nd one, but it's still not really a family film because it would frighten smaller children, which is probably the main reason why they rated it PG-13.   <br /> <br />All in all, it's an OK film to rent.
B0000VCZKW|1.0|Other reviewers are correct. MATILDA, one of Danny DeVito's underrated masterpieces of humor, was released in 2.35:1. Once again, a DVD release crops it to fit \\"conventional\\" televisions. The term \\"conventional\\" is fast become outdated, since 16:9 widescreen digital TVs are getting increasingly affordable. My humble suggestion: make clear to studios that charging us full price for only half the frame of the director's movie are charging TOO MUCH. Wait for a \\"real\\" special edition that presents the film as DeVito intended it to be seen.
B000003TAW|5.0|It's great to hear a good humoured band who produce good music and obviously not obsessed with their image (although they have one: the classic \\"geeks\\"). <br /> <br />Being reasonably new to pop/rock and good music in general I admit I'm not the longest standing Weezer fan. I, like many others, heard 'Buddy Holly' in the mid-1990's and I liked it, I really didn't think to pursue the band that took about five years for that to happen. I had recently re-heard 'Buddy holly' to me (and saw the classic Spike Jonze Video)and I loved it, recalling the name of the group was difficult... basically I'm stupid. I bought the album in the summer of '03 and soon became a total Weezer enthusiast! I know own the The Green Album, Make Beleive and Pinkerton and I can honestly say - in my opinion - none of those compare to the consistent quality on this album. <br />'Buddy Holly' is one of those immortal tracks which is fun, punchy and good lyrically and musically but I think on the album it takes a back-seat to the following tracks: the classic, hilarious, brilliant 'Undone', the outrageously fun 'Surf wax america' and the anthematic awe that is \\"Say it ain't so\\" - my favourite weezer song (period). <br />If you like weezer and you don't own it, RUN TO THE SHOP AND BUY THIS. if you like general rock/pop music, RUN TO THE SHOP AND BUY THIS. GREAT DEBUT.
B000002HMH|4.0|Load is definitely different. If you're going for black album sound listen to King Nothing, if you like the slower ones Until it Sleeps or Hero of the Day. Bleeding Me is slow but explodes towards the end of the song. The low point is definitely Mama Said, I don't know anyone, not even hard core fans, that like it. It's a country song that isn't very...anything really. I would recommend this only to more dedicated fans. IT ISNT THE WORK OF OLD AND ITS NEVER GONNA BE!!! I liked it a lot. My favorite: King Nothing.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is beautiful, ugly, touching and shocking all at once. From the moment it starts, it has you in it's grip and won't let you go. It is unlike anything seen before. It is intense. It is violent. And it's tone is very dark. But it's passion draws you in. And the physical world that Frank Miller created has been faithfully reproduced by Robert Rodriguez and his team. This is a landmark movie. And the performance by Mickey Rourke as Marv is Oscar-caliber. He has vindicated those of us who have always believed he was a great actor in the tradition of Brando and DeNiro.
B00005JNQ8|3.0|'The Interpreter' has strong cast, slick direction, and authentic mood (the film being pastly shot in the real United Nations building).  If the film had been shot in the 70s, the incredible story (and especially its ending) might have sounded more plausible.  As it is, with today's more complex political situations surrounding the UN, 'The Interpreter' remains just an OK thriller -- entertaining, but ultimately unbelievable. <br /> <br />Of course, you don't have to make everything believable in thrillers, but I point out this obvious thing about reality because 'The Interpreter' starts with an excellent premise.  While in a booth in the UN Headquarter in New York, an  interpreter Silvia Bloom (Nicole Kidman) happens to overhear part of conversation (in one African fictional language Ku), which strongly suggest that one assassination plot is going on.  And that assassination, as she learns later, might happen here, in the UN. <br /> <br />Consequently, security agent Tobin Keller is called in, who at first does not buy her story.  However, as the story unfolds, several incidents happen to Silvia, and Tobin starts to guard her with his men, thinking that there is a possiblity that she is still lying to him, or to us audiences. <br /> <br />You get two superstars -- Nicole Kidman as UN translator, and Sean Penn as security guard.  Both do not disappoint us, but I must say there is no chemstry between them.  As the film is basically a thriller, well, I can ignore that flaw, but not this one, which is the film's too complicated and incredible story about assassnation. <br /> <br />Think about this.  If you're a president of some country, and is being accused of tyranny (I hope you're not!), would you come all the way to New York City where most likely you will not be welcomed?  And when you might be assassinated?  His motive is explained in the end, which -- excuse me for using strong words, but ... which is an insult to our intelligence.  And Nicole Kidman's character, at first a pretty credible one, gradually becomes awfully contrived and even ridiculous (sorry I cannot revela that part).  Do you believe all of her 'past'?    <br /> <br />Despite the great cast including Catherine Keener, Yvan Attal, Jesper Christensen, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, Clyde Kusatsu, and Michael Wright, their characters are all pieces of a big puzzle, which is not uninteresting itself, and considering the complexity of the material, Sydney Pollack did a superb job with his slick direction (as in seen in 'The Firm'), but all in all I was not intrigued by the whole film, of which politics are outmoded, and even silly in this post 9/11 world.  Good acting, lots of suspence, not-so-good story.                   <br /> <br />
B00021R7CG|3.0|I've always been a sucker for \\"end of the world\\" themes in literature and cinema. Having enjoyed such efforts as \\"Threads,\\" \\"Testament,\\" and \\"The Day After,\\" I decided to give this film a shot. And it was pretty good, but if you're looking for great special effects involving nuclear devastation, you'd better look elsewhere. With the exception of one REALLY haunting image of the sky lighting up with a thermonuclear fireball just outside windows of the White House, this film takes a more subtle approach, focusing on the fear and confusion amongst top brass when a rogue attack triggers a nuclear exchange. This film is more in the tradition of \\"Fail Safe.\\" Not bad, but not that great either.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|I don't know the reaction of Clive Cussler fans to this film -- I don't know why the author is so angry about it -- but as an ordinary film fan, 'Sahara' is mostly enjoyable, if not outstanding action adventure film.  Matthew McCoaughey is a likable treasure hunting hero Dirk Pitt from 'NUMA'; Steve Zahn is a scene-stealing sidekick (and he is always so) Al Giordino; and Penelope Cruz as a doctor Eva Rojas from WHO, who gets involved with Dirk's adventures.  These premises, together with the hidden gold coins made during the time of the Civil War, sound much like 'National Treasure,' and the comparison is interesting because director of 'Sahara' is Breck Eisner ('Taken') also known as son of Michael Eisner. <br /> <br />But 'Sahara' is different from that Nicholas Cage film, and that is the location mostly set in the hot desert of Africa.  Dirk, Al, and another NUMA agent Rudi (Rainn Wilson) borrowing a small boat from Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy), cruise on the river into the desert of Mali, Africa, where he believes a huge US iron-clad ship disappered with gold coins. <br /> <br />At the same time, the film shows us that a deadly plague is killing the people of Mali.  So, on the way to the country, Dirk and Al travel with a beautiful doctor Eva, who seeks for the cause of the disease with her senior Dr. Frank (Glynn Turman).  Don't call it a contrived story yet, for 'Sahara' is going to get more contrived as the team is attacked by the machine-guns, rockets, tanks, and helicopters of the country's troops, and their incredible adventures begin. <br /> <br />That's it, and that's all I have to say.  The film is made with a familiar set-pieces, none of which are particularly imaginative or innovative, but techinically speaking they are fine.  Action film fans like me might say we have seen the same kind of scenes -- like, peeping into the 'secret' of one company owner (Lambert Wilson); blowing dynamites without using fuse, or foolishly giving our heroes chances to escape from the villains who just don't think of killing them instantly.  You can spot bits from James Bond, bits from Indiana Jones, or bits from any actioners shot in Morocco, the land which provides the wonderful landscapes for the film.  <br /> <br />However, in spite of its impossible story and lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Cruz (who is miscast, I am afraid), the whole film goes plesantly enough, with competently done action sequences and authentic images of Africa.  Totally unoriginal, but 'Sahara' is still fun to see.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets (Metallica's 3rd album, 1986) <br /> <br />Back in the 80's, Metallica were the Gods of metal music.  With their rocking guitar riffs, hardcore melodies, and deep lyrics, no other metal group could compare to the likes of them.  Their heavy debut, Kill em All, was a success with popular hits like \\"Whiplash\\", but their second release, Ride the Lightning, was more mature and had an improved sound, but once they released Master of Puppets in 1986, the improvement went even further, thus creating one of the biggest heavy metal albums in history. <br /> <br />I think I spoke a bit too soon when I said that Ride the Lightning was Metallica's greatest effort, since this third album of their's is even better that that CD.  Metallica definately improved their music for Ride the Lightning, but it's even more solid on Master of Puppets.  The music is melodic and beautiful, with awesome guitar riffs and a LOT more solos, but the lyrics are significantly improved.  Something like, \\"Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings/twisting your mind and smashing your dreams\\" sounds a lot more deep than, \\"Someone help me/OH PLEASE, GOD, HELP ME!/they're trying to take it all away\\", since although the lyrics were good on Ride the Lightning, they were just slightly simple for a metal album.  Master of Puppets' lyrics will REALLY wake you up. <br /> <br />The CD opens similarly to Ride the Lightning, with an acoustic solo that follows into an energy-packed up-tempo song (\\"Battery\\").  On Master of Puppets, however, Metallica managed to add a taste of awe-inspiration.  With great solos, catchy lyrics, and an incredibly wonderful song-opening, it seems as if they couldn't have possibly made a better intro. <br /> <br />Then again, once the title track comes in, you'll be impressed.  With smashing-hard guitar riffs, a great anti-drug message, and pulsing lyrics, this is a perfect second song.  Within a few minutes, the melody slows down and you'll some of the most beautifulsolos ever written until the tempo picks up again. <br /> <br />\\"The Thing that Should not be\\" is also good, but it isn't quite as impressive as some of the other stuff on here, and it definately sounds like it came from Ride the Lightning, instead, especially since the interesting storyline is about a legend (as is the case quite a bit on RTL) and the music fits the lyrics excellently. <br /> <br />Then comes one of Metallica's greatest hits ever, the astounding rock ballad, \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\".  The solos are just as wonderful as that of the middle of the title track.  The lyrics are extremely deep.  Eventually, the speed picks up a bit and makes this sound like a slower version of the title track.  Probably the best song on the entire CD. <br /> <br />Riffs and drum syncopation are the main focuses of \\"Disposable Heroes\\", and it possesses a great anti-war message.   A great high-throttle solo can be found, too.  Be sure to notice the key-changes during it.  Overall, a experiment gone well. <br /> <br />\\"Lepper Messiah\\" is another song that sounds like it could've been on RTL.  Unfotunately, the only interesting melody attributes are the speed pick-up during the second half and a slow-down for the finale, byt that doesn't mean this is a bad song.  It's good, but certainly not the best. <br /> <br />\\"Orion\\" is instrumental, so expect some intriguing melodies and riffs from here.  The opening is a cresendo-ing drift, but soon you'll here some extremely catchy riffs.  Within the middle of the song, with the bang of a gong, you'll be listening to a very mellow melody that continues for three minutes until the original theme picks up until the end of the song. <br /> <br />The beginning of the last track, \\"Damage inc.\\", is nothing more than individually-cresendo-ing metal sounds, but suddenly, the throttle picks up and turns this into a TOTAL thrash song, making \\"Damage inc.\\" sound a lot like \\"Battery\\", but it's even more intense. <br /> <br />Master of Puppetsis a metal legacy that will live for a long time.  Listening to it, you'll think to yourself, \\"they couldn't have done any better than this\\".  If you've been listening to stuff other than metal, upon one listen, you'll be saying, \\"what kind of music was I listening to before?\\", and you'll want to buy all their other albums (outside of their last 3).  If you love rock music, or especially heavy metal, but don't own Master of Puppets, you have got to buy this, since you're missing out on a classic! <br /> <br />p.s., RIP, Cliff Burton.  Metallica started to become less and less popular ever since you left the world.  The band was never the same without your great bass riffs and solos. <br /> <br />p.p.s., actually, I bought this album before I got Ride the Lightning.  I probably liked RTL best at first because it was more simple, and therefore more pleasing to a first-time metal-listener.  Once I gave this CD another spin, I was more astonished than ever.  Therefore, I recommend buying RTL first and buying this afterwards.

It's been so long since a band has been able to combine ridiculously technical instrumentals (by today's standards) with tunes that are just so damn catchy. Just listen to the start of track 3 'Blinded In Chains' or the solo/bridge of 'Bat Country', you only need to hear them a couple of times and the riffs will be stuck in your head. They've obviously been influenced by 80s metal stalwarts such as Maiden, Metallica and GnR, but I don't understand why people seem to think this is a bad thing. It'll be good to finally have some music that's somewhat mainstream that's  actually played by musicians who have talent and are deserving of recognition. <br /> <br />The drumming and guitar work on this album are fantastic, especially Syn's solos. A couple more efforts like this and he's definately on the way to beocming a guitar god. Just listen to the solos on 'Wicked End' and 'M.I.A', enough sweep arpeggios to make Malmsteem proud, and the flamenco guitar solo at the end of Sidewinder is just amazing, you have to hear it to fathom just how jaw-droppingly good it is. <br /> <br />Shadow's singing, though not quite as good as the clean vocals on Waking The Fallen, is nonetheless still pretty good. The fact that he learnt a different way of singing to cope with his vocal chord surgery, as well as the much larger vocal range needed in this album (compared to WTF), in such a short amount of time shows that he has a lot of potential in the future. <br /> <br />And finally for all the hardcore/metalcore kids: Hate them as much asyou like, they don't want closed minded little turds liek you as fans anyway. Go back to listening to your Bleeding Through and Hatebreed and other such simplistic crap, keep on pretending that you actually know what good music is, keep on pretending that BrEaKdOwN'z R FuLLy SiK! You guys are no better than the supposed 'teenyboppers' you loathe so much, you disgust me. Keep on hating everything except hardcore, but in the end, what good does it do you? I can go to a metal show and enjoy the music immensly, I can go to an RnB club and dance and enjoy the music, hell I can even go to the shows of a few select good Metalcore bands, such as Unearth or As I Lay Dying, and have an awesome time. You on the other hand, can only ever have fun at a hardcore show cos nothign else iZ bRuTaL EnUfF, wherever else you go you'll just stew in your own pathetic rage. The people who like the music that you hate don't really give a rat's about your opinion, we're having fun and that's all that matters.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love love love this CD and I know countless others that feel the same. John Mayer is not only a talented singer, but also is a talented song writer and guitarist, which seems to be a thing of the past with today's music. I listen to this CD just about every day and am still not bored with it and I bought this a year ago! His newest CD is also super, but this one is the best in my opinion. <br />HAPPY LISTENING!
B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins gained fame and commercial success with their classic alternative rock album Siamese Dream, then they decided to do something many artists then and now fail to do successfully...evolve and change their sound. Billy Corgan pours his heart on on 28 unbelievable tracks that take you on an emotianol journey exploring life's highs and lows. Some songs are beatiful and touching(\\"Tonight Tonight\\", \\"Galapagos\\", \\"Thirty Three\\", \\"1979\\", \\"In The Arms of Sleep\\") while others are earth shattering rock at its finest(\\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\", \\"Zero\\", \\"XYU\\",\\"Bodies\\"). There is also so much experimentation on this album (\\"Porcelina\\", \\"Ruby\\", \\"Lily\\", \\"By Starlight\\") that it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of the White Album or Dark Side of the Moon. The thing that sets MCIS apart from the those two classic albums is the sincerity and beauty in the songwriting.. Corgan wears his heart on his sleeve on MCIS and channels all his feelings through 2 and a half hours of the greatest alternative rock album ever made. <br /> <br />Standout Tracks <br /> <br />Tonight Tonight <br />1979 <br />In The Arms of Sleep <br />Porcelina of the Vast Oceans <br />XYU <br />33 <br />Ruby <br /> <br />Hell its all good!!!!!!

B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys is awesome. She has SO much talent, and she's just an amazing musician. This album backs it up. <br /> <br />With that said, the only bad songs would be \\"Dragon Days\\" and the overrated \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" (it changes in the song too much). Otherwise, if you don't own a skip button, you won't have a problem buying this. <br /> <br />My ratings: <br /> <br />Harlem's Nocturne - 2/5 - An interlude that is just okay. <br /> <br />Karma - 4/5 - This song is good. I love the superstition mix better than this album version, but that's okay, the song is still cool, even though it's only about the word karma and nothing else. <br /> <br />Heartburn - 4/5 - This song is so cool! I love how the dums go so fast in the song, it adds so much energy. <br /> <br />If I Was Your Woman - 5/5 - This is such an awesome track! She plays the piano so great in this song. If you need to prove her talent, but his song on! Oh, and I love the beginning when Alicia says \\"A-M-O-B, drop it on me!\\". <br /> <br />You Don't Know My Name - 2/5 - I personally think this song is overrated. The chorus repeats itself too much, and the song is too long in time (almost 5 minutes). I guess it's okay, but it gets way too repetitive. <br /> <br />If I Ain't Got You - 5/5 - This is an awesome song! The bomb! And this isn't even the best song on the CD! I love the piano, and Alicia's vocals are so sweet in this song. <br /> <br />Diary featuring Tony Toni Tone - 4/5 - This is a very good track. The only reason I marked it off is because it's slow and it's boring when you want to her upbeat tracks. Still, this is a great cut, and Tony Toni Tone was perfect for this one. <br /> <br />Dragon Days - 3/5 - I like the message of the song, but it's just not that good. The beat needs a new tea bag and vocals are only okay. But the lyrics are awesome, though. <br /> <br />Wake Up - 4/5 - This is another good track. Hopefully Alicia will wake up from those dragon days. The beat is good and her vocals shine as usual. <br /> <br />So Simple - 4/5 - see \\"Wake Up\\" <br /> <br />When You Really Love Somebody - 4/5 - I like this track. The beat is nice, and it has a good meaning. It's basically the exact opposite of R. Kelly's \\"When A Woman's Fed Up\\". <br /> <br />Feeling U Feeling Me - 2/5 - Another somewhat worthless interlude. <br /> <br />Slow Down - 3/5 - It's an ok track, if you really enjoy very slow tracks. The vocals and lyrcis are good, but the beat is just way too slow and boring. <br /> <br />Samsonite Man - 5/5 - THE BEST SONG OF THE CD!!!!!!!!!!! I just LOVE THIS SONG!!! I play it all the time. The meaning is sad but it has a good message. It's the anthem for girls when their guy is leaving them. \\"Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go. He's the samsonite man.\\" LOVE THE BEAT TO DEATH! The beat is just amazing, Alicia Keys and Erika Rose produced and wrote this, KEEP PRODUCING! This song is so awesome that I can describe how much I love it! When you buy this, listen to this first! It's AWESOME! <br /> <br />Nobody Not Really - 4/5 - It's an interlude, but it's actually not filler. To be honest, this isn't really an interlude, I think it's a song. I think it's just taken as an interlude because it's kinda short (2:56). But, I still consider this as a song. The beat is good, and I like the chorus. <br /> <br />Overall, if you like \\"Karma\\" or \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", or otherwise any song on this album, buy it. It worth every penny, even though there is too many filler interludes. <br /> <br />My Top 5: <br /> <br />1) Samsonite Man <br />2) If I Ain't Got You <br />3) If I Was Your Woman <br />4) Karma <br />5) Heartburn
0062502182|3.0|Coelho tells the story of the shepherd Santiago, who goes in search of treasure to fulfill his life's purpose or \\"Personal Legend.\\" If you can get past the perennial existential babble, it's a decent story and - I admit - it made me reflect on my life. For that latter quality, I recommend it. [Examples of babble: \\"Any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things,\\" and \\"If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil.\\" What?] <br /> <br />The fundamental message of the book is that you should discover your \\"personal calling\\" (as Coelho calls it in his introduction) and not be afraid to pursue it. This shepherd encounters all sorts of obstacles, yet he seems eventually remembers (or is reminded of) his goal and continues to pursue it. As I read, I found myself reflecting on my own personal calling and whether I am still on the meandering road that pursues it. I would like to be reminded to reflect on that more often. <br /> <br />In tone, the book vaguely evokes Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet but without being nearly as directly meaningful nor as poetic. Towards the beginning, I felt the same cheesiness that repelled me in Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but Coelho thankfully tones it down several notches.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The hyperbole around Coldplay's latest offering is just incredible.  There are people calling them the biggest band in the world and comparing them to super groups like U2 and others.  I don't about any of that but this has to be the best album of the year.<br /><br />X&Y is an absolutely brilliant album that is bound to be an instant classic.  I am so hooked to this album that I haven't stopped listening to this album since the very first day of it's release on iTunes.  All of the songs are incredibly melodic, catchy and bound to be instant classics.  The first single, Square One is a great song but it's just the beginning, as what follows it even gets better.  Chris Martin is just an incredible songwriter and the other members of the band are great musicians.<br /><br />I read a review where the reviewer called the music on this album as 'silent screaming' and I think that's is really an apt description.  The album just has a huge wall of sound that's really loud without sounding like Metallica.  This is a loud, rocking album with incredible guitar work that is bound to have you hooked from the first listen.
0312995423|1.0|This had to have been one of the worst books I've ever read. Suspension of reality required a great deal of endurance during this read. It was an utter waste of time for several reasons (beyond the blatent ignorance of how the Internet works in real life.) <br /> <br />1. It was predictable! There was no suspence because a semi-intelligent reader can see events and the outcome a mile away. <br /> <br />2. The author builds up an intelligent, strong and sexy heroin in the begining of the story only to turn her into a crying and weak victim in the end. What a shame to waste such a character, indeed. <br /> <br />3. The author wrote 3 chapters about an Internet search. I'm not saying it was wrong, but it was way too long for something so mundane. <br /> <br />4. The bad-guy assasin is very cartoonish. I wont give him away but he was over the top. <br /> <br />5. I don't know how to say this other than the way he uses cryptography and computers in this book is farfetched to say the least. Maybe by reading the Puzzle Palace and having a computer science degree I'm jaded about the intelligence community, crytography, and system architecture.  <br /> <br />I was very disappointed reading this after reading The Da Vinci Code. You can see that the author's style was not as refined in this book and the basic characters were the same: strong woman, intelligent man, powerful bad guy, cartoonish assasin.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|All this album is is a sardonic response to the immense expectations that listeners of popular music have set for these truly gifted producers.  Opposed to unleashing more magical and infectious tunes in a magnanamous light, Human After All not-so-subtly proclaims, \\"Shove it,\\" to its audience.  Perhaps, Bangalter and Guy are telling us to pay attention to more important things in the world today. Maybe they just don't feel like being continually lauded. Maybe they're bored...still. Who knows. Whatever the reason, they have decided to withhold greatness for awhile longer while concurrently providing glimpes of euphonious riffs in songs like \\"Robot Rock\\", \\"Prime Time of Your Life\\", and \\"Technologic\\".  Of course most of these tracks become stale from repetition and stunted growth, but that becomes the point.  <br /> <br />I would even be so bold as to suggest that, if anything, Daft Punk have likened themselves with Melville's Bartleby, from Bartleby The Scrivener. Though I don't foolishly presume to fully understand the content of such an enigmatic and classic piece of American Literature, I will continue to suggest that in the wake of the public's demand for more, like Bartleby, DP have replied with, \\"I prefer not to.\\" In the end, Bartleby influences the lawyer to view things from another perspective (mainly Bartleby's). However, DP vary themselves with Human After All representing Bartleby's death and the catalyst for such a revelation. <br /> <br />Surely, we haven't heard the end of quality material from DP. No way can the people who created songs like \\"Face to Face\\", \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\", \\"Around the World\\", etc. devolve into inconsequential matter.  Even as more evidence, listen to Bangalter's work on the soundtrack and score to the French film, \\"Irreversible\\": sheer genius.  Just when they will release new material is unknown, but if or when they do, they will once again continue to kick our a--. Ultimately, Human Afer All is the calm before the storm.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is probably the best American rock band that have ever recorded. Still can't figure out why they are not in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame.  <br /> <br />One More From The Road was always a great live album. The BEST live album just got better. It captured Skynyrd at their peak it July 76. Steve Gaines was still pretty new to the band, but he kick started something special that tragically would end shortly in that terrible plane crash.  <br /> <br />I can't say enough about this album. I have owned it in every format - 2LP vinyl, cassette, the original single CD, the remastered 20th anninversary 2CD (which I thought was so awesome, BUT to put an alternate SHA in the middle didn't make sense. You have 2 SHA in the set) , then the Deluxe double CD. I was totally blown away by this one. The sound and mix is unbelievable. Who would have thought that a live concert from 76 could sound so amazing. Advances in recordings and mixing have come a long way. I compared the sound to my other OMFTR CD's and this by far blows them away. <br /> <br />Skynyrd's setlist was white hot. They literally smoked on every track. You can actually feel the energy of their performance coming through on this CD, something which only a select few groups can do. The addtion of Ronnie Van Zant's between song talking is such a great treat. Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, Steve Gaines were cooking up something great during their run at the Fox. Artimus Pyle shines with drumming on this and Billy Powell's piano is just too perfect. Leon Wilkeson tasty bass lines are just phenomenal. These boys came to play and show the world that Skynyrd kicks butt.  <br /> <br />The setlist is a best of Skynyrd. Powerful , rockin' and high energy. This is the way Rock & Roll should be. You will find no better live versions of Skynyrd classics(MCA, SHA, SNS, Freebird) and some great covers(T For Texas , Crossroads). MCA did an outstanding job of putting the tracklist back to the original concert runningorder. Everything flows magically. The alternate versions on disc 2 are awesome. It is great to hear the differences on the songs such as SHA, Freebird , 3 Steps between the nights they played there.  <br /> <br />I recommend this Deluxe CD to anyone who is a fan of Rock & Roll and any fan of Skynyrd. Even a casual fan will be amazed that Skynyrd has this kind of energy and magic on this CD. You can't go wrong .  <br /> <br /> <br />Long live Lynyrd Skynyrd
B0000DDAU9|5.0|<br /> This album and it's follower 'Leviathan' sound like they should have been released on vinyl. They have this vibe that 99.9% of the metal community cannot produce. Like the elephant ancestor that their name is based on; the music feels like a 6 ton mammal storming towards you...but the surprise is the absolutely dazzling musicianship the group posesses. Don't take my word for it...just buy it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is without any doubt on of the best albums of the decade. I could no tell compared to other of their albums because they are so excellent. But i think this is my best Radiohead album after OK Computer. <br /> <br />They wanted a twist and did it gratefully. <br /> <br />Please check out \\"Where I end and you begin\\", Radiohead at it's highest. The second track, \\"Sit down, stand up\\" has some of the most complex moments, I can't believe what they achieve, it's like Emerson Lake and Palmer in their time. Simply the most advanced music. <br /> <br />These guys are already a legend, some more of this excelent work and their place along with groups like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin will be assured. <br /> <br />My opinion: They're already there. <br /> <br />By the way, the previous comment if obviously from someone who listens Blink 128.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I liked Audioslave's first album, and Out of Exile is almost as good, but not quite. First of all, perhaps it's just me, but many of the songs sounded quite similar. Tom Morello's still a great guitar player but I felt as if he was getting stuck in a rut here; he said in an interview that it was the first time he'd ever come to recording sessions without some kind of sense of what he was going to be playing, and I think that shines through rather well -- it's not as impressive as before. <br /> <br />Cornell's vocals are still good as well but overall I was left a bit underwhelmed. This isn't as good as the albums Rage Against the Machine (Morello and gang's best) or Superunknown (Cornell's masterpiece). And it isn't even as good as Audioslave's first album. I hope their next one is better, but for what this is, it's a good listen and definitely gets better with time. (It's kind of grown on me.)

B000929AJQ|5.0|There have been a lot of reviews published, a lot of questions answered (on why it took so long, the soul-searching, the sobriety, etc.), but the music still stands out as being, possibly, the finest of Trent Reznor's catalogue.<BR>What seperates this Halo from the rest is how it came together. When you take your typical method of writing and arranging and throw it out the window, only to sit down with a piano, a drum machine and a computer to record into, and a deadline of 2 songs for every 10 days, you set the bar pretty high. Moreso when yor last release was 5 years prior and met with lukewarm to almost fridged reviews.<BR>The end result is a pounding, danceable, stomping romp through Trent's psyche. From commentary on the U.S. administration (&quot;Hand That Feeds&quot;) to personal exorcism (&quot;You Know What You Are?&quot;, &quot;Sunspots&quot;) and heavy hurtin' songs (&quot;All The Love In The World&quot;, &quot;Only&quot;) you have a very powerful album. The angst is still there, but tempered with age and a newfound sense of clarity. Definitely one of the best albums of 2005.<br />Standout tracks: &quot;Sunspots&quot;, &quot;Only&quot;, &quot;Every Day Is Exactly The Same&quot;, &quot;The Hand That  Feeds&quot;, &quot;You Know What You Are?&quot;, &quot;With Teeth&quot;.
0316172324|4.0|Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a riveting look at rapid cognition, or our natural ability to form snap judgments. Gladwell compiles an assortment of compelling examples of how we use our rapid cognition-sometimes for better, sometimes for worse-to make split decisions.<br /><br />Meet a psychologist who can predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will still be married 15 years later by observing them for only one hour. Find out how researchers can tell which doctors will get sued and which won't after only observing 40 seconds of a conversation between doctor and patient. Meet the art historians and scholars who were able to spot an art forgery in seconds after science had \\"proven\\" it was authentic.<br /><br />This ability to discern a great deal from a limited amount of information is known as thin-slicing.<br /><br />As fascinating as the examples in the book are, what I found most interesting is what it teaches us about our snap judgments. Sometimes they go right (a firefighter who gets his men out of a building seconds before the floor collapses), and sometimes they go wrong (as in the case of the police officers who shot Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man). Why?<br /><br />More experience, not more information, seems to be the key. Experience educates our snap judgments, and experience helps eliminate the snap judgments that are behind unconscious prejudice, what Gladwell calls \\"the dark side of rapid cognition.\\" Through experience we identify signatures that allow us to make accurate evaluations in a short time. Information, especially as we compile more and more of it, tends to obscure these signatures and leads to less accurate evaluations. In many cases, this seems to contradict common sense, but the evidence in Blink is undeniable.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book's message is to respect our powers of rapid cognition, to recognize the times thin-slicing serves us and the times it leads us astray. But more than that. Rapid cognition doesn't need to be a mystery and we victims of it's whim. We can educate our snap judgments, and thereby learn to control them.<br /><br />©2005 Curtis G.

B0002S94BG|5.0|this guy was a tornado..so amazing that the word \\"amazing\\" does far from do him justice. jeff buckley was blessed with the most beautiful voice i have ever heard. this album will make you love him and if not..you're just not ready for the miracle called jeff buckley yet. On \\"Grace\\" Jeff Buckley opens the door to his soul and you will not be able to forget his voice ever again..he will expand in you and you will be hooked faster than you know. I'm not exaggerating, it's true - i know it by experience. You will want more after you heard this album, you'll always want more, believe me.
B0000C1733|4.0|Albeit that I already reviewed this CD once, I think it's important that I talk about this thing again on the account that sometime later this year the Red Hot Chili Peppers will release their ninth studio effort. <br /> <br />I read the reviews on here and I can tell most of them are the fans of the casual type. These are the people that got on to RHCP after albums like Calfornication and By The Way, when they turned away from their funk sound. True they became better musicians than when they were the trash metal, funked out, punk rockers with the hyper-energy, freakshow of the late 80s and early 90s, but the true fans of RHCP know that Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), Mother's Milk (1989), and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987) are the definitive works of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the reason why they are still around today for these \\"new\\" fans to enjoy. <br /> <br />The new fans have to understand something, funk has always been apart of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and they are actually going back to it (if you don't believe me listen to Fortune Faded, Save the Population on this collection and Rolling Sly Stone and the Black Cross (a cover) off of Live at Hyde Park), which might turn off the new fans. <br /> <br />Then again, the Red Hot Chili Peppers without funk is like American flag with no stars on it, it just doesn't sound right. <br /> <br />Anyways, on to the Greatest Hits collection. It is a Warner Bros. release, which has struck a nerve with many older RHCP fans since it did not include their material from their EMI heyday (although strangely Higher Ground made it on to here and that was from Mother's Milk, an EMI album). Nonetheless it really is not bad. <br /> <br />Four tracks from Blood Sugar Sex Magik - Under The Bridge, Give It Away, Breaking The Girl, and Suck My Kiss made the cut onto this collection. Suck My Kiss (best job Flea has ever done on bass) and Give It Away (Frusciante's guitar is pretty wicked) stay true to their \\"heritage\\" of sorts...rockin' while funkin' out at the same time. Breaking The Girl is like classical music with a heavy bass, and it's one of the better jobs that Anthony Kiedis has done on vocals and Under The Bridge is a rather impressive 4 1/2 minutes of work with the closing choir vocals and Flea's soothing bass. <br /> <br />A B-side to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Soul To Squeeze which later appeared on the Coneheads soundtrack stands out as the best RHCP song ever done. It blew me away when I heard it. <br /> <br />Scar Tissue, Otherside, Californication, Parallel Universe, and Road Trippin all made it off the Peppers' 1999 release Californication. Strangely, it's only five of the six tracks that  made top 50 on the modern rock charts. The other one, the notably omitted Around The World was actually a modern rock number one so I'm baffled as to why that was left out. Nonetheless, to me, Parallel Universe is the best one to make it off of Californication and I don't know why that wasn't released as a single with one of the best guitar minute-long solos I have ever heard. <br /> <br />By The Way and Universally Speaking made here off of RHCP's last release, By The Way from 2002. Most American fans are confused as to why Universally Speaking is on here instead of Can't Stop or The Zephyr Song. Universally Speaking was actually released as a single overseas, but as much as I like Universally Speaking, Can't Stop would have been a much better fit. Plus, the CD is only 65-67 minutes long, so they could have added Zephyr Song also. <br /> <br />My Friends is the only track from One Hot Minute when they had Dave Navarro at guitar. Other people loved it, and true, it is rather beautiful, but it is usually a track I skip because it just dragged way too much. (I guess it comes from being between Breaking The Girl and Higher Ground). They should also added Aeroplane from One Hot Minute. Dave Navarro was a pretty good influence on the band...even though I really wasn't all too crazy about the fact that him and Anthony kissed in the video for Warped...which was actually sort of a dumb song anyway and at least that didn't make the cut. <br /> <br />Here's the real injustice. Higher Ground is the only song from the 80s to make it on to Greatest Hits. True, Higher Ground put them in the Top 20, but Knock Me Down and Taste The Pain all made Top 50 I think and at least one of them if not both should have made the cut on to the Greatest Hits CD since they did get permission to get Higher Ground from EMI. <br /> <br />The two new songs, Fortune Faded and Save The Population were taken from the recording session in August 2003 when they recorded 15 songs. They are pretty impresive and pretty funky...in a spacy out sort of way. <br /> <br />If you listen to this collection and you're a hardcore fan you are going to miss the old band even more. There's no rousing rockers like Fight Like A Brave and Me and My Friends, powerful ballads like Knock Me Down, hardcore funk like Taste The Pain, Hollywood, Behind The Sun, Jungle Man, Funky Monks, or The Power of Equality. Listening to this over and over as hardcore fan gives you a sense of nostalgia as you listen in hunger for the old band. <br /> <br />I hope that the newest album they come out with comes back with the familiar spark that they had from the first nine years of the band's existence.
B00005JMUA|1.0|What a letdown. After months of waiting, we're left with a drawn-out, badly written, undercharacterised anticlimax. The action scenes are poor, the plot developments predictable, the characters uninteresting and even QT's supposedly legendary ear for dialogue is revealed to be made of solid tin - was there ever a worse last line for a major movie? And were there ever so many poor performances in one film from a supposedly major director? Carradine shines only because he rises to the giddy heights of being average in such poor company (Uma is especially bad, and the extremely unflattering photography doesn't help). <br /> <br />KB 1 was an okayish but wildly overlong actioner, but there's nothing here to match the silly but mildly exciting House of Blue Leaves finale. What that means is the big action climax actually happened at the end of another movie or halfway through this one when it's put together. After that, imagination deserts QT, but he just keeps on going like an irritating tin toy that has outstayed its welcome. A poor show, for purists and geeks only. THE disappointment of the decade.

While it's not hard to see why American audiences didn't go for it, it's harder to understand the malice European critics greeted it with. It's a pretty good portrait of resistance infighting (the Communists are setup by the De Gaullists as liberation approaches), local collaboration (the schoolteacher gladly helps the Nazis root out Jewish families) and the nuts and bolts of resistance work. No great heroics or big setpieces, which is probably why it tanked: the big climax is more an emotional risk than the rescue audiences probably wanted. Performances are mostly good - Blanchett is much better than contemporary reviews would have you believe in particular. There are better films, but it's a good movie and for my money better than the alright Lucie Aubrac. I liked it enough to buy the DVD.  <br />
B000000XBC|4.0|This collection is excellent, although I'd recommend Vol. 1 first. Lots of great songs here that are overlooked by classic rock radio. If you find that you like Vol. 1, but don't want to buy actual albums, this is a great way to delve deeper into the CCR catalouge. <br /> <br />My biggest problem is that \\"Effigy\\" isn't present. I think its among CCR's best songs.
B0000507QH|3.0|This is a classic case of great performance, shame about the movie. Sophie Guillemin is quite a revelation - in every sense - without ever appearing to do much or indeed anything. Here she reminded me a lot of Isabelle Huppert in The Lacemaker (only with much more nudity), with much of Huppert's brand of everyday sexuality.  <br /> <br />Guillemin's a blank slate of a schoolgirl/model that men in crisis project their fantasies on to. She gives them her body but nothing else, and seems constantly detached and immune to surprise or emotional or intellectual involvement, much to the distress of her latest part-time conquest, recently divorced teacher/author Charles Berling. The downward spiral of obsession that will destroy his life is a given, and that's the problem. The film constantly tries to raise the stakes to surprise us by how much further it will go, but by the last third he's become so intensely irritating in yet another variation of the previous scene - only louder and more desperate - that you lose interest. Had it ended half an hour earlier it might have been more successful, but this seriously outstays its welcome. <br /> <br />Poor movie, but definitely worth a watch for Guillemin.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come.  Keanu Reeves can't act if his life depended on it and his performance here proves that in spades. The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.  <br /> <br />Avoid.  <br />
0679777547|5.0|I am a little embarassed to say that I discovered this book only after watching the film The Ninth Gate with Johnny Depp and discovering that it was \\"based\\" on this book.  Sort of.   <br /> <br />The book, as is often said, is SO much better than the movie - so filled with literary allusions, so much more definition in the characters and the plot. <br /> <br />If you love literary mysteries, this book is a must read.  I read it in 24 hours almost non-stop because I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />In the plus column for Hollywood, it made me appreciate Johnny Depp's characterization so much more after reading the description of Lucas Corso... <br /> <br />
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I can't help but wonder if ALL the widescreen prints of this movie were destroyed in a warehouse fire. Why would you bother to master another \\"Special Anniversary Edition\\" with a new DTS soundtrack and not include a Wide screen version? Especially with more and more widescreen TVs on the market. It is going to look pretty silly in a few years showing this pan and scanned musical on your widescreen TV. While not my favorite movie musical, I would still buy it if they ever have the sense to release it in it's original format! Until then...forget it!
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album says more than any fluff pop/rock album that has come out in the past 5 years. Simply put, this is techno-metal for adults in touch with their dark side.  I have been listening to Mr Reznor since Pretty Hate Machine. He has taken the Classic Rock audience and sent it to this careful and sometimes brutal new frontier! <br /> <br />I think that The Hand That Feeds is song of the year. There is an honesty here that drives the point home. Musically, this shimmers with agression that only Trent & company can pull off. None of these metalic clones can hold a candle to this Blowtorch of musical strength. No profanity is used here, which makes this the first single in over 10 years to be radio freindly!  <br /> <br />All The Love In The World and You Know What You Are have potential to make an impact on the censor paranoid radio of the harder stations. This is an album to be appreciated as a complete piece.  <br /> <br />This work is not as deep as The Fragile, but it is complex and definitly worth getting. just like the last track you will find this album is Right Where It Belongs.    <br />
B0000039QA|4.0|A good cd by the late B.I.G. the only problem i had with this cd was that in my personal opinion is that they had to many bad rnb and rappers on this one. anyways biggie ruled on  this cd. the beats were really good they had some good  rappers like bone thugz and jay-z so if your a biggie fan the definetly get this one
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I've been a Star Wars fan since forever.  I saw NEW HOPE & EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in the 80's followed by RETURN OF THE JEDI.  I loved them all and sawe them repeatedly each about 40 times.  I loved it.  Then recently I bought the boxed set to see the extras and to see what all the hoopla people were making about the changes.  I personally don't see the big deal os.  The films are still fantastic and exciting.  I enjoyed every bit of it now as I did way back when.  Personally I believe George Lucas read my mind because as I was watching Return of the Jedi I was thinking it would be great if at the end he put the Anakin Skywalker we know today (Hayden Christensen) in the scene in the end where Luke sees his father, yoda and obi-wan.  To say the least I was overjoyed to see that he did.  It's was the right thing to do because he basically is showing Anakin restored to the man he was prior to going to the dark side.  It would have been better to have Padme inserted as well so Luke and Leia could see their mother.  But over all I believe all the additions were great and the movies are still the best.  It gets and A+++++++
0452282152|5.0|Most people recognize Vermeer as the Dutch master who created priceless works of art.  Yet little else is known about him or the subjects that he chose to paint.  In this fictional tale author Tracy Chevalier brings to life that mysterious model for the Girl with the Pearl Earring.  It is through her eyes and voice that we learn about the enigmatic Vermeer and about 17th century Dutch culture.    This simple yet absorbing storyline flows seamlessly under Chevalier graceful penmanship. In this tautly written novel, Chevalier creates a cast of intriguing characters - the cold and stoic Vermeer, his emotionally fragile and volatile wife Catharina, the powerful matriarch Maria Thins, the lecherous patron van Ruijven and the modest yet radiant Griet.   It is through these characters that Chevalier creates the intriguing premise for how that Vermeer masterpiece came to be.  A thoroughly wonderful and highly recommended read.
B000001E3V|5.0|the great eric clapton outdid himself with this classic recording !! with his 3 piece band backing him, this classic piece of music is simply one of his best !! a classic 18 and a half long \\"let it rain\\" !! you have got to hear this version, it simply blows away the shorter one !! you better hurry and get this because i have a feeling it won't be in print much longer !! take it from a 42 year rock fan, you can't top this. get this cd while you can !!

B000002LRX|5.0|I have to say that all the reviews are right on the money.  I only thought I should include something because I am not one who usually likes albums that are experimental or far from the norm.  Let me just say that this is definitely unique.  This is one of my favorite albums and I don't know why.  i don't remember needing to grow into it back in high school when it came out.  I just loved it right away.  Its a shame more people don't know about this band and this album.  All they know is epic.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore should be congratulated for his fine effort in producing this fantastic, original score.  I disagree with people that say it is a John Williams rip-off.  I assure you that this score is a fresh and new take on movie-based music.   <br /> <br />    The soundtrack can move from stark, epic pieces, to comforting and calm tracks.  There are many points that can send a shiver down your spine as you imagine what could be taking place in the film.  Another high point is the end track with Enya.  She has an amazing voice and the song she sings is very sad and beautiful. <br /> <br />    I recommend this CD to anyone who has fine taste in motion-picture scores. <br /> <br />
B0009PVZWI|1.0|THE WHOLE POINT OF DUALDISC WAS TO OFFER A CD COMPATIBLE LAYER ON ONE SIDE AND A DVD AUDIO LAYER ON THE OTHER SIDE, BUT TO MAKE THINGS FAIR THE FOUNDERS OF THIS FORMAT AGREED THAT AT THE VERY LEAST, THE DVD LAYER HAD TO CONTAIN SOUND QUALITY \\"NOT INFERIOR TO THE CD LAYER\\", SO SONY BEING WHO THEY ARE DECIDED THEY WOULD SKIMP, THE REASON: SONY CREATED THE SACD FORMAT BASED ON THEIR DSD TECHNOLOGY, AND A YEAR LATER MERIDIAN LISCENSED OUT \\"MLP\\" (MERIDIAN LOSSLESS PACKING)THUS DVD AUDIO WAS BORN, NEITHER FORMAT EXPLODED, IN LARGE PART  BECAUSE OF LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE STUDIOS, WELL SONY HAS UN-OFFICIALLY CLOSED THEIR SACD PLANT, AND DUALDISC WAS SUPPOSED TO CARRY ON THE DVD AUDIO FORMAT, BUT SONY WILL NOT PAY ROYALTIES TO A FORMAT THEY DIDNT CREATE, SO THEY OFFER \\"CHEAP\\" DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 MIXES AND STEREO THAT IS IDENTICAL TO CD QUALITY ON THE DVD LAYER, UNIVERSAL HAS PROVEN THAT YOU CAN FIT DVD AUDIO AND DOLBY MIXES ON THE DVD LAYER AS WELL AS VIDEO CONTENT. THE REASON SONY CALLS IT \\"ENHANCED STEREO\\" IS FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT MOST DVD PLAYERS SOUND BETTER THAN THE CD PLAYERS THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO (I.E. MULTI-DISC CHANGERS AND WALKMANS) BUT WHEN YOU PLAY A DUALDISC ON GOOD EQUIPMENT YOU CANT HERE A DIFFERENCE IN DISC SIDES, THIS IS FACT, NOT OPINION. SO THE ONE THING THAT THE AUDIO COMMUNITY SHOULD DO IS STOP BUYING DUALDISCS THAT MERELY STATE THAT THEY CONTAIN \\"ENHANCED ANYTHING\\" KETS KILL THIS FORMAT AND FORCE THE STUDIOS TO RELEASE HI RESOLUTION MUSIC THAT TRUE MUSIC LOVERS CAN ENJOY, NOT THESE FILE RIPPING, IPOD TOTING WHINERS THAT COMPLAIN WHEN THEY CANT ENJOY THE MUSIC THEY \\"PAID FOR\\" THE WAY THEY WANT. <br />SORRY TO SAY FOLKS,BUT DOWNLOADED MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE CRAP. <br /> <br />IM DONE, I HOPE EVERYONE READS THIS
B00005JOGE|5.0|This will have to be a great DVD. I just finished watching it and it was the most amazing spectrum of artists from around the world and it is all for a good cause in getting africa out of debt. When this DVD is released i want to buy it.
B000059H99|3.0|This review is for the 2001 MGM Special Edition DVD release.    I just recently saw the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD 28 years later after seeing it in the theater.  When I saw it in the theater as a senior in high school in 1977, it seemed exhilarating and inspiring.  Perhaps it was because it was art imititating real life: a virtual unknown actor makes an Oscar winning film against all odds.     Seeing the DVD in 2005, it lacked a lot of punch, credibility and it seemed very hard to connect to the characters.  The first thing that stood out for me was how much of a neanderthal the Rocky character was played by Sylvester Stallone.  The rest of the characters from his neighborhood were not that far behind on the IQ scale either and the dialogue was dreadfully painful and boring to sit through.  Then there was the preposterous premise of an old, washed up boxer who fights in a recreational center of a neighborhood church getting a shot at a world title fight.  The only truly great segment in this film is the last 25 minutes which includes the classic training scene through the streets and landmarks of Philadelphia complemented the outstanding music of Bill Conti playing the Rocky Theme.  The final fight scenes also hold up well and the outcome does have it merits since it bucked a predictable ending.  Perhaps its the four mediocre and unneeded sequels that may have subconsciously poisoned my enjoyment of this film recently.     The DVD transfer lacked the razor sharpness one is used to seeing on DVD.  Perhaps it was because it was a low budget film and the master copy lacked sharpness.  If you've never seen it, it's worth a watch, but don't buy the DVD, rent it.        Movie: C+     DVD Quality: B+
B00023B1LC|4.0|To clarify - I am NOT giving the movie itself a bad review. The Bourne Identity is one of my top 10 all time movies.<br /><br />I am, however, giving this \\"extended\\" DVD a 2 star rating (but with the movie being a 5 star, I figured a 4 star rating was about right). It was interesting to see the extra content, but certainly not worth re-buying the disc if you already own it. (like I did)<br /><br />So in summary - if you own it, skip this. If you don't own the movie on DVD already, this would be a good version to pick up.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore continues to amaze me with his stunning work for LOTR. The Two Towers soundtrack has some of the themes from the previous soundtrack, but it has many newer, more darker ones.   <br /> <br />    There is so much fantastic music in here that this is one soundtrack you can't pass up.  The amazing Rohan theme (played by a violen) is breathtaking.  The battle music for Helm's Deep is  great.  Every track earns five stars except the last: Gollum's Song.  It isn't too bad, but it pales in comparison to Enya's song at the end of FOTR. <br /> <br />    I do suggest that you go and buy this CD.  It has great music and should never get old.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|\\"Something is happening, but you don't know what it is.  Do you, Mr. Jones?\\" from Ballad of a Thin Man <br /> <br />Want to know who Mr. Jones is?  It's mrE from France!  Read his review. <br /> <br />Ha, ha, ha, ha! <br /> <br />See?  Dylan WAS ahead of his time!
0553288105|4.0|This story is more character driven than Asimov's best. In fact, his ability to wring emotional depth out of the most abstract alien characters is amazing. Witness the scene in which an alien composed of free floating gasses masturbates by rubbing against a rock wall...and it actually ends up being quite erotic. There are also some intriguing ideas about the first cause, meglomania and multiple universes. Certainly worth any sci-fi fan's time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Damn, I love this Album, It's not her best, But it's one of the best albums of the year. And her voice is still Bad ASS!! All haterz \\"shake it off\\". Cuz Mariah's Back and she's gonna take over again. My personal Favorites are We Belong Together, Mine Again, and Shake it off. This album is the Best, So go out and Buy IT.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Brit's not 16 anymore, she wants to appeal to a more older audiance. So, you may think its trash... then dont buy it! She's old enough to start singing songs about adults and not 13 year old kids anymore. Sometimes, the song off her first album... well, come on that was cheezy as hell. \\"sometimes i run, sometimes i hide.. sometimes i'm scared of you...\\" come on! that song is a kid song! I do believe that kids should not listen to this cd, thats the truth... but... I cant get enough of this cd! Its one of my favorites!!! Anywho, if you dont like it, take it to music trader or something. And quit whining!
0451196716|3.0|I couldn't put the book down, to be honest with you. The premise is just too interesting and there's never a dull moment. But ultimately the story really didn't amount to much.  <br /> <br />There's a very \\"Oh, the humanity!\\" theme running throughout the book as these teenage boys(who are strangely articulate and deeply profound for adolescents) walk themselves into madness and death. Meanwhile, spectators watch from the sidelines with signs, waving and smiling, cheering their favorite, treating the event like it were the olympics except for the collecting of feces and discarded shoes. Many times, I couldn't help but scratch my head and wonder: Why kill the guy who drops in cold blood? What's the point? If the contestants are there voluntarily, why should I sympathize? And why do so many people actually WANT to be in this thing?  <br /> <br />It would've helped if King would have described even vaguely the kind of world these boys inhabit that this kind of contest would exist, but he doesn't.   <br /> <br />So many questions are left unanswered by the end, which was anticlimactic at best. Quite frustrating.  <br /> <br />Also, some of the deaths seemed very unrealistic (one kid rips out his own throat), as well as the implausability of keeping at a constant 4mph pace for almost a week with no rest. That's very fast, almost running.  <br /> <br />It is, however, a very entertaining read. If you start it, you WILL finish it.
B0007GAERG|2.0|I wanted to embrace M.C.'s comeback more than anybody, but I was SUPER disappointed in this.  The lyrics are dumbed down for the J-Lo demographic (I'm guessing).  Not to mention she holds back a lot on her talent.  She whispers and shreaks entirely too much.  No to mention some sorry ass collabos.   <br />Only two good tracks...those are the singles that were released.  Don't waste you're money on this one.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Let me start out by saying is that all you have to do is listen to Mine Again, Joyride and We Belong Together to know that THE VOICE is still here alive and well.Besides from that people want an album that they can feel and The Emancipation is a great example of that..The uptempo songs Get Your Number and It's Like That, Shake It Off and One and Only in my opinion are some of Mariah's best and feature hot hot beats..
6301620208|5.0|European movie critics didn't like \\"The Day After.\\"  They said that it was not well made and was poorly acted.  They may have been right.  But that was not the point.  This movie is brave in that it only tries to do one thing.  That is to show what would happen if there were a nuclear war.  Therefore, it deserves to be ranked as one of the best made-for-TV movies of all times. <br /> <br />The setting is not New York or Los Angeles or any of the huge cities.  It is Kansas City and nearby Lawrence, Kansas, home of the University of Kansas.  The subplots of the characters lives are appropriately interrupted by the falling of the bombs. <br /> <br />The first scene after the nuclear explosions is outdoor rubble and falling snow.  But it's not snow.  It's fallout.  The doctor character played by Jason Robards is overwhelmed by those needing treatment at the humble campus hospital which is the only remaining hospital for perhaps 100 miles.  People stand in line for a sip of uncontaminated water from a pump.  All of these images are horrifying but they are based on scientific research.  <br /> <br />When this movie was first aired on TV in November 1983 experts warned that those less than 13 years old should not be exposed to this film.  But the movie was so highly publicized before its airing that no parent could possibly be unaware of the content of \\"The Day After\\" let alone that it was going to be on TV.  The night it was on, it became one of the 20 highest rated television programs of all time.  The next morning schools across the country had classroom discussions about this movie. <br /> <br />Since that time, Reagan and Gorbachev made massive reductions in nuclear arms.  The Soviet Union itself has disbanded.  The threat of a Cold War nuclear confrontation is now diminished.  But in some ways we are less safe.  The Soviet breakup left nuclear weapons scattered around several breakaway republics.  Russia brought those nukes home but their ability to keep these weapons secured from thieves is in doubt. <br /> <br />And based on what happened on 9/11/01, there are people who may be crazy enough to use them.  Now anti-Western sentiment comes not from Communist controlled Eastern republics but from radical Islamic Jihadists who we know are actively seeking nuclear weapons.  If these terrorists had the opportunity to use a nuclear weapon in an attack in the United States, it would make the World Trade Center attack look like a firecracker in comparison. <br /> <br />\\"The Day After\\" is realistic with the following caveat.  A caption at the end of the movie tells us that the effects of a nuclear war would actually be worse than depicted here. Over twenty years later, this movie unfortunately still has some relevance.  <br />
B000002H97|5.0|On behalf of all metallica fans we want to thank you for this epic album, WE'RE NOT WORTHY! You brought forth the melody. You showed metallica that thrash was not the way to go.

1932100385|5.0|Six years ago I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease).  I've always been a healthy eater and believe in natural healing whenever possible, especially through diet and (sigh!) stress reduction.  After my diagnosis, I cut out all sugar, wheat and ate even more vegetables and grains.  Although I hadn't consumed red meat in 20 years, I did still consume other animal protein.  While I was able to successfully control my crohn's disease this way, it was not until reading The China Study that I completely eliminated chicken, turkey, eggs, and cow's dairy.  I still eat a small amount of goat yogurt and goat cheese and some fish, and I've never felt better! <br /> <br />It was not The China Study alone that influenced my decision to drastically reduce my animal protein consumption.  While Dr. Campbell's results are compelling, worrying about contracting some disease in the future is not always enough to persuade most of us to stop eating hamburgers, chicken, eggs or ice cream.  The American diet revolves around these foods and it takes a concerted effort to find satisfying alternatives. <br /> <br />What cinched my decision to further reduce my animal protein consumption was the information I read in other books about the effect of factory farming on our health, environment, and our collective sense of humanity.  <br /> <br />Together with The China Study, these books make for impressive reading: <br />* Animal Liberation by Peter Singer <br />* The Food Revolution: How Your Diet Can Help Save Your Life and the World by John Robbins <br />* Plant Roots: Reasons Why the Human Diet is Rooted Exclusively in Plants by Rex Bowlby <br /> <br />When you consider that it takes 2,500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef vs. approximately 24 gallons to produce one pound of wheat, something's wrong.  In addition, my consciousness was raised when I realized how animals in factory farms (where most animals we eat are raised) are treated and killed.I was beyond horrified.  All I know is that once my awareness was raised there was no going back. <br /> <br />Whether you choose to cut out animal protein completely or simply be more conscious in your decisions about what and when you eat it, The China Study along with these other books all give you food for thought.  I can't encourage people enough to read them and come to your own conclusions.
B0000028M7|5.0|To me Alice In Chains, not Nirvana or Pearl Jam, was the band the emphasized the grunge movement of the early and mid 90s and the album that shows it best is \\"Dirt\\". This album is packed with the mix of great musical perfomances, especially by Layne Staley (RIP), and lyrics. It can be seen that the songs on the album came from the heart of band members, as they all tell about their inner struggles and emotions. Main themes of this album are drug addiction, loneliness and death. The songs that really stand out on the album are \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Would?\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\". All of these songs are singles and radio hits, otherwise some of the underrated songs are \\"Rain When I Die\\", \\"Hate To Feel\\" and \\"Dirt\\". \\"Junkhead\\" is another good tune. Overall, there are no really bad songs on the album, except \\"Sickman\\" and \\"Dam That River\\" take a little while to get used to. <br /> <br />1. Them Bones 10/10- great opening song, with some awesome lyrics <br />2. Dam That River 7/10- to me this one is one of the weaker tracks on the album even though a lot of people like it, but I do no find anything special about it <br />3. Rain When I Die 8/10- a decent song with lyrics that I really like <br />4. Down In A Hole 10/10- probably my favorite song on the album, great lyrics yet again and an awesome perfomance by both Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell <br />5. Sickman 6/10- to me worst song on the album but still rocks compared to today's immitators like Creed, Staind and Puddle of Mud <br />6. Rooster 10/10- this is a true classic from this album and will stay as one of the defining grunge tunes <br />7. Junkhead 8/10- this song is all about drugs, and it always makes me think about Layne's sad demise <br />8. Dirt 8/10- strong song, again drugs are the subject matter <br />9. Godsmack 8/10- good tune with nice chorus <br />10. Iron Gland 7/10- not really a song, but serves as a nice little break from the previous three metal tunes <br />11. Hate To Feel 8/10- this song took me awhile to get used to but it is another masterpiece nevertheless <br />12. Angry Chair 9/10- another awesome song with great perfomance by Sean Kinney and Mike Starr <br />13. Would? 10/10- this is another classic along with \\"Rooster\\" and one of my personal favorites <br /> <br />Overall: awesome album, if you are a fan of grunge, 90s rock or metal this is a must
0767805712|3.0|This is a chilling look into what could be, our society's future. This movie, has a good story, with some true, sad, deepness.  <br />The story goes, in the future, your life is molded around, your genes and how you were born. The natural born people (\\"In-valids\\") and the genetically modified people (\\"valids\\") are seperated into different classes, and different realms of life.   <br />A young in-valid, Vincent(Ethan Hawke) has a dream to become an astronaut, despite, all the things holding him back, like his DNA for one thing. After, seeing no easy way to achieve his dream, he starts to try a different tactic. He takes the identiy, of a perfect valid, Jerome (Jude Law) that has been crippled in an accident, and now has no real future. Instead, of his perfect genes going to waste, he is used to help Vincent, achieve his goal. The real Jerome supplies the now Jerome with everything he needs to pretend to be him, from blood, to urine. Soon, Vincent now Jerome, works his way up the ranks, in a futuristic, space agency like thing, (Gattaca) and soon is a step away from his dream, when a murder case comes up at Gattaca, and threatens to ruin his whole plan. But, during all this, Vincent, falls in love with an in-valid working at Gattaca, (Uma Thurman)and she soon becomes caught up in his plan.  <br />This is a very interesting, deep, sad, and smart story. It is a very beiliveable sci-fi movie. It shows, how humans did not only become more advanced in technology, but in the way they discrimminate. I found, it a very good movie, but heart-breaking in alot of ways. I only hope, society and science never get this advanced, it's for our own good. The ending is what set my rateing back, becasue I'm to emoitional a person not acknowledge the sad aspect, of the ending. I recomend this to any sci-fi nerd, and people who enjoy a good suspense, and story that really makes you think.

0380778556|5.0|After reading the book, \\"Rebecca\\", I can understand why it is mandatory reading for a high school English class. The writing and language of Daphne DuMaurier is exquisitely rich with such precision to detail, one can easily enter the stage she sets and the worlds she creates.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of a young woman whose name is never mentioned,  unless Mademoiselle, and later Madame and Mrs. DeWinter.  Beginning at the ending, in the first two chapters, the narrative begins again, in Monte Carlo as a hired companion to a boorish matronly social-climber, while befriending a widower on holiday who suddenly asks her hand in marriage before she is required, by duty, to leave Monte Carlo for New York.  The simple-bred and educated young woman henceforth lives within the aristocratic English estate, Manderley, and the shadow of Rebecca, the recently deceased former wife of her new husband where she finds superficial manners and politeness as well as drama and mystery.<br /><br />Here is one example of the part Rebecca plays in the story, from the new Mrs. DeWinter's point of view:  \\"I could fight the living but I could not fight the dead.  If there was some woman in London that Maxim loved, someone he wrote to, visited, dined with, slept with, I could fight with her.  We would stand on common ground.  I should not be afraid.  Anger and jealousy were things that could be conquered.  One day the woman would grow old or tired or different, and Maxim would not love her any more.  But Rebecca would never grow old.  Rebecca would always be the same.  And she and I could not fight.  She was too strong for me.\\"  (But wait until you find out how Rebecca died....)<br /><br />The sequel to this story, written by Susan Hill Long, is called \\"Mrs. DeWinter\\", so I'm assuming the narrator's given name still remains a mystery even there.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is the first NIN record I have purchased. That being said, I'm not in a position to compare it to previous works. All I know is that Reznor is a freind of Tori Amos (someone for whom I hold a great deal of admiration) and that I've heard he's something of a tortured soul from the darker corners of my friendship pool.<br /><br />I bought this record today as one of ten new music CD's I picked up (it being payday and all), and I have not been able to stop listening to it since. The opening cut, \\"All The Love In The World\\" at once evokes both Amos and Moby - it is haunting, stirring, lyrical, and stuck in my brain like an ice pick.<br /><br />Buy this record.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|CLoser is an amazing story, told in a beautiful context. The actors, were supurb, especailly Natlie Portman and Jude Law. This is the kind of movie, where if you turn away for a second, to go to the bathroom, your gonna be lost. You need to pay attention. It's also not a kid's movie, though it does not really show anything, it does say quite alot of mature things. It's a complicated, twisted, sad story, but also very, true to life. I mean when has a realtionship ever really been simple?  <br />The way they portrayed this movie, I loved. The opening sequence, WOW! It toally blew me away. Another great thing, is there's nothing to distract you from the story, in this movie. There's no background music, all there is, is the raw emotion, of the characters. The only music, is at the opening sequence and closing sequence. Same song at both. I think that is a very smart idea.  <br />The story follows, 4 characters. Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Nataile Portman), Anna (Julia Roberts), and Larry (Clive Owen). It shows how connected, and twisted they all become, over the course of time. Really, it's amazing how connected these people, wether they know it or not. It's sickenly twisted, but not enough so you can't help but want to see nore. From, one meeting, between Dan and Anna, it changes all of them, forever. It shows every angle of a relationship, that has been torn apart by infidelity. From the cheater, to the cheated-on, and then how they can switch rolls, without a thought of how it made them feel. In the end no one, is really left happy.  <br />It has some excellent acting. And it really makes you think about your own relationships, and what they will become/are, and what is love really? <br />I highly recomend it to anyone, who enjoys a good thoughtful drama, with some twisted situations, and raw human emotion.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Six years since the massively creative and subconscious mind blowing release of The Fragile, Trent Reznor has released his latest...With Teeth. I cant seem to figure out what he's been working on for six years, because I doubt it was this album. <br />  <br />Before one gets the impression that this album is garbage, I need to say that there are some good songs on here, I really enjoyed them. Compared to the time and effort apparent in The Fragile though, I feel like Trent might have been too busy with gardening or something to really commit to this CD.  <br />The sound is much more simplified and natural than his previous releases, without the artistry and innovation that distinguished The Fragile and The Downward Spiral from similar music.  <br />The lyrics seem to be lacking the cohesiveness and genuine self examination of his other works. It seems like Trent is having difficulty getting lost in himself anymore, which would be alright if he could bring about his current emotions as masterfully as he did his anger and hopelessness, but its sounds more like hes trying to get in touch with a part of himself he doesnt relate to anymore. <br />I have to commend him on his vocal style though, it is still Reznor and its refreshing to hear his voice again. <br /> <br /> I would have enjoyed more studio work and synth effects on this album, to compliment Twiggy's recognizable bass, and to balance Grohls all too natural drumming. The depth lost by tossing most of the electronics for this album has created a sound that makes me a little uncomfortable and at times embarrased for Trent, because he seems a little naked.  <br /> <br />Yes, the White Stripes are doing well without any electronics, and Reznor seems to give a nod to that 80's rock sound with this album, but it seems like he's expiramenting with clothes that just dont fit him. I hope this isnt the end for NIN, but Im not going to hold my breath for another six years to find out.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|This is my favorite movie! I love it! Great animation, really funny, really sweet, another thing is my whole family can watch it. Anyone who doesn't like this movie is nuts! It's hilarious and really sweet. The first time I saw it in theaters I was like I'm am sooo gonna buy this movie! Dory is so funny! Buy this movie.

B000002TQV|5.0|What a brilliant album, and even if it wasn't the most original music it's still mindblowing to listen to.  There is just so much soul and life throughout the whole album.  It would be hard for me to pick which Radiohead album is my fav, but The Bends is definitely up there along with Ok Computer. <br /> <br />This is a great album as an introduction to Radiohead, they're such an eclectic band.  It's always nice to hear real music in this world of MOR (middle of road) garbage.
B0006L16N8|2.0|. . . that this cheesy, boring, Vegas-lounge effort is given so many superlatives by so many people.  I can't find a single song on this album that isn't ruined by embarrassing writing or bland production. This is their \\"greatest album yet\\"?  The crisp sound and sharp lyrics are gone and have been replaced with a rock opera by The Carpenters.  Coldplay was always a bit overhyped to begin with, but this effort is, as one reviewer put it, \\"music for shopping malls and armpit commercials.\\"  To say this cd is disappointing doesn't really come close.  It's a collection of numb, lifeless, whiny songs that are posing as angst-art but only manage to bore you to death.  There are a hundred bands that can top this in their sleep.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I became a fan of Coldplay back when Parachutes was released, and I have to admit that it took me a while to get into it, but once I did I was amazed at how beautiful it was.  AROBTTH came out and though I only liked a couple songs on it, it was definitely so much better than this mainstream garbage.   <br /> <br />X&Y is seriously one of the most dull and bland albums I have ever heard. And what shocks me is to see how many people are buying the hype..  X&Y is far from being a masterpiece, it might as well be elevator music.   <br /> <br />Where is the Coldplay of old? I forgave them for AROBTTH, but I don't think we will ever get another good album from them. I miss Parachutes, but I guess that's the way it goes when a band is too taken by being the biggest band rather than writing good songs. What a shame.
0800179501|5.0|I am not being biased in saying that this is the greatest film to come out of the 80's just because I played a minor role in the film as a Cobra Kai stand in.  This is a movie about honor, pride, Elisabeth Shue, a city called Recita, and of course Cobra Kai Karate which is real.  Many people don't know this but during the shooting of the film, many of us Cobra Kai stand-ins played our part so well that it became reality to us and after Martin Kove's (Sensai John Kreese) career was over, he summoned us at the old dojo where we were given special training and now reside throughout the nation as the Cobra Kai network.  Back to the film...Daniel Larusso (Ralph Machio) plays the part of a  smart a-- cake eater who steals Johnny \\"Sweep the Leg\\" Lawrence's broad Elisabeth Shue) and then expects to get away with it without a beating.  That's when the real heroes come into play representing the Cobra Kai dojo (which is real).  At Cobra Kai, we live by a few rules, I'll share one of them...\\"We do not train to be merciful here, mercy is for the weak. A man confronts you in the street he is your enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy.\\"  After all, \\"pain does not exist in this dojo.\\"  Unfortunately there was a major script blunder which leads to an unhappy ending but this movie is still a hit and I strongly suggest that you view it in order to get a small taste of what a privelage and honor it is to be a member of the Cobra Kai Dojo.  \\"Strike first, strike hard, No Mercy Sir!\\"  Heil Sensai Kreese!  Cobra Kai never Dies!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|It took me a while, but finally I get this album.. I must say that at first I was a bit disappointed, sure I loved the album because it was a new Radiohead release, but I couldn't get into it as much as previous releases, I put it down for a while and just came back to it now. And now I finally see the brilliance of this album.  Every song is full of so much raw emotion and pure sonic brilliance.   <br /> <br />I am not sure how a non Radiohead fan would accept this album, but if you're into Radiohead I can safely guess you'd enjoy this album
B00003CXA2|1.0|Don't be fooled by the amount of money that this movie made in the box office, it is a major dud.  Not only is it offensive to cripples and the handicapped but it just isn't enterntaining!  This movie distorts the history of our nation by placing a half witted dunce in some of our countries finest moments.  Tom Hanks plays the role of a not so smart man pretty convincingly which makes you wonder.  The one bright side to this boring film is the acting of Steven Griffith who plays the role of \\"Tex.\\"  I think this film would have been more serious and convincing had Jim Carey played the role of Gump using his Dumb and Dumber character Lloyd Christmas.  I do recommend the adult remake of this film \\"Forrest Hump.\\"  1 word \\"blahhhh!\\"
B000002UJQ|5.0|What's there to say? This album isn't one of the top 5 best albums of all time for no reason..  Radiohead are brilliant and OK computer will always be one of my favourite albums.
0061020710|4.0|I am so glad that I finally picked up Pratchett and started to read this long series. I don't know why I never felt an urge to read Pratchett before. If you read a lot you might hit a point where you are bemoaning the fact that you have read all of the good authors out there. And then you will pick up a book and unexpectedly set forth on a whole new landscape. Now when I look back at moments where I was finding difficulty in discovering new authors to plunder, I only wish that someone had pointed me in Pratchett's direction.<br /><br />This series is very much like the much more widely read `Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy'... only better. I was laughing out loud time and again as I flipped through these pages. And in the boundaries of this genre (humorous fantasy), I can't think of an author being able to top what lies before you if you have yet to read these books.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this book five stars lies in the fact that I don't think that `The Color of Magic' manages to pass muster against other authors whom leave more of a wake in their passage. George RR Martin is an author who has just completed the fourth in a series of fantasy novels that will just blow your mind away. They are not humorous. The heft of Martin's series emotionally and plot wise makes a small book like `Color of Magic' pale slightly in comparison. But that aside, this is a book that I would heartily recommend. Enjoy.
B0006399FS|2.0|After the disappointment of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" I was hoping U2 might get it  back together and release a better album.  But HTDAAB is even worse...   <br /> <br />I just can't believe that the band that released such masterpieces as \\"the Joshua Tree\\", \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\" released this.. How very disappointing <br /> <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is probably the only half decent song on the album and that's pushing it.. I guess it would be an average album if it wasn't U2.. But in U2 standards it's very lacking. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is U2.
B0000399WC|1.0|after wasting 3 or so hours watching this film i feel as if it is the single dumbest film ever made, Now don't get me wrong the acting of Steve McQueen and Mr. Dustin Hoffman were simply amazing but just the story of the show was so boring and i do understand it is a true story but leave it at that, god bless butterfly boy and good for him for making it to freedom but no need to make such a boring story into a movie or even a book.
B0007P3582|3.0|I thought the cd was alright, like other people said it seems like he talkin more about killin ya with his 50 different weapons, but dat shiet was funny
B0002S947K|5.0|Right from the opening song and title cut, Trouble, you immediately know that this is a special CD. That this CD is so different that you can't wait to hear what's next. Forget the fact that the lyrics are amazing all by themselves, his vocals and exquisite production make this a standout first effort that oozes with class and originality. Whatever magic that Nora Jones has, Ray LaMontagne also possesses. That magic sets him and his music apart from anything played on the airwaves, and anything on CD anywhere. Ray's biggest problem will be to one day follow up with a second CD, but for now, just enjoy this great new artist!

B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD is absoluteley awesome. It really does the concert justice. Now i didnt see this in Melbourne but i saw them when the came to Nashville and it reminds me how great they were.  This concert was done almost as much for them as it was for the fans. You can tell in there performances that they were having fun. The addition of solo songs were a good choice.Like don henley said some of them could have been eagles songs anyway. The highlight i think was joe walsh's song life's been good. Its so cool how he never says the same thing twice when preforming. He sang it different in Nashville and on live albums. This whole tour could be dubbed the Joe Walsh show because he was so great,but everyone else did great too. Don Henley still amazes me how he can play drums and sing at the same time(I'm a drummer) and its harder than he makes it look. Even if you are a casual fan of the Eagles, have one or two albums, or you just like Hotel California, then you should deffinately pick this dvd. This is about the best concert you will ever see. With the way music is going these days you should hold on the the classics because this new music just doesn't have the same feeling. Well I'll stop my rambling just buy the dang thing!!!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This was probably one of the coolest most messed up movies I have EVER seen! <br />It starts out with two guys left chained up in what looks like an old bathroom. There's a man with a gun and a tape recorder in the middle of the room, who appeared to be shot in the head. <br />In order for the kidnapper to let them go, one of them has to kill the other one, and if he wants to live, he has to survive from trying to be killed. <br />I don't want to give the rest away because you HAVE to see this movie. <br />It's DEFINITELY not one for the weak of heart, and it is REALLY disturbing (one of the most I've ever seen and I've live for horror!) <br />If you like sick gory movies, this is a winner!
B0000027F8|5.0|I believe this to be his most honest and vulnerable album. George Michael is a legend.
0066214122|3.0|From Dr. Frankenstein to Dr. Strangelove, the idea that any advanced technology will turn on its inventor/user, to the determent of civilization, has frightened and thrilled us as readers! Michael Crichton has been able to scare us to death with his action packed visions of a future where bacteria, viruses and DNA cloning turn against the human race. Having read almost all of his books, The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic stand out as master pieces of technology run amok. Unfortunately Prey doesn't! <br />It isn't that the premise lacks timeliness - nano-manufacturing is becoming a very realistic process. It may just be that I know very little about diseases and the cloning of DNA and a lot about micro-machines. Working in the area of software agents that \\"swarm\\" within computer networks and learn through group experience, we humans can make the \\"software\\" only so smart. Building micro, self powered, flying devices that can monitor air quality or send video feeds back to remote \\"observers\\" - not controllers - are moving out of laboratories and into field testing today. But, we are far, far away from the premise of Prey. <br />Crichton has moved from industrial fantasy to science fiction in Prey. Yes it is exciting - it is a good airplane read. But, it is not at the level of many of his other books. I await his next.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Ever since people have been going to the movies there has been one constant in the realm of cartoon movies, Disney Studios.  Disney has created unforgettable classics; such as, \\"The Lion King\\", \\"Aladdin\\", \\"Snow White\\", \\"Bambi\\", and the list could go on and on.  During the mid-nineties, the \\"House of Mouse\\" as Disney Studios is often referred to as, changed animation styles and began delivering audiences clunkier drawn characters that didn't seem to have the distinct visual style and grace that made their films instant classics with children and adults alike.  However, there were some gems amongst the average animation being created, and one of these gems that would soon join all of the other Disney classics was, \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is about a young, self-involved emperor named Kuzco (perfectly cast David Spade), who cares little for other people and only desires to make himself happy.  Under his employ is the incredibly old and insanely evil, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her unwitting sidekick Kronk (the hilarious Patrick Warburton).  Yzma desires to rule the kingdom but her dreams are thwarted when Kuzco catches her trying to settle disputes by using his power and has her fired.  This doesn't set well at all with Yzma, who along with Kronk, devises a plan to kill the emperor.  In Kronk's defense, he really has no clue what's going on, and is really a good man at heart.  However, Yzma's plan quickly goes awry when Kronk accidentally chooses the wrong potion and instead of killing Kuzco, it turns him into a llama.  In the middle of all of this insanity is Pacha (John Goodman), a simple villager who was summoned by Kuzco only to learn that the young emperor is going to destroy his village in order to create Kuzcotopia.  Of course, since the emperor is in the form of a llama, and has mistakenly been taken back to Pacha's village it's up to Pacha to convince Kuzco to change his mind and open his heart, while evading Yzma's evilclutches. <br /> <br />This hilarious cartoon, probably one of the funniest Disney has made in years, has plenty of jokes and sight gags to keep both young and old rolling with laughter for the entire duration of the film and even long after the movie is over.  With a convoluted plot that is intended to be pure fun, even poking fun at it's own absurdity, \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is the perfect film for people of all ages. <br /> <br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is rated G.
B000805796|3.0|Not an outstanding piece of work but not a bad one either.  Fans of her previous two albums will like this one too.
B0007GAERG|5.0|First off, I loved the review by Sheila Teague, the self-appointed \\"authority of everything\\" from Chesapeake VA. It was quite insightful and funny..Way to go Sheila.      This album, the emanicapitation of Mimi, came out in April, but I wasnt totally sold on it until I heard the whole thing on the website of entertainment reporter Kevin Scott while working nights on my job...after hearing the cd, I wondered what that hell I was waiting on.      Mariah is on fire. Its seems as if she has finally found her niche. First she was labled an adult contemporary singer, then a pop singer, now Mariah has made the full transistion to R&B singer. Welcome to the club girlfriend!    With guest appearances from Jermaine Dupree(JD), Snoop, Twista and Nelly, this album has a range of club hits and slow ballads, with a little bit of something for everyone. She still has those high ocatane vocals that would make Whitney Houston, Rachelle Farrell and even opera singer Denece Graves green with envy.    the lead single, the JD produced hit Its Like that, has been bumping in the clubs and on radio since January of this year..with background vocals from hitmaker Fat Man Scoop, this single got plenty of play on radio stations around the country.    The second single, We Belong Together, ended up being Mariah's 16th number one single, the most ever by a female artist and only one number one hit away from tying Elvis Presley for the most ever by a solo artist. We Belong together, who I think was \\"dedicated\\" to Derek Jeter on the cool, was Mariah's call for that special man to come back...this song has been a hit on radio stations everywhere.    My personal favorites on the album are Mine Again, Circles, Your Girl and I wish you knew. They are all slow ballads and show Mariah doing what she does best, pouring her heart out. I play I wish you knew over and over..I absolutely love that jam!!!    Fly like a bird, which takes a gospel approach, is an outstanding song as well.     Mariah keeps these songs short and to the point, as the whole entire cd is only 50 minutes long, but she put in a bunch of work, believe that.      The beats to some of the songs are outstanding and overall, I think this is her best album in years, possibly since her debut album, or at least since the Daydream album in 1995...
0767803434|5.0|I was completely glued to my seat from beginning to end: this film was nonstop action, suspense and drama. While admittedly *today* in real life there would be intense security to prevent this from happening, it seems a highly plausible plot for a film, especially in 1997 when it was made. The world sat in disbelief when it was announced at a TV  press conference that Kazakhstan terrorists hold the U.S. President James Marshall, delegates, and various family members as hostages up on Air Force One not long after boarding the plane in Russsia. Communications between Glenn Close, the U.S. Vice President, a prisoner on Air Force One and the U.S. Press Secretary in Washington confirmed their status ...<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays the U.S. President with fearlessness and cunning. He also demonstrates superb hand-to-hand fighting skills plus superior technical expertise with a gun. He becomes the hero who manages to elude the terrorists when he remains one level below, as they overtake the pilot and copilot. He creates diversions and thwarts their various plans, all the while evading detection. Initially, they are unaware whom they are fighting. Once Ivan Korshunov, the leader, realizes it is the President of the United States who nearly single-handedly prevents them from achieving their goals, the terrorist becomes more vicious. He threatens the wife of the President at gun point and turns on the loudspeaker so the President can listen as she voices her fears. This enrages the President who takes even more serious measures to save their lives: he dumps fuel to force them to stop. The fighting scenes are unparalleled yet eventually Harrison Ford is captured. The capture of the President forces the United States to negotiate with the terrorists, despite their policy against doing so. The terrorists want the release of General Alexander Radek, the former ruler of Kazakhstan ...<br /><br />The rescue of the President, delegates and their families is breath-taking. Fortunately, some manage to jump with parachutes but there are not enough and time is running out ... Air Force One does not have the ability to land. There is a daring awe-inspiring rescue up in the air at 15,000 feet. General Alexander Radek is released from his prison cell, dressed in his well-decorated uniform as he walks across the prison courtyard ... and in the end, justice prevails. Viewing this film sends chills up and down one's spine because despite the many aspects of the film that are exaggerated - terrorism is one area that *thankfully* is *not* depicted in its true scope given what we know of the events of 9-1-1 and current Iraqi War.

B000002NFM|5.0|This album is very original and energetic. I already bought it a couple of years ago, but I messed up that CD and I am buying it again. I can't imagine any techno-lover not having this album in their collection.
B000002KKD|4.0|There are 3 classic songs on this album:  \\"Planet Claire,\\" \\"Rock Lobster,\\" and the Limburger Song--er, \\"Dance This Mess Around.\\"  That's 3 more than most albums from people who are still learning to play their instruments. It sounds less revolutionary now than it did up in Athens in 1979, but it's still a lot of fun. The girl singers are so good, I wish Fred would just stick to dancing instead of \\"singing.\\"  The B's would go on more sophisticated musical projects, but nothing they ever did was this fresh.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|This isn't hardcore at all, it's trendy crap that you would find at Hot Topic. For real hardcore, I recommend Glassjaw, Boysetsfire or better yet pick up some hardcore from the 80's like 7seconds and Circle Jerks. While I don't like those last two bands, they are hardcore, unlike these losers.
B000002OX7|5.0|35 years on, I finally figured out what that strange concrete obelisk thingy on the cover is.  It's a beacon, a Lighthouse if you like, at the top of a hill, and on one side of it stands all the great promise of rock 'n' roll of the 60's, and on the other begins the downhill slide toward tedium and drivel that gave rise to punk. 1971: the year of Exile on Main Street, Fragile, Aqualung, and a dozen other classics - and this one stands head and shoulders above them all, looking out at the coming storm.
0385510454|3.0|John Grisham haven't been writing too many good books lately. This one has its ups and downs. Overall story leaves a lot to be desired but I enjoyed reading about italian culture and food and how main character had to emerse himself in it.
B00006IU73|4.0|Hey Lord Chimp, as a reviewer you are one cool dude. I read your review and it made me go back and listen to this. I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 4. This is an album I've always admired a hell of a lot--just didn't really enjoy listening to it all that much. It's like Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Radiohead wrapped into one.  It's not as \\"neoprog\\" as Spock's Beard or The Flower Kings --too much influence from the 90's.  And the tunes don't exactly grab you, but they do sneak up.  It's loud, meaty, sometimes harsh, occasionally lyrical - a beautiful piece of work.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is an excellent collection of the later Beatle's hits and is a good choice for those who do not want to (or cannot)have the original alblums. It's well done and conveniently put together.
B0000027RL|5.0|I'm not one of those people who likes to compare Pearl Jam with Nirvana.  People love them both.  That's great. But I just don't resonate with Nirvana the way I do with early Pearl Jam. Eddie Vedder is be the best singer-songwriter to come out of Seattle. Just don't call him that to his face. <br /> <br />What's with the title, anyway?
B000002UYZ|5.0|A nice cross selection of Beatles favorites. If you do not have and do not want to get or cannot get all of the early Beatle's alblums this is an excellent way to hear their most popular (best?) early hits.

B000005IU2|5.0|Take it from me, as a lover of music and one who is just dicovering this gem of an album: jump in; let this album explode in your head.  Possessed rage riding blues riffs blindly, believing in the power of their noise, letting it become them, something with which to shout.  Flash foward thirty years and hear Rage Against the Machine lift their riffs and load it with another line of manic aggression. The primitiveness of the Stooges instictually reminds us of what we love so much about rock & roll and wonder of its birth.  Iggy Pop and the Stooges are that (...) beginning, overlooked and shunned,
B00008DDSC|1.0|This film isn't very good. James Spader plays a very strange attorney who like to \\"play\\" with the secretaries he contracts to BDSM games. And Maggie Gyllenhaal has enough talent to be a good and not a mediocre actress, like many of the ones we have now, even seeing her naked doesn't makes you feel something. And I found some mistakes in the movie, like see mountains in Florida, when you can clearly see it's California. Bad dialogues and too slow.
B000001Y5J|5.0|I'm sure you've heard the story behind this album, but I'll tell it again anyway. Pretty Hate Machine became a surprise hit. While it never broke into the top fourty it stayed in the top 100 for over a year, which is quite a feat. TVT felt that if they had more control over the music Trent recorded, than they could have an even bigger hit. Obviously Trent was not happy with this. This album was recorded secretly and is basically his \\"f**k you\\" to TVT. This is easily his angriest album, but if you can look past the angst you'll find a great mini-album.    This is not only his angriest album, but also the only one that would really fall into a Metal category. You can tell that Trent had been listening to a lot of Ministry around this time, because it sounds pretty much like their heavier albums with better singing. That's not to say that it's a total rip-off, though. These songs are a lot catchier than Ministry was in their industrial-metal prime, and have a more melodic feel to them. There are also no political messages or samples, which were, and still are, a big part of Ministry.    The album opens with Pinion, a short instrumental that repeats the same 6 chords over and over. It begins almost silent with something that sounds like the wind in the background, but as the song goes on it gets louder and louder until it finally becomes undistorted. 3/5    Immediately after the last few chords of Pinion, Wish begins with a very memorable drum beat. This is probably the most well known song on the album. It has an interesting music video, and it won a Grammy for best Heavy Metal song of 1993. It's easy to see why. It follows Trent's signature loud-soft-loud plan, and it's as good as any of his heavier songs. 5/5    Next is my personal favorite song on the album, Last. A lot of people find the lyrics to be cheesy, and I will say that he goes a bit over the top here. But the music is incredible. It's very rare that a song can be both this catchy and still retain all of its heaviness, but this songs suceeds. It also contains probably the best solos I've heard in an NIN song to date. 5/5    After Last is Help Me I Am In Hell, which is a short, soft instrumental break before the chaos of the next track. It's almost acoustic, and it keeps the album from becoming monotous. 4/5    The album's fifth track is the very noisy Hapiness in Slavery, the other single from the album. The video for this song featured performance artist Bob Flanigan being tortured to death. Of course this wasn't real, but the video was quickly banned from MTV after one airing, which usually gets more publicity for a song than being in rotation anyway. This is probably the only thing to hint at the Downward Spiral, but it still doesn't feel out of place. 5/5    The actual album finishes with Gave Up. Like Wish, it opens with a memorable drum beat, and is probably the most straightforward rock track on the album. However, it's also one of those songs that sounds a lot better live than in the studio. The version found on And All That Could've Been is much better. This version is still nice, though. 5/5    Depending on your copy of the album, the next track will be Physical, the album is over, or there are many tracks of silence following Gave Up. You should still have the last two tracks in some form, though.    The first of the two bonus tracks is Physical, which is a good cover of Adam Ant. If you listen closely you will hear Trent's dog barking in the background, and Trent will say \\"Eat your heart out Stevie\\", referring to his situation with TVT. This is a great track quite unlike anything Trent has done. It's also probably his raunchiest one, even more so than Closer. 5/5    The second of the two tracks is Suck, which has seen many versions, including various demos. While Trent was involved with the first released version by Pigface, this one is a lot different. That version was just Trent's vocals, Drums, and Bass, but Trent has fleshed it out with guitars on thechorus and a catchier bass line. He also added a bridge to the song. The opinion seems fairly unanimous that this version is better. Even Pigface plays it Trent's way. This also seems to be one of Trent's favorite songs to play live. The version on And All That Could Have Been is a bit heavier, but I think they're equally good. 5/5    If you're more into metal than alternative rock, than this is the NIN album for you. Even if you're not really a metal fan, you should still check it out, because it's a lot more interesting than some metal, and obviously it's more than just straightforward metal. It's the best EP Trent ever released and it's a very important chapter in the history of Nine Inch Nails. If you had any previous interest in NIN and don't own this, then you shouldn't hesitate. You won't be let down.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes is one of the better greatest hits collections for any band out there. All the tracks on the album are truly definitive, showcasing the band's innovative and unique style throughout their existence. However, although the greatest hits are very complete, and good for a new fan of Pink Floyd, the band's strengths lie in the album approach. An album by Pink Floyd wasn't just 5 or 10 songs, it was a unit. Sure, you particularly enjoyed the individual songs on the album, but you got the music and understood it when the album was played as a whole. For example, this package includes Sheep from the Animals album. It's a good song, but we realize the true meaning of it when we listen to it with Pigs, Dogs, and Pigs on the Wing. But, if you want to get acquainted with the band, get this set. Afterwards, though, buy their albums, and understand the true meanings of the songs as part of the epic albums of the band.
B000002H33|5.0|I can't believe what you guys are saying about Metallica. \\"Metallica were goths in the '80s\\", \\"Metallica became better players on the Black album\\", \\"Nothing compared to St. Anger\\". Those are some of the stupidist things I've heard. And worst of all, the person who praised the Black album, also said the first five Metallica albums are crap, when that album was in fact the fifth album by the band. I think that shows just how ignorant these guys are. I'd also like to see what you guys think of progressive rock if 8 minutes is way too long. You people must not have a very long attention span.    Anyway, despite what those idiots down there think, I think this is easily Metallica's best album. Every song on here is memorable, and they all have a great message behind them, except for Orion which is an instrumental. There isn't a ton of variety on this album. It's all pretty much the loud thrash that came to define Metallica's style in the '80s, but that's certainly not a bad thing when the songs are this well written. Each song is fairly complex, yet simple enough to follow, and few Metallica songs, if any, require more technical skill than these. There is also a lot of variety in the lyrics. Hetfield deals with a variety of real issues on this album and each song is well thought out. Oh and I'd like to take a moment to compliment the album's art, which is some of the best I've seen.    The album opens with the classic acoustic intro to Battery. Then it gets heavier, but still very majestic, and then all hell breaks loose. The thrashiest track on the album. The lyrics are about a totalitarian government, perhaps the Nazis, that destroys and converts anything in their path. Metallica didn't have singles in those days, but I've heard this song get some radio play. 5/5    Next is the even more classic title track. This is probably the best track on the album, and also the longest one. It's mostly thrash, but there's also a great soft, melodic break in the middle. The lyricsare about a person being controlled by a drug, and for most of the song it is from the point of view of the drug. This has recieved a lot of radio play, and I'd say that is very justified. 5/5    The Thing that Should Not Be is another classic song by the band, but then again all of these tracks are classics. This is another one with a soft intro, but once again it's one of the album's heaviest tracks. It also features one of the best solos on the album. The lyrics are based off of a literature of the same name, and it's about a metaphorical monster of some sort. 5/5    Next is Welcome Home(Sanitarium), which is a mostly soft song, other than chorus and a bridge, which are much heavier. It also features more great solos. The lyrics are about a person who has been labeled insane and is afraid to leave their asylum but longs to anyway. 5/5    After that is Disposable Heroes. Appropriately, it begins very militant sounding, but eventually becomes thrasy, another one of the album's heaviest tracks. The lyrics are about a man who is sent to be in a corrupt war, where the soldiers are considered to be expendable. 5/5    Leper Messiah is the album's 6th track. Musically it's more of what you've heard on the album only a little slower, but that's certainly not a bad thing. Lyrically, it's about the corruption of religion in the past, specifically the Catholic Church. 5/5    Orion is the album's epic instrumental track. This is eight minutes of some of the most melodic metal I've ever heard. Probably my favorite track on the album. It's just surreal. You have to hear it for yourself to understand what I mean. 5/5    The album closes on a somewhat weaker note in Damage, Inc. It's easily my least favorite song on the album, and it's the most straightforward song on the album. Though, the intro is nice. The lyrics are also a little worse than the rest. Hetfield finally resorts to swearing to get his point across, and it talks vaguely about the conformity of society, which I guess is Damage, Inc. Still an incredible track despite being the weakest. 5/5    After this album Metallica released ...And Justice For All, which was good, but too complex for it's own good. After that they decided to go in the opposite direction on the self-titled, \\"Black Album\\", and it paid off for them, and it was still a good album. I think the lyrics lacked the intelligence of this album and Justice, and the music was much less complex, but it was still a good album. After that, though, things weren't even remotely Metallica-like. Load and Reload left behind anything remotely complex, and unfortunately marked the end of anything worthwhile coming from the band.    If you're only going to get just one Metallica album than this is definitely the one to get. Every song is great, and the lyrics should make you think.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is the best album I've ever heard in my life, and in my humble opinion, the best live album ever. The concept is so original, and even though it doesn't look good on paper -combining metal and hard rock with a symphony orchestra - it sounds amazing. Michael Kamen's [R.I.P.]arrangements for the symphony are spectacular. The way the symphony marries up with the band is absolutely phenomenal. I could listen to this album over and over every day for the rest of my life and not get bored. For the love of all that is holy, if you don't own this album, buy it right NOW! You'll thank me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|5 stars, go buy this cd...if you haven't already, its good you'll like it, there amazing, don't listen to anyone who said it sucks... b/c you cant say that about a band who has put out other masterpieces...
B000003TAR|5.0|This is by far the best Nirvana album. I love how stripped down the production is; some will say that it's a little sloppy, but to me, it wouldn't be the same if it was a polished production. Kurt Cobain's vocals on this album are affecting and effective, especially on \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" [my favorite Nirvana song] and \\"All Apologies\\". Add that to the stellar songwriting and Dave Grohl's amazing skills behind the kit, and the result is a great rock album that stands the test of time years after its release. A must have.
B000005IU2|5.0|The Stooges' second album is a brutal masterpiece. It is something that is neither pretty nor wholesome, and it succeeds almost entirely on the powerful chemistry at work on this album. Iggy screams, shouts, yelps, and grunts over a barrage of simplistic music with simplistic lyrics and, at times, no music at all (\\"L.A. Blues\\"). \\"Dirt\\" is my particular favorite, though, a slow, menacing song that manages to sound like nothing else on the album and still become its centerpiece. Other great tunes present here are \\"Down on the Street,\\" the excellent opener, \\"1970,\\" a perfect proto-punk anthem, and the title track, simply one of the finest, rawest, most visceral songs ever recorded. This album was one of the building blocks of the first wave of punk rock, inspiring people in the same way that the MC5 and the New York Dolls did. I love this album, and believe me, everyone should give it a listen. From the moment the electrifying \\"Down on the Street\\" begins all the way until the completely free-form jam \\"L.A. Blues\\" closes, Fun House grips the listener and allows no room for escape. And honestly, who would want to?    In conclusion, I will say this: everyone hates you, Howard Tuttleman. While this may gain me some unhelpful votes, your senseless review is matched only by your undoubtedly terrible taste in music. And to think, you really believe you have fans! Dare I ask what you like to listen to? Oh, and by the way, was it that hard to turn over the record? I mean, you turn it over, you set the needle down, and you listen. It takes all of ten seconds to do.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is flawless, and hands down the best jazz album ever made. I don't think anything else needs to be said about it. Important tip: Do not trust anyone to claims to love jazz and does not own this album. They do not love jazz if those words come out of their mouth. This album is perfect in every sense of the word.
B0000057C5|5.0|I've had this album since Du Hast was released on the radio, and it is awesome, perfect when I'm in a thumpin' kind of mood. I'm not your typical hard music fan (professional, married, stepmom of 3!), but I've nearly blown the speakers at home and in my car on this one a few times. Just wicked!!
0375703764|4.0|Other authors use similar post-modern techniques; others mess with your mind and your definition of reality.  The strength of House of Leaves is that is does so in a funky, accessible manner.  True, the official story, that of a documentary on a house with (literally) a life of its own is more enjoyable if one recognizes its pseudo-academic nature.  True, the narrator's story in the footnotes is more enjoyable in the context of the beat and funk \\"biographies\\" that proceed it.  But anyone with an interest in horror-suspense or in experimental literature, can enjoy this literary romp in horror.  It is an imperfect but excellent introduction that can lead the reader into some of the masters (Edmund Jabes, Peter Esterhazy ...).
B00004U28G|3.0|It says 16x9 format on the dvd package and it is in its theatrical widescreen format. Widescreen lovers enjoy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Zeppelin when I was 15 years old; 1979.  Unfortunately, within the next year, Bonzo died in a tragic accident.  I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard the news...  Around that same time (before Bonzo passed) I saw \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", which remained burned in my mind (for decades) as the quintessential and definitive Zeppelin movie.  I was wrong; this DVD shows a much more realistic portrayal of the band.  With this DVD, Jimmy reestablishes himself as my favorite guitarist of all-time, considering the timeframe he worked in and the technology that was available at the time, this is quite a feat!  This DVD is a MUST-HAVE for any Zeppelin fan - don't even THINK about going without!
B00004W52U|5.0|When the right people come together at the right time in any context, wonderful things can be achieved. Operation Ivy's first and last album, Energy is an example of this. Jesse Michaels, Matt McCall, Lint and Dave Mello's only album as a band is one of the purest, most passionate(this will come up throughout this review) displays of youthful anger, rebellion and energy(so will this) I have ever heard. Sorry for the long song by song review, but I felt like doing it. Skip to the last paragraph if you want.  <br /> <br />Knowledge: The perfect album opener: It's short, sweet and ferocious. Jesse Michaels proudly exclaims \\"All I Know is that I Don't Know nothing\\" in this invigorating display of youthful exuberance and angst. No wonder it's one of the most covered punk rock songs of all time. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Sound System: This song is crazy. With a memorable(though IMO kinda annoying) chorus and fluid, great verses. The band just oozes a ska vibe here. Bouncy, catchy and uplifting. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Jaded: Jaded is a raging punk rocker with positive, intelligent lyrics. The chorus is catchy like a virus and the verses are pretty melodic. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Take Warning: Op Ivy back off from the punk rock for a moment to bring Take Warning, a mid tempo reggaeish ska track. A catchy anthem against violence and intimidation in the punk scene. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Crowd: The Crowd is an attack on conformity and herd mentality. It's musically/structurally in the vein of Jaded. But it's even catchier, more energetic and better. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bombshell: Short, fast and furious. Quite a bombshell of a track. Not the best track, but it packs quite a wallop.    <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />Unity: Op Ivy's famous call for peace and understanding between punks. Falls somewhere in between Take Warning and the next track Vulnerability. Another song that's catchy as hell with a great message to boot. The unified band chant at the end of song is a highlight. 10/10 <br /> <br/>Vulnerability: IMO, this is criminally underrated. You can hear the passion dripping from Jesse Michaels every word. A warning against the indifference that is so prevalent in our society. The rapid rhythmic changes at the end of the song are great. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bankshot: Great Ska instrumental! If you ever wanted to know what ska music is about, check this out. 9/10 <br /> <br />One of These Days: Cool rendition of a traditiona song. Better than Nancy Sinatra's version for sure.  <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />Gonna Find You: Gonna Find You is another rip roaring punk rocker dealing with authority in general but particularly in education. 9/10 <br /> <br />Bad Town: Bad Town is another song about the punk scene with some cool horn lines. The best part of the song is near the end when the horns and guitars play a series of great lines. Interesting, but not one of the best. Plus, Jesse Michaels seldom fails to sing the chorus out of tune. But it's all good. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Smiling: Another good but not amazing song. The pounding snare really sets the tone for the song and the chorus. ______does a good job here. 8/10 <br /> <br />Caution: Back to the really good stuff. This is another punk rocker with a memorable chorus. Invigorating and energetic. C-A-U-T-I-O-N 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Freeze Up: A political punk rocker with good lyrics and another great chorus. The hip hopish part here is really cool as well. Great bass work from Matt McCall. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Artificial Life: An angry semi skaish rant against the shallow commericialism of our society. Another really good song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Room Without a Window: Room Without a Window is a political rocker that stretches Op Ivy's vocab a bit. It also forgoes typical song structure. The chorus isn't great but it's no big deal. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Big City: More punk rock with intelligent lyrics, Lint's clean to fuzzed out guitar tone and a catchy chorus. The lyrics are of particular note. Some cool extendedmetaphors. 9/10 <br /> <br />Missionary: The only real anti religion song here. More pure punk anger. The lyrics are passionate and articulate their point well. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Junkie's Running Dry: This song is an all out punk rock indictment of those who forgoe their beliefs to join the rat race. Uncompromising, raw and awesome. 9/10 <br /> <br />Here We Go Again: This isn't one of the best songs here, but I listen to it quite a bit. It has one of the best(and fun to play) basslines on the album. I've failed to give Matt McCall his due thus far, but he is one of the best punk bassists I've heard. He consistently churns out throbbing basslines on every track here. For his best work, I would have to point to Maxwell Murder by Rancid. 9/10 <br /> <br />Hoboken: Not a standout, but its more of punk rock ferocity that makes this album great. 8/10 <br /> <br />Yellin In My Ear: Yellin In My Ear is one catchy ska anthem. Who can't help singing/shouting along to the chorus once in a while. The production isn't the best(some of the shout outs are obscured) here but it can be forgiven. 9/10 <br /> <br />Sleep Long, Sleep Well: Another great chorus and lyrics about our society make this one more great song on this album. Jesse Michaels are particularly passionate on the verses here. 9/10 <br /> <br />Healthy Body, Sick Mind: An interesting attack on our health and competition crazy society that Op Ivy feel is so fundamentally flawed. Cool song and lyrical theme. 8.75/10 <br /> <br />Officer: More rebellious punk rock dealing with the perceived abuse of power by police officers. Not a really good song, but again, there is no real crap here. 8/10 <br /> <br />I Got No: Op Ivy made sure this album ended on a high note. Energy ends the same way it started, a concise, yet exciting punk rock song. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Many band have tried to emulate the verve, intensity and creativity of Operation Ivy, but none have come close. If you are asking yourself whether to buy Energy,I would heed the advice of Operation Ivy and Pick it Up, Pick it Up!.
B0002OERI0|5.0|As a gay man i have to admit i'm not a big fan of green day. But this time they have done a good job. \\"American Idiot\\" is full of punk spirit and strong vibe. My personal favourite is \\"SHE'S A REBEL\\", and \\"AMERICAN IDIOT\\" \\"BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS\\" \\"JESUS OF SUBURBIA\\" are amazing too. Buy it.
B0002EXH54|5.0|In case you don't know, this was Megadeth's second album and their last with their original thrash style, which would morph in the more varied ''So far, so good, so what!'' and then leap into Progressive Thrash realms with 1990's ''Rust in peace''. <br />When this album came out, they were one of the most technically proficient bands of the lot, with the instrumental talents of Chris Poland and Gar Samuelson, both trained in jazz technique. But of course mastermind Mustaine commanded attention with his  complex riffs, solos, and snot-spitting vokills. Nice lyrics, too. The bass work by David Ellefson gives a nice kick in the arse to the procedures throughout the album, finally sounding like it should with the remastering work.  <br />Check out (in case you haven't yet!) the almost instrumental ''Wake up dead'', the ANTHEM title track, ''Devil's island'' and my favourite ''Good mourning/Black friday''.
B00005Y228|5.0|Yes, It was Love at first listening...Her voice, her International Diva Pose....She's a real clubby diva, i remember when i saw her video \\" Spinning Around\\" and i liked it. Now i'm lucky enough to have this cd...\\"CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD\\" \\"LOVE AT 1 SIGHT\\" \\"LOVE AFFAIR\\" \\"IN YOUR EYES\\" and the entire album is a classic jewel of the pop music.
B000002JKA|5.0|...But still just as good.  <br /> <br />This was the much anticipted album after Images and Words. I remember reading some articles about this album about how a lot of people were surprised at the metal edge to this record, because John Petrucci plays a 7-string guitar on record for the first time. I have also heard that this record has just as many friends as it does enemies. It was also recorded around the time that Kevin Moore left.  <br /> <br />All that considered, Awake is another great DT record. This record, along with 6DOIT, are ones that are always on my iPod rotation.  <br /> <br />Here are my favorites: <br />6:00 - Cool drum intro from Mike Portnoy, awesome song.  <br />Caught In A Web - A 7 string guitar can be heard on this song, lending to its heavy sound. The lyrics deal with how one can be trapped by the \\"powers that be\\". <br />Erotomania - John Petrucci's masterpiece of guitar playing, IMO. This is actually an \\"Intro\\" to a 3-song piece called \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\". <br />The Silent Man - A beautiful acoustic ballad, a break from the rest of the album.  <br />The Mirror - I really love the first 1:20 seconds of this song.  <br />Lie - One of the heaviest DT songs I have heard. John Petrucci lays down a wall of guitars here, and plays an awesome guitar solo.  <br />Space Dye Vest - A dark piano ballad. This Kevin Moore penned track was the last song he wrote for the band, therefore it has a very dark, moody feel to it.  <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are awesome, and there is not one bad song here. It is a bit long (About 77 min.) but well worth the listen.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|It's pretty funny. Warner Brothers claims to be celebrating their 50th anniversary in television productions, yet the only show from the 1950's that is slated for a season release is SUPERMAN (and it wasn't even originally produced by Warner Brothers!!). MAVERICK, along with CHEYENNE and SUGARFOOT, were some of the first successful television series produced by Warner Brothers and they deserve season sets! I imagine some \\"genius\\" at Warners marketing thought up this \\"sampler disc\\" and should have his/her head examined for not realizing that season sets are the norm. Hopefully this series will become available in season sets, possibly from some other company that knows better like IMAGE, PARAMOUNT, or ANCHOR BAY. I guess all we can do now is keep our hopes up.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Train of Thought. Dream Theater shows off their metal side on this record, opinions be damned. A lot of people did not lke this record because if it's heaviness.  <br /> <br />I thought this disc was great. But, then again, I was attracted to Dream Theater because of their metal side, anyway. The album artwork is in black and white, which reflects the music within. if you approach this disc with an open mind, you will be rewarded.  <br /> <br />As I Am - I think it was appropriate that they lead off an album like this with a song like this. This song blatently tells all naysayers that \\"We will do what we want, write the music we want, and say what we want, whether you like it or not\\"  <br /> <br />This Dying Soul - The continuation of the Mike Portnoy-penned lamentation on alcohol abuse. If you look in the liner notes to this song, you will see a small caption that says \\"To Bill W. and all his friends\\". Bill W. is the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, and this song deals with steps 4 and 5 in the 12 steps to recovery. (The Glass Prison on 6DOIT is about steps 1-3, The Root of All Evil on Octavarium is about 6-8) There is also some great axemanship from John Petrucci.  <br /> <br />Endless Sacrifice - One of the more pleasant sounding songs on this record. This song deals with depression, and about how love can heal suffering. More great guitar work from Petrucci here.  <br /> <br />Honor Thy Father - This song is a sticking point for me whenever I hear it. On the positive side, there s some awesome riffing from John Petrucci here, and the lyrics are well thought out. On the negative side, the instrumental section at points gets on your nerves after a while. This song is why I deducted 1 star.  <br /> <br />Vacant - A melodic break from the rest of the record, and a refresher from the instrumental bit in Honor Thy Father. There is no guitar on this song, all you can hear is a cello sample, grand piano, and a digital pad effect from Jordan Rudess, John Myung's bass guitar, and emotive lyrics from James LaBrie. <br />  <br />Stream Of Conciousness - an 11 minute instrumental song. John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, Jordan Rudess, and John Myung TASTEFULLY show off their chops here. It also has a very classical sound to it, too, which I like. Definitely the centerpiece of ths record.  <br /> <br />In The Name of God - Once again, John Petrucci shows that he is not only a master of the guitar, but master of the pen, too. This is a song about how certain people use religion to justify violence and inhumanity. It is the most chilling at about the 5 minute mark when James LaBrie refers to the Heaven's Gate, (Hundreds of believers lured into a doomsday cult), David Koresh and the branch Davidians (Self-Proclaimed messiah leading servants to their death) and Revrend Jim Jones and Jonestown (40 sons and daughters Unconsenting plural wives, perversions In the name of God). The song ends with a question that is very thought provoking (Does following faith lead us to violence?) <br /> <br />Yes, for the most part, this album is very heavy. But if you look beneath the metallic surface, you will find the intelligent and thought-provoking music that makes Dream Theater great.  <br />
