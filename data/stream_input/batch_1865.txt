0545265355|5.0|My daughter and I had wanted these forever and could not put them down when they came it! Will read it over and over again!
B001608R5I|3.0|Although the album was unopened and new there were a few skips on the record as if were stored incorrectly.
B009HELT3C|2.0|Our family loves this movie and was so glad to see it again. We rented the movie in HD but the picture quality was more like analog. The picture was choppy and pixelated. We watched it twice and the picture was worse the second time viewed.<br /><br />We still love the movie.....
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|challenging but still cool at the same time that's what I'm talking about a good game. there's nothing wrong with this game I don't know why anyone would rate it a 1;2;or 3. and it keeps me going all day.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This album is just sick.  I'm a bit oldskool, so I bought the CD.  This is has gotta' be like the best rock album of the year.  Hopefully, it'll be recognized as such.
B003Y01JL2|5.0|Item was exactly as described. Couldn't be happier. Unless of course I had known ahead of buying this one that the 10th anniversary re-release was write around the corner. Live and Learn.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It works great. I would recommend it. I love my battery life in my HD fire. The app loaded fast and I can tell how much battery I have.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|this is one of the best seasons of mad men out there. ive watched over and over seasons 1-4 and this season will be no different. the changing of the times that is illustrated is seamless with character development and plot that we saw in seasons 1-4. same bad ass mad men with the added complexities of the evolution of the time
B003XQM2YU|5.0|Really like this movie - Russel Crow, what can you say.  Would watch again,and again, and again.  Fun - hope there is a sequel
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A bit different from his other stories and in  good way!!! This book hooks you right and its hard to put down!  Romance and suspense perfectly intertwined together!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|I'm a total Pegg & Frost addict. While Shaun was my first flick by this dynamic duo, Hot Fuzz remains my favorite. Will watch, ad nauseam.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. I don't like reading, but I loved this book. I will be looking forward to the next book.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|The photography is wonderful, the sound track too, but it's Rob---he is eye catching and delivers the dialog beautifully.  The book was a hard read for me and I was glad to see it visually realized.
B008XG1X18|5.0|updates with my boards and I can see my friend's boards. perfect when I cannot get on the computer &amp; use my kindle!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|This was a super movie at a super price I love Martha may who.  Great video with faith hill as well
B004EK926K|5.0|First time that  i've seen it in HD and it is a must see Christmass movie . One af afew movies i will watch this Christmass.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Nothing but positive to say about this CD. Has all of Linda's hits. I haven't listened to her music in a long,long,time (since the 70's) and forgot how amazingly talented she was. A really nice trip down memory lane.<br /><br />One of the best female vocalists ever!!
B007TBCTRK|5.0|Loved this movie and while watching it the soundtrack caught my attention. The music is beautiful and worthy of a listen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used Accuweather for years on my iphone and have come to rely on the acurate and up to date forcasts!  I was glad to find it was available for Android so now I can enjoy it on my 8&quot; Kindle Fire.  you will not find a better weather app!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Muy buen producto, solo que la copia digital es ara ser descargada en cuentas de Norte america (itunes), y que es un proceso para descargarla un poco tedioso, incluso para alguien que maneje ordenadores, la clave de descarga no es, y hay que descargar una nueva desde la pagina de digital copy..asi que se imaginar&aacute;n..
B007HACDLK|5.0|When Vince Flynn first hit the publishing world, I enjoyed reading his stuff.  Yes, his writing suffered from too bronzed a hero to too much ideology, but the plots typically were well wrought.<br /><br />I moved away from Flynn as Rapp became more psychotic.  There was a great deal lacking in this ubermensch.<br /><br />So, it was with lowered expectations that I came to read \\"The Last Man\\".  I was pleasantly surprised.  No longer is Rapp Superman. He has issues and he recognizes that he has them.  Ideology has clearly taken the fold-down seat in the back of the Suburban.  The story was complex, engaging and well written. Wilson was a bit of a cutout character, but the main characters all seemed to hold their own.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in international intrigue.
B0041T52S6|1.0|Package was shrink wrapped and when my son opened it there was a piece of paper with an ad for for the Scott Pilgrim comics and no dvd. Santa brought an empty box. I felt bad for my son because this was something on his list this year.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|The advrtising simply says Lungs,  not 1/2 or 2/2 , not until just now did I see there was any mention of it being a seperate entity.  So  I am disapointed  that I thought I was doing ine thing and was doing another.  The cd I got I love, but amazon could clarify what its selling. it isnt all this sellers fault.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|Me encanta, solo que es Region 1 y no puedo reproducirlo en my Playstation 3 europeo, una lastima. pero nada que no se pueda resolver!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was amazing and so heart felt and emotional.<br /> you really feel the intensity of the raid and what the time goes threw everyday
B009MCRHH6|5.0|What a nice Christmas surprise. I've played this game on the computer and loved it. Thought about purchasing on my kindle several times. It's worth buying, so definitely get it as the free app!!!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Though the middle of the story is slow, developing the &#34;character&#34; of the Captain America suit, the rest of the story has suspense, action and heart.  I was surprised how watching this movie opened up the discussion in our family about what WWII was actually like, comparing the artistic license taken in the movie with many truths/experiences of the time.  It's amazing what they were able to do via cinema magic to transform this hulky actor - so believable - and Chris Evans nails the role.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Better than the movies though the movies are closer to the book than usually happens. Well formatted and edited. Top Five Books published the edition I read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|BOOK REVIEW by Michelle:<br /><br />\\"Let me inform you of something,\\" he says in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />I just want to roll around in Colleen Hoover's brain. Soak up this awesome writing gift she has ...and maybe, just stay a while. Yes, I am unashamedly a Colleen Hoover stalker ( of the harmless garden variety) . The woman, truly, truly...beyond...truly, has a knack with words. She can tear you apart and put you back together and then tear you apart again.<br /><br />Simply with words.<br /><br />If you look at this cover, it is already telling you a whole lot about what this book is going to do to you. Look at Sky's face...... no ...really look at it. Then I want you to read the words as you first see them on the cover. Whisper, `Hopeless' , chant it, slowly building the volume , until you hit the crescendo and you are shouting HOPELESS at nothing.<br /><br />The story builds, all the characters have something to tell us.<br /><br />There will be heart aching pain.<br /><br />I LOVE Breckin. He is Sky's first alliance. She has many firsts.<br /><br />I had a `Mormon', friend in high school , like Breckin. They are priceless , loyal friends.<br /><br />\\"I'm Breckin,\\" he says. I'm in an alliance to overtake the public school system and all its minions with your daughter.\\"<br /><br />Holder gives him a half smile, but he's staring at the coffee cup on Breckin's desk. \\"I thought Mormon's weren't allowed to have caffeine.\\"<br /><br />Breckin shrugs. \\"I decided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay.\\"<br /><br />Beautiful Sky, a girl I identify with. She thinks out loud. She doesn't conform. She isn't a clone. I spent a lot of the book in my head going `No, no , no , no....'. I didn't want it to be so. I was hoping , praying I was on the wrong track. Colleen doesn'tdisappoint , she throws the reader curveballs.<br /><br />She will sucker punch you in the heart.<br /><br />You can't help feeling tense, uncertain, lost, frightened. The story will take you places. Some, may feel it more than others.....for reasons. I felt my chest fill up, become heavy like a stone was resting on it.<br /><br />\\"Where'd you go. Sky?\\"<br /><br />Colleen's words weighed me down. Held me trapped with fear.<br /><br />Dean Holder, the boy whose words will melt your face off. Whose strength and understanding will make you set your prospective boyfriend sights ...higher.<br /><br />\\"Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\" He pulls my hand up to his mouth and kisses it.<br /><br />The bar has been raised, people!<br /><br />\\"You don't deserve words, Sky. You deserve actions.\\"<br /><br />Sky and Holder are like two old souls, in young bodies. There will NEVER be anybody else for either of them.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />\\"We won't go any further than this, I promise. But please don't ask me to stop where we already are. I need to watch you and I need to hear you because the fact that I know you're actually feeling this right now is so far out amazing. You feel incredible and this feels incredible and please. Just...please.\\"<br /><br />I'm so acutely aware of everything about him in this moment that I'm almost positive I could pick his thumbprint out of a lineup.<br /><br />You can tell how passionate Colleen is with her writing. No stone is left unturned. I could just picture her sitting there, rereading her work until she was absolutely positive she was going to blow our brains with emotion and make sure we felt the raw pain she puts her characters through. That we, the reader are as connected to her words as she is. I feel like she would expect no less of herself.<br /><br />It shows.<br /><br />Oh, it is ...raw. I found myself at 2.00am having a girlie cry, while hubby snored next to me. I for once was grateful for the noise. You can't help 'feel' a part of the story. 'Feel' a part of Sky's pain and loss. It grabs you and squeezes your heart.<br /><br />Tight.<br /><br />I want...no, absolutely NEED this book in paper form, currently only digital. The paper back for easy gripping, the hardback, to own such a passionate, beautiful, heart breaking read sitting proudly on my shelf ,and also that book jacket is powerful, painfully beautiful. The paper back to share with my friends, sorry guys the hardback will be off limits, but how could I not share this with you? The hardback that one day WILL hold a signature when we meet face to face. I will be the one unashamedly wearing the stalker t-shirt ( of the harmless garden variety) .<br /><br />This is a review where I stumbled over my thoughts, I sat staring at the computer screen, for far longer than necessary.<br /><br />Bottom line.<br /><br />Read this book.<br /><br />Discover for yourself, what I had trouble expressing. What I couldn't spoil.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks.... Colleen Hoover has entered the building.<br /><br />Michelle
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome, and enjoyable! it is so awesome when it comes to se if i'm good at logic and to get better at logic. not that much logic is really needed though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is freaken AWESOME. I would recommend this to every ONE. Get the game please its awesome get it please.<br /><br />Thanks.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|Amazon's system says this should work on my phone (LG Optimus T) but it makes the phone reboot.  Very annoyed and disappointed with this.
0875845851|3.0|I read this book years ago. At the time, this simple, well-written book had impact. I just re-read it and find the content feels dated and perhaps simplistic. The book is worth reading but may not change your life.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's angry birds. To much has already been said about it for me to go into detail about it. If it's free, DOWNLOAD IT IMMEDIATELY!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I have totally enjoyed this book. It is absolutely funny and I just could not stop reading till the end.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I usually read right through a DeMille novel, but The Panther just does not keep my interest.  Perhaps it is simply that I am weary of novels centered around jihadists.  I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt on that score.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game!!! My daughter loves this game. It's great for kids!!!! Every kid should play it. Excellent!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love puzzle games. The idea is simple. Connect the dots and fill up the board while doing so. It starts off as simple but the difficultly rises significantly when more dots show up and the board expands. Simple, addictive, and challenging.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Very good game but uses 375mb of memory<br />that's the reason some people r having trouble<br />installing.<br />For 1dollar.  good deal.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|There was certainly entertainment in this movie, once I got past the confusion of the beginning and figured out the treads to be connected.  But more star power was needed to carry off this movie.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|A wonderful sci-fi thriller with some interesting twists and turns. I think most viewers will say this was well done and entertaining!
B0086700CM|4.0|What can I say, your character runs non stop. It's up to you to make sure your character jumps, slides, and dodges obstacles. Try to last as long as you can. With a simple upgrade system and the ability to buy power ups with the coins you collect, it gives you a drive to do better and push it further.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|If you're looking for a mindless read then this book is worth reading. It's great to have handy while trying to kill some downtime, but even then it started to bore me. It took me a while to get through it, simply because it was so annoyingly repetitive (much like the first one). It's safe to say that I should have stopped reading after the first book. My 50 shades journey comes to an end here!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Imagine you've been planning to meet some old friends in New York for New Year's Eve - you haven't seen them in years, you have a great evening set out, and you're flying in that evening.  Then your plane gets delayed and instead of drinking champagne with your buddies, you're stuck circling JFK for five hours, buying cheap airline cocktails and getting more and more bored, annoyed, and disappointed at the way your evening is turning out.  That's what reading this book is like after reading the first three.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was by far the most amazing book I've read. You are captivated from page 1. I absolutely loved the way it was written. GREAT BOOK!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|The DVD was great!  It worked wonderfully and I didn't have a single problem.  Still watching it every now and then. Quick shipping as well!  Thank you.
1439127700|1.0|The book ... &#34;The Presidents Club:  Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fratenity&#34;:<br />What there was of it was great.  Unfortunately several pages were missing!!!!!  From 279-310
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Enjoyed this movie - The story line was good, the characters believable, and it ended on a positive note.  Always love anything with Clint Eastwood and he didn't disappoint!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great movie! My Grandfather grew up during this era, and told stories of \\"running shine\\".  I think he would have liked to have seen this movie.
159514188X|5.0|this book was wonderful! i loved it :) y a y a y a y a y a y a y
B008KE3960|5.0|Game is fun challenging and does not require money to play.  no advertising either, so far, which is a plus.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Absolutely awesome show. Recommend to any one who likes a good comedy. Zoey Deschanel is a quality actress. Well done.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I so very much enjoy any books by these two authors! With multiple, interesting story lines, these books provide a great deal of entertainment.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This game is terrible. It proves nothing what so ever. I myself have tried the same finger and received two different age numbers. This is probably just a fun game for dumb people to play.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|A great addition to your collection if you are a Rod Stewart fan, like I am. I loved it !!!!!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I absolutely love this book! Anyone who reads classics should consider this one. The story line is so unique. It really puts you in the shoes of the characters involved.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|This is a fun little musical game, but challenging!  You need to strike the &#34;keys&#34; very precisely, or you have an error!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Combines the best qualities of novels by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman!  Excellent writing, fun plot, and more hilarity than you can &#34;shake a stick at&#34;!
159514188X|4.0|This was a very disturbing read. It gave me an insight of teens, and if this is really what is going on inside some of their minds, they are certainly living in a world of turmoil. The angst is palpable, and I felt very sorry for the state of events.<br />I also feel that not all the mistakes made are an individual's but also deeply entwined in the society they live. Too much negativity to deal with, too much pier pressure at an age that should be far more protected than it is (an age where the teens work to pull away from this very protection and strive to build a personality of their own, unsuccessful though it may be)<br />Whereas I would recommend this book, it is one that will leave you in an unpleasant mood, and wonder what we can do to help the lost children.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a fun game that would get anyones party started! Just jump and slide your way to safety while being chased by the evil creatures! Great for all ages. A great bordum killer! I recommend this app to everyone!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love it sort of touched my heart every chapter even when you know what is  coming at you your don't know all the details I just love this book in my opinion you haven't lived till you've read wonder it's a great book no great is a  understatement  wonder is awesome
B0058YPILY|5.0|Wish they made more and am waiting for Season 8 (on the waiting list). Another addition to my great collection.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|This movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be and nothing more.  The acting is sub-par and the writing is laughable. don't waste your time.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is the best show out there and now i can watch it anytime i want. Got it aa lightning deal from Amazon during black Friday week, and it arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition...love Amazon.com
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love the premise of this show! It has action, drama, romance & a great storyline! A keeper for me
B0072V394E|5.0|Wanted to watch an original Django movie before going to the show to see the new Quinton Tarantino movie.  enjoyed it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Multiple story lines with very interesting characters involved in not your typical threat to world peace. The Jack Ryan Jr character is as appealing as senior was in earlier novels
B0076DCT2G|1.0|The main character is a sarcastic detective who never stops uttering absurd and annoying sarcasms. The plot is weak and drawn out. Good author - bad book!!
B0086700CM|5.0|love love. love love<br />awesome game.<br />buy buy buy buy buy buy buy! :))))))))))<br />seriously get it for Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />love it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I've recommended it to a new Kindle owner and hope the enjoyment is as great!  I'm considering ordering the full game, though I'm not very good at the levels beyond the first one!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't often write reviews unless I really enjoy someone's work, or find particular problems that prospective buyers may be interested in knowing before they make a purchase. Thankfully, I'd like to note that this is a case of the former.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Truly superlative character work. Each main character has a significant back story with multiple interesting developments over the course of the novel. I was despondent over losing a particular character, which I think is a testament to the quality writing. I wanted so badly to know more, but I was only given a precious few pages. The characters in this story are easily up there with Paul from Dune or Ender from Ender's Game. I was particularly fond of Holston and Walker, two of the gruff old men from different volumes of the omnibus.<br />+Excellent sociopolitical commentary. The best works of science fiction always deal with more basic elements of human nature like greed, love, corruption of power, and fear of the unknown.<br />+Very well done world building and establishment of universe. Mr. Howey has convinced me that there is a whole world of unexplored stories in his universe, and he has firmly established his setting.<br />+It's more of a personal preference, but the short sentences that are direct and to the point remind me of Hemingway. There is a simple elegance to this kind of prose that I very much enjoy.<br /><br />Cons<br />-The pacing of the series is rather slow, and continues getting slower as the story goes on.<br />-It is surely a difficult balance to find as an author, but I felt that the amount of background details given was frustratingly slim. A certain amount of mystery is good, but I still feel as though I do not know enough for the plot to have its maximum emotional impact. If I had slightly more background information, I would likely be even more invested in the story.<br />-This is a small matter, but I felt that the intricate word pictures sometimes detracted from the plot movingforward. There were times when I could feel just how cold a character was, but there were also times when I was ready to get on with it.<br />-As a regular science fiction reader, I tend to prefer having a touch more science in the plot. There is some science to be sure, but I would have loved learning perhaps a little bit about how the atmosphere was warped, or maybe how the hydroponics farms worked.<br /><br />Overall, Wool is a delight to read. I cannot wait to jump back in and uncover more secrets from this fascinating dystopian universe. I do sincerely hope that Wool receives more recognition in the future, as it is a story that is so well told that it truly deserves to be enjoyed by a wide audience of science fiction fans looking for the next epic saga.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|Lego were good for my daughter  she liked  the colors plus the booklet to teach her how to build.<br />Would recommend to a preteen.
1449410243|3.0|I expected more sneaky stuff that your cat does, it was more of a cuddly book and I'd rather have had the laughs, it was a gift and my sister liked it, she hasn't read it yet tho, I hope she get more fun out of it than I did.
1423140605|3.0|i'm not really into these kinds of books but my son is..he has them all now and can't wait to see if there will be more that will go with this series and the other ones he has out..
0525952926|4.0|I read Fall of Giants about a week before purchasing the sequel from Amazon. I adored the first installment and had high hopes for the second. I was not displeased in the least! Follet had a knack for intriguing story lines and I love his creative use of intertwining character relationships. However, I rated this one four stars because certain characters lacked the depth I so loved in the first novel. Also, I was sad to see that the author did not incorporate elements of concentration camps into his novel, he seemed to skip over that major part of WWII. I'm not afraid to say, however, that this installment made me more emotional than the first, a quality I like in books. Overall Follet does an amazing piece of work and I cannot wait for the third novel in his Century trilogy.
B009MO5E10|5.0|Haven't watched this yet.  But I have ordered 100's, if not 1000's of dvd's from Amazon.  I've only had 2 that I have had to return and I have always received the replacements very the next day.  Amazon truly backs its products and they have the best prices in town.  I have made a few mistakes in the past, of buying dvd's from other places because they were cheaper, only to find out that those were bootleg copies.  So Amazon is the only place online that I purchase from anymore.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A fantastic Christmas movie - touches the hearts of children and adults alike - can be conversation for anyone about Christmas - Christ centered and/or Santa centered.  Love it!
B009MF56GC|5.0|loved the first one and knew that the 2nd one was going to be added to the collection..was bought as a gift for Christmas..
B008M721MS|4.0|first time using this so we will see how it works...hoping it works well this is the first kindle we have owned....so i guess time will tell
B001706I5I|5.0|This is a great movie very close to the Dr. Seuss original book. Loved how the rhyme was narrated throughout. This character was perfect for Jim Carey. Amazon streaming was faultless.
B005LAII1C|4.0|have now watched it twice..my hubby was surprised when he opened it for Christmas..he can't wait till part 2 comes out..
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I enjoy this kind of show but would prefer not to have to pay $2 for a 45 min show.
B008P76VXU|5.0|This was a gift for a Wagner enthusiast, who truly enjoyed receiving it. No distracting vocals to get in the way.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book. But The height of the drama was short lived and not as suspenseful as I would have  assumed.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|I enjoy this kind of show but the sex scenes and language are too much they spoil an otherwise exciting story.<br />I would love to see a 'cleaned up' version of this show.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|It literally took me 12 years to view this movie and even though I wasn't able to watch the entire movie it is definitely the kind of movie I would see over and over again. I can see why all the woman went Russell Crowe crazy!
0451232852|5.0|i LOVE Ken Follett books, But this series just out does all his others and I learned so much!!! A+ quality especially if you love historical novels.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|More than just a great Woody Allen movie, this movie crosses genres to become a wonderful literary fantasy. I was surprised by Owen Wilson's range; my family commented that it seemed as though Wilson was playing Woody Allen's classic &#34;confused man&#34; role. The plot cleverly combines the magic of modern Paris with its wonderful literary history, introducing the audience to accessible versions of Hemingway, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein, with Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec thrown in. Wilson's deflating of a pompous pseudointellectual is not to be missed. One of the few five-star movies to be produced in the last decade.
B001HN6922|5.0|very cute movies. disney is so cleaver. all their movies are good. i especially like Cars, Love mater, i think he is everyone's favorite!!!!  keep them coming.  hope there is a cars 3
B0082Z447U|4.0|Its a good read for mystery book readers. It also has romance with plenty of suspense. I've watched the b&w movie but some important things were left out which made the book even better.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in naval action of the Napoleonic period. Well shot, good story line, believable characters. I wish there was a similar film about Stephen Decatur, Thomas Truxtun, or Edward Preble...
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Great classic movies, First in the 6 series.  I love Paul Walker, and Vin Diesel.  This movies will always be a classic now
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Had hoped for more as far as plot and acting,  Found it a bit boring and not into it.  The guys did well but not my cup of tea.  Almost embarrassing at times for such reputable actors.
B0041LG08U|4.0|The watch is a beautiful, expensive looking watch. The deep blue is almost ink blue inside and around the bezel. Yet its attractive in the light. The band is sturdy and light. It has a nice finish.  The clasp is well made. The only negative is that the watch itself is thick and on the heavy side. But for me its not that big of a deal. Afterall its a sports diver watch. Most are made this way. I like the fact its selfwind too. So far it has kept accurate time.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is a great and fun game, the hole family loves it.<br />I play it at least 3 times a day.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|This is definitely one of the best science fiction shows on tv!!!!! I love it!!! This season introduces the new doctor.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this app works amazingly well on my iphone, but it crashes immedistely upon starting it on my kindle fire hd :( so sad!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Great musical with wonderful music and story line.  Definitely a family movie that leaves you ready to join a marching band at the end.
0545265355|5.0|what a great read. would definitely recommend this book to others. warning: you will be hooked. its hard to put down.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved every chapter! Such a beautiful perspective from man's best friend. Think I will probably look at my dogs a little differently now. Would read again in a heartbeat!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Did not load correctly, did not run well.  Was a waste of time and money.  Definitely not worth getting.  Also no clear directions on how to play the game.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Between my family's last Kindle Fire and this Kindle Fire (purchased only a few months apart) this app changed for the worse a LOT, which I do not understand. It is the same product and the same app and I can even have them open at the same time next to each other but they behave completely different. This version does not show me any posts older than one hour aside from some weird sort of summary and even then I can only scroll back two or three hours in my time line at the most... It's not even worth the memory when it's a free app...
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Brings back memorys of when i was in kindergarten and it was mandatory they showed this film. Very scary.  I feel it was made well. I saw threads and actually liked this one more. I felt the attack segment on this film was better then threads!! However i felt the post attack days on threads was more powerful. For the price you cant go wrong.
B005HSL626|2.0|Does not make sense.  Thought it would be a fun game to play but definitely not for adults--much more for kids.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Omg my mom got me a kindle fire to Christmas  I love it and I love the books a wee bit more can't wait for catching fire and the mocking Jay movies to come out!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great show and a good movie for children . I would recommend this to anyone who ;oves a good cry
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great movie.  Having grown up in the South, this story rings true in so many ways.  It is refreshing to see the differences overcome and friendships made in unlikely places.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved the story of this book and the entire series.  It was hard to put down once I started reading it.  Some of the subject matter is not for the faint of heart, but it's a good read!
0571202284|5.0|I found this not long after my little sister told me she wanted to animate and decided to grab it. She was so excited and just loved it so much and is still reading through it. A great purchase for the animator in your life, or anyone interested in the process.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Ugg! Waste of two hours of my life! Couple funny parts, but that was it. Glad i didn't buy it, just rented it!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It is hard to put down.  The fantasy and the reality blend with the fascinating photos to create a totally engaging loop that holds you till the end.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Really fun Idea and well excecuted for the most part, but a lot of it felt like it was still in first draft. Don't think it was worth the 12$ (for an ebook? come on) but I'd recomment it if the price drops to 5 or 6.
B00AL3KEE8|3.0|First, this is a bit different than Q's first couple soundtracks (Pulp, Reservoir) which contained lots of great seldom-heard super-cool 70s tunes. This collection is closer to what you get with Kill Bill. It has more 70s cinema music than radio hits. There is some original and resampled hip hop that's not bad, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't own any hip hop albums made after the mid 90s and usually isn't a hip hop fan. There are a handful of \\"classic\\" western tracks which are more novelty for film nerds, than fun to listen to, but overall the music is enjoyable. I haven't watched the film yet, but I'm sure all of these will grow on me after I've actually seen the flick.<br /><br />Amazon is selling this for less than half of the cost of the same album on iTunes. Five Dollars versus fourteen dollars (prices on Christmas 2012). It's a pretty great value.<br /><br />Keep in mind when you buy from Amazon, you don't get the final \\"credits\\" track from RZA. This track is essential to the soundtrack and will set you back a dollar and thirty cents on iTunes. It's an original track written to re-tell the movie while the credits roll.<br /><br />If amazon included the RZA track \\"Ode to Django,\\" I would rate this album four stars.
B0049VZ222|4.0|Very well done action and zombies. Keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br />Good story lines with excellent acting
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Screen has air bubbles. Protecter is broken. This is the worst I have ever seen a 60 dollar phone cover.
B00746O3X8|5.0|This is just what I've needed for working in the field with my Canon T3i.  Excellent quality and very adaptable.  Comes with a spare holster that could actually be attached to my belt without having to wear the whole harness.  The only downside I see is that I have to change out rectangular tripod connector on the bottom of my camera for the round connector that works with the harness and separate holster, but it is a small annoyance that I can live with.  I've no problem recommending this as a great solution for securely carrying around a camera without having it bang around all over the place.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Stayed very true to the books and a great cast as well as fantastic scenery. Enjoyed every minute of the shows.
B004U8VWIM|5.0|not what I was expecting from the movie, it was suspenseful and had enough twists to the plot that I was unsure at times what was going on, I loved it
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I was very sad to see it end. But it was a great ending. I wasnt sure how moning was going to give me the happy ending she promised. But she delivered!
B00ARAO720|2.0|Just felt a little light in the plot and acting department. A real show for kids would not watch again.
B009HELT3C|5.0|another entertaining movie in the men in black series, while tommy lee may be getting a bit long in thew tooth for his role, it is still a great movie
B009GENZKS|4.0|I like the first one better, but this was still a good movie. I did like the way it ended which is opening the door to another sequel.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Just took a chance and made the surprise tartin for the first time for a Christmas  Eve buffet. It got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Looking forward to trying some of the other recipes. Wonderful cookbook for vegetarians!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Ka-Bar BK2 Campanion Knife is one of my favorite knives and a perfect with my Ka-Bar BK9. The Ka-Bar BK2 is a very thick blade with a black coating finish. The coating will wear off over a period use which is normal for heavy use camp knives. The Ka-Bar BK2 sheath is one the better stock ones I have seen. The only complaint is the upper webbing makes for a difficult drawing. If you plan on using the sheath I would suggest a stiffer mounting point.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|John Rebus, Inspector of Lothians and Borders Constabulary: Retired.... And we missed him, but Mr Rankin has saw sense and resurrected an old style copper, not one who breaks the rules, but instead bends them back on themselves if it is going to get the right result -  a 20th Century Copper who, some think, has no business in the 21st Century.<br /><br />On the other hand if you are a reader of crime fiction, Rebus is. exactly what you want! A dog with a bone who won't let go, even if some of the places he ends up; no self respecting dog would want to be seen, especially when The Complaints are breathing down your collar again just waiting for the moment when they can pull the leash tight and hang you out to dry.<br /><br />DI Rebus is retired but back at Lothian and Borders Police in the SCRU looking into unsolved crimes when he has a chance encounter with the mother of a missing daughter who believes that her daughter is also linked to a number of other disappearances on the A9 trunk road between Perth and Inverness (how I hate that bloody road - well not the road but the politicians who .... another blog post maybe) but none of the Police forces in Scotland have made the connection before.<br /><br />This is another parent who can't and won't close the book on her daughters disappearance and move on with her life.  Rebus is, as he was in the past, non committal, but takes a look anyway and as it turns out was both bad and good for the mother - never ask for a stone to be upturned if you already know what dirt is underneath it waiting to be uncovered  .........<br /><br />Is it possible that up to 5 women have been abducted and murdered, and no one has made the connection? Has Scotland got a serial killer, and can a retired dinosaur crack the case?  Rebus is back in the mix with Siobhan Clark, his old Sergeant, now a DI and working out of the station on Gayfield again.  He is up and down that A9 like a yo yo and lo and behold not only is Siobhan back, but so is Rebus's old SAAB but by the sounds of it wearing a lot better than him in semi retirement.<br /><br />Rankin hasn't lost his touch with Rebus, he is his usual cynical self, but there is an underlying maturity towards Siobhan in not wanting to completely drop her in it, although at times he doesn't always manage this.  The Complaints are on his tail but especially as he still seems to be rather cosy with the Edinburgh bad boy fraternity and there is no convincing them that he is anything but dirty and doesn't belong in a Police station, unless of course he is locked up.....<br /><br />He still has issues with his daughter, but .....<br /><br />This was a great re-introduction to Rebus, and with the retirement age being changed since he left, he has the papers in front of him to get back in, but will he, and, will Rankin take the chance? I for one hope that he does give us more of Rebus, even if he doesn't make it back onto the force and gets a new warrant card.... Welcome Back, John<br /><br />Editing for Kindle: 5 out 5<br />Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5<br />Plot: 5 out of 5<br />Overall Rating: 5 out of 5<br />No of Pages: 363<br />Chapters: 69
B00782O7IY|5.0|This movie was really great. I wasn't sure that I would like it, but the acting was good and I was able to understand the story. It had marvelous music. The dog was trained so well that I couldn't believe it.All in all it reminded me of a Charlie Chaplin film which I truly enjoy.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Personally, this one, in my opinion was the best yet.  I loved the actor that played him as a much younger person.  I think he nailed it!  Definitely recommend!  AAAAA+
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I have used this browser for about a week and will Continue to until something better comes along.  It is noticibly faster than the standard ICS browser.
B005LAII80|5.0|Trust me folk's, there will be a sequel to Dredd at some point sooner or later. The Movie has had a great response from both critics and Cinema-goers alike, and I believe that if a sequel was to be made, then it would do extremely well at the Box-Office next time around. Alright, Dredd didn't do too well takings wise, but that was not due to it being a bad Movie. But morons online stating that Dredd is a \\"remake\\" of the poor 1995 Stallone Film before it's release, probably didn't help matters much. Along with the fact that the new film probably wasn't marketed hard enough in time for it's release either. (Even though the films two main stars did do a lot of interviews for Dredd) Many people didn't even know a new Dredd film was even on the way at all. And by the way, Dredd is not a remake of the Stallone film, it's a completely new, fresh start for the character. It's a re-boot rather than a remake. A brand new story, a brand new Mega City One, and a brand new Judge Dredd. I have a strong feeling that \\"word of mouth\\" will play a big part in whether or not there will be a Dredd 2, plus it's probably all down to how the film sells on Blu-Ray and DVD across the coming year also. I'm positive that the possibility of a Dredd 2 in the next two or three years will not be overlooked by all the parties concerned, providing Dredd does indeed do well on the home market. Looking forward to getting hold of the new Blu-Ray, and fingers crossed for a Dredd 2 in the not too distant future.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|IIt was very different.it kept you guessing what  was going to happen  the character did a good job portraying their  characters
B000SW4DXK|5.0|An endearing story with a VERY gifted child actress. It is rare to see a remake of a classic that is perhaps better than the original.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My daughter has been watching the Supernatural series from the very start and was missing the seventh season. I bought it for her as a black Friday deal so it was super cheap and it arrived in record time. She loves it! I recommend it to anyone who loves Supernatural.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|A classic movie...one of my favorites.  I think it has a lot of sci-fi, but also drama about the situation of isolation, loneliness, focus, fear, hope and courage.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Raunchy, but it is Seth Mcfarland. That is what you get. I laughed all the way through. A little corny toward the middle, but still very good.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Rovio Entertainment hits another one out of the park with this one! My family loves it! I have to admit, I thought it was going to be just like the Angry Birds series. I was pleasantly surprised. This game has a completely different feel and is more difficult for me. (My husband has no trouble at all!) I recommend it to anyone who like problem solving games with a bit of humor.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This was all I could hope for!  Fantastic deal, great product, perfect for a Christmas Sci-Fi marathon! I would strongly suggest it.
B0096Y6EUG|4.0|He is one of my favorites so it is biased. But he does a great job. similar to MTV unplugged.
B002VQ7PVS|2.0|I should have down loaded the excert first.  Then I would have known that this was not a book I would have been interested in.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The events in  the book are very detailed and interesting.  Even though some of the parts are kind of  scary.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Play is good and smooth. Graphics are good for the platform. Easy to use and the equipping if gear is easy. In all a good game.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Who doesn't love Jack Reacher?  Lee Child has created a live character that we will always remember.  I've read all the Jack Reacher books and always look forward to the next one.

0345534379|5.0|It's the same book from when I was a kid!  The print is small but I'm getting old!  My 9 year old can read it fine!!!
1451650728|5.0|Much has been said about how Star Trek is limited by its own genre. This book ignores those limits and makes its own story with its own rules. By focusing on the supporting cast, the supporting cast becomes the main cast and the main cast becomes the support.  Without being constricted by the main cast, but instead enhanced by it, the author frees himself to tell his own story. It is difficult to explain without spoilers, but let me say one thing. This novel is a triumph. It has expanded my knowledge of the way established fiction can be written.<br /><br />This book is a simi-sequel to \\"The immortal coil\\"[[ASIN:0743405927 Immortal Coil (Star Trek The Next Generation)]]<br />But it's not necessary to have read beforehand.<br /><br />The reader may wish to use the websites - \\"Memory Alpha\\" or Google if they need to remind themselves of some of the more obscure references this book uses from Star Trek lore.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very Great show and I could not stop watching! The show is very well done and I would suggest it to others!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome.it's soooooo cool I got it like 8 months ago and I loved it soooooo much.If you don't have this app read this comment and you'll want it soooooo much!
B0076DELIG|3.0|Good story, but really, I figured out whodunit almost immediately, if not the exact details. Bosch is still a compelling character, hopefully my brain gets stretched a bit more next time...
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a very fun and challenging game. The music is so relaxing and there's no hurry in trying to solve the puzzles. I love it!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Looks nice, feels nice, good protection. On the next batch, spend another 1/8\\" of material on the spine so the cover actually closes (hence the 4/5 stars). I'd like to look at the nice cover design not have to turn it upside down so it closes.<br /><br />EDIT: Gave this the fifth star - after a couple months of use it loosened up enough so now the cover closes well.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The game work just like any other mohjong. For the kindle the game menus is in a inconvenient location. Found myself accidentally exiting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i loved the entire book from start to finish. such a heartbreaking and heartwarming story. has to be one of the top books i have read all year!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really enjoyed the latest Harry Bosch installment.  The plot moves well, the characters are well drawn, the ending is believable and yet exciting.  Keep writing Mr. Connelly-  I am lovin' it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars. I love  it as well a the  other two books she has written. Look forward to reading more from her..
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I downloaded this today..Merry Christmas...anyhow I think it is pretty fun but I have to make several attempts to get through the levels so I had to stop playing because I have other stuff to do. It will be fun when I have time to play more.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|great holiday movie, never gets old, family laughs together every time we watch it one of our christmas time favorites!

B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun.  I love cutting the fruit and it is somewhat challanging but not so much to stress me out.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a real page-turner.  Loved the end -- second only to Grisham's &#34;The Brethren&#34; which is my personal favorite.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books, if not the content.  The movies are quite excellent as well.  I really like stories that are 'new' and not the same ideas worked over yet again and again.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it. It was so action-packed and at the end I was really shocked. I never thought that Katniss would ever face her second games like that. It was awesome.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I waited almost 7 years for this next book in the series and it did not disappoint..but only when reaching the end!
1419702238|4.0|My son wanted this series for Christmas so that is why I ordered this. He absolutely loves these books and I've skimmed them and they are pretty cute. Definitely recommend for young readers.

B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|This is a great movie from the great Oliver Stone.  Anyone who enjoyed Blow or Alpha Dog, would definitely enjoy this movie.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Sadly, I wasn't much impressed with Mile 81.  It took a long time getting to the interesting stuff, then like a book match, burned out much too quickly.
B005P4P966|5.0|This tv show will go down in history as one of the best written sitcoms.  It will make u smile and laugh. U will see yourself lr someone u know in the characters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is smartly written and not at all predictable.  Lots of twists, turns and surprises.  Very clever.  I would read it again.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes! I've always wanted to play this, but didn't want to pay $5 to. I have not yet played it, but it seems real fun! Glad that this is the free app of the day! :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good it's so good I wanna sing and dance I read it in like to days that is how good
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is a great app!  I loaded it on my Kindle and now I feel like I can us my Kindle HD for much more.

B00008973A|5.0|Love the music, dancing, acting, even the costumes (especially the last scene) - everything about it.<br />I play it every few weeks.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|just okay hard to hear all the words<br />hate when they make movies that are hard to hear and thus follow
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is really cool and helpful, I'm so glad they included it with the device for free :) thanks amazon
B009K6DKTS|5.0|I like Taleb's style. This book makes you rethink many of the ways you think about things. Becoming more antifragile is topping my list for 2013
B002RXZF6C|4.0|While dated and simplistic in many ways, this is so much more than a &#34;monster&#34; film. It is very different from Shelley's book, but it manages to capture the main ideas of the Romantic movement - that science sullies nature by making it understandable, and that the life of reason promised by the enlightenment would not lead to happiness. Even today as we have our lives improved and extended by technologies unimaginable at the time of the film (let alone the book), the entire world still struggles with these issues. Will we return to the simple, short, and technology-free life of the middle ages or move forward to the wonders still promised by the enlightenment? Undoubtedly the book and the film will continue to play a major role in how our culture struggles with that question.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|What I received was not the Stanley flashlight pictured but a cheap imitation. The LED is plenty bright; however, the flashlight broke within seconds of removing it from the package. The tripod legs were a molded plastic, not the chrome ones in the pictures, and one snapped off when trying to open it. Also, the key chain portion is in the way of the tripod making that feature doubly useless. I couldn't post an image to the review, but I was able to find it on this link.    [...]    I was able to get a hold of the real flashlight pictured and it is of a much higher quality. The legs are much sturdier. It has a much better designed reflector around the LED that focuses the light. You can rotate the head without feeling like you are going to break it off. The key chain itself is even a better quality.    I suppose that is the one issue of online shopping. Beware of imitations.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I've been missing Creedence, since all my old music is on LP's. It's a lot of trouble to convert them to MP3s, and this discounted compilation came along just in time for an early Christmas present to myself. It has all the greats I most remember, and provides a great walk down memory lane. There may be some songs missing, but they haven't yet come to mind, and the filler songs can easily be skipped or just removed from my playlist.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Have read Gone Girl and now Dark Places!! Looking forward to Sharp Objects. Gillian can really keep you on your toes!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Again, this CD gives Susan Boyle the stage that she needs and deserves.  It showcases her wonderful pure voice, with some mostly familiar songs.  Her work with the male guest vocalists is fantastic.  I especially like the participation of Donny Osmund.  I highly recommend this CD especially if you already like Susan Boyle.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Love this show! Love rewatching episodes where I catch things I missed the first or second time around! No commercials is the awesome too!
B0067R0APK|4.0|I chose this app because the previous app that I bought (weather plus) looked real pretty. But did absolutely nothing. It just continuously stated that it was retrieving data, and it never did. I have used this app for about a month now, and I think that it is great. It has every feature that I could use, and then some.<br /><br />.

0440246024|3.0|I like literature but I have a soft spot for John Grisham. I am sure Grisham would be the first to agree that he is not a literary writer by any stretch of the imagination. His fiction belongs on the same shelf as Isaac Asimov's. His novels are easy, entertaining reads and Grisham writes good plain unadorned prose. His simplistic characters have always disappointed me, but his genius at  presenting, explaining, and resolving moral situations more than makes up for his one dimensional characterization. His stories offer good life lessons and maybe two dimensional characters would get in the way of that.<br /><br />But I wonder if Grisham knows what it's like to suffer with indecision. He knows about the pain of loss and about feeling physical fear, but angst is an important human dimension that Grisham characters never display. In this book, the only troubled character appears only a few times, and while Grisham sympathizes with him, he also labels him schizophrenic; he wonders what kind of hell this man must be living in but he avoids exploring that hell at all. What I mean is that _all_ of Grisham's characters are like Aragorn or Saruman (from the Lord of the Rings books) with no one like Frodo or Gollum. They are all representation of a perfectly representative ideal, they are characters who know who and what they are. No one ever questions himself.<br /><br />But fiction needs tension and Grisham fails to provide it here. There is a little bit of tension from the plot, but the book resolves itself with very few surprises. Grisham usually provides tension by presenting us with several moral dilemmas, with satisfying resolutions that teach us something about the nature of right and wrong. Here, there's none of that: the good guys are good and do good things, the bad guys are bad and do bad things.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's a fun read. Willie Traynor is a young student living in 1970 off his grandmother's good graces. When she tells him to get a job, he stumbles into Clanton, Ford County, Mississippi and soon buys the decrepit local paper. He turns it around, writes most of it himself, befriends the matriarch of a prosperous black family, Miss Callie. And that's what the book is about. It's a picture of a friendship, about a sweet old lady cooking every Thursday for a nice young man who gets her story out.<br /><br />There is a murder plot, there are a few legal twists, but in the end it's a human interest novel. There's nothing wrong with that but it's missing what I like best about Grisham.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Nassau, The Bahamasinto Clanton, Ford County, Mississippi and soon buys the decrepit local paper.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very relaxing, at least for me. It is really fun in the sense of how it makes you think and us  your brain, without really noticing!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|It was given to me as a present before I could buy it here, but I will write a review anyway..... It is amazing, like a mixture between diamond eyes and saturday night wrist.... Powerful yet very melodic, chino s voice only gets better. It lacks a song like change, but what record doesn't.... Tempest comes very close, and even leathers grew on me after I disliked it when it came out. Deftones only puts out great records and this is no different

B008M34INW|3.0|Nothing to rave about here. It's quite simply a Mel Gibson action/revenge flick. Gibson's character is reminiscent of his remake of Point Blank (60's Lee Marvin movie). He's a likable, irascible sorta-bad person protagonist who rises to the occasion. The movie is enjoyable, of an appropriate length, and has a happy ending (for some of the characters, the ones you will end up liking). Nice way to pass an evening.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Works great. I have enjoyed playing this game. I hope you download it too. Probably the best game of its kind.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love this show and it plays really well on my Fire. Great way to occupy yourself when traveling by air.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|I just think it was an awsome movie it gives such a good story. Zac Efron is such an awsome actor.
B00A2IUDO8|1.0|Stopped watching after the first few minutes. Relies on sophmoric humor and grates on my ears with the over over over over over over use of the most vulgar language.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|This game is sooooooo boring and such a time waster and don't even get me started on how long it took to download ugggggggg!!!!! Also, when I tried to play it on my kindle fire it froze!!!! For me it was just a total WTF?!?!? Moment.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter just loved it!! I thought it was going to be a small school ,but actually its a descent size.
B009KHCT94|2.0|generally bad. looks low budget, could've been a lot funnier. doesn't stick to one plot line just very disappointing and wasn't worth the 4 dollars.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought this was entertaining, although a little weird at times. The projectile vomiting seemed like it was from a horror movie or something. The characters were the real gem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun if you have never played this game ur missing out thanks for making this game!
B006O6F932|3.0|Very cute and very creative design, however it is flimsy.  Still worth it, my daughter played with it all morning.  The second floor does not hold dolls well, not strong enough.  Still cute - just like the dolls adorable but not high quality.
B00319ECGK|4.0|I loved watching this movie when it first came out. All of the amazing cinematography has been perfectly ported in the Blu-ray version, and the magic of this incredible idea has been preserved in the intervening years. It is a staple for every scifi collector.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My wife loved it and is thrilled to have this set.  As others have mentioned, the case is not super durable, but That is easy to compensate for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing game that is getting closer to the real thing than anything I've ever seen. Unlike the cheap imitations, this bears closest resemblance to the actual thing.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK. THE STORY TAKES YOU TO ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE LIVING IT. GREAT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Thought it was a very good film with a good moral to it.  the animation was fantastic!  good enough to watch again.
B009MO5960|2.0|I had played and watched all \\"Resident Evil\\" movies and games. Despite my very low expectation of this latest addition to the movie franchise, I still had been overwhelmingly disappointed. No plot, no ending, all gunshots and an invincible Alice, fine. Nevertheless, the stupid setting (a mockup of Raccoon City + Toyko + New York + Moscow under an ice sea in Russia), the absence of new ideas/designs/monsters and the rare appearance of bloody zombies really frustrated me. Without Alice's SM outfit, Ada Wong's sexy red cheongsam, and the Umbrella logos everywhere, there is little difference between it and any other low quality B movie at all. In short, rent one. Save your hard earned money on something else.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|The band is not very confortable seems to be quite rigid at the moment to be adjust feels hard, the watch is also quite heavy but looks very good
B005LAII8K|4.0|When most sci-fi action movies lost themselves in stunning CG, visuals and actions, the director and writer of this had made it right for telling a time travel story brilliantly with intelligent screenplay, great acting (especially Levitt, who you can tell he had, with a little help of make up, styled himself into young Willis perfectly), and most importantly an excellent plot (and ending) with solid details. The quality of the creative ideas, action and cinematograhy are high, yet the quantity may not be enough to satisfy some heavy action movie fans who got the wrong expection from the trailer and of Bruce Willis. No matter what, a very good movie which captivates the audience from the beginning to the end. Highly recommended!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|A little hard to work out at first but very enjoyable..... makes you think and I am enjoying it very much.
0316017930|5.0|Wow! Glad well does it again. How does he keep finding such interesting topics to write about. This book will really change how you view success. And failure.
0756405890|4.0|It's a good lead into the series. A few slow moments, but all in all a good read for fantasy lovers.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|IT is the best DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOK EVER SO GOOD GREAT JOB JEFF  KINEY AMAZING JOB HI
B005VPRF0M|5.0|I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. He is 5 years old so with help and supervision from his Dad, he had very little difficulty with it. I have not seen the product in person but my brother says it is on par with the Legos of our childhood...durable, bright, easy to use and definitely a delight to my nephew. He has graduated from Cars to Batman now so he was thrilled to have this as a starter piece to his impending collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read the Hunger Games series to see what all the buzz was about. I literally could not put it down. I raced through the series only to immediately start it over again. Very enjoyable book and series.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love this game unfortunately it meant that I have ignored most of my family on Xmas day but hey at least they know that I like the kindle f I 're that they brought me
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is really helpful and not bad for the kindle fire BUT it kind of has wrong battery data for the kindle system
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This was one of the dumbest movies ive ever watched.  Who would make a show about a farting, drug smoking Teddy Bear?  Watch this movie only if you have a weird sense of humor.
0547884591|1.0|very disappointed by the &#34;f&#34;bombs used in the book.  Otherwise helpful hints, I am surprised that there wasn't a warning on it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Rowling's dark and mysterious way taken us through many adventures and while I appreciate she is now advertising that she is writing for adults starting off a book on hum drum death is just depressing. The whole time I am thinking why did this man who dies in the beginning of this book have such a crap life? Isn't reading supposed to help you escape from the crap reality that surrounds you? It is thorough and well written just depressing.
1419705849|5.0|Nice to have a hardcover of the 7th edition of the series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and got it to complete the 5 book series and don't know why they didn't just make a 7 book series but I guess the 5 book series set was already out by the time the 7th book was published.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This really is a great book.  Having read all of Grisham's novels, this is the best.  The book has a great plot and I couldn't put it down..
1419702238|5.0|Got this to complete the 5 book set I bought and didn't realize they were hard cover. Very nice heavy cover that is surely great for the collector of this series.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Edit: This app is updated in Amazon App Store. I really like the new Swift Key Flow. Better predictions than stock android swype. Also, they have a ton of new languages now, including hybrids like 'Higlish'. Gotta love it!<br /><br />Old review:<br />--------------------------<br />Great keyboard, but why can I not update to Version 3.1?<br /><br />Its on ver3.1.x on Google Play Store, but Amazon App Store does not let me update it to that version. I'm stuck on ver 3.0.x<br /><br />Also, just noticed that the predictive input is missing, as I'm typing this review on my device.<br />--------------------------
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I really rarely use it. I think I opened it once. But it is an interesting app for those so minded.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This is a great summer read - very fast & loads of fun.  While the movies are good - so much more fun to be inside Lisbeth Salander's Head. This is a book you will read again and again.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Going to break the rules and talk about Fight Club a little. This has become a well established cult classic and I hope it never fades away.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|An amazing book, certainly the best James Clavell wrote.  An incredibly immersive saga of feudal Japan. I've never read an author that laid out a story arc of this scope - where everything happens for a reason - and in the final pages pulls all of the pieces together. A true masterpiece.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is one of the better values for the price. It easily sets up so that I can read while in bed or laying on the couch. I love it!
B003YHSE7W|4.0|It' a One disc movie, no extras. It arrived in two days, no problem. Quality. A10/V10, obviously, it's a br movie. Great movie, by the way, robert downey jr is awesome lol
0525953728|5.0|It's well-written and hard to put down once you start reading.  It's never a dull moment.  It will be one of the most treasured books in my bookcase.  I'm glad Marc Owen related the inside story of the raid to set history straight.  I agree with him 100% when he said that this story deserves to be told because it is the greatest manhunt in US military history.  There's no other credible story more than from the guys involved in the raid themselves.  Through this book, we have seen the inaccuracy of the story, however minor, presented by the media a few days after the raid.
B009P25TQE|5.0|Geat comback music amazing this artist has become in a short time the best of us amazing voice is a classic can wait for the next album he is amazing and talented is all in him
B003PBB4ME|5.0|i havnt bought this item beacuse i dont know if it works for i phones so i would like to know if it would work for iphones???
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is a great collection dvd shall always be the perfect love story and amazing cast this is a must
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Its Dec and I can only c 10 posts n then will not display anymore posts!  Whats up??  FIX THIS!
B007MLMJ18|5.0|Pablo Alborancame to be very popular with the cd with its own touch of flamenco beat a a great voice fill with talent that calls your soul with his great voice this popular cd is a must have
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I rate this a full 5 stars. Why? Because being a huge Alien fan, it's just required. I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to own the definitive collection of all the Alien movies on Blu-ray on such a low price of $20.  It has tons of extra features that will take days to watch and comes packaged in a very neat book-like box. I love this boxed set.<br /><br />Not to be missed.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|a movie that shall maintain u inrterested for ever for its great cast beautiful love story a must see and have for the ultimate movie collection wont be dissapointed
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter is still singing and the movie has been over for hours!! Great story and good vocals as well. The acting was really great in it which surprised me as the reviews were not all that great. I'm glad I made this purchase. I'm sure this will be a &#34;go to&#34; movie of ours for a long time.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This return of the apes is as spectacular as the rest but better a great comeback amazing cast great love story this is a must see wont be dissaPOINTED
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I fell asleep. Did not seethe end of the picturre.<br />However, I seemed excitin enough. I will try it again .
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very happy with the game--good storyline!  Had gotten the game as a free one, but liked the small initial part so much I bought the full version--very happy I did!
B008NB0SQO|3.0|Trust Disney to decide what's best for everyone.  They cut the Christmas past song \\"When Love is Gone\\" because they thought kids wouldn't like it.  I was going to replace my full-screen DVD version with this Blu-ray but after watching this version I'll keep my DVD.  It makes sense that Disney bought LucasArts. Now they can get together and cut huge holes out of my childhood.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Not as good as book one or three, but still great!  I'm really hoping book six will come out in fair time
0688156819|5.0|Very cute. I am more for the darker reads and this one did not disappoint. very cute indeed. would suggest.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|I have tried for 3 days to download this on my kindle fire with no luck. Other applications have downloaded without a problem. Very disappointed, I love Sonic!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Inventive and entertaining for both young and old. Explains a lot of unanswered questions about how Santa does it all.
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|I really enjoy this movie especially the point of view of Margareth Tatcher along the movie (it's the story by their eyes)
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Fans of Steve Carell and Russell Brand will be smiling from beginning to end in this film simply because of the talented voices of these two actors. Add that to a clever &#34;supervillian&#34; plot and the hard to describe (and hard not to love) minions....and you have a really entertaining film for all ages. This is one you can watch over and over again.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|came with no problems and worked perfectally well worth the buy if you havent seen this movie before. =) =)
B009H2PCNC|5.0|I have been listening to Brian Eno for a long time. If you like Music for Airports then this is also for you!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Gave this to my daughter today as a Christmas present and she tested it as per instruction and so far so good!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I loved this movie.  I had to buy it.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.  lots of great animation and a really interesting story!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Good movie!  Fun, entertaining, and family friendly.  We actually liked it better than MIB2, and would give it a score of 7 out of 10.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|The best way to learn history is from a master storyteller and this historian is an excellent one.  Facts flow together to knit a compelling and easy to understand narrative about a time in US history that most of us haven't learned.  Excellently written, well-researched and eminently readable!  An excellent book for a history lover or non-fiction lover who also loves to learn while reading for pleasure.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Good<br /><br />Love the series, incredible story. Love the characters especially Latinas!  She is my favorite, very good series of books!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Lots of fun. A little more challenge on a smaller screen. Don't care for looking with flashlight in dark rooms but other than that it is worth the effort.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Liked this movie.  It was well done and the actor who played Mark Zuckerberg nailed it.  Very interesting too about how Facebook became so popular.  People who are not up to speed on this sort of thing should find it fascinating.<br />Would very much recommend.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Good movie! very cute! Great deal for what I paid, and a good thing to watch on a rainy day.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Was not impressed with this one. Poor character development and humor not that funny. We liked the storyline and think they could have done a lot more with it. We were hoping for something like &#34;the incredibles&#34; but brave fell very short.
B000063UR2|5.0|love this movie, a classic rom when I was a kid. Got it on time and no issues with it.
B002PYW26Y|5.0|My only qualm is that I cannot download to my computer after purchase, I have to have a kindle. The movie is a bit campy but done well. It's a nice new twist on the old lost in space series as well as the novel swiss family robinson.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|This game is great to play with others, Facebook friends or random.  It's at a relaxed pace where you can play over several days or minutes.  If you're an impatient player you can start other games to occupy your time while waiting on other games. Only wish there was a single player mode where you could play against a computer, otherwise I'd have given this 5 stars. I really enjoy playing this game though. Lots of fun when played against family! =)
B001GUXJQA|4.0|And now (within 2 weeks) I'm finishing the fourth and will keep going to the end. Great character development through series and not-too-obvious mystery plots.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked it for the action and the slightest amount of romance. This is why I strongly recommend this book to future readers.
140053271X|5.0|Recipient love the Nook! I really liked the way the pages look on the Nook, VERY much like that of a paper book!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bunch of space for you camera gadgets and really inexpensive bag. I will give 5 stars for it and strongly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is pretty easy to learn, and it gets increasingly more challenging.  I play it on my kindle fire without any problems.  It's just different enough from the &#34;bridges&#34; flow free game to make it fun to have both.
B0061S073A|5.0|Works just as described. The kindle owner can choose which apps are displayed for use, and purchases are prohibited without the proper identification pin number.<br />Highly recommend this app for all users.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I was dubious as to whether a new Bourne character would equal a good Bourne movie but Jeremy Renner knocks it out of the park!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Great game and most of all...it's free. Just got a Kindle 8.9 Fire HD and getting to learn Amazon's site for downloads.  My daughter is going to love this game.
B004GYY714|5.0|Was going to put up another directional FM antenna this year, but no need with Tunein.  The choices are endless and free.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is amazing! Both the free version and the $0.99 version work wonderful. I think that everyone should buy this app. In the more expensive one you can wake up to any song that is in your playlist.
B0061S073A|5.0|This is perfect.  My son is only using apps I approve. I don't have to worry about in app purchases either  thank you
B008FWHGYS|2.0|Billed as an Anthony Hopkins movie but he's been religated to a minor character. At least I think he was. I'm not sure because I fell asleep.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a great story of faith and human indurance.  I would highly recommend this book.  I am looking forward to the movie.
1419705849|5.0|My 11 year old LOVES the series and this book was up to Jeff Kinney's standard on all the others.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun game great story line just to short as with most hidden object games.  cheap enough to buy though.  got my 74 year old mother playing it even
B004EKCNMA|4.0|It's a creative take on the classic original.  It's a perfect film for the family and great during the holidays.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I always have the trouble of knowing how a book is going to end after reading just the first few pages. Dashner kept me guessing till the last page of the final book, not even knowing if the main characters themselves were safe.  Origionality abounds in this book,  I have never seen a book with the same concept and probably never will. The characters are unforgettable and draw you in. This series has been excitedly added to my short list of favorite books.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas present.  Arrived very quickly, packaged well, looked great.  Everything shipped like it said and I was completely satisfied.<br /><br />As for the set, it's fantastic.  Has some hero characters, the new lego horses, and it's a pretty nice size for the price.  No complaints.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. I gave this five stars because you actually know what Katniss is thinking and it is very action packed and fast paced.
0802130208|5.0|It's a great book.  I'm super into it.  It's not for everyone but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to many people.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We rented this, but will have to buy it!  So much fun!  The music is awesome! I think we watched it 7 times!
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I did not like the drug scene as the main focus of the book this book was not as good as previous ones in the series the second half of the book is much better than the first
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Our kids, ages 2 years to 15 years, all loved this movie.  Great story, funny dialog, wonderful imagery and the accents are FANTASTIC!
1470157578|4.0|Voo-Doo Deadly is the 3rd in the Amber Fox series, and yet one more enjoyable read.  I have read several of Ms. Hodge's books, and she has never disappointed me yet.  Following Amber Fox through her love life and escapades, enables me to escape the day-to-day.
B00908DDZM|4.0|I am usually not a fan of rap, but I have found this body of work entertaining. I have listened to it a few times and am entertained. What more can I ask for?
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Tells the story from an insider perspective but is heavily edited by the US Intelligence services and military so therefore the real truth will never be revealed. It is better than the deductions made by the Journalist writers who have put together exaggerated stories from news reports but still not as good as it could have been.<br />In saying that I understand the need to guard the methods by which our military operate and agree with their need to do so.
B003ZJ0ZX0|3.0|Not as good as the last cd. He had a few f words I felt weren't necessary. Only some of the songs were good.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is very similar to Sim City. A big plus is that you can play without spending any extra money!
B009ZE27US|1.0|this was more than 10 years off on my age never got the correct age don't buy its a waste of time.
B007TUAHVQ|4.0|For kids fan of Halo this toy will fullfill theirs expectations. Look as the big ones but you have to assemble, adding more fun for them.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this is a GREAT app it is a very nice puzzle game and fun/addicting. I'd give it 4/5!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was so much fun; it had me (and my entire family) singing along... Rebel certainly deserves an award for her performance as Fat Amy/Patricia!!<br /><br />**The only negative is that Fat Amy's \\"Pirate Dance\\"---shown in the preview trailer---was NOT shown in the movie itself!
B005F3XV62|5.0|Purchased for a gift at Christmas.  The intended person has not received it as of yet.  After all it is Christmas morning.  Wow you people are quick
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was pretty good and I would recommend it for its funniness. bottom line it's a great book read it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I gave this movie for a Christmas gift. The recipient said that it was as good as the book is.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This starts rather slowly with a flashback to the LA Watts riots. Then it moves to the presesnt and becomes perhaps Connelly's most intriguing puzzles, with a plausible denoument.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book but you must read the other two books beginning with The Hunger Games  to truly enjoy Mockingjay.
030758836X|5.0|What did I learn by reading this book? Well, let me think a second or so? I've got it. Nick Dunne, to put is kindly, was a wuss and a bum who got a lot better than he deserved. Who could blame Amy for getting even? Not I.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|The only thing I didn't like is they didn't offer tracking for my order. Other then that I'm happy with my order.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I attended one of the first showings of the film in Oceanside, CA. While we were standing in line I asked twenty people at random what the movie was about. 17 out of 20 said it was about the French Revolution. Just for the fun of it I did the same thing as people left the theater. This time 14 out of 20 said it was about the French Revolution. One lady positively gushed about \\"How great the Bastille scene was!\\" So, great music, some fine and some not so fine performances, and a Big, Fat, F for audience education.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever!!! My 6 year old on downloaded the game and now I am addicted. We play against each other and it's fun!!!
B006X415GK|5.0|Who knew a black and white doll could be so pretty.  My daughter loves it! The detail is remarkable and she is different from any of the other monster high dolls we have.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|thank you world of goo, or 2d boy. its about time we get a good faotd. even if it is Christmas and we can expect junk tomorrow.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|I purchased this to refresh an aging VHS tape that we play every Christmas. My wife was extremely disappointed that the &#34;love is gone&#34; song/scene was removed. Yet the Blu-Ray quality and the extras were well done. The intermission entertainment was a nice addition.
0393088774|4.0|Paul Krugman knows exactly how to end the nation's economic problems, but sadly, this will never happen.  Expecting sensible actions out of Washington is impossible.
B00009EJC5|5.0|James Brown - In A Jungle Groove<br /><br />Did I mention that this is some seriously funky stuff? Extended versions of classic songs that never let up is what you will find here. This CD should come with a warning label that it could be hazardous to your health. The groove laid down here could stress your body in ways that just aren't natural. If you love James and don't have this one yet, what are you waiting for?? Serious Soul Power - essential to any soul collection.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Not the least bit sugar coated, this book is beautifully written and real.  How did someone suffering so manage to continue to write so eloquently?
B0045HCJGC|5.0|What can I say, Amazon always comes threw when it comes to the prices. The product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived. Not to mention this is a great game with good graphics.

B009SCRERI|5.0|My daughter loves anything fairy related so they could have animated snakes in a fairy costume and my daughter would love it.
B00005JPD0|5.0|What can I say... I haven't seen a Washington film that was bad. This movie has a great story line and great actors. Val Kilmer also added a great role to the movie.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Amazing stuff here! The king is back!<br />So many banging hits to be on your radio soon!<br />Great feat. artists such as Busta Rymes, Little Wayne and more
B00004RFFI|5.0|What can I say, Amazon always comes threw when it comes to the prices. The product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived. Not to mention this is a great film.
1423140605|4.0|I purchased it as a gift and it was a hit. I read a bit of it and Rick Riordan still captures your imagination.
B004SBX112|2.0|Finally got the season 3 Christmas update. You can only play 2 or 3 levels and it makes you wait an hour or more before you can go on. I want to play continuously, not wait an hour and a half or more
B000ZELISO|5.0|This is a great series for all people!  I now have this blu-ray to add to my collection!  Thank you!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Some of the scenes are a bit too small but it is a good game keeps my interest and that is not an easy task i have deleted many that just weren,'t interesting
B000P0J0EW|5.0|My husband loves this movie.  It's full of drama, action, and suspense.  The actors are great!!  Any guy would love this!
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|This movie would be best in 3D but still a fun movie for the holidays. My kids enjoyed it.  Ages 7 - 10
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I love this show!!  Thanks for sending it so quickly!  I will keep you in mind for the next season!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this app is awesome and I'm not much of a gamer so how do I get past level 3? I need help!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved to read such a creative idea.  It was well thought out and the story was woven into a great web of timelines.
B004PEJ1H0|4.0|Love this song...would have liked a bonus track instead of the instrumental version but it's still worth the purchase price as it is a charity record.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This film is hard to classify - it is essentially a heist/action movie at heart with some science fiction and film noir thrown in to keep things interesting (there's also a love story).  The special effects are astounding, the music is fantastic, and the pacing is excellent.  This movie also requires a level of concentration to keep track of what is happening that is missing in many films.<br />I would recommend it to anybody who likes to have his mind challenged.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This app would not load on my tablet. I tried three different times to load it, thinking it was my wi-fi connection that was preventing it from completely loading. Twice the app got to the 'installing' stage then I received the 'unable to load' message.
B000IZA9OE|5.0|The plot is ridiculously funny, the music and lyrics are great, and it cracks me up every time I watch it.  I love these four little foul-mouthed boys, and would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys satire.
B0000WPADK|5.0|I can't thank you enough for carrying train projects that make my husband smile. He said he's going to have fun putting this together.
B00AMS38YU|3.0|Not much to say. Everything about this was mediocre. If you do not have any other movie to watch, this passes the time. But you leave the movie wondering why you wasted it. Watch Man On a Ledge instead.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|The first of the Harry Hole series - but only just translated so I read it last. This book fills in some of the missing pieces referred to in the subsequent books. Another gripping and grisly Harry Hole book. One of the things I really liked about this book was that it took Harry Hole to a new setting - Sydney - a city I know and like. This is a very good read - a pity its probably the last HH book I will read as the series seems done and dusted with Harry's apparent demise.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|This book gave me some self respect. I am a profound introvert and always felt to be strange but this book suggested that I am not all too bad.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Awesome show keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great writing and cast. This show is another huge hit by the USA network. I hope this show goes for a long track record on the season counter. Keep it up USA you've got a home run with Suits.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|It's like a comic book come to life. Totally unrealistic view of the gang lifestyle, but fun to watch anyway. Very stylized account of a gang trying to get home after a shooting of a high ranking gang leader at a mass gathering in New York far from their Jersey territory and the blame erroneously put on them. Great music soundtrack with some very memorable characters.
B001706I5I|5.0|Jim Carrey is amazing, and we see something new every year we watch this!  The whole family, especially someone in a bad mood, could watch this and be happy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought book hope to finish and share with friends soon. Hope the movie is as good as the book is
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie! Jennifer Lawrence is wounderful as Katniss Everdeen. I'm looking forward to seeing the next movie when it comes out.
B008XCM18Q|3.0|Having seen the movie starring Matt Damon, I was surprised by how vastly different than the film this book was. It was a good, not great, read. Parts of it were quite tedious and/or confusing. I also found the romantic storyline implausible. I doubt I'll be seeking out other books from the Bourne series.
B00337KM2S|5.0|What a great movie. Who doesn't love George Clooney.  Anna Kendrick is an up and coming  movie star.  I'm a huge fan of both!
1419705849|5.0|My teenage grandson still reads ALL of the Wimpy Kid books which makes them an easy and great gift idea for me.  I'm so glad they still want to read books in spite of all the technology out there!
0887081770|5.0|The children I watch love to look for the moon at night. This book is a favorite at bed or nap time! I love this book as much as the children do!
B009M8E3K4|5.0|I loved this documentary.  Not only is Neil Young a talented musician but he is a beautiful person.  I loved watching him return to his hometown.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Pretty Little Liars the books and the Tv series! I'm always on my toes and don't know whats going to happen next! It's my new favorite show for fashion since Gossip Girl has ended it's series!
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|I found out about this album when I was in Spain (Oct 2011). Waited till I got home to purchase it, & I love it. Excellent cross between genres & incredible talented artist.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Pros:<br />Minimalistic design -- doesn't need a lot of shelf space<br />Comes with a considerable amount of extras/bonus footage in each CD<br />PRICE.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some of the extras, especially in the earlier movies, are not in HD.<br /><br />I think most of the negative reviews here are people expecting that this product will be something that it never was intended to be. Yes, it is a collection of the movies all in one package. Yes, you would've gotten the same product if you had bought it all separately. But, that's the point -- you get all of it in a minimalistic design and doesn't break the bank. No, you're not getting the ultra-special extras or any other bonus materials.<br /><br />Also, there's a misconception that this set only has the movies, nothing else. This is simply untrue. The original discs themselves come with chock full of extras--Goblet of Fire alone has 1hr+ of bonus content on disc!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great way to please yourself and/or the HP fan in your family, this is the go-to gift. You can also opt to wait or go for the real 'collector's sets' if you're a hardcore fan.
B005JZ18IY|5.0|I love Ed and I was upset I couldn't buy the deluxe edition of '+' in America. ):<br />So naturally I went straight to Amazon to purchase it, knowing that they'd have it!<br /><br />Great bonus tracks and great album overall.<br />Ed Sheeran is a brilliant artist and a top lad so buy his album.<br />Okay? Okay.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game soo much I wish they had it when I was younger but they probably had I just didn't look this is a great game.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Awesome Thu was. A true difficulty to read on Christmas day, but I go throughout the whole stinking stupidest book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Ease of playing game on the Kindle Fire - touch the card and it flies over to the corresponding card.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Just saw a Christmas Eve showing of the movie.  I loved it!  I went online to see if Amazon had the soundtrack.  I was a little surprised to read some of the negative comments. You need to see the movie so you can appreciate how  and why the movie's versions of the songs are different.  I plan on buying this so that I can play the scenes over in my mind.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|First of all the movie was amazing!!!! Loved banes dialog!!!! I watched the whole movie three times!!!<br /><br />The amazon service was AMAZING!!!! No skipping or stuttering fast forwarding was awesome!!! If or the price and 48 hours I will be renting through amazon from now on!!! I can watch on my iPhone iPad or my Blu-ray player!!! Amazon you sold me, I think they need better advertising!!! I am definitely saying goodbye to redbox and iTunes. Netflix selection sucks got rid of them a long long time ago!<br /><br />Love renting from amazon!!!
B007BT0RKG|2.0|Without a search option the lite version is just a map to look at.  You have to know where you are going.  That can be helpful though in some circumstances.  The map showed my position as being about a mile away from where I am.  They claim the paid version is better and includes a search option.  I tthink I will go with mapquest, but I will keep the lite version to make sure I can see a map while I am offline.
B00846F1YW|3.0|great game with one exception... exception is I can not get past chapter 13 as others have stated. hoping this review will allow access.
1449410243|3.0|This book is okay but not as funny (in my opinion) as Bad Cat by Jim Edgar.  It's an easy read though, you can open it up to any part and start reading.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Its was everythimg i expected it was blue it was ray it was in sealed package it came quickly nothing was broke i really enjoy rhe moving bought it ar a good price
030759565X|5.0|This book is full of yummy food!  Much like her website, the recipes are easy and I haven't had one turn out badly yet. The S'mores cake is to die for - I've already made it twice. Perhaps the best bit of the book is that Deb Perlman's sense of humour is present in the directions of each recipe. I laughed out loud more than a few times.  Her cute son is also peppered throughout the book. In short - I love The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook.
B004LSJCJM|3.0|i was expecting a little more,over all not bad cd.couple of songs are really good.music kind of sounds all the same after a while.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only the first few load in the newsfeed and then it just stops.  This is obviously a known problem.  Please fix.  If you download the updated version from a 3rd party app store then it will work fine.
0783225547|5.0|This is one of our favourite movies of all time. Since we recently got to visit Mt. St. Helens and learn about the real disaster that inspired parts of this movie, we are more impressed with the accuracy of the effects in this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very challenging yet simple game that is fun to try to beat.  You simply have to jump and turn your way through the course to outrun the monkeys.  Not too deep but a great way to occupy time when you're waiting in line somewhere.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|everything is great.  We just loved this product and especially love the kindle, and how it works.  thanks again for everything
B00114RKT8|5.0|This movie was excellent.<br /><br />It was thoughtfully made, and the acting was skillful.  It powerfully described the evils of slavery --- without Hollywood's normal graphic emphasis on violence.<br /><br />The one missing dimension in this movie (which would not be &#34;politically correct&#34; for Hollywood to include) was a description of William Wilberforce's deep love for the Holy Scriptures (the Bible) --- which impelled him to strive to abolish slavery as a Christian duty.<br /><br />His intense study of the Bible (and resulting self-examination) was too huge a part of his life to omit (reference his magnum opus &#34;A Practical View of Christianity&#34;, which was published in 1797).
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Would give it 2 1/2 if that was allowed. It had it's moments, but they were too far between.  Mostly it was just silly and the characters weren't particularly likable.
B008DL466C|5.0|I believe the real reason why a lot of the reviews are bad is simply because some fans expect him to be more lyrical, they feel there is no real substance in what he is saying. Wiz has never ever been a very lyrical rapper; his true fans know his strength is in his beat selection, his flow on the track and the fact that when he sings on a hook it actually sounds decent, His beat selection is a large part of that. Wiz is exactly in tune with what his real fans like. The beat selection on this album has been the best so far in his entire career. His flow goes good on the beats and the hooks are good. To me this is by far his best album. If you like Kush and Orange Juice how can you hate this. I'm even a little surprised myself this was so good. The beats are way better the hooks are just as good. Most people just hating cause he mainstream now.
0060254920|4.0|The pictures are great and so is the story. Who can't relate to this story? Happy bedtime and turn off the lights.
B006H5120E|4.0|This was a great movie to view in 3D, Blu-ray. A friend who watched the movie with me said, &#34;When the Titanic sinks, you get wet.&#34; All the details of the movie are so clear, in beautiful color. It is a thrilling experience (if BEING on a sinking ship can be described as such).
0151003084|4.0|Kids seem to enjoy having this book read to them and it isn't the sugary, sweetness of so many books. Just lots of fun.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Thank you Amazon for putting this out there for us to purchase. I was waiting and waiting some more for a good fps to buy. I hope you keep releasing more like this. Great game, I am hooked!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|It was a Christmas present plus it's a great show! So ya it worked out just fine! Loved it! Ya
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Worst of the series. Same old same old, no real plot development. With I didn't spend h three dollars to watch it.
B00164GDA0|5.0|I've loved this mover since it first came out and the song was the first dance we had as a married couple.  I can watch this movie over and over.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A  good read but not spectacular. No doubt some of this translates in to real life, but there are better books out there.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I bought a set of these for my husband and ended up buying another set for my son when he moved out of the house.  Great movies and our whole family enjoys them.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Everything is wonderful, but a little hard to setup and not very clear directions. I figured it out but a little frustrating at first.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Works Awesomely awesome, Now I am going to make my Nexus 4 a gaming console. I haven't noticed any disadvantages
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises does what few trilogies can, it ends things on a high note. The conclusion is epic and extremely satisfying for fans of the comics or just fans of films. Bane is a fantastic villain and Tom Hardy kills it in this role. Anne Hathaway makes a wonderful Catwoman. The returning cast are all fantastic as well and while the plot of the film has its minor problems, it is ultimately a great send off to one of the best trilogies ever.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was the same price as a big store that couldn't keep them in stock. Was glad to get it quickly and with free shipping.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A family tradition! My family and I watch this EVERY YEAR, a must for the collection! Classic humor, good fun for the holidays!
B008J34466|5.0|Ordered these as a gift for my wife. She loves Pink and this was a good deal for the actual disc.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|The product was priced right, it works, and is great for my baby nephew to look at. I would purchase this.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Ordered these as a gift for my wife. She loves Pink and this was a good deal for the actual disc.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|What a great game- got this the day it came out.  I hadn't played an Angry Birds game in a while, but the new mechanics of this one with the new bird moves (along with things from Angry Birds: Space) worked really nicely.  If you like other Angry Birds games, give this one a try.  The ad-supported one is FREE, after all, so what do you have to lose???
B0052GACNM|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother in law. She enjoys it. That is all that matters. The end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great little puzzle game to help kill time.  I can pick it up and play it when I'm going to bed, or when I'm just waiting to meet someone in public.  Simple to learn, difficult to master with bigger boards.  And plus, it's free, so why not give it a try?  You might like it!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This movie really should have been made first. It does explain a lot to those of us who don't read graphic novels.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|That's two hours of my life I will never get back! Do not make the same mistake I did and avoid this movie.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|One of Quentin's best movie's since Pulp Fiction. A must see to see the fictional humor in the darkness that was the reality of WWII.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good but short.  Wish it was a bit longer.  Not really free.<br />Story was rather interesting. Lots of different mini games.
B0056369RO|4.0|Fun catchy pop music. Don't take the lyrics too seriously, and just enjoy the music. Don't try this at home should come on this disc.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Well worth watching it's a great story line and great ending. !! Very intense and great fight scenes.  I especially love the Pittsburgh references there is some tuff and smart people that come out of that little town.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|There is a reason why this group has won award after award. Their harmony is some of the best I've heard in the last twenty years. What are you waiting for? Buy this one.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Gave this for a Christmas gift.  We already own and have watched it more times than can remember.  Great show.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was a good deal, and it is Region 1 too. Not one of those region free sets that are found all over the web.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Parents beware lots of F*** this and F*** that. Lots of dope smoking, bongs and drugs. Lots of sexual moments. Not giving my opinion or not rather I let my teens watch this, just preparing you. That said, there are some extremely funny parts and even a little love story mixed in.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Very talented lady. She is the current generations ultimate performer. She knows how to get noticed, and she stands up for the defenseless.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ive read all three books and I thought it got better as the stories went along.  not what I thought it was going to be the way every one was talking but i like the books
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Ordered these as a gift for my wife. She loves Pink and this was a good deal for the actual disc.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|Great lyrics, great tempo...a powerhouse! Carrie has done it again...don't miss this album! Blown Away is a great and showcases her incredible and natural talents!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|If you don't watch Sons, you should. If you do watch Sons, you should buy it. It's as simple as that.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This movie is amazing! Great fun. I specifically didn't read any summaries about this because I wanted the plot to be a surprise. I highly recommend doing the same. Great movie!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I needed the season, so I bought it. Of course it is awesome. Of course i would recommend it. Always.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The book is very insightful and follows a guideline that most people should think of as gospel.  Tim keeps a typically boring topic exciting and motivating.  I wish Tim would create a meta-learning book all by itself but this was a great start to how he cracks all of his en devours.  I have already recommended the book to several friends and had people flag me down in public while reading it to let me know they are part of the Tim Ferriss tribe too. Can we look forward to a more in-depth meta learning post on your blog now that the book has been released?
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works well on my Kindle. I like the way that it looks. I like how smooth it runs. Good app.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|what can I say about a cable, its a beautiful necessary item, it keeps my Kindle Fire fired up for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|But I like the application even more than I like the site. It is set up a little strangely, but fun nonetheless.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|with what's his name?  More action, better plot and fantastic realism, in building and creating the future.  Much better than the lame original starring what's his name?  The female antagonist really kicked butt and was evil to the end.  I was a little disappointed to see her die, with a wimp and not a bang.  Good acting and lots of stunts.  ********* stars.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I was impressed with this movie. I love the relationships. I love the twists. I would watch the movie constantly, given the opportunity.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I like this one also lot of excitement another good show what I dont like is you guys telling me how many words I have to put down
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So it is no different on my Kindle. I like having the entire trilogy, I think if it looked nicer, that would be even better.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|great show love the big mo cause my brother was on it and is a plank owner and thats is something to be proud of
0740748475|5.0|Warning this is REALLY REALLY heavy! We nearly broke ourselves picking it up, but it was a really awesome present for a Calvin and Hobbes Fan!
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Modern day love story, where meeting someone online does not always turn out like you want.  Nev is enduring, patient and kind.  It will leave you wanting more.  That is why I am addicted to the Catfish show.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just added this app and like previous reviewers it only loads about 10 posts. Pretty ridiculous mistake for an app of this popularity. Simply put, fix this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This games cracks me up.  The birds make noised that are funny and it's fun to play.  I wouldn't trade it..
0307887448|5.0|Great novel! Ready Player One is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi debut from Austin resident, Ernest Cline. Do not read too many reviews--just pick it up and read it.
1863514260|5.0|I bought this book because it was Trish Burr and was very pleased to find all the information in it.  The color arrangements are many and wonderful to prefer to when starting a design.  I took it to the Adult Center and the people that paint found it very useful and also bought it.  I also love her birds and flowers that are in it.
B002G01EPC|5.0|Full of amazing detail, goes well with goku and friends, great poses,and stunning quality, the figure is just epic all day!!!!!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Good read for everyone that wants start a company.<br />The Canvas Model is simple and the software to develop is good.<br />Ash Maurya has experience to write this book,
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Good movie , not for kids 12 and above is ok .<br />Enjoy with your whole family , Musical/ drama
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It opened up and answered a lot of questions for me. As I have read other book on this subject before. This book was different but the general theme as the others I have read.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Not as good as expected but still entertaining. Tommy Lee Jones excellent. Sensitive subjects but handled very nicely. Enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing!! I love Suzanne Collins!  I suggest every one read this! You'll love it too! It's also a tear jerker!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Very hard, but it works! The videos are longer than 20 minutes each. They are about 30 minutes each with the warm-up and cooldown.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I love ot but a little low on the mini games in fact I would not even count them as mini games
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I thought this was gonna be Horrible book... BUT NO!!!<br />It Was simply......amazinggg!!!<br />i mean it went into a lot of detail.....READ IT!!!!!

B009DT98RK|5.0|I saw Peter in concert back in August, so this was a great way to capture the memory of that show. I think Peter Frampton is one of the best guitarists around and this band is 5 guys just rocking the place for 2+ hours. I would give this DVD a 10 star rating if I could. One thing that I especially appreciate is the video editing and production. As a guitarist, I want to see the licks and chords. Many concert videos show more face shots and crowd shots. This DVD have a great balance of all angles. Great job! I own both the DVD and BluRay versions. The BluRay clarity is stunning. It's like you are on stage with the band.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I just beat it, it's a bummer cause now I have to download all g5 s games ;) keep the good games Rollin' in producers!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read! Very inspirational. Makes you want to be a better person!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The only reason I gave it that rating is because it wasn't giving a lot of information on the definition words .I like it because it explained the root word and logical.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|cool game, but need more energy or shorter amount of time to rebuild energy level. love it other than that.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think this is good for people who need some help with words. I definitly am not trying to sound mean.
1451627289|5.0|This book is at the top of my list.  I loved it.  I have even bought it and given it to friends for gifts.  Not a typical Stephen King book.  Well worth the time to read it (it is pretty large).  I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book should be required reading for every man, woman & child in not only the U.S., but the immediate world.  The writing is clear and the message is direct and to the point.  It's all there ... the science, the research and the results.  I use it as a reference and suggest others do the same.
0307959856|3.0|Was really looking forward to reading it because I love both authors, but for me, the combination just didn't work. PDJ just strained to much to fit with Jane. Maybe if I had never read Jane....
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl is a great ride - impossible to put down. There are surprises from beginning to end. Loved it!
1402238843|5.0|Have read GH at least a dozen times; my paperbacks are tattered and torn; this edition is really really nice.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game itself is easy to use , realistic and pretty basic. The ads are ready to get out of. Though some are loud.
B000088E6D|4.0|The ,musics are OK, but CD is too expensive, specially if compared with others such as Barbra Streisned, Rod Stwart, etc.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|These two make a perfect team. If you want good old English humor, confusion, and hilarity you need to watch this.<br />A long time fan of this show I finally bought the DVD's and am loving it.<br />Recommended for everyone who likes comedy.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Compelling from beginning to end.  It reminds us of how much we have grown as a nation, even if we still have a long way to go.
0345803493|5.0|Hmmm what can I say? I was motivated after reading fifty shades of grey and absolutely loved this. This second novel really answered a lot of the questions that the first left.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It's FREE on Christmas. Bout it 8 still with the 5 bucks. If you want it to be free, buy it on Christmas morning. SOOOOOOO FUN!!!!!
0345803507|5.0|I just had to get the other two after reading the first novel. This novel is full of twists and unexpected turns.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I gave this three stars because my parents wont let me buy it. I WOULD GIVE IT A MILLION STARS IF THIS WAS THE FREE APP OF ANY DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That would be. pur--fect
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Its a good book I really like all the mixed emotions there katniss has to deal with about peeta mellark.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|tThe novel was entertaining.  The plot was kind of slow.  The characterization was superficial - I would have liked more in dpth.  I'd give another in the series a try...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use and follow... I needed a bible and couldn't find one anywhere so downloaded this app and I really love this app plus its free
B005LAIISA|4.0|This Ice Age movie really is a far stretch from the others and doesn't keep much to any original theme or plot. But overall, it a good addition to the Ice Age franchise and kept my five year old son entertained for hours and that in itself is enough to get me recommending it to my friends.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Works great on the kindle like on the smartphone, so I can't complain. App does what it is suppose to.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|first off &quot;Plague 2&quot; by &quot;Rose&quot; is NOT a &quot;plague inc 2&quot;, and it sucks. Second, this is better than &quot;Epidemic&quot; which it pretty good to start with. I highly recommend it.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|It's great to read the classic story that I've seen so many times in film. Dickens is a great writer, and this story is a page turner (even if you already know what's going to happen).
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It has kept my kindle safe, and for the price it should have. I do not really like the flap to keep it up because it does not feel so strong when you are typing on the kindle, but apart from this its a great product.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I've been following [...] for some time now, but I never really understood the methodology of it until now. The book is straightforward with no BS. It gives practical advice and a proven system that works.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fast paced! it reminds me of video games from the 80's!  it is a lot of fun!  the graphics are pretty impressive!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this case and it had bubbles on the screen and when you talk on the phone everyone I talked to said I was echoing so I called the company. They looked up the serial number and this is a counterfeit lifeproof case. Don't buy it. Spend 15 more dollars and get the real thing from the company. I bought a REAL lifeproof case from lifeproof and I love it. This isn't even a good knock off
B005DI994W|4.0|I was not impressed with the movie being converted to Blu-ray.  There were parts of the movie that lacked color.  I kept it in my collection only because I lost the one I purchased in DVD.  Overall it's an excellent movie and one I plan to keep in my collection.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great history the era and the role of social class.  The book illustrates the changing role of the social classes, and how their lives are intertwined.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|An amazing book that draws you in with such subtle ease. Not my typical type of book but still wonderful.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Clever plot and story telling technique.  It is  a different  approach in a novel  to dealing with murder.  It really delves into the minds of and motives of the characters.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|…excellent story.  Never put it down. Worth more than Amazons .99 cents!!  Anxiously awaiting the next book from Mr. Weir
B006O3MU96|5.0|This is a great game for kids and adults. I could spend all day playing this game, honestly! I would recommend this to any Amazon customer looking to install a great game for anyone in their family. You will have a lot of fun playing this, I promise.
B000001GQB|2.0|Most of us are slaves \\"in Pharoah's Army\\". An occupation is not a vocation, however lucrative it might be.  Consequently we rot. Is it not the root cause of Thoreau's maxim that \\"most men live lives of quiet desperation\\"? Even at our Walter Mitty best, we would not dream of surveying Mozart's Symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic. And yet one wonders whether Uncle Karl Bohm, feted as he was, went to the grave as unfulfilled as any Joe Dirt. Could one suggest that he partially missed the train, vocation-wise? If destiny had been kinder, he would have been a funeral director or a latter-day Charon on the shores of the Dead Sea, ferrying tourists to the other shore?<br /><br />Evidence is readily at hand: his Mozart cycle from the Sixties. It certainly has its merits (K 22, K 110, K 129, K 132, K 134, K 181, K 338) but much of it sounds funereal - and it takes  a special sort of talent to drain the innate vitality from the Berlin Philharmonic (Giulini replicated this herculean feat in [[ASIN:B0000027JI Mozart: Symphonies Nos. 40, & 41 - Jupiter]]).<br /><br />Uncle Karl's testudinal treatment of the finale of K 183 is almost the worst conducting known to me - and in making this statement, I am fully aware of the horror that is entombed in [[ASIN:B000001G5A Mozart: Requiem]]. To be dead beyond death.<br /><br />This compilation of Mozart's last six symphonies has been around since mid-1995. It is emblematic of the wider cycle. The Haffner is defunct. The Prague - sounding ever so ordinary - is afflicted with Rigor Mortis. Not even Resurrection Day will summon this G Minor from the grave. There is some sort of pulse to the Linz Symphony even if it is fitful.  That leaves the great E Flat and the Jupiter as the sole reasons for purchasing this set unless one has a taste for the macabre.<br /><br />K 543 was recorded in the same month - February 1966 - as Uncle Karl's K 297b with the Berlin Philharmonic (and the latter is arguably his best-ever recording).  The great form (in E Flat Major) continues: this is warmhearted and wise music-making. It is an invitation to luxuriate in both the breadth of Mozart's vision and the opulence of a great orchestra at its zenith.<br /><br />The Jupiter likewise commands respect: it is spring-heeled and dramatic. Repeats are few but their omission is a blessing. The Berlin Philharmonic red-lines itself in the finale where Mozart invokes the Music of the Spheres. And yet this is not its first manifestation to the market, CD-wise. DG originally released this cycle in the late 1980s in the famous sea-green box with minimal documentation (being rarer than hen's teeth, it is not listed on Amazon). K 551 sounded ever so punchy in this earlier issue. In attempting to add more ambiance to the baseline, the Original Image Bit Processing fatally undermined its pungency.  Track down a copy of the older issue; they are readily available.<br /><br />It comes down to this: do you want to abet Uncle Karl's subliminal urge to be a mortician or would you rather listen to a Mozart who is vibrantly alive?m (in E Flat Major) continues: this is warmhearted and wise music-making.

B009CPJHY4|2.0|The cast looked strong, but the script was weak and the laughs were cheap. Don't waste your time with this one.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Love the special effects, but I love the character interaction. If nothing else, the cast is a great combination of actors.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|There is a love story thrown in there but is worth sitting through just to catch all of the funny dialogue.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|The kids loved this movie! Funny and teaches a very good lesson too. I have it to them as a gift and they don't get tired if watching it.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|More from middle earth, is just what I have been waiting for.  A nice mix of LOTR and Hobbit, takes you back to the movies and away.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The container left a lot to be desired so I am getting a folder for the discs so they don't get scratched getting them in and out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has knocked my socks off. I have been absolutely blown away. Never expected what is going on in this season. The utter surprises took me completely off guard. I never thought I would be such a huge fan of a zombie show but this one has an awesome story line and is jam packed with action, suspense (like none other), and guts!<br />Just when you think you know what's next the writer's spin you in a totally different direction... Wow! This is truly great writing as well as acting. Big props to the writers!
B001NAT05W|4.0|The Looney Tunes quality action sequences really undermine what is otherwise a fun and entertaining story. The actors are great in their parts, with Hallie, Sharon and Ben each doing a great job. There is only so much you can do to create an engrossing and believable superhero story when the action sequences are each so shockingly badly done. Imagine a Sat. morning cartoon, only without the bright colors. They really make catwoman look like wiley coyote racing around. Each cut to a scene like that snaps the viewer out of the story, so that you become a critic instead of a passenger on the ride.<br /><br />Even with that I found it enjoyable to watch, but I really hope that cgi team goes back to film school before they work on another film. They beat this one up pretty bad, though fortunately weren't quite able to slaughter it.
1451613512|3.0|I can't nitpick most of the facts that Stone mentions on the series. But it becomes obvious that the facts have been cherry-picked. To Stones credit, he does cite facts that could detract from his assertions, but he mentions these is passing. So if you listen carefully, you will realize that the real Cambodian genocide came after the Khmers Rouges victory and far surpassed what had gone on before. What I do find nagging are his little bits of obiter dicta fired off in passing. He refers to Laos as \\"little Laos\\", a country that if an American state, would be the 12th largest state in the Union, between Michigan and Minnesota. So, geography is not one of his subjects. Regarding Chile, he makes an issue of CIA interference in the anti-Allende coup. Viewers will not have any idea of just how large Chile's economy was, how much the CIA really invested in fomenting the coup, nor even any realistic idea as to why Chileans would have been so split that a coup became probable. We are left to imagine an army of CIA agents running around Chile giving orders to Chilean stooges who mindlessly carried out the will of these foreigners. Hardly accurate. Missing is any hint that Allende and his policies may have been the reason that Chileans on the right were willing to support the coup.<br /><br />In short, it's targeted to those who like their history in sound bites.
B002XISFHM|5.0|Star Trek fans just know.  Blu ray gives the film detail and makes the starships look real.  Any Star Trek is good
B009VB97EY|4.0|Good movie, the dance movies were good the music was good the acting was good, I would watch it again.
B005LAII1C|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. This movie isn't even funny and its full of cussing. Like every other word.
B00867GKIK|5.0|Up is the best! Bought it as a gift who loves the movie and he was thrilled to see it in 3D
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I'll be honest, I only rented this movie for Michelle and MIla and I did get my money's worth there. Other than that, this movie goes nowhere. It's definitely better than the last Resident Evil but no where near the first. None of them have even remotely compared to the first (and I've seen them all!)<br /><br />So, if you're a Mila and Michelle fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're a fan of good movies, you will be.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Did not get to watch the movie so did not have any biases about the book. Engaging story line,a heroine we can root for and the capacity of man to love and  sacrifice as well as cruelty and apathy.

B005LAIIKI|2.0|Went to see the movie this morning. Ruined my Christmas. Should've seen Les Miserable instead. Quentin Tarrantino likes to say he's a genius, but he has yet to show it in my opinion. It's like if you took the Man with no name from the Dollars trilogy and combined him with Shaft, you get Django. A somewhat dragging, overtly racist, overly gorrish B-movie that's about 40 years past it's prime. I don't see how Quentin thinks this'll win him an oscar for best pic. Spike Lee was right. Using the history of American Slavery to produce an action/spaghetti western is of poor taste. The results are even more poor. There were way too many laugh out loud moments for such a serious subject. Skip it. Maybe get it as a rental from the Redbox, unless you own a Sergio Leone movie, then you wont see anything new. Except over use of gore. Tarrantino needs to get with the times.<br /><br />My grievances with the film: (Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />1. The film is supposed to be set in the South yet it begins with a slave chain gang moving through an arid, rocky desert. Later, we learn this desert is supposed to be somewhere between east Texas and Mississippi, where Django was sold. I don't know of any desert between Texas and Mississippi. It's obvious Tarrantino only made this shot as that's how every spaghetti western starts, even though it's geographically and historically inaccurate.<br />2. Why does Dr. Schultz pay for Django after killing one of the slave traders and injuring the other, then he basically frees all the others by giving them the key to their shackles, a gun, and leaving them with the injured slave trader, who they quickly kill? It's nonsensical.<br />3. Why would Schultz let Django dress like a 1700's French nobleman when they go to the Tennessee Plantation? It would blow their cover immediately as the whole thing would be ludicrous. No free man would dress like that.<br />4. Why the comedic scene of the Klan members meeting before their attempted lynching? There's nothing funny about a bunch of racist morons arguing about attire before they try to go and lynch someone.  Lynching is not a funny subject.<br />5. Why does Schultz, who has no problem with killing people right in front of their loved ones, have an issue with torture and slavery? Even Django asks him this question in the movie, but he never gives an actual answer.<br />6. Why don't they just pay to buy Django's wife for \\"the insane price of $12,000\\"? They concoct an elaborate plan to get her for cheap, but in the end, pay the insane amount for her. It would have saved lots of time and from the look of the amount of money Schultz had, it wasn't that much too him anyway. Who would be frugal about rescuing their wife?<br />7. When things go bad and Schultz kills Candie, why in the world would he, a professional killer, take the time to apologize to Django when he could've killed Candie's guard too? This would've cut the last unnecessary thirty minutes of the movie. Schultz could still die in the shootout, but why right before it begins? I know this would've cut Tarrantino's unnecessary cameo, but it could've ended the movie faster and better.  And why was the guard played by the same actor who played the slave trader who died at the beginning of the movie?<br />8. The actual ending was overkill. I know Tarrantino wants to rival the original Django film for violence, but blowing up the mansion? Burning it down would've been more affective and historically accurate.  Then the horse tricks Django does were just cheesy. And what's with Hilda's weird clapping? First she seems strong for a woman who's gone through all the things she has, then she's clapping like she has the mentality of a five year old at the end. Not very consistent.<br /><br />I felt like Shcultz watching the dogs rip up d'Artagnan as I was watching this film. Even worse when people were laughing at it. No wonder Will Smith passed up this movie. You never really came to like/love any of the \\"good\\" guys, butyou really came to hate DiCaprio's and especially Samuel L. Jackson's characters. What kind of movie is it where you don't really care for what happens to the protagonists, but all you care for is that the main antagonists die? That's all that I can say. Jackson stole this movie like Kevin Bacon did in Sleepers and the last Xmen movie. If this movie gets any Oscar noms, which is unlikely, the only deserved one would be Jackson's supporting acting.

B000MLNUBI|5.0|Although the box arrived with broken hinges, the watch is great and wearing on and off frequently. Do take note that both the front and back crystal is acrylic and not mineral as stated. The bracelet is not solid steel so the weight is lighter then one with solid steel links.<br /><br />Overall watch working as intended. Item arrive on time. Other than the plastic box hinges broke, i'm happy with the watch.

B007N8RULO|5.0|A very commendable version of this popular game. I like the tap approach to move cards which is easier than slide.
1426209584|5.0|You'll want to savor this book. Sure give it a quick go through to utterly overload your eyes but then go back and give this book the slow treatment. Astounding photos with insightful text make this coffee table book a rare find. Having worked in the canopy of the Peruvian rainforest photographing birds at 100 feet, I fully understand some of the pain, discomfort, tedium, sweat and other tropical slings and arrows Tim Laman suffered to bring home these images. The knowledge and field savvy that Laman and Edwin Scholes employed is beyond compare. And to those critics that say the colors are overblown by the printer, consider that over-the-top colorful birds in the warm light of dawn and dusk can make for some amazing colors that non-photographers (or mid-day photographers) just won't understand. This is a landmark body of work.
B000Q3ECHS|5.0|This is the 1938 printing of the story with illustrations by Everett Shinn.  If you get some modern version of this story, yes it will have all the words.... but often they will have no illustrations.  I believe there is something magical about having a beautiful picture to look at every once in a while while reading a story.  This is especially true for children, but even as an adult, I enjoy a picture every once in a while.  This copy is un-abridged and is  130 pages long.  It has 30 nice small b&w line-drawings and ALSO about 14 full page COLOR &#34;paintings&#34; of many of the famous scenes in the book.  This means, as you read, you see a picture every 2 or 3 pages!  The book is 9 1/4 inches tall , 7 1/4 inches wide, and about 3/4 inches thick, hardback. If you don't have a copy of this on your shelf, i think this is a very good choice.
0805047905|5.0|I got this book for my son when he was almost 7 months old, and he loved it.  He still loves it at 10 months, but he has a lot of books and the favorites change every once in a while.  This one is one of my favorites because I like to make the animal sounds as my son turns the pages for me.  The sounds make him smile, and seeing him smile makes me melt.  His favorite page is the one with the children on it; he’ll turn all the pages until he gets to that one, and then he’ll stop.  This was a great purchase!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|amazon gave me this bag as a promotional item.  It was one of two styles to pick from.  It's a very nice bag, but it has a lot of holding capacity...more capacity than I have equipment.  Maybe I'll grow into it some day, but right now, it's too much space.  If you own lots of gadgets and lenses, the compartments are adjustable and items can be strapped in for extra security.

Especially good if you teach school with students who are overly confident with their abilities.  The Perplexus makes them think and really will rack their brains.

B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie.  It was a big unrealistic but since it was based on a true story but also legend it worked.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Misérables is one of my all time favorite plays and this was an excellent addiction to my collection of Les Mis concert DVDs.This is by far my favorite performance. The cast was phenomenal. It was excellent to Lea Salonga again as Fantine after her role as Eponine in the 10th anniversary.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing fiction. Sucks you in and provokes emotions. You love and hate the characters as if you know them personally

B001706I5I|4.0|My family watches this every Christmas. Adults can enjoy this as well as young children. However, some very young children may be scared by the grinch. Played by Jim Carey, the Grinch is so believable it's hard to tell there's man under all that makeup. The story provides a good holiday lesson. I would do 5 stars, but I did notice a curse word by the Grinch at the end of the movie. It is not a huge deal to me and it is barely noticeable, but I think a family holiday movie should leave those out entirely.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Just looking at Kate made every minute of the movie worth watching, everything else is a bonus, let's not forget Jessica Biel.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I think I must be bewitched, hypnotised, or under the PLAY'S power, because I cannot get enough!  I have since seen the musical performance 4 times, 1 on Broadway, and 3 at home.  I have read the book, and even saw the non-musical movie with Liam Neeson.  Can you tell I'm a fan?<br /><br />The music eclipses me.  Now that I've seen it so many times, the music is quite familiar to me, and still sends chills up and down by spine.  &#34;The Blood of Angry Men&#34; is quite my favorite.  Looking forward to attending this movie, when the theatre isn't stuffed with people, and on my own DVD!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This is THE book to read if you are getting started on DSLR, Bryan explains everything in the most simple way possible.<br /><br />Great book.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, thank me later.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Thank you Amazon for making my first Christmas present of the day a great one! This awesome looking $5 game totally makes up for the crappy, poorly put together Christmas themed games that you've been churning out over the past few days...<br /><br />The Amazon Appstore... where every day is Christmas.<br /><br />Oh, about the game? I haven't played it yet...<br /><br />But trust me...its good. You don't have to take my word for it though... Just look at the rating and the number of 5 star reviews compared to all the others! It's not often that a game has hundreds of reviews and like 90% or more are 5 stars...
B009RI4FRU|5.0|For me this is the ultimate feel good movie. Makes me think of two of the most important things growing up, the Outdoors and first love.

B00979CS50|5.0|an outstanding musical statement.after 40yrs. neil young's interaction with crazy horse remains as fresh and innovative as the very 1st  album he released back in the early 1970's.psychedelic pill is a testament to artistic freshness and relevence very few artist can manifest after such a long and storied career.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Brings back many fond memories!  There are not many artists today that measure up to Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet band.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It was funny as hell<br />I never laughed so hard before<br />Great acting and good voice work<br />Plot was good and fantasy
006135323X|5.0|If you have any interactions with people, this book is a must.  It's well-written and offers interesting insights.  A must for marketers and managers
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|my daughter loves it. she says its fun to play with. it is a great app. fun for any one.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Lately I've been listening to the entire DT catalog in a somewhat obsessive attempt to internalize that those grand old days really are gone.  Yes, with Mangini on the throne, they soldier on but no matter how many times I listen to the new line-up, it just doesn't pack the same wallop as when Mike Portnoy was spankin' the skins in the most awesome prog-metal-whatever band on the planet.<br /><br />OK, so what do I have to say about Systematic Chaos?  On day one, spin #1, I sat up and smiled, because this album has IT.  What is IT?  It is the stuff that has made Dream Theater distinctive and unique ever since they released their second album.  It's a cohesive space where virtuosos synergize and melt our ear-brain into a puddle of Not Worthy.<br /><br />And then, over time, it gets better and better.  The two tunes that initially seemed a bit too pop (Forsaken and Constant Motion) become increasingly woven into your mind's audio template and eventually, you realize that it all works.  And really, I can't do this justice with a song-by-song description.  This isn't a collection of songs as much as it is an album that stakes out a space and makes it resonante.  For every ten thousand 5 star albums reviews on Amazon, good luck finding one that holds a candle to Systematic Chaos.
B001NZU7GI|5.0|backed by a great supporting band his playing just flows. It is evident that being around Duanne raised his playing.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|The book I read every Christmas and love it every time. If you haven't read it then you should consider it.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|I couldn't find my original CD from last year so I bought the digital version from Amazon.  It is one of my favorite Christmas albums of all time!  Annie Lennox's voice is amazing and she offers some amazing versions of some of the classics!  This album is a must!
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Let's get real here. This set is just amazing. Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness is easily one of the greatest 90's rock albums of all time. This IMMERSIVE box set is a blessing to all Smashing Pumpkins fans, and it's one of those albums that you can go back to many times and always find something new that you missed before. This set adds to the magic and puts the listener right in the studio with band. All the ideas, artwork, and creative process are all right here for you to explore. The artwork in the set is a marvel unto itself and adds even more depth to an already deep concept. To top it off, you get a live DVD of the band in concert. What can I say? AMAZING! Money well spent. Beautiful packaging and quality production.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|There were many dimensions to this book.  Well done character development and descriptions of India.  Want to read more by this author!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Have not had a lot of time to play this one yet, but seems fun so far. Easy to download.
B000050WZY|5.0|A friend loaned me a copy of his vinyl LP of this re-issue of Beatles early top hits. Having played it once I've ordered my own from Amazon. This is a stunning resurrection of the original cuts. Dunno why folks gripe about the content: it's pretty clearly advertised as a collage of their singles. All that's missing from Beatles One is the junk, crud and corruption that a lot of the later \\"remastered\\" versions of their music introduced. This is as clean as it gets, for a purist, at least. I cannot address any issues folks might have with the CD. The vinyl, reproduced through tube pre-amps and amps, is perfection. Thanks to the engineers who produced this.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|A fun game with various levels so any age can play and not get frustrated. Great for families with or wthout children.
B005ZUR724|4.0|What update do I need.<br />What new update is there. Will change review if update comes.<br />Seems like a cool game.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|Disney's 2009 version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" brings Charles Dickens' classic to vivid life with the dramatic animation over live acting that made \\"Polar Express\\" such an entrancing visual experience.  In the case of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", the effects are quite moving.  Londontown never looked so forbiding in the dark, nor so cheerful on Christmas morning.  The ghosts look as scary as they were meant to be; after all, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is about motivating a stubborn old miser into better behavior.  The movie effectively captures all the essential elements of the story, including the presentations by the ghosts of past, present, and future.  If some scenes are a bit over the top, such as the exotic dancing at Old Fezziwig's, or Ebenezer's flying sequences, it's a bit of relief after Scrooge's unhappy confrontations with the ghosts.  Jiim Carrey does a terrific job behind the animation as Scrooge.  Highly recommended, as long as you like this particular style of animation.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|I've owned this album since it was released in 1982 and have always treasured it.<br /><br />A few years ago, Island/Polygram came out with Legend 2 which was a weak attempt to do an unnecessary follow up.<br /><br />LEGEND is a great sampler of what Bob Marley, Bob Marley and the (original)Wailers, Bob Marley and the (post Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh)Wailers were about.<br /><br />Having own quite a few of his blackmarket/ underground concerts none of the official \\"live\\" recording of the Wailers stacks up against the ones that are privately owned and circulated, but there is the sense in listening to the few live tracks on this album of what a Bob Marley & The Wailers concert meant.<br /><br />This is a phenomenal album and the benchmark of what reggae was and what reggae should have always been.<br /><br />5 gargantuan stars.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Just got my box set in the mail, great collection for the price! All the movies look great, the bonus book is interesting, and a DVD for each movie is in the set, which I was a little worried about with some of the other reviews. Great collection for the price!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book is so good.  I have never read a more descriptive book.  This is the greatest book to read ever.  They need to stop right here and hurry and make the movie. Love this book
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I know this is just a highlights album, so  I wasn't expecting the full soundtrack. That said, really, no &#34;Do you hear the people sing?&#34;.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman does a passable job as Valjean although the higher notes in his register are thin, nasal, and occasionally very hard on the ear. His best track is the new song written for the film &#34;Suddenly&#34;, although, that song ends up being more of a long, drawn out recitative than a proper &#34;verse-chorus-bridge-chorus&#34; style song.<br /><br />Russell Crowe as Javert. Bless his heart. That's all I'll say on the matter.<br /><br />The only &#34;fun&#34; song in the whole darn show, &#34;Master of the House&#34; is (as I'd feared) utterly ruined by a miscast Sascha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Sascha sings the role as the slightly drunken love child of Borat and Bruno. Helena's voice has no power to carry the part. The best I can say for this is all the notes are sung correctly and on pitch.<br /><br />While we're on tiny voices with no power, While Amanda Seyfried's voice is pretty, if she ever sings above a mezzo piano I've yet to hear it. She's drowned out by practically every other voice she's put up against.<br /><br />Granted, I may be spoiled by listening to thoroughly trained voices soar through this music from the various broadway casts, touring casts, and concert versions, but if you're going to mount a film version of this production, you need the voices to do the parts justice.<br />(which brings me to Anne Hathaway. I don't know where this voice of hers came from but Holy Moses on a Matzoh she's AMAZING. I heard her growl out that high E in the ubiquitous I Dreamed a Dream and was floored)
B006O6F932|1.0|Wow, a piece of card board box would be more durable then this crap! $65 bucks for this? I don't think so! First off you barley move this and it comes apart and it was made wrong! The speaker system on the one that I bought doesn't even fit into the grooves!  Lately, shame on you for making and supplying such a flimsy piece of crap and then having the nerve to charge what you do?! You can't even play with this without the entire thing falling apart!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this series. Season seven was bomb. There is only one aspect of the story line I could have done without and if your a fan of bobby you will probably agree with me. otherwise great season. I can't wait for season 8.
B005OP28XS|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows on television today.  Laugh out loud funny:) Sure to lift your spirits iand put a smile on your face.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|puzzles are challenging but still do-able. some can be done instantly, others take a few tries. excellent game. I would recommend it to anyone!
0345525558|5.0|This was a magical story about communicating through different flowers.  It was sensitively written and takes one to another dimention.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Good film and lots of action. I've watched all of the Resident Evil movies and enjoyed everyone. But it's nothing spceial and thats why I wouldn't give it a five.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game gets challenging and is a lot of fun! great way to exercise the brain! its free so why not download it now?
B005XN31LY|5.0|I like this story. So much that I introduced it to my 25 year old daughter, who also enjoys it. She is actually the one who purchased it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It was good. I enjoyed the reading and it was interesting. I was always curious about this topic and this book answered a lo  of unanswered questions of mine.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This story is another virtuoso performance for Michael Connelly.  Harry Bosch just keeps getting better, more nuanced and likable.  He is no super-hero and he can be a bit irritating at times, but he's honest, and true to his principles.<br /><br />The arrival of an IA investigator in the nick of time felt ever-so-slightly contrived, but this is a minor ding considering the fix Bosch had managed to get himself into. Short of him becoming McGuyver the author had little choice but to rescue him in any way possible.<br /><br />Great read and very satisfying. If you already know Bosch you won't be disappointed. If you are new to the series you have a wonderful treat in store!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|i played this game on my pc and loved it and the fact that it's free as an app makes it more worth it to play when i'm out of town or traveling.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|only the first few posts show on the timeline. please fix not worth downloading at the moment. use the web until its fixed.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|i've heard great things about this movie and the price is even better than i expected. definetely a movie i won't watch alone according to the quote printed on the cover.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I was disappointed with this latest Michael Connelly book.  It seemed slow in many places and was just not his usual &#34;page-turner&#34;.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This completed my Grandson's LEGO village...........Really all he wanted to Christmas - he's a happy boy.........and I'm a happy Santa.........
B007MU85D0|5.0|Wanted this album for a while, cost much more on itunes.  Combined with a promo code got it for about two dollars!  Songs are very mellow overall, great for background while reading or drawing, but also good for listening in the car or by headphones.  Interesting lyrics, and great vocals.
B0060D123K|2.0|A great part of the movie was cut when the song by Belle was removed!  What a bummer!  Bah Humbug!!!
B004J64QSI|5.0|les miserable is the best musical  concert in my humble opinion, very christian plot, talks about grace, redemption, love, self sacrifice and not to mention awesome vocals and orchestra. a must see!
B001437DMA|5.0|Come on now.....its Joe Satriani! Seriously, This album is an epic sucess in a long line of genuinely strange but incredibly beautiful music. Take me a way Joe.....ahem... I mean, Take it away Joe!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed will not load more than a handful of updates. Please fix! This is a widespread problem apparently
B005LAIHPY|4.0|this movie may have many cheesy parts but I believe that was the point of the movie made from a board game I thought the alien weapons were really cool and a story what a long swiftly there were a few parts the job in taking out but overall it was a great surprise how good I thought this movie was compared to the reviews date got
0439023513|5.0|Loved this series. The first and third books by far were the best. I was not crazy about the ending but the book was a good read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Like it much better after I got my stylus.<br /><br />sometimes it does jump back to the home page. Why? Anyone know?
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|it piqued my curiosity, Maggie smith has always made me laugh with her delivery of her lines. Can't wait to see the new season
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I played this on Wii a few years ago. I never understood why it never became a phenomenon like the boring, repetitive birds.  Gameplay on the droid is amazing. It's just like the Wii version.
B005LAII3U|3.0|I would have given this product 4 stars, but the audio went out of sync with the video after the audio dropped out for a split second more than once.  I've got about 200 BD's, and I've never had that issue before.  I'm not alone with this problem as I just did a quick search on the Web and discovered others are having sync problems too, and it seems to be happening on a variety of players.  (I'm using a PS3 Slim.) I was able to get the audio back in sync with the video by re-starting a chapter.  Others said they did it by switching from Dolby TrueHD to PCM.  Consumers shouldn't have to find a fix to this problem because Sony Pictures shouldn't have released a product with this issue.  Shame on them.  They need to do the right thing and issue a TOTAL RECALL of this disc and send consumers a corrected replacement... like Universal did a few years back with the \\"Jurassic Park\\" DVD's.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I really like this film for what it is: a fun popcorn movie with outstanding visual effects and great (but somewhat flawed) surround sound.  Aside from the sync issue, the soundtrack is what you'd expect from an action/sci-fi/popcorn film: loud with lots of explosions and gunfire.  Thankfully, the rear surround channels aren't forgotten or under used as there's plenty of sound coming from them throughout the film.  The visual effects are jaw-dropping at times.  You know a lot of it is CG but most of the time it looks pretty darn convincing.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's nominated for an Oscar for its visual effects.  (If only this movie had been filmed in 3D.  It certainly looks like it was meant to be.  I hope we can look forward to a Blu-ray 3D release with an upgraded soundtrack to 7.1 channels down the road some day.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the original film, I found this \\"Total Recall\\" to be a big improvement.  I know some feel exactly the opposite, and that's ok.  To each his own.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in general (unless he's playing a cyborg), and I didn't care for the cheesy jokes sprinkled throughout the original film (lines like \\"consider dat a divorce\\").  And even back in the day, I thought some of the visual effects were really bad (like when Arnold's character, the woman and the bad guy are all exposed to the Martian atmosphere and their eyes bulge out of their heads).  That's not to say the new film is perfect.  It's not a deep movie, but it's highly entertaining eye candy, and it features a few cool ideas for future technology, such as a cell phone in the palm of your hand (literally) and turning any piece of glass into a computer screen with just the touch of your hand.  I don't know how plausible they are, but they're interesting nonetheless.  I think the Extended Version is the better film as it fills in some blanks.  It's a shame the extra footage wasn't seen in theaters, and it's a shame the director over did it with lens flare.  It's out of control in this movie! But Colin Farrell is a much better actor than Schwarzenegger, and I don't think Kate Beckinsale ever looked hotter than she does in this movie.  She also proves she can play a good villain.<br /><br />This disc set comes with the usual extras you find nowadays (behind-the-scenes documentaries, flubs, etc.) as well as a UV copy.  I give the film itself: 4 out 5 stars; the video presentation: 5 Stars; the audio presentation: 4 out of 5 stars (would have been 5 if not for the dropouts and sync problems).g in general (unless he's playing a cyborg), and I didn't care for the cheesy jokes sprinkled throughout the original film (lines like \\"consider dat a divorce\\").

B00APUYWYA|2.0|My wife and I found this movie somewhat entertaining but overall rather awkward.  It felt like a movie trying to capture the style of Glee in a movie format with the American Pie style humor.  If that sounds like your thing, go for it, but it's not for everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My nieces (ages 4, 9, &amp; 13) love this app &amp; so do I. We've introduced it to other folks &amp; they love it too!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|The original is so much better than the remake. Watch in b&w. The colorized version shown on TV doesn't look natural. If that is the only version available, use the TV settings to turn off the color. Sit back and enjoy. Sure the dialogue is a bit corny at times but the story will warm your heart on a cold winter's evening.
B005LAII1C|5.0|funny stoner movie. NOT for the whole family. good times for everyone that watches it. Watch it over and over
0316067598|5.0|Should be required reading for high school seniors. However, I guess that would be &#34;politically incorrect&#34;! If this country had a clue to what our military endures in battle, (the politics, the enemy, and death), perhaps they would drop to their knees and seek our heavenly Father. There is ONLY one way to cure this country. Look Up America!<br />P,S. Yes, I served my country during Vietnam, Army Airborne Ranger
B00866JL96|5.0|It is an excellent DVD to watch. I would suggest this one to everyone. I gave it this rating because it kept my interest and very emotional
B009NPKTN6|4.0|It was much better than I thought it was going to be, having grown up in the hair band '80's, it pretty much nailed it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This was one fantastic movie.  We watched it twice before it expired; for us, that's rare.  It was just that good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An easy to read account of the special forces operations that contribute to our freedom that most of us take for granted.  A no nonsense accounting of this dramatic mission without political hype or press spin from a seal's perspective.  Very enjoyable to read - May God bless our military who sacrifice so much for all of us.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This was a present.  The kids loved them.  They put them on their phones immediately and they were happy with the results!
B003B5M0PO|4.0|Absolutely loved the book. Courageous, heartfelt and truthful. An unbiased outlook on war, touching, men hardened by deprivation of war, reaching for one symbol of hope and recognizing in the war horse true valour.<br />Read the book before yo watch the movie!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie was great. We will watch it again and again. Lots of first person camera action. A very cool movie.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is how greatest hits albums should be. It has all the familiar hits, but enough new material (as well as a new version of Miss Independent) so that even long time fans will want to pick it up!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I love it ! I purchased this DVD as a gift for my granddaughter. i have seen it and it is great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show!  The story line keeps you coming back each week.<br /><br />Darryl is one of my favorite characters and you just never know who will get attacked next or be off the show.
B006O6EOII|5.0|This doll is pretty cool.  Roller maze edition is a neat addition to the collection.  I like the blue hair and you have to put the skates on by yourself, so that's rather cool.  I think it's cool that Mattel gave her knee pads, promoting safety while also selling this doll.  Very cool.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|A friend of mine said this was the &#34;best movie&#34; he had ever seen, so I had pretty high expectations.  I agree that the special effects were phenomenal.  But I thought the plot was just okay.  It seemed &#34;familiar&#34;.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I liked the book, never had read any book from Vince Flynn, but I really liked it. An interesting story about CIA and FBI agents, in the begining it was kind of confusing but it get's realy exiting. It is a nice book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|EVERY MAN LIVING SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE.THIS MOVIE WILL SHOW SOME GUYS ON HOW TO BE A MAN.THIS MOVIE WILL SHOW YOU SOME IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT LIFE.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|This is a difficult movie to watch: it's heavy, a little slow and too much long, but it's an excelent work of acting by Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. A good story that's worth it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a great series if you like supernatural type books.  Falls into the angels versus demons genre.  I'm on the third in the series now--reading them back to back on my Kindle!
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Funny, lovely and rocks like a hurricane. In my opinion,the best musical movie of the 2012 year. Tom Cruise made a really good work.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Rented this movie as I'd heard it was hilarious and it did have its moments.  The story line was weak and predictable, but there was plenty of funny moments.  Ted's voice was pretty annoying as it seemed to keep morphing into Peter Griffin.  I would have given the movie one star, but the fight scene in the hotel made this worth watching.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A lot like Pioneer trail I played on Facebook. I've been looking for a portable game that was similar for awhile. It's been great so far and free which is always good lol
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We love this movie!  It is so funny!  The kids cannot stop watching it.  The minions are the best!  Highly recommend it!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood and Justine Timberlake excellent in this movie, unlikey pair but did and Awesome job! It<br />s a movies I could watch again

0671449028|4.0|It's cute.  My great grandson will be reading it by himself before long.  He's 3 and very bright, but aren't they all.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|I received this as a Christmas gift and I have yet to find the ball inside the big ball. I have traced all the paths from start to finish and I have even vigorously shaken the product. I would assume that the ball was inside the final product and did not fall out of the packing box for me to install. Would not recommend as quality control is an issue.
0375507256|5.0|Very deep with several themes winding their way through the different stories that make up the total novel.  Good book..
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I love this movie.  We have visited many of the filming locations.  I can watch it over and over again.
1423113454|5.0|Bought this for my child for christmas and she loves the story line and characters.  Great writer for childrens books.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|hooked from the start.  much more fun than the original.  I hope that the kids don't want to play it

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game addicted me from the first 5x5! I am currently battling the 12x12 squares, and I am very entertained. It is a must-have for all ages, and overall is a fantastic game. Thank you!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|A little too dark sexually for me - I guess okay if you are in to that stuff. Actually I found myself saying - no, not again.
B00821OW8K|4.0|08-16-2013 Updated Review, 4*<br />I finished seasons one & two & think that they were pretty good.<br /><br />Updated Review, 3*: I finished season one & still like it.<br />Watched the 1st season & it was good. I will definitely watch more episodes now & hope that I like them like the 1st one. Thanks to the people that posted comments about my review. I can't even remember why I rated it so low initially but I was way off.<br /><br />Some shows that I like: The Walking Dead, American Horror Story, The Langoliers, Halloween 1,2,4, Tucker & Dale versus Evil, Fringe.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The whole series was extremely well written and kept the reader moving along. I had trouble putting it down. My only complaint is that I felt soooo bad for the tortured characters and what they suffered in the end.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Too much of a good thing can be boring. There is very little of an interesting plot except for when the will this internimable book end.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Although the content was titillating, overall, this was not my cup of tea. Surprisingly it did wind up with a halfway believable ending for these characters.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Just purchased the pro version. The effects occasionally work. It doesn't save my work..reverts to the unedited photo. Running on a GS3.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loved it! This is a great price for the whole collection!
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|Funciona muy bien. Cumple lo que el fabricante promete. El único punto por mejorar es que cuando abre el flash pega contra el micrófono por lo que se debe tener la precaución al colocarlo para que esto no suceda.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|A great slapstick. This is my 10 yr. old's favorite Home Alone. The whole family did like it but we picked for our kid in the family.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The last sentence of the book is my reason for 5 stars: &#34;...the right book at the right time.&#34; If you love books and technology and the joyous pursuit of knowledge then buy this book. It contains the secret to immortality.
B009QW7MQS|4.0|I really liked this Bond because Pierce Brosnan is in it and i liked his girl in the one too.
0446554995|2.0|Have read all of the Pendergast series, along with the others (Gideon), in between.  Started off OK, but went in too many directions.  Not leaving a reader eager for a follow up.  Seemed forced, as though the authors were having to finish up a contract and deliver the last manuscript.  When finished, had much the same feeling with Patricia Cornwell's \\"Blowfly\\".  Used to wait and read them all, not here, disappointing.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|My 10 year old loved it. She loved how he was really curious and adventurous. It had some sad parts in it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun game. Keeps me entertained. I am NOT a game person, but this is very easy and very fun!
B000IDEORY|5.0|I have watched this several times and i could watch it several more time. I should have purchased it instead of renting it. There is much talent in this movie. I also sais not to&#34; judge a book by its cover.&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this at school after a friend got me hooked. I read this book in a few hours and it was completely worth it. I got my whole family to read it and they all loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone with a sense for violence and love. Team Gale!
B004C3DLJS|5.0|My 10 yr old said it was the best Toy Story because it had a lot of suspense. She liked the part about the giant claw that rescued the toys.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have had many hours playing this game. Thank goodness for something that entertaines me as I sit waiting for all kids practices to be over!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is the most funny book I've read in in my life. The good thing about is that every one can read it because even my dad cracks up when I read a paragraph or to to him.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I like that this game has many different pinball boards to choose from. I introduced my grandsons to pinball and they are addicted!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Fun and well thought out even though I can't get passed level  six<br /><br /> And I hope you did yourself justice and did the free one first.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game, it much harder than the other angry bird games but i like the challenge. My grandsons play my games all the time.
B008K7RGA2|4.0|I have seen several performances of Tosca over the decades, most of which were never recorded.  I have both DVDs with Jonas Kaufmann as Cavaradossi and this performance I find outastanding.  Visually, of course, he is all you could want.  More importantly, however, is his voice over which he has  such wonderful control.When he goes soto voce, the effect is awesome.  As Scarpia, Bryn Terfel is remarkable, both vocally and as a real bastard.  Angela has not been my cup of tea for a long time now and her performance here says the opera is all aboutme, NOT Tosca.  Some have complained about the production itself being similar to those of the past and did not care for it.  If they saw the current Met production, I think they would wish for this one many times over.
B0086449YA|5.0|So many wonderful songs.  !  He reminds me of Glen Hansard, one of my all time favorite songwriter/singer  . Of course, Mr. Knopfler has been around longer and has a larger body of work. Listen to the CD often.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|These are the only Alien movies that are really worth watching.  The first two, Alien and Aliens being the best of the set.  While I do not think Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection were bad I just really think they tried too hard to extend the story.  The first two are really are a mix of classic monster and sci-fi genres.  Personally I think the best part of the set are the extras.  Even if you do not like the third and fourth movies as much as the other two, the behind the scenes material gives a lot of insight into the stories, and probably makes them more enjoyable.  I do think throughout all the movies Sigourney Weaver did a great job making the character of Ripley evolve because of all that she experienced.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the movies (aside from the alien vs predator films) this is definitely worth a pick-up.  There is now a blu ray version that you may want to get instead that contains all the extras from this set, but even as a DVD set this looks and sounds great.  It should be a part of any fan's collection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book really gets down into the root of all Christian's issues. I really enjoyed the growth of the characters.
B002NS2HBM|4.0|Alias was a great concept that got a little weird when it started to focus on the Rambaldi storyline.  The first few seasons where that was merely in the background were great.  Jennifer Garner's character believed that she was working for the CIA (which she could not reveal to anyone) finds out after her fiancee was killed by the organization she was really working for what she was really involved in.  From there the show focuses on her life as a double agent and her attempts to bring down the rouge spy agency/criminal organization.<br /><br />Where Alias really shined was character development and casting those parts.  Every character that was around for a significant amount of time changed from the time they were first introduced.  And of course Alias was a world where being dead did not always mean staying dead.  I think the best storyline of the series was the time jump, and the way it was done.  Sydney having lost two years with no memory, then finding out exactly how and why her memory was erased was a great payoff.  Especially when that is the kind of a story that often falls flat at the big reveal.<br /><br />The one drawback to the series as I said before is by the end the entire focus was on the Rambaldi storyline, and making the whole supernatural/eternal life storyline.  It really did change the feel of the show, and while it did provide a good explanation for Sloane's motivation from the beginning, I think it did better when those parts of the storyline were in a few episodes of the season as opposed to the focus of the season.  Overall though if you are looking for a show that combined action, comedy, great acting and a unique take on the spy world (plus the bonus of Jennifer Garner in skimpy outfits on a pretty consistent basis) this is a good one.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this because it was offered for free and I sure am glad. This was a great read. I was very involved to the point of yelling at the characters in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
0892563508|5.0|I used a lot of this book to help me write a paper, it was very informative and because of it i learned a lot and also got an A.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to waste a little time with! Easy to use and understand. Lots of fun . Lots of fun. Lots of fun.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|This movie is formulaic, and its plot is indistinguishable for the thousands of other rom-com movies.  But it's movie that works, and its predictable and formulaic plot -- struggling, loveless woman struggles to find love to please her family and friends before she realizes with the help of her true love that she must first love herself if she is find her true love -- is made less so by the director's wit, a winning performance by Anna Faris, and Chris Evans' abs.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I bought this for my 10-year-old nephew and he loved it.  He had opened it and built it before I left.  This was a great gift for a boy -- and perhaps some girls would like it to -- if they are fans of the movies.  Amazon and the seller could not have been better.  A fantastic experience all around.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo is artistically beautiful, and the story is wonderfully refreshing, unusual, and fun! Every child should see this movie! My daughter adores it, and she's actually a college art student.
B005VPRETE|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 7-Year-Old niece and she just adored it.  She couldn't wait to start building with it.  I would definitely recommend this as a gift for little girls and Amazon and the Seller couldn't have been better.  Kudos all around!
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This is a perfect addition to the collection.  Very enjoyable and clever,  definitely a must watch movie.  I want to go on an adventure now.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|As good as minecraft demo it has a time limit but thats it it had maney details like in minecraft pc like crafting.
B007FC3AAI|3.0|I don't get it. I have seen all bur the last Breaking Dawn part II and I don't see what all the hoopla is about. First I hae to say that the special effects were magnificent but....Kristen Stewart has about as much personality as a termite and Robert Patterson is not much better.  I wold think were they at a party they would be the most boring people there - unless they started taking one's blood.  I do like Jacob and I see real potential in this actor. He is cute and has an adorable warmth about him - something the other don't have --don't even come close.<br />I have True Blood - good and great at times but my favorite is The Vampire Diaries--now this is exciting, the characters are gorgeous AND warm AND great acting AND I think the show is ten times better than Twilight - any of them.  I'm not sure if I'll even order number two of Dawn (the supposedly last of the series) for of all the vampires running around your town and mine I believe the Vampire Diaries is top notch on all areas.<br />And that's the way my boat floats!  Sherrie Holtz
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|If you like action movies, you cannot go wrong. The comparison to the original is unfair. The original was a little corny at times, something only an Arnold can pull off. This one is along the lines of the Bourne series, MI series and the plethora of spy movies - which is also the movie's problem... it is just another spy movie.<br /><br />I'd watch it. But then I'd watch anything (almost) that has Kate Beckinsale in it. Cheers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Liked the whole series. I was particularly glad to find the story wasn't as &#34;dark&#34; or creepy as I thought if would be after reading the first few chapters in book one.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I enjoyed the acting but the story was predictable and overly done. There was one or two unpredictable twists in it to make it entertaining enough for me not to notice the length.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I received it the day they said it would arrive.  It was a holiday gift for my grand daughter who loves the surfs. She just loved it.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|no real plot or character development.  Pretty awful.... Sad since the first two were so good.  Don't waste your money/
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We really love the Disney movies and this was no exception.  Was going to wait for Christmas, but we couldn't wait.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about, it was AWESOME. I watched it two nights in a row. Ready for sequels. I hope they come out.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|This is the only other version of A Christmas Carol I have seen other than the Muppet Christmas Carol. This version is wonderfully made. Well animated and a great retelling of the classic Christmas story. A treat for the children. A must see for adults wishing to return to the joys of their youth.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Downloaded it twice won't go past the loading screen keeps trying to reload doesn't work .not workin on my Asus tr101 running ice cream sandwich
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This keeps grandkid busy for many hours and also develop hand eye coordination.<br />They love it, so it is worth it.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|Several great acting performance and a twisting plot. Watchable several times over bought for a family member who collects great movies.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is an enjoyable adventure.  Figuring out what to do next is good and straight forward The mini-games were a little bit too easy though.
0316228532|2.0|This review will be short, as many others have said the same thing in longer posts.<br /><br />I know Rowling can write, because I'm in my 50s and have read the entire HP series three times.  And she again proves she can write with \\"The Casual Vacancy\\".<br /><br />There are, however, two overriding issues that I have with the book and that stopped me from thoroughly enjoying it.  One is that there is an overabundance and unnecessary use of four-letter words.  It's as if Rowling was trying to prove that this is an ADULT book (make no mistake) so she made sure to throw in as many words as possible, even when not really called for in the context of the story.  I'm no prude when it comes to four-letter words, but this one is way over the top.  I get it-this book is for adults.  She doesn't have to prove it on every page.<br /><br />The second issue is that while there is a huge cast of characters, not one of them seems to have any redeeming values.  They are all nasty, petty and unlikeable.  One of my pet peeves is when an author gives the reader not one person to root for or admire.  Does it make the reading juicier?  Maybe, but it also makes the reading wearying and not a lot of fun.  Why would I care what happens to any of them when I can't stand them?<br /><br />Judging by the pretty even number of people who gave this book 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 stars, it's clear that what some people like about the book, others dislike.  Does that make it successful?  I'm not sure.  I don't think Rowling needs to always stick with Harry Potter, but I'd like a little of the ambiguity and joy that she gave to her HP characters and the fun I had while reading it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm very happy with the ad-free version.  It was inexpensive, and it's way better than the version with ads.  It's fun, as all the of the 'Angry Birds' games have been.
B000HZGOUI|5.0|its a movie that you will like or hate and me on the other hand i like it alot. its just one of those action movies that gets me into the movie and my favorite part of course is when both of them make their own knife and duel it out at the end. but overall awesome movie!!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The last of trilogy was the best Batman movie ever. The acting was superb and I had to buy it even after seeing in the big screen.
0321701763|3.0|Not as good as I hoped it would be.I have learned as much from YouTube Videos.I needed to know the basics of Photoshop and this Book tends to go off in the wrong directions for me.
B005IQZB14|5.0|the happenings of the author's life, the ups and downs framed in a backpacking trip on the Pacific Coast trail
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was short enough that it stayed enjoyable but it was very predictable. Decent book for it being a free download.
B009B8YZKS|2.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie of Halo because I have never seen one before and I love all the games. This movie sucked so bad and its a shame that whoever made this movie screwed it up so bad. I hate when people does this. Go play the game first and learn about it and then go make the movies.<br /><br />1. The movie focused on the cadets way to much in their training. Who cares about the cadets! Especially about the boy and his brother somewhere fighting the war.<br />2. Takes forever for Master Chief to show up and when he does he babysits a bunch of kids.<br />3. You barley see any fighting actions from Master Chief.<br />4. Master Chief was on maybe 15 minutes and then the movie ended.<br /><br />As far as how things looked that part was awesome. The suits, weapons, warthog, & Covenant was that of the game.<br />Cortana looked great too but I did expect to see her a lot with Master Chief but you don't.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The time gaps may confuse readers but it helps with moving the story forward. Not worth all the praise it is given yet you won't be disappointed in this fairy tale like romance. The vocab reads adult but the content belongs in the YA section. I don't see myself going back to 're-read it and don't plan to bring it aboard a plane as you may fall asleep.
B003L77GRO|5.0|My mother and love this show but they are asking way to much for it at a regular store and this was 20 dollars cheaper
0307730697|5.0|I love this story and his courage to do these things. I think it gives Americans an appreciation for what they do.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|We love this movie and amazon truly does offer the best price. The bright colors will hold your childs attention and the humor and storyline appeals to adults too!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Great fun to watch, especially when eating dinner and may want a distraction. Not an Oscar winner, but fun nonetheless.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is fabulous.if i could i would rate it 20 stars.its realistic and the funnest game you could ever want
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I loved DeMilles books The Lion and Lionshead and thought this would be just as good.  It was terrible and I stopped reading it half way through.  His main character continued to make sarcastic silly remarks on every page.  The story kept dragging along and half way through the book it still was not going anywhere.  I could not believe that page after page was filled with stupid and sarcastic off hand remarks made about everything that was said by all the other characters.  I will not read any of his books in the future and have read many in the past.  He must have needed the money or something to generate a useless book like this. If I had  bought it at Costco I assure you I would have returned it.  I would give it zero stars but it is not an option.
B0083Z614S|4.0|A little too wordy in parts, or it seemed that way however, a good read. The characters are very believable.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The story was well thought out and interesting, you can get lost in the various arcs. But, it's not too distracting. I'll definitively be reading the others.
0670021652|5.0|Great book. I'd read in our library and sent a copy as a wedding gift to our nephew and his bride. They received it in record time, and considered one of the better wedding gifts. That made it even more satisfactory for us.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Good time. Getting a little dark though, I may need a shower soon...<br /><br />Or I'll accept it.<br /><br />Three more words required...
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I'm no fanatic on romance novels, but I found this one to be clever. It was a little cliche, but isn't love like that. Very well written, a great novel for it costing me no money.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|My wife and daughter both love the various Jane Austen movies. I watched this BBC version years ago and really enjoyed it. Of the few that I've seen, this is the best.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great app.  it is easy to use lets you stay intouch with friends and family. you also have have acess to a ton of fun games
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is a classic musical.  Our family really enjoys watching it.  The story line is funny, and the songs are catchy.  If you like old musicals this one is definitely a must see.  My husband sometimes starts singing the songs from it randomly.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I liked the first Expendables. This one is way more out there. A lot of random stuff happening in this one.
B004P1JEWU|1.0|I am crushed to discover that this edition does not have x-ray! The previous instalments of the series did, and future ones seem to, but not this one!<br /><br />Although this is indicated on the full Amazon site (not mobile), it is still confusing and upsetting.<br /><br />Also, the Kindle edition not available in Australia does appear to have x-ray enabled!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this on my xbox and kindle. I am greatly happy that the game was released on the kindle! now I may be able to play wherever I go! I wish they had came up with this sooner tho... This game is to die for. its works flawlessly it should have 5 stars instead of 4 1/2 stars.
B000007SPT|5.0|Heard this playing in all places on a train and i asked the passenger if he knew the song and he told me as it was in his collection so i tracked it down,now i have my own and jusr love the music and how its put together,Thank You
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Merry Christmas Baby is right up there with Bing Crosby's White album for<br />me. Merry Christmas Baby is one of the best Christmas albums ever.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Slammed is a great book for teens that will make you laugh out loud while your eyes also well up with tears. Easily finished in a day, Slammed is perfect for a road trip, plane flight, or just a lazy Sunday.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Overall the book is dark and seemingly hopeless. There are small victories here and there but the losses are overshadowing and overwhelming. The author does a fantastic job transporting the reader right into the heart of the Hunger Games. This book made me stop and think about those people around the world that live a modern, real Hunger Game. Great read.
0385491026|5.0|The book is great! The cover feels different to other book covers. Different, but better. It's more flexible and if creased, there is very little damage. This might sound awkward, but its hard to describe. Also, shipping was fast and the book in a perfect condition when i received it. Thanks!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|One of the best Disney animated classics available. Filled with memorable music by Sir Elton John and delightful characters voiced by stars like James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Cheech Marin, and Whoopi Goldberg. An enjoyable family treat.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|I love all her songs & her she is just like Perfect&#60;3 I wanna meet her so bad! Like omg
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Just saw this again Christmas Eve. It's a fun musical rendition of the Dickens classic. Sir Michael Caine makes a very dignified but ruthless Scrooge. Highly recommended.
B008K8U13K|4.0|This game is awesome with it  great graphics but the only complaint I have are that the special stages which are really hard to beat
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES file explorer works as expected, easy to use and makes it easier to keep track of downloads. I recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an amazing. It left me on the edge of my seat waiting to see if everything would work out.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Must read for anyone who loves Vince Flynn's character, CIA assasian, Mitch Rapp!  Although, if you do not know the story of Mitch Rapp from previous books, this one may be hard to follow.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have been reading Grisham for quite some time and am nver disappointed in his stories or his style in engrossing the reader.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I use this stylus on my iPad with Notability. It is so much easier to take notes and my handwriting is almost the same as if I were writing with pen and paper.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I know a lot of people are upset that Jeff Lynne has released an album of covers, rather than new stuff, but this CD sounds super, and Lynne's choice of songs is superb. Plus, he gives each song his own unique signature. Jeff Lynne could sing names from the phone book, and I'd still buy it!
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|As much as I LOVE Uno and Dos, I absolutely cant stop listening to Tre! In my humble opinion, its the best of the 3, but I always have, and always will, love everything Green Day!
B00AGH6FD8|3.0|Not as good as Home Alone I, but still a family favorite!  Nothing better for a family holiday movie than HA 1 and 2!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really loved this book. Very different sort of ending, but it's the perfect ending to this series. Obviously this is a fictional series, but it had a realistic view and feel to it, which I appreciated.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I really expected much more from this book after reading some of the other reviews. I thought about just giving up on it and finally just skimmed through (which is something I almost never do with a book). I was frustrated with the marginally interesting main characters, the lack of development of others and finally just fed up with the whole thing. Waste of time and money for me.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Definitely a fan of the Hunger Games. This was my least favorite of the entire series, but it was still really good. :)
B002ZG99TK|5.0|This movie is based on a true story, some of it was filmed where it really happened.<br /> It has a fair share of explosions but a lot more adventure drama as it unfolds.<br />SO if you like action, suspense and not having your screen filled with blood and gore..... This movie is for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I started to read the series, and I must say, while I felt the book had a different &#34;feel&#34; to it (for lack of a better term), I really enjoyed this book. :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait to read the other books.<br />I can't believe I read it so fast. I couldn't put it down.
B006TGWY3K|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Lacuna Coil fan, but I wasn't overly fond of this album. Best song, IMO, is &#34;Kill the Light.&#34; Not really a fan of their &#34;Losing My Religion&#34; cover.
0307720748|5.0|As entertaining as it was informational, as exciting as it was educational.  Would recommend this to anyone as an insightful and honest description of Branson's life.
B00381A1MU|5.0|Bought this car along with several others for Christmas for my grandson. He LOVED them! Good quality, subject matter, interactive toy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I went into this knowing there would be ads, but I must say this game is enjoyable and challenging I would have given it five stars even if it had no ads.
1400052173|1.0|This was requested as a Christmas gift but as I scanned over it, I was very interested in this true story and my granddaughter was very excited to receive it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Even though recovery from coma is difficult and perhaps miraculous, meningitis,even encephalitis is an inflammation of the meningeal layer and doesn't destroy the gray matter of the brain as implied. A window into what might lay beyond but not too convincing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Is, if anything, consistent.  I've been reading Bosch since I came across this book about about a murderous hawk in the public library so that has been a long time.  I'd say the Black Box is more prodedural than usual but of course it is a matter of degree.  If you put The Bosch books on a continuum measuring procedure it would be tight and consistent but the Black Box would be to the far right.  I rank Bosch at the top of the genre.  I read a lot in this genre and like John Rebus and Harry Hole.  I find Dave Robicheau to be wildly inconsistent as well as the other characters created by Burke.  I rank Bosch far ahead of Lucas Davenport  and I don't mind the Davenport books at all.  I can't think of any other series I enjoy as much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting beginning to the story and very detailed. It felt like you were actually there with the character's. And I love their background stories.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|The pace of the movie was way too slow and the storyline was not the least bit exciting or thought-provoking. I lost interest after 10 minutes.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I think this is stupid but I liked the books. I don't want to do,this is stupid. I love brass
B009VB97EY|2.0|Crappy movie: bad acting, poor writing, horrible cinematography, lousy lighting. Matthew McConaughey plays a skinny, creapy, drug-crazed bisexual master of ceremonies, and Channing Tatum plays a character very similar except that he's buff and can dance unbelievably. Every actor and actress in the movie could use some acting lessons. I would have turned the movie off much sooner than I did were it not for the occassional glimpse at Channing's bare rear end. The whole movie reminded me of a bad all-male-review in a cheesy drag bar.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|awesome game highly recommend it. fun; entertaining; just good fun to be had.  try it out and see what uh think of it too.
B009RH973I|3.0|This was a great fit to my HD. If your are looking for a case, this is the one.  Just one thing that is strange, the strap.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|dude this price? I thought that it was too much. then I came back this morning and it was free! thank you and merry Christmas!!!
B005KDDUVS|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is great and the caracthers espectacular, very well written.
B00003CXPD|1.0|I thought this was supposed to be a feel-good movie.  I turned it off twice due to the violence.<br />It was depressing, not uplifting. And on the box, Mark Salisbury, said it was \\"Funny\\".  Which part was funny?<br />There was nothing funny about this movie.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I am sorry, I Liked it better, like it was. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! New is not always best.
B008M721MS|5.0|i purchased this for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it. annoying to set up but overall its a good item
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Very sturdy case. Easy to use. It's true that if you install the Kindle with the charger ports on the right for accessibility, the camera is on the left (not easy to use), but I never use the camera, so not important to me.  Love the sleep function and the good quality elastic strap.  Well worth the price, every bit as good as the high-priced cases.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|I don't normally read 'sky&#34; novels but this one was a page turner for me. I like books that are, simply-put, a good story. This was that.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Wow, what's not to like about this game! Great controls (which is rare for mobile) , amazing art style (rivals the console version), nice even difficulty curve, and most important of all... it's a blast to play!
B00908DDZM|5.0|This was a gift for my niece ( she's 30). She was thrilled to get it! She said she played it all night! I would recommend this to anyone who loves music.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|has songs like 'easy lover' 'groovy kind of love' etc.  so there are a lot of choices.  sound quality is great.  love the variety of songs.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Anything by Joss Whedon is a winner! I love his sense of humor and his characters, especially his strong women. This is just the tv show, so if you are looking for something with more flare, this isn't for you.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I just got this app for free (instead of the $5) on Dec. 25 and read all of the great reviews. So, right away I began to play it and it was awesome!  So please get this app...it is a great game!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|One of the best places on the internet that I've found for storing your photos. I found it very easy to up load my photos & the ability to share them on a differnt social networks makes this free app great! With 5GB of free space only adds to the greatness of this app. Thanks you Amizon.com<br />  M.R.Bush
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Well made movie with catchy dialogue and funny accents . My kids and the adults loved this one equally. Typical fantasy fare though.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The story was interesting, as were the characters.  They were a strange mix of quirky personalities that blended together in a quirky way.  Loved all the characters.  LOVED the music!  Be sure to watch the closing credits if you appreciate cleverness and great music.  I wish I could be more clever myself in writing this amateur review.  Bottom line: movie was very well done, clever and quirky (have I used those two terms before?), low key, quietly amusing and the music was great!  My mother introduced me to the orchestral piece by Benjamin Britten when I was a child, so that was an unexpected bonus for me.  Loved the movie!
B006YC74E8|5.0|I've tried many apps and this one impressed me the most not only that but it has impressed me the most.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Went to the premiere of this movie and LOVED IT!!!! After seeing it the night it came out I saw it four more times. Then when I heard the movie was coming out a week after my birthday I per-ordered it as soon as I got the money from my birthday. Buy it, enjoy it, watch it, and then watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much! It's full of action and romance. Suzanne did a great job with this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun easy to play and very addicting.  there are some gliches-says wifi is not on when it is and freezes every now and then.  Other then that its a fun game.
0545265355|5.0|It came quickly and the books are in really good condition. The story is really good and entertaining I really enjoyed it I'm almost done I just need the last book to finish
B0083P1QUM|5.0|She takes me to places I've never been!  This is a very good read.  If you have not read Patricia Cornwell I suggest you do so immediately!
B000YXMMAO|5.0|like the band, like the album, ordered for a gift to someone that shared my appreciation for the &#34;product&#34;. as good as it gets for someone getting &#34;the music&#34; during 70ies
031236198X|3.0|\\"Our iceberg is melting\\" is a small and very (too?) easy to read book that mainly consists of a fable about penguins who notice that they need to change. The penguins then happened to follow Kotter's eight-step process of successful change, so you can learn this eight-step process by learning from the penguins :)<br /><br />The first 100 pages in the book is the fable about penguins who need to move to a new home as they discovered their iceberg is melting. They convince the senior management penguins and plan the change with a selected team of change agents. They manage to convince the other penguins that action is needed, get a quick win and manage to successfully change.<br /><br />After that, there are a few pages explaining the eight-step process for change that was taken from John Kotter's research and his earlier books on managing change. The pages aren't enough to get an in-depth understanding of Kotter's research, but for that, you will need to read Kotter's other work.<br /><br />The story was easy to read as it was simple (simplistic?). I found it mildly interesting. There wasn't much news in this book if you are already familiar with Kotter's research, but then again it doesn't take much time to read as the book is very thin. The book wasn't bad, but I would probably not recommend it to anyone either as it was definitively not a book that impressed me. I was thinking about 2 or 3 stars. Decided to go with 3 as it does seem to achieve its own purpose. Just ok.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Suzanne Collins did an excellent job bringing all the characters to life. Better than the movie.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was very funny! I couldn't put the book down and finished it in a day! Great Great Great Great!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|A well acted, great story and fiting end to the series...each of us will take away from this how we feel. a nice set up for anymore batman movies to come....
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought this recorder as an upgrade to my old digital recorder. I use it to conduct interviews and for video. So far its been awesome. I really can't find anything bad to say as of yet and i'm completely satisfied with this purchase
0375842209|5.0|The story of a German girl who loved books, her foster parents, her neighbor, and a Jew. The story about people who lived on a street named after heaven. The story narrated by death.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger is on her way to Molching (Himmel Street, to be exact). Her mother cannot afford to feed her or educate her, so she will be taken to her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. It is the beginning of many things for young Liesel. As we all know, where there's a beginning, there will be an end. And what and end it will be!<br /><br />This is, without a doubt, my favorite book. It's been my favorite since the first time I read it, which was about a year ago, I believe.<br /><br />I refrain from reading about anything that has to do with the Holocaust, because I'm a big fat crybaby. I am not ashamed to admit it, clearly. Whenever we had to read about it in school I would cry. Especially when I saw the pictures. Oh, god, the pictures! They were horrifying! One picture in particular always got to me.<br />I would just stare at the pages for a while, then burst out crying. Silently, of course, because being found crying in school is social suicide. Not that it mattered what others thought of me, I just didn't want anyone to see me in that state.<br /><br />The Book Thief set my soul on fire. And I didn't want it to stop.<br />I read the last sentence and I was left with a bitter-sweet feeling.<br /><br />All those people. The victims of Hitler. Not only Hitler, though, because he couldn't have done it alone. The victims of humanity. It hurts to even think about them. It's so different reading about it in a text book than it is reading it from this book. It intensifies itself somehow. In a history book, it sound terrifying, but not entirely true. In The Book Thief, however, you feel every ounce of everyone's pain. And it hurts. Every word punches you in the gut. It picks you up, spins you around, and tosses you halfway across the world. It leaves you wondering how. How could this have possibly happened? What was running through the mind of everyone in the world at that time? How could anyone see this happening and not do anything to stop it?<br /><br />Over 5,860,000 people DIED.<br />That makes me sick.<br />It makes me physically ill to think about that.<br />They were mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends. All dead.<br /><br />Overall, this book is one of the best things I have ever read. Nothing I say can do this justice.<br />Once again, it's the story of a German girl who loved books, her foster parents, her neighbor, and a Jew. The story about people who lived on a street named after heaven. The story narrated by death.<br /><br />I love this book so much that, if my house were on fire and I could only save one thing, it would be this book. And that's really saying something considering I own many, many books, including The Hunger Games trilogy.<br /><br />Yes, I said it. I would rather rescue The Book Thief from the fire than THG trilogy. Believe it, ladies and gentlemen. This book is that good!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|If you like completing quests in a game this one is for you. The only bad part is that you can lose your progress.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I love that I can create different notebooks and either use the typing or handwriting functions. I wish I didn't have to close a notebook before jumping to another.  Overall this is a wonderful app!  It keeps me organized during meetings.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game seems perfect for the tablet.  While the gameplay graphics are fine, the animation that plays when you complete a level are low res and very sturrey.<br />Needs to be optimized for tablet imho.
B007SGM084|4.0|Overall they were good books with very erotic story lines.  The first book kept me really heated up asking for more, but as the second and third books dragged on; I was getting really tired of the over used phrases and sadly even the eroticism started to not be inspiring. I kept reading them because I was vested in the characters and the author did try to tie up with a nice finish.  It was fun while it lasted.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I felt this movie was closer to what Pixar wants to do and less of a 'Disney' movie.<br />The scenes and visuals are just stunning and may require multiple viewings to truly appreciate.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|remake better than original though story line its little differnet., still like it both. two different si-fi movie trends in time or years. would see it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The suspense started from page 1 and continued to the last page.  One of Grisham's best books so far. Great read
B000BVMAJ2|4.0|My son absolutely loves Legos, and received this set for Christmas.  He already has quite a few Lego Duplo sets, so it is a nice add-on option for children who already have some basic block sets.  I would not call this a stand alone set though because it has only a few actual blocks in it.  The price for this set on Amazon was significantly less expensive than other retailers I checked; which is nice, because Lego Duplo sets can be quite pricey.<br /><br />Overall it's a good set, but I could only give it 4 stars because it wouldn't be a good set for anyone who doesn't already have other Lego sets.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|It was a good movie.i expected a little more out of it.but deff worth watching once.another batman all that needs to be said
B005LAII08|5.0|This movie is excellent, another hit from Pixar Animation.  The story line is basic enough for small children to follow, but complex enough for an adult to enjoy.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|This is obvious since any religion that calls all religions lies, including itself, is probably the correct on to belong to.<br /><br />I'm surprised it took me this long to finally read it. Vonnegut has firmly established his style by this one, Short sentences are good. Semi-colons are bad. Vonnegut doesn't use semi-colons. I use them too often. Learn to write by reading this,
B005S9EK1S|4.0|A great romantic drama adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel.<br />If you're in the mood for a good chick flick this is a great choice!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|And the thing with Vonnegut is this. You sometimes feel like editing him; you feel there should be more words and long luxurious sentences that meander along to delight the reader.<br /><br />Don't do it! Short sentences work. It's the order they come in that makes them work. Connecting sentences together to make a story is the trick.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I am addicted...quite fun ....graphics are awesome....thank-you I really like it ****I give you four stars working on fivehaving fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|You almost feel like a part of the game. The descriptive style doesn't leave much for the imagination to conjure.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Gave it a 5 star rating because it was well written, in a very pleasant and engaging style. Further, for me the book was very easy to understand.<br /><br />I recommend this volume to anyone interested in quantum physics, consciousness, workings of the mind, and even personality.

B000002J09|5.0|A very good album not their best one but very worth while getting nothing can compare with led Zeppelin II and Phsyical Graphitti<br />(bad spelling) worth getting.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was very emotional and intense. Katniss isn't the best protagonist but there are aspects of the story that can make up for that.

B0091Q82L8|5.0|.....and on the verge of musical transformation. This live concert bridges the gap between the street punks they started out as and the enlightened rogues they became.

B00000IZOR|3.0|I purchased this for my 14 month old. He loves phones and pulling toys around. The one big draw back is the length of the phone cord. To hold it to his ear while standing, the phone comes off ground. Overall good classic toy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it's a really addicting game. just very slow on consuming coins, only downfall I'd say. it's pretty fun though and a little bit of a strategy game as well.
B008M36ER0|4.0|Good,action movie. I didnt like all the subtitles. From what I understand a good look into what really goes on in a real Mexican prison.
B000FA675C|5.0|Brown had me hooked.  I could not put the book down although I had read it many years ago.  The suspense and intrigue made the pages fly by.  All the characters became real as I began to know them as real people.  I began to believe the story.  I was waiting and anticipating the finding of the ancient writings that proved the linage of Mary as the wife of Jesus.  The Templars and Opus Dei members guarded the secret.  The ending was completely unexpected.  Now I want to see the movie again!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|A fun debut novel by Bec McMaster! I very much enjoyed this entertaining PNR read; and it was so quick, that I’m almost sorry to see it end and will certainly look very much forward to book #2 next year.<br /><br />This novel introduces us to Honoria Todd, who is the eldest sister of three siblings, forced to flee their life within the Echelon society and settle in the rookeries under the watchful eye of the “Whitechapel devil” himself– Blade. Even though Honoria tries hard to stay under the radar, she can’t help but catch Blade’s eye. The secrets envelop her, and strange circumstances of why the Echelon has put a high price on her head make Blade only more curious. Will she be his salvation or his undoing? Their meeting sparks much more than secrets, pride and prejudice, but love and war as well.<br /><br />This novel tries to combine several genres within, and even though it is part of the London Steampunk series, it is much more a paranormal romance (and inventive at that). There are certain steampunk elements/machines thrown in here and there, but they don’t greatly interfere or are of any importance to the plot itself. The vampire mythology is quite different though, it is imaginative and intriguing.<br /><br />Like any other novels, certain aspects can be successful or not. I must warn the reader that there is quite a bit of steamy content in this novel, which was not distracting. However, what made me frustrated the most in the beginning, was figuring out the mythology and trying to determine the difference between a blue blood and a vampire. I felt the world building did not happen until much further point into the novel, if at all. The use of “accented” language was somewhat frustrating as well, but I gotten used to it after getting involved in the story. It certainly served a purpose, but not a great one at that – I could’ve done without it. Also, the ending felt rushed. I was a bit disappointed that the novel’s climax came to an abruptly, almost convenient ending. I thought Ms. McMaster would offer a much more intricate development of the conclusion.<br /><br />And then, there were Honoria and Blade…I almost loved to hate them at times. They were great characters, but at some points their obligatory storylines/sex scenes felt forced – I wished there was something less predictable about them, but nonetheless they were entertaining and I rooted for them to be together. A fairy tale must have its happy ending.<br /><br />At the end I would recommend this novel to those readers looking for a fun, entertaining, steamy PNR with steampunk elements. Happy reading!
B0011EVSGE|5.0|how can you not love this feel good movie! great cast, awesome music, very nostalgic.  This is our holiday classic!

0152164154|5.0|This is a gift for our daughter.  She is a high school French teacher.  She explained the book to us on Christmas day.  This is required reading in her French class.  The students do not like to read the book; however, after graduation, many of them call or write to her relating how much this book meant to them and purchased one for themselves.

B009POCG0Y|1.0|This is one of the worst films I have ever struggled through, Matthew McConaughey must have been desperate<br />to do this one. \\"Dark\\" hardly covers it. Even desperately trying to find redeeming comedic<br />undertones was impossible. You really should warn people off this one.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I've waited for every episode. I enjoy the interpersonal relationships play out between the actors. Wonderful excitement and drama that each episode contains. Can't wait for more!
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|i laughed so hard i peed a little.  not a movie for kids though unless your kids are super awesome
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Good book that is just a fun read.  Keeps you interested in what will be found in the store, and consequences that may follow.  Also shows a little about human nature.  And throws in a lot of computer experience as well.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|There are two things I wish... First I wish that I had read the reviews on this video before buying it, I mean I always read the Amazon reviews, but this time I didn't, and I regret it. The second is I wish that I could give this rating something less than a star; probably a tenth of a star would be too generous. This was such a disappointment and a waste of good money.<br /><br />DISNEY TOTALLY RUINED WHAT HAD BECOME A HOLIDAY TRADITION AROUND OUR HOUSE. Two of our favorite holiday movies were the Muppet Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life, it looks like we will be going back to It's a Wonderful Life and more than likely this disappointing Muppet Christmas Carol video will be put on the shelf.<br /><br />Disney in their infinite stupidity and utter ignorance has butchered a beloved Christmas classic and Scrooged a time honored holiday tradition. They removed a pivotal scene with the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" sung with Michael Cane. This was unexpected (as I said I should have read the reviews) and a major disappointment that ruined the rest of the movie for us. What were they thinking? I read the supposed reasoning for excluding it and think they have their head up their ass.  As usual for Disney, it is about what makes money for them rather than honoring the true spirit of the original version. I am hoping this and other reviews get out and they discover that this was the biggest bone head move they (Disney) could have made.<br /><br />Removing this key scene diminishes the story, ruins the cadence, and leaves the entire production meaningless. Disney needs to learn to keep their cotton picking hands off of perfection (which is what this was up until now).<br /><br />SO PLEASE, AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have the ipod version and I play it everyday. but I don't know if I want to buy this again. And is it really worth the seven bucks? All it is is a game with terrible graphics and its barely updated compared to the computer version.

0307887898|5.0|Test, test, and test....that what this book is all about. Instead of wasting your time on an idea that no one may care about, how about developing a MVP and testing it?<br /><br />I used this book to help launch my recent invention, the [[ASIN:B008YWRTB4 Sushiquik Complete Sushi Kit]]<br /><br />This should be a top 10 for all Entrepreneurs!
B0051MKMNC|4.0|This was a fun movie. I enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />If you never watched this movie and you consider yourself a mainstream movie watcher and generally are somebody that likes movies, then you will probably like this. If you are a critic and require an &#34;artsy&#34; and &#34;award-worthy&#34; component of some sort than you possibly may not care for this movie.<br /><br />The premise is we only use 20% of our brains, and what we would be like if we could access the whole thing. The main character basically does just that, and it makes him feel limitless.  It was a fun movie and I believe Bradley Cooper is appropriately casted for the role.<br /><br />Would recommend to those who haven't seen it.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This is the franchise's best movie. The cast has great chemistry. The movie was brilliantly directed and acted. There aren't many movies that I can watch more than once; this is a keeper and one I love to watch again and again.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We had missed the whole first season when we started watching season 2.  We love this show and every episode.  I recommend this to everyone that loves intrigue, mystery, military, government, cover-ups and conspiracy's.  This is a must have and we are so thrilled we purchased this.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Me and my family are big tabletop gamers, and we like to introduce gaming to our friends and family, and we have found out that this game is perfect for it!<br /><br />Since it doesnt involve the use of word or anything written, only imagination and knowing the people you are playing with, this game is ideal for ANYONE! It's hard to find good games that I can play with my spanish speaking friends, but this game has been a total hit, that even they wanted to buy a copy for themselves!<br /><br />Highly recommendable!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wraped it all up in the final book, The Mockingjay  is a good read and I would recommend it. Thanks
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Although the book was written well, the reader often feels caught up in a sub-plot that continues and continues as you wish and wait for the payoff of how this part fits in with the whole.  Ends as expected, but is overall an interesting read - just too predictable and overplayed.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|Red Riding Hood really doesn't deserve 2 stars.  It is really that outrageously bad.  I suppose I gave it 2 stars because it has certain \\"production values\\" that are somewhat interesting and, yes, it has Gary Oldman, who I am a big fan of, in spite of the fact that he plays a completely ridiculous character in this turkey.  My big question is--along with probably most people who have sat through this-is what in the hell is with that big, freaking metal elephant?  Who came up with such an absurd idea in the first place?  And the whole werewolf bit?  It's just all so incredibly STUPID and worse, badly scripted.  This flick almost makes the whole Twilight movie thing seem good and that's just scary.  The director would have done well to sit down and study Snow White and the Huntsman to see how to take an old story and breath new life into it.  But then again, I think this particular story for this particular purpose was DOA to begin with.  Again, 2 stars is being very generous.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Yep, all the good ones are here!<br />Original recordings too, not just a new &#34;design&#34;.<br />Great if you don't have her other albums
B000V39KDO|3.0|300 is another highly faithful graphic novel adaption of Frank Miller's, the first being Sin City.  Sin City became one of my favorite movies of all time, but 300 fell far short of that mark and barely made a &#34;3&#34; star rating from me.  I give it 3 stars primarily because of it's incredible CG work and the fact that despite it's general lack of a good script and poor dialogue, it still entertained me and kept me watching until the end.  With so many incredibly bad movies out there these days, that is no small feat.  I am highly inclined to simply shut movies off after about 20 minutes or so if I feel that they are so insulting to one's intelligence that they don't deserve to be watched.  So, while 300 is far less than a sterling movie, it at least had some basic entertainment value for me, which is not a bad thing.  However, I find movies like this with such constant over-the-top gore and fighting and destruction to get tedious in the extreme and that's primarily what this film delivers in abundance.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|One of the best quick-hitters on business and motivation that I've ever found. This is definitely a resource that I pull from every couple months or so, and anyone doing something where they have to totally rely on themselves will look at this as a must-have. There is no reason to not get this book, even if you've read the blog posts, because having them all in one place where you can annotate is a major plus.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was quite an amazing piece of work, from the acting to the astounding CG work.  This is one of those rare films I could watch many times without tiring of it.  It is an experience to be had and for me, quite a surprise.  I don't know what I was expecting.  I had been no real fan of Kristen Stewart, but her acting work in Snow White is very good.  I think I probably watched it because of Charlize Theron, who I've always enjoyed watching.  But whatever the reason, I am glad I did.  Any time a director can take such a well-known tale and turn it on it's head and make it into something so completely unique and imaginative certainly deserves a lot of respect, at least from me.
B000P0J09W|1.0|I love this movie which is why I ordered it.  Unfortunately the movie would not play all the way through.  It kept fast forwarding itself, and jumping scenes as if it were scratched.  I took the movie out, it had no visible scratches on it at all.  I put it back in and it did the same thing at the same scenes through out the movie.  I purchased a bunch of movies from Amazon for Xmas, I hope this is an isolated incident.  I will definitely be returning for a refund.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|If you're a fan of Charles Dickens, then this is the collection to have.  The price simply cannot be beat!  It's going to take me quite a while to get through all of these.  I don't see how anyone could find fault with this collection of some of the greatest writings by one of the world's all-time greatest writers.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This was a good buy. It was everything I expected. Lots of action. It came in only a few days.

B004KPQK2S|3.0|An ok horse race movie. Had a lot of anger and bad language! Our kids love horse movies but I've seen better!
6305511055|5.0|A thriller that keeps you on the edge of yor seat. Redford at his best. Very well written storyline, takes you on a wild ride.<br />Any of you that enjoy the Bourne Identity, Legacy would enjoy this film.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie is just a lot of fun; nothing serious here but that is what entertainment is all about isn't it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Very very good i like this book because it tells me definitions to words. my favorite word is yo-yo  and palindrome.
B007R0Y7VO|4.0|This is an entertaining movie fantasy but rather far fetched.  Overall, I would say it is pretty light fare but not a total waste of time.
B001706I5I|5.0|My kids loved Jim Carey in this role. No better person could pull it off.. So glad this movie kept the original tone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story continues with exciting adventures and monsters galore. Just like the previous books in this series, the excitement continues as the characters face another quest to save the world.
0756666937|5.0|Arrived very quickly and grandson loves it for Christmas, lego lovers will enjoy the book a lot, nice hard bound book
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Probably the best first season of a show ever. Second season is still good but nothing beats this first one.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I liked the fact this movie did not follow the original movie. Though it was similar, I liked the fact they found a new way to tell the story so it was not just a repeat of the first, with newer graphics.  The whole idea of the mutants was pretty much gone except for the previously mentioned woman.  There was a legitimate, but scetchy reason to have her in the original movie, but there was no reason for her inclusion in this movie. Other than that, I liked the story line changes.  The movie was very good.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Not a fan of making Batman a big wuss most of the movie. I know it's fantasy but some of the movie was just ridiculous.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I read this book on my iPhone standing in the subway without expectations or desires towards improving any skills as I have no intention of trying the recipes- I don't have time to cook elaborate meals; I read this book because I like Ferriss' writing. Surprisingly, this book did change some of my behaviors- I now drizzle the oil on my salad after the vinegar, and I prep all my vegetables before cooking them later. This book is an amalgam of a lot of disparate stuff (discovering my eye dominance was an unexpected, fun experiment), which Ferriss tries to excuse by claiming to aspire towards an anthology of everything he's ever learned. I don't know if Ferriss honestly anticipates the average reader finding the sections on scavenging instructive and then proceeding to cook inside a soda can or a pit hobo/caveman-style. Some of his insights on how to apply the 80/20 principle seem pretty useful, such as the shortlist of the main verbs that one should learn to conjugate in any language, with the intention of relying on infinitives for all other verbs. I don't know if his tips are better than what I would learn if I were to google each of these topics separately, but I would probably not have occasion to google \\"optimal way to shoot free throws\\" or \\"fastest way to learn a language\\" anytime soon. In general I find his approach inspiring and fun- if this crazy dude can at least begin to attempt to master these various fields, including cooking when he can't even identify basil, why can't I?
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Boring<br />More Boring<br />Most boring<br />So, one might ask, &#34;Why did I buy all three?&#34;  Answer:  I kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't!!!  For a while, &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; was all anyone could talk about.  Mothers didn't want daughters to know they were reading it and daughters didn't want to know their mothers were reading it.
0670451495|5.0|A favorite of my daughter's generation, I bought it for a young girl who loves animals.  She loved it too.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I loved reading this book. The story held my interest.  I can't say it's the most well written book I've ever read but the story more than made up for the writing.  I don't think I've read any other Kate Morton books,  I definitely will read her next one.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A great read to reflect on christmas and give the spirit we all need sometimes<br />Read on christmas eve, loved it
B0076DELIG|1.0|I couldn't wait for this book to be released.  I've enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's books.  But not this one.  I kept reading hoping it would get better.  For me, it never did.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My husband and I have watched them over and over and they are still so funny!! Can't get enough of them
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Three of the most boring books I have ever read; repetative and boring.  If you're looking for something good to read, don't waste your money on these.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Acting cast was not great, perhaps because of a low budget or poor directing. Given the great plot possible because of the Halo game, should have been much better.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Boring<br />More Boring<br />Most Boring<br />Why did I buy and read the second if I didn't enjoy the first?  I thought it would get better.  In this second book, I did like meeting his family.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I loved this product! Using this for your alarm clock day-to-day is no mistake! I used this and even though I am pretty hard to wake from my slumber, this got me right up! I would easily recommend this to anyone who uses alarms a lot or who needs help with getting to sleep.
0062200909|5.0|Bought this book, hoping for eye candy and inspiration to get me drawing again. It is everything I hoped for. The eye candy aspect is especially excellent.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I absolutely adored this book, from beginning to end. The action was intense, the characters were marvelous, and the plot was like a magnificent puzzle slowly revealing its inner workings. I cannot wait to read the next book in this trilogy, and I would strongly recommend this book to anyone.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had me gripped through the first 3 quarters. Couldn't stop thinking about it when I wasn't reading.<br />But then I got so disappointed and frustrated with how it ended that the whole experience was ruin.<br />The only reason I want friends to read it is so I can have someone else agree with me about how frustrating it was.
0763655465|5.0|My grandson enjoyed the story and the illustrations were marvelous. Very colorful, light and delightful  I certainly would recommend for all children
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was just as great and his last books! I loved it!! So read it and find out about it.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is awesome - simple, intuitive and totally addicting. Ads don't bother me. There is an issue sometimes where the screen goes black between games (like when a game is over), but that doesn't really bother me either. However, what DOES bother me is that the Apple versions of this app have a lot more features. As you play, you get points toward special rewards like \\"bomb deflecting swords\\" or special types of fruit. And these are not only pretty fun to play with but also make for a much higher-scoring game. There's also an \\"online vs.\\" mode where you can play other people. When will the Kindle version of the app get these extras?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very funny.great book. One of the best diary of a wimpy kid. You should read and rate this good  book
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This riveting English Novel is screened in best traditions of British cinematography. It presents excellent cast and scenery, a great family entertainment.

B006LSZECO|4.0|IT WAS A VERY GOOD READ AND NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I HAVE READ BY THIS AUTHOR BUT IT WON'T BE THE LAST.  A HARD BOOK TO PUT DOWN.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a nice and fun way to relax and I think anyone should have acsses to it even if they choose not to put a card numder on their kindle fire.

B000VK99Z6|5.0|Hillariously dark police action film!!  I love the dry humor that the screenwriter just expects you to know.  One of my favorite all time movies.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|Horses are fascinating animals and can do so much.  It is unbelievable that there are people who would abuse them so badly.  very enjoyable film.  We had seen it in the theater and decided to add it to our collection.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|It had lots of the ingredients of the first Bourne movies save Matt Damon but it just wasn't as good. The story was also not written by Robert Ludlum. They slapped the Bourne name on it and did seem to put quite a bit of money into chase scenes and effects but the story was disjoint and I found it hard to get too invested in any of the characters. I kind of followed the story but at times, it just wasn't well glued together. I watched it at home and found my attention straying. My wife left mid-movie.
B002V79VJ6|5.0|Have all of the Bond films on DVD and enjoy watching them.  Also enjoy comparing the various actors playing the part of Bond and also M and Q.  It's very interesting to see how the series has evolved.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|My son has lots of nerf guns. This one shoots good but requires 4 AA batteries. I think they went a little too complex with the design and using the lever to change clips is a bit awkward. Overall its just an OK nerf gun.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Interesting take on the game.  The writers have very good imaginations and have put a different slant on alien invasion.  The story of the young officer who came through under fire is also quite interesting.
B005LLX582|1.0|Indulgent and fake... so tired of Malick trading on his earlier successes.  It's like the Emperor's new clothes.  There is nothing there
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The young lady is determined that her marriage will not be arranged.  She and her parents also learn that compromise is acceptable.
B000001E3V|5.0|Fabulous music from the the best band Eric Clapton ever had! The only thing that could be better is if someone would re-release the classic \\"Derek and the Dominos in Concert\\" in CD in this country.  It was recorded at Fillmore East while this one was recorded at Fillmore West, during the same time frame, but is even better.  It is extremely rare anymore which is surprising. Nevertheless, this is truly great stuff from a band that existed only briefly but set the standard for blues rock forever.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Enjoyed it! Right out of the movie, sounds great and gets your emotions running all over again just like the movie!
B008M721MS|5.0|This is a wonderful way to stay in touch with our family and friends that live so far away from us!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Bought this book after reading a review of the new Tom Cruise movie.  I was initially put off by the extreme staccato brevity of Mr. Child's writing style, but the pace of the book got me hooked.  Eventually the short sentences seemed to naturally fit the personality of Jack Reacher as he told the story in the first person.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Entertainment at it's very  best! Great Buy! Dexter series is worth every penny. Give the gift the keeps on scaring!
1401307450|4.0|This book was a very open and honest portrayal of Anthony Kiedis's life so far. His account of his childhood really made me understand him a lot more. The language can be raw but his experiences kept me turning pages.
B009ZE27US|1.0|don't care if it is a gag app or not... right thumb 40 years old left thumb 34 and my sexy young girlfriend is 34 also... at least according to this crap... lame stupid boring and waste of space on my device
0307352145|5.0|I always wondered if something was wrong in the interactions I had with people. This book introduced us to many powerful introverts and made me realize that I'm okay. It also gave great tips on teaching extroverts what we are about and how to work with others. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B004WR125O|5.0|THE ADAPTER MET ALL EXPECTATIONS, AS SOON AS I PLUGGED IT UP IT WORKED. THIS LAN HAS MADE THE RECEIVER THAT MUCH BETTER
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No.  This is awesome.  First, it's definitely more A than Y.  I'd censor it to age 17, due to some sexuality.  But contrary to some YA/New Adult authors, the sensuality is not attention-seeking, it fits.  It adds to the characters.<br />Second, WOW!  Powerful story.  I had a plot suspicion, but it didn't go quite where I'd thought it would've.<br />Third, I felt like the book was on its way over frequently due to some plot resolutions, then I was so happy there was still alot of book left.  Otherwise, I'd had some serious TEAB (the end of a book) lingering afterwards.<br />How has Colleen only surfaced a year ago?  She's my hero!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This thing runs smooth! I would recommend doing yourself a favor and get a solid state boot drive to complement this bad boy. You do not want to be limited by a mediocre hard drive when you have this power house under the hood.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|While reading about Sky and Holder, I felt like I was a part of their world. I didn't want any chapter breaks from Hopeless.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Good direction for the story. Book 2 doesn't disappoint.<br />A thrilling ride that keeps you guessing. Reading #3 next. Yep.
B005LAII12|5.0|It is hysterical would recommend it to everyone, Mark Wahlberg was great in this movie can watch it over and over and never get tired of it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|To think, to live beyond legend, beyond infamy,, and to finally find your place in life beyond where you first breathed life. I am glad Ender finally found peace. But who will speak for him when it's his time? Now that will be an interesting time. And of course time will tell or should I say... Speak
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is just like 50 shades of grey.. but it was good. Couldnt put it down! I loved it!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app is just absolutely wonderful!!! I can now play Civilization V,post on the Minecraftforums,etc. straight from the toilet! I will use this whenever I get the chance to.<br /> Yes,I do have to admit it's not perfect,but it's very close to. It does need tweaking,but overall it's absolutely great.<br /><br />Some suggestions:<br />-automatically go to keyboard when you tap a space that's is possible to type on.<br />-have a mini mouse on the side (enabled/disabled in settings)<br /><br />Unfortunately that's the only suggestions i currently have.<br />Remember keep up the good work!
B004RE29PO|5.0|This was a gift and was well received. The picture is greately improves fron the VHS. Also the sound track is much better.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Pretty good. Not nearly as great as the other wimpy kid books, though. The other wimpy kid books had multiple plotlines.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is such a great dvd. My kids love it. I highly recommend Brave! Makes a great addition to any collection
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|people should not have you say that this is a bad app for kids to use especially cause they're board
B008M721MS|5.0|i like it a lot.i get to see my grandkids  in texas. this is great. wish i had this sooner.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|From reading some of the reviews, you'd think this season was mastered from VHS tapes!  Quite the contrary, from what I've seen so far, I'm seeing the same quality as season one with the exception of a few issues - some of which are due to the film stock itself.  Many people have already seen the \\"cloaked\\" enterprise as it leaves the orbit of a planet on \\"A Schizoid man.\\"  If I hadn't been looking for this, I doubt I'd really have seen it.  And by the time the ship is most of the way off the screen, the \\"mistake\\" had filled the edge properly instead of hanging a few pixels off the edge of the screen.  As for planets, to me they appear more like the originals.  Yes, I've seen one with clouds so small and uniform it looks pixelated, but for the most part they look okay.  I'm not complaining about the season one planet work, but the original planets were just a blurry mush of clouds with different colors for the different planets.  Yes, season one remasters has planets where you can see land masses and fine cloud detail, but that wasn't in the original episodes.  To me, season two just goes back to the original look of the planets having banded clouds kind of like Jupiter.  As for film grain, as others have noted, there are many shots that appear very grainy compared to others, but even on the extras, people working on the show admit that they were trying different film stocks in season two.  If you want to fault someone for grainy video in the blu-ray, fault the original producers for using bad film.  By the way, audio seems first rate from what I can tell so far.<br /><br />If you're quite anal about the most minor speck of grain, or a few times the warp nacels look turquoise as opposed to blue (which could very well be due to film stock), don't buy the set!  Go ahead and cut off your nose to spite your face!  Just let the rest of us enjoy one of our favorite shows looking like it was created today.  And we'll complain about something worth complaining about - like the extreme compression and harsh clipping of almost all music put out on CD in the last 15 years!!!
B00138EV8U|5.0|I love this sound track!  It makes me happy to be able to listen to it on my new Kindle!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Doesn't show entire news feed, can't like anything. Might as well not have an app at all. :( , needs to work right to be effective.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the long weather prodiction and the instant weather of the day for our area. I comes in handy when I miss the news.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|If you just want all 8 films on DVD this is great! It's nice and compact packaging. The disks are the exact same as the 1st disks from all the other releases, some disk do have a few features but mainly its just the DVDs.<br /><br />This will hold you over to be able to wait to get the other giant box sets, until WB figures out that they actually want to give us all the bonus features.
B005HSL626|2.0|I put this game on my kindle for my 6 year old twin boys to play they love it. I have not played it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Have enjoyed Grisham's stories in Ford County in earlier work.  This seemed like something he just cranked out with shallow characters and an implausable plot.  Grisham may not be out of ideas....this story had potential...but it is written like he does't care anymore.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|awesome ilove this game good great like love yada yada yada yada good good godd good good good<br />goid goid good
B008ROGZUU|4.0|Angela Gheorghiu and Bryn Terfel have been around for a while - they give give dependably good to excellent performances and here ,as expected, they are fine. Jonas Kaufmann is becoming one of most exciting singers around- Verdi, Bizet and Wagner-he does them all and gives dependably great  performances.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|It doesn't support my printer. I have an Epson XP-300 and its not in there please fix asap. I really Ned this for my kindle at work. Thank you!
B000068UXF|3.0|Disappointing. I read a review that made this sound much better than it is - it's not terrible, but it never takes flight
B00A50PE6K|1.0|Unlike volumes 1&2 this one is boring....so disappointed in it. Songs suck and it was boring...sorry gle this one isn't a keeper
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is as perfect a game as will ever be released.  If you like RPGs and even if you don't, buy this game.  The best game made for the PS2 is even better on the Vita.  There is no reason to pass this by.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Haven't gotten very far yet but Jewels Star is nice visually and everything seems to be working right. Plus, there are some fun effects to enjoy. A nice, simple puzzle game.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I could never figure out how to play no instructions  so, I don't guess I will play this one much
0470901071|4.0|This is a good book to get prepared for the CCNA exam along with other tools.  I recommend people study all the book and use other tools.
B000SGRONM|3.0|there is a quite a few short stories in this book. some are ok then some i just rather skimmed through. The Santas elf story was the best
B009JBZH54|1.0|Purchased this item as a Gift and The Dark Knight Rises CD is missing. Only came with 4 of the 5 CD's. I will be returning it for a refund.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|I love live music, and prefer seamless gaps between songs. If this sounds like you,<br />then you'll love this app too.
0385344228|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book.  Fourteen year old Jacob Barber is charged with the murder of his classmate.  This book drags a little bit in parts.  Also, I didn't feel sympathetic towards any of the characters.  I would have thought I'd have identified with Jacob's mother, but her character was really underdeveloped.  Jacob is hard to like and hard to root for.  There were interesting plot twists and towards the end the book was hard to put down.  But it is definitely a sad, depressing book, especially in light of recent events (school shootings).  It makes you think about how far you would go for your child and how much you know your own child.  The story itself was a good one, but I just wish there was a little more \\"feeling\\" or that at least one of the characters was a hero type that I could really root for.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love the DVD. Great condition and for the price it is worth it. This shows always bring me good memories about my younger years. Love it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector is another hit for Clancy. I can visualize the movie it may be with Ben Afleck  again starring as Jack Ryan jr. Again.<br />The book setting was perfect for today's geopolitical landscape and it was great to read about the same characters continuing their role in the storyline.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Love this album every song on it is very good. I listen to it every day sense i bought it.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|While I agree with some other reviewers that the editing is a bit &#34;jumpy&#34;, the performance is totally top-notch.  In my opinion, the best Led Zeppelin concert ever.  Granted, they are older and don't engage in the extensive &#34;jamming&#34; like they did forty years ago, but they are spot-on in musicianship and sound.  It is fantastic and inspiring.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the book!  After reading several accounts of NDE, Dr. Eben's account of his experience confirmed my thoughts on the issue.  I have read all of the Elizabeth Kubler- Ross books on 'Death & Dying' yet 'Proof of Heaven' gave much more incite on the real experience.  I feel that at some point I may re-read Proof of Heaven because the first read was so engrossing, that I read it very fast  .A second read will possibly give me a deeper incite.  If Dr. Eben's account is true, it serves to take away some fear of the unknown after death.
B002PL5GTC|5.0|Personally, I am a picky vinyl person. Some bands you listen to on LPs and wonder, &#34;Why the heck would someone make this?&#34; but this band... This band ABSOLUTELY needs to be heard on vinyl.<br /><br />importcds shipped my vinyl next day and I received it 3 days after.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is slightly warped from heat, but I cannot blame the seller or distributor because they do sit in the heat sometimes. It is perfectly playable.
B003QSOE0U|1.0|The only redeeming feature of this film is the special effects depicting the Pearl Harbor attack.  The screen play and the story line are awful--predictible and cliched.  Watch it to see Hollywood at its worst.  This film pales by comparison with &#34;Tora, Tora, Tora.&#34;
B00782O7IY|5.0|I bought this for a granddaughter who loved the movie. I thought it was an innovative, enjoyable movie too and would recommend it to those who enjoy the classics.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Based on a true story is always a plus for me. If you're looking for a feel good movie for the family movie night, this is it!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I bought this for relatives who have limited TV access. I thought it was one of the best HBO productions and they thoroughly enjoyed watching it too.
B004UID2LC|1.0|As  best as I can tell this didn't work in my tablet as it said the youtube video downloaded but I couldn't find it. The TubeMate downloader worked great, however
B000A7DVR2|5.0|What can I say?  This is just a classic and a must have for any movie enthusiast!  The dude abides!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This program was easy to use, and worked perfectly.  I had tried others and this is the one that worked best for me.
0525952926|5.0|The opening of  Winter of the World did not pull me into the book as quickly as Fall of the Giants.  Actually, I was a third of the way and then the magic began.  I learned some things about the Nazis and their methods of torture that I didn't know.  The characters were well developed and I am looking forward to the third book. Again, Mr. Follett has written a book that I delay finishing only to find myself back in the real world and wondering how the lives of the people involved will evolve.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Thing I like about Follet novels is his attention to small details, like what people ate in medieval  times. Also, not a direct sequel to Pillars of the Earth, but equally entertaining. Barely lasted a 3 hour flight.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome but they should make it like Indiana Jones where you could slide under traps that shoot arrows at you that would be awesome
B0083DJWGO|1.0|I bought this book after reading an excellent book summary that the author published in the Wall Street Journal.  The book itself would have benefited from a judicious editor.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|bought this dvd for my girl its one of her favorite holiday movies so the price was great for this classic and the quality is just as expected
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is your typical search and find game with a storyline. The music is great with the background and the story is pretty good so far.
B000YHG72E|5.0|bought this dvd for my girl its one of her favorite holiday movies so the price was great for this classic and the quality is just as expected
B005BY3XHC|5.0|the writer made it so simple and easy to read, so that you can get his point smoothly, it gives the reader access to their inner power and potentiality of their being.
1451695195|5.0|Loved, very compelling. I would recommend everyone read this book. It is one you can't lay down. Since we are all going there some day, you should read it,
B008BM9L72|3.0|I found the books quite average, too much groaning etc and the story itself excluding sexual bits was poor. The first book was interesting but once getting to the second and third, I found myself skipping the sexual scenes just to get back to the story itself.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was ok. i thought that it should not been released as a book and it should of just had meanings. That is what a dictionary is made for
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a great app for young children! Lots of artistic options and great for long road trips. I recommend,
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|awesome weather app!  Definitely a must have for the android.  I love the HD look to it and it works great with my nexus
B008NW67E0|4.0|So of course I like Mumford & Sons or I wouldn't have bought the album. There are some great songs on here but it does get to where it all sounds the same after a few play throughs.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious! One of the best movies I've seen this year. Anna Kendrick was awesome. Good song selection and great voices. Definitely 5 stars.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|My grandson told me about it.  It's tricky but as I work on it becomes more fun.<br />I had to contact him to see exactly how to do the game.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of our favorite holiday movies! Am very satisfied with the quality of the DVD we received! Overall satisfied. thanks!
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun to kill time. works great on the kindle fire. occasionally freezes so maybe an update would fix the problem.
B004IV32HU|5.0|Weird wrapped in bizarre and hidden in period comedy, photographed in glorious black & white.  I saw this fim in Highland Park, IL, in 1994.  I remembered \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space,\\" so my fiancée, who had not seen any Ed Wood films, agreed to go.<br /><br />Well, it was a real hoot.  The film opened just like a real Ed Wood film, only this film was really interesting to watch -- unlike a real Ed Wood film.  Martin Landau steals the show -- for which he won an Academy Award.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season two has alot of good twists and turns to keep you on you're toes! Jessica Lange (Sister Jude) is a great \\"twisted soul\\".
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Very good adventure game. Puzzles were not very difficult. Topic was interesting. Graphics look nice. Looking forward to the next game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love It!!!  Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel.........................................  Love It............................. Love It..........................<br /> One of the best books I have read.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It is a great book in every way. I love the characters. Simply amazing! Fantastic job you did Jamie McGuire!
B000PWQPAC|5.0|This answered many of the questions that fans of the original series had by the end of the second and final season. If you want to know a little more about how things &#34;turn out&#34; this is worth picking up. Especially at this price and for the sake of completing the collection.
