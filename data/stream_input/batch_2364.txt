B00785P2QC|5.0|When I first got this I said it was boring then for a little then I started doing all the goals and it got really really REALLY cool!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I enjoyed the acting of everyone in this movie. Daniel is always the most professional actor and he portrays Lincoln as a gentle soul who had intelligence and wit. Well Done to the director and all of the other actors in this movie. It is well worth seeing.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Not as expected.. Did not like this app, too busy, too many adds.  Games were chincy and childish.  Promptly removed..
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I bought this in order to view the photos I had taken with my Kindle Fire HD. When I couldn't find my photos, I followed instructions from others as to what to do, I bought the ES File Explorer and immediately I was able to see the photos I had taken.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Believe it or not.. some of these puzzles you really have to use your thinking cap to figure out.. :)
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|It no longer works. It said it stopped working and I don't know why.  It gives no explanation as to what to do once it says it has stopped working.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Let me start by stating that I am a Joss Whedon fan.  His firefly series was excellent.  I guess everyone has a bad day.  His story line for this movie is uninspired.  The writing is below the level of most comic books.  Most of the actors seemed to be cashing a pay check.  Scarlett Johansson was miscast.  A true 100 pound imposter.  And she and Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Banner mumble their lines.  There is a spark when Robert Downey, Jr. is on the screen.  Scenes like the fight between Thor and Iron Man were illogical and contrived.  Thor is made to look like more of a stupid brute than Hulk.  Iron Man, Captain America and Thor are better films.  I hate saying that because I wanted to liike this film a lot.  I am not sorry I watched this film, but I am sorry I purchased the DVD.  I hope Whedon gets back on his game for the inevitable sequel.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I enjoyed this immensely. The plot, acting and tone of the movie was gripping. I highly recommend this movie. I find that I'd like to see it again.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|This is a solid spinoff of Doctor Who. I wish they would continue the series. If you are a fan of Capt. Jack you will like.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Very good movie which depicts an alcoholic's faulty reasoning and actions. Even though he is a hero, as only Denzel can do so well, it was a bit rough to see him be wrong, and then to admit it was hard but a great lesson for everyone.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Well, first with the good.  The case is of a good quality for the price.  I'll probably buy another one for that reason alone if needed.  The screen protector is crap.  It's better than the super thin ones, but it is still garbage to try to get on without bubbles.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to very easily connect with my friends on Facebook through this app. It is a valluable tool.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will have a lasting effect on you if you have ever been loved or loved someone who is no longer with you.  Read it.
B005TMSN4E|2.0|adds option to add Nikon and other lenses to a very small camera defeats purpose of having small camera advantage. Returned to amazon. I have Nikon 200 for large lenses. Another useless purchase for me, Maybe you'll like it. I didn't
0375842209|2.0|hassle getting the book in large print for my elderly mother. Ordered several times, each time was small print?? She said the book was ...odd but she's 85 yrs old :)
B001HN69B8|5.0|I went into this movie knowing what I was in for. I'm a fan of Terry Gilliam, even... nay, especially... his films that boggle other people's minds. While the premise is a tad labyrinthine, the artful execution is fantastic. And the way Heath Ledger's untimely demise was handled was brilliant.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|There were too many digressions from the original story.  Furthermore, we were dismayed to realize that two more movies were required to complete the story.
B001CDLATE|1.0|I read the reviews and thougth this would be interesting, but I was very disapointed, all I saw was povery.<br />I would like to get rid of this CD. it make me sick.
B006F8HZYK|5.0|I have. used this book countless times as a tool to help in everything from term papers. To research proposals. It is a must have for writers at any level.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|Well researched and written.  I am a veteran of that war and found it most informative.  I finally uncovered a narrative<br />that explains the whole story.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game..I can play it with my Facebook friends and i enjoy competing against them because my friends are very competitive... I recommend this game to everyone...
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent - I enjoyed it immensely. Dan Brown is a good writer and the Da Vinci Code is very well written. i would highly recommend it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this game very entertaining and you get to build homes in a tree very cool game..<br />I would recommend it to my family and friends...
B009KEN87O|5.0|No one can say that this game is not well put together. interesting if redundant gameplay but very entertaining. twenty
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Now I understand why this movie is a must-see! It is fantastic! If you don't see this movie, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life!!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I appreciate that Eastwood's character was raw.  But this picture did not need such a raw portrayal.  For me it took away from the story and enjoyment of the whole.  Amy Adams was the bright spot - a good balance of vulnerability and confidence.  A good watch, but I had to look past a lot of negative vibes to get a few positive ones.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan, or even if you're not, this is one of those \\"must-have\\" CD's.Both CD's are<br />over-the-top good.Every song is excellent as these guys are in a class by themselves...
B0000542D1|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theatre when the movie came out in 1964 I was 7 years old at that time when the Beatles first came to America. I was fascinated by their performances as actors, whoever directed this film captured the fans in a big way, I highly recommend this movie to people who's lives were influenced by these four stars from Liverpool England The Beatles.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Love this artist and his choices on this album are different but catchy!!  Definitely one album not to miss!! A hit!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Due to a divorce and cross country move, I lost track of this show and missed the last half of the closing season after faithfully watching all previous episodes.  Thank you for letting me catch up! :-)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the only series made for television that I watch! I have always been a huge zombie fan going back to the &#34;Night of the living dead&#34; and then the original &#34;Dawn of the dead&#34;. In this series it's much more about the characters, their interaction and struggle to stay alive. The downside is ,now I have to wait until the next season starts. It's a long time til October. LOL
0316227706|5.0|I don't really get it but she loves it and therefore so do I.  Another coffee table book among many.
B004X4RU9I|5.0|Ip man 2 was very well done, it follows Ip man through the aftermath of Japanese occupation, going from riches to rags, to where  Ip man begins his very first martial arts school, and ultimately defends the honor of Chinese culture/martial arts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This original series on AMC brings me so much joy! It is one of my favorite ones, without a doubt.
0316056863|5.0|Very funny book with lots of great stories. Wirtten from a great perspective for ambitious women. Great light read for vacation.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is a fantastic film.  Good service, all that jazz.  Seriously, if you read the original spec script for the film you can see how much depth Gabriel Byrne added to his character: it was totally written differently.
B005C5QS9A|5.0|Will definitely use this as a resource to return to when looking for thorough, reliable information to plan my classes.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I have read a number of Nicholas sparks books and I am always saddened by loss either through death or medical.  Safe haven and The Lucky one have had a good ending.  I have seen the movies if a lot of them and I do like them.  I just don't like to be sad at the end of a good book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very user friendly - glad it is able to downloaded to my kindle - don't have to carry a separate calculator
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a wonderful novel that lured me into reading all the time!<br />It was simply amazing to experience all together.
B00471TLZS|5.0|I really like the movie. If your looking for a message, it has one. Birth control. But seriously it's a classic movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is not a no boring thing it is just like the original minecraft<br /><br />  This is a awesome game and you can see the world
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was a sweet story but I felt like it was missing something. Good moral and the lesson can apply to everyone. I would recommend it to friends and family.
B0097C8XL0|2.0|Not my type of game. I am not really a video game player and this reminded me of a video game
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|More to this movie than meets the mind, at first watch. A movie about life. A movie about death. A movie about what we do with the time we have. Very well written. Very well directed. Top quality movie.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The good and other side of Jobs. Steve had some words of wisdom for our political leaders, but most think they are too smart to do what he recommends. His comments about engineers and needs in building a plant in the US should be done. Finally what a testament to building products with the idea of functionality and simplicity as most important.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie numerous times. So do my grandchildren, and one of them asked for this as a birthday gift. The arrival of the gift was timely, and condition excellent!
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is a real eye opener!  There are a lot of foods out there that we are told that's good for us and necessary to be healthy and it's simply not true!!
0470450266|5.0|Very well explained. Great for beginners and experienced artists alike, this book can greatly expand your knowledge of anatomy and proper Zbrush tools and methods to achieve an ideal figure. The DVD included should be watched in conjuction with reading the book lessons to achieve the best possible results.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Sons of A is an excellent series. I just started watching it during 2013 and am now up to season 4.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Man of action, defends the weak, connects the dots, kills the baddies, wins the girl, accepts no kudos, and disappears into the night. Old fashioned hero. Easy read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is free frantic finger fun just download it trust me you have nothing to lose but ya freedom if the inspector gets ya.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this one is great, I highly recommend it.  a must see and a must buy.  my favorite to date by far
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The only real way to appreciate this is to read it. To attempt a description and review would spoil many plot points. It's extremely well written with a great understanding of the characters. Highly recommended.
0547564651|5.0|Paul Tough has brought together important research and anecdotal data reinforcing the value of non-cognitive learning as a pathway for success.  Teachers at all levels need to read this brief but essential work.  Teaching and Learning for success is not a a one way street. The current emphasis on high stakes testing is limiting to students, teachers, and parents.  Tough encourages us to choose another way.  As Margaret Mead said, &#34;Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.&#34;  How Children Succeed points educators in the right direction.
B008220C38|5.0|The acting, sets and costumes are all magnificent.  I particularly enjoy watching Keira, her mesmerizing emotional interpretation of Anna. This movie will appeal to all those who appreciate British productions of classic tales.  One can watch it many times and become a part of this fantasy for a time that no longer exists.  A movie CAN entertain without continuous foul language and brutality, in fact, I don't watch the &#34;contemporary&#34; productions, or very rarely.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in 2 days because it was so hooking. Many twists and turns. Love story. Mystery. Suspense. All in one. Great book!! I highly recommend it!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|The game itself was fun to play but without logging in or purchasing additional lives you are limited to five lives and the game is over.  This means a very short play time.  Not worth the effort.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|This is a good weekend watch. This movie is funny on MANY levels and particularly if you have reached 40.
B004UID2LC|1.0|ever time I want to see a video it freezes! I hate it. Worst app ever made for youtube! So disappointing. :(
0345529057|5.0|I'm not going to ramble on about these- the books are great, and if you're considering reading them, this collection's a good way to go, price-wise. They're a good read, and this is one of the better ways to get the first part of the series. Happy reading!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|ok I like it and all but there's 2 flaws, 1. you can only watch music videos and 2. once you watch a video after the video there's one you didn't even request! so I have to push the back botten all the time. but I like how it doesn't freeze on you.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|But I will admit that I don't quite have the love for 'em that he does! If you're a fan of the franchise, this movie pack is definitely for you- we'd never seen two of the movies, so it was a real treat for our son to have all of them.
B003008RWA|1.0|It's funny this movie is produced by an obese guy. Boring, and basically full of BS.  Would give 0 stars.
1435133439|5.0|Treasure Island is a classic pirate adventure story!  I recently watched the 2012 TV movie &#34;Treasure Island,&#34; and since I had not read this story as a kid, decided to read it as an adult.  I can't believe I missed out on this adventure as a kid!  The descriptions of the pirates and of life at sea and on the island are vivid and imaginative.  The character Jim Hawkins is relatable and likeable.  Definitely a fun bedtime story for kids - and adults!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this.  It is a little predictable but kept my attention until the end.  Nicholas Sparks always knows the way to my heart.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Too drawn out.  I have always enjoyed his book and his humour.  Humour was still there though this time I got a little tired of it, partly because the plot was not going anywhere.  It took the whole book (almost) to get to the action and that was the last couple of chapters.  It's okay for an okay read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book drew me in.  I kept thinking about it after I put it down and felt compelled to go back to it at every chance I had.  I even stared to search for stories that are similar to it when I finished it,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you enjoyed the story of the fallout series you'll seemlessly slip in to this great story. Howey creates a marvelous world within a world and makes you feel that you are there, that you are a dear friend to the characters, and that all that happens is happening to you. A must read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it! My Horse, Gulliver is Awesome.. It could be better by faster energy!!<br />It's still pretty addicting though!! I love Horses so that's a good thing. IT SO GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE HORSES JUST LIKE ME!!!<br />U should get it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely outstanding. If you have not read this book, you need to. It is the best thing i have read in years. Its much less predictable and stereotypical than a lot of books lately. If you are thinking about getting the Omnibus of the first five books, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book, although begin to suspect that Max had something going on the side halfway through the book.
1451629184|4.0|Great book.  It is unthinkable that there are such sick people in this world who prey on children.  Her horrible journey based on her journal, this one will touch your heart.
B007HO392S|5.0|The lyrics are awesome! 100% Carrie, true and true. I love all her music, didn't watch Idol either, true sound to voice
B003RT0NK8|3.0|Not a movie I would venture out to see. Made well but the story is week and just like the other \\"save the earth\\" movies.
0316286850|5.0|That about sums it up (read subject).  This is the fourth time I've bought this book as a gift, that speaks volumes in-and-of-itself.  Great how-tos and tutorials about items that are useful and some that are advanced.  Don't get overwhelmed with the first few pages.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I bought this album almost immediately after it came out in 2005...I was disappointed. The best tracks, in my opinion, are \\"Human After All\\", \\"Robot Rock\\", and \\"Technologic\\". It's a far cry from their previous effort, the absolutely amazing \\"Discovery\\" album. \\"Prime Time of Your Life\\" and \\"Emotion\\" are just plain awful.  The other songs are OK enough to pass the time until \\"Technologic\\". The title of this album is spot-on, they are human after all and make mistakes just like the rest of us.  I give this album three stars for each of the songs I think are the reason this album is worth anything.
B008C20TDG|1.0|As a Kindle version, not so great.  It was hard to go back and reference the lists of &#34;yes&#34; food and &#34;no&#34; foods.  I actually went back, paid again, and bought the tactile book version so that I could reference and dog-ear pages.<br />As a book, very interesting read.  I did a slightly modified form and have found answers to some plaguing health questions I had.  Very cool indeed and it did, in a way, change the way I look at food.
B00756GKBA|4.0|As always, I have big expectations of Madonna.  I wasn't too fond of her first single initially, but it grew on me.  The rest of the album is awesome, my favorite being \\"Gang Bang\\".  She keeps things current on this album just like she has always done.  I would say this one is a good mixture of her two previous albums.  Not my favorite of hers but it's a good buy for any Madonna fan.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|Loved the book!<br />Seems like he was actually there and went through all of this. Looking forward to reading the next one.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Really fun me and my sister play this game all the time u can even update it and get new people. Good game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I read by Colleen Hoover and I couldn't stop reading until I finished it.  The pace was fast but the story still felt very complete.  I was emotionally invested from the beginning and was so happy about the full circle conclusion.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Ok, I got this app it is ok I can feed him and stuff,but he will not deepest what I say
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show well writen actors play off each other very well ........Best Zombe show ever even if you do not like Horror zombie movies you will be drawn into this show it is that well done ....
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Love this show it was my favorite on mtv and now I get to watch it all the time plus the movies
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game overall, but I don't like that you have to buy diamonds. you can earn them but at a really slow rate.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The previews will have you thinking this is purely comedy, but there is at least as much drama/seriousness in it. Which I like about it!  I think the acting is good all around and there is a lot of &#34;true&#34; stuff going on it it, about relationships, family dynamics, how economics will mess with things, etc.  But with one-liners and humor to keep you interested.  I think folks expectations were too high because of all the other mega-hits of the director.  This is a nice flick.
0740748475|5.0|Then I feel badly for your childhood. My 10 year old doesn't mind when I pull her from her computer, if she can read this excellent collection from a brilliant mind. Highly recommended.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Be stretched it was a short book that would have made one good movie. Three movies makes it, sadly boring.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who doesn't like this program. I could watch it over and over. To bad Matthew had to die. Great series.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Definitely one of Dan Brown's best!! There's such an amazing amount suspense and thrill!! And a great twist at the end.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I am a big Les Mis fan, although the original London cast is my favorite.  Alfie Boe is a great Valjean,Nick Jonas is ok - you can tell he's used to singing into a microphone, he just can't project as well as the other performers.  All in all very enjoyable.
B007THA4FI|2.0|To me this was over rated and hard reading.To many good books to get bogged down in on badly written novel ,which is my opinion.I am sure other people love it as it was on the best seller list.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I don't like the background sounds and there's so much going on as you play that it becomes a little confusing.
B00BWU0S3Q|3.0|This film WAS entertaining for those who like action movies.  Lots of violence, and a large portion of it had firearms at it's core.  The character development was mindful of the character assembly of \\"The Seven Samurai\\" and \\"The Magnificent Seven\\".  The movie is based on historical facts, some of which are \\"nudged\\" a bit in order to fit in to the story's flow, and the setting of the late 1940's was authentically maintained throughout the film.  The flow of the story is artfully created and maintained as well, and the acting was commendable.  I thought Sean Penn's character was made very \\"believable\\" due to his abilities as an actor - his portrayal was exemplary. Mireille Enos (of AMC's \\"The Killing\\") brought authenticity to a difficult role - and she did it well.  Mireille Enos is an actress to watch ... she's on the rise, and rightfully so.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I bought this because I was having trouble getting to sleep and needed something to read. Big mistake, since I stayed up all night reading it. It keeps you guessing and the end is unexpected... at least I didn't see it coming.
B00992CF6W|4.0|when trying to get skin, texture pack, or mod it says unauthorized request. please help im begging you.<br />Also i tried pockst tool
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun game, works better then most for free. Could b alittle clearer on were things r but overall a very good game
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Pretty much what I expected from this book. It had great examples and was written in an easy go read format. Her points are well thought out.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Use it all the time, especially the 10 day forcast.  I get the weather info I need when I travel, so I am prepared for all weather conditions,  I highly reccomend this to anyone interested in the weather forcast in their area or anty other area in the US.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was awesome<br />Tinsletown to bed at me for about two weeks ago I was all the most historical society of the lost hero
B000N2HBSO|5.0|best book on Lincoln ever if you are a history buff or if you are a fan of him get this
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyable book. Well crafted and kept me guessing until the end.  I tend to be a person who knows how mysteries end and this one surprised me!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This movie captures your full attention and heart.  Excellent job by the entire cast.  A movie that can be watched over and over again.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|love all the stars in this show have all the seasons wish there was more. love Joe flanigan he is my favorite.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I stumbled upon this gem of a series while channel surfing. Thought it would be a documentary since it was on the History channel... and I would take a look given the subject matter was of interest. Wow, was I surprised! First glimpse of Ragnar Lothbrok's icy blues and steely smirk left me craving more. No gratuitous sex scenes... plenty of viking violence but also reflective of viking culture all around including the agricultural aspects and not just viking plunder lust. Love it. Hope this series will last awhile and continue with the beautiful cinematography, excellent script and all around splendid acting.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love how you get to drive and find the animals.I would get it if I were you. it is my favorite game.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Fun read.  Love story  with family values and fangs.  Well written in keeping with previous Twilight editions. Full of surprises. Excellent escape for a weekend  vacation.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My 11 year old says, &#34;It is an unexpected plot and theme that people wouldn't normally think about when watching a movie with ; Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Sandman, Easter Bunny, Jack Frost, the boogey man and the Man in the Moon.&#34;
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Good game, doesn't constantly bombard you with attempts to have you buy in app currency. A welcome trait in a game nowadays.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Since I grew up during these early years, it was easy for me to relate to the events and was interesting to follow through the eyes of the author.  I was expecting more drama like King`s movies!  All in all, 11/22/63,was a good read.
B00CBXVGPC|5.0|When I heard about this show, I was worried it was going to be horrible. I didn't see how it could compare to my favorite movie, Silence of the Lambs, or the original books by Thomas Harris. But I gave the first episode a shot anyway and I was hooked.<br /><br />It's true that the original draw is Hannibal Lector. Everyone is intrigued by Hannibal. But I ended up staying with the show because of the depth and potential of Will Graham's character. His internal struggle with how well he can relate to killers is perfectly balanced with his external struggle with his social awkwardness and urge to keep people at a distance. The writing is amazing so far, the dynamics between Will and the other characters are compelling, and the visual design of the show is breathtaking. Even the use of lighting and food lay-out (usually in dinner scenes with Hannibal) informs the viewer's understanding of the plot and characters' personalities.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best new show I've watched in 2013. I'm glad I gave this one a shot.
B008VBYN80|1.0|why do I have to pay to play a free game at a normal speed?  Don't pay for this game....
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game if you have plenty of time to create and upgrade just like the older strategy games I played in my younger days. still getting use to the multiplayer side since I'm an oldschool gamer. but overall pretty cool game.
031250926X|5.0|This book is great! My 13 mo old loves it because it is simple and interactive with the slider, and I love the story and the great pictures!
0399230033|5.0|There are very few words in this book, but the story is funny and cute. I started reading the book to my brother by telling the story out loud (Oh, see, look at the Gorilla! What is the Gorilla going to do?!) and eventually it changed so that my brother would tell the story to me. There is also a mouse hidden on every page which I've found kids go crazy for searching for that kind of thing.<br /><br />A very cute book. I buy it for every baby shower I go to :)
141694737X|5.0|This book is cute and my 13 mo old loves it. He loves to lift the flaps, and I enjoy the story.
067144901X|5.0|Read this so much to my brother when he was younger that I still have the entire thing memorized (Okay, it isn't THAT long).<br />I buy this for every baby shower I attend regardless of gender (along with Goodnight Gorilla) because it is cute, short, no one buys books for baby showers anymore and kids love animal sounds. :)
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|When Bruce stayed in his range, not singing too high and Steve and Nicko played tighter and interesting arrangements. The set lists too were then a lot more exciting for the fans: Still Life, Killers! Perhaps replacing Hallowed with Phantom of the Opera would have sounded and looked great played in that icy stage set. Had it been released in 1988 on audio, I'm sure it would have been named best Maiden live album, ahead of Live After Death.<br /><br />How I wish Iron Maiden would ditch the formula and bring out whatever they're really feeling. Even in their more crappy follows ups they provided gems like No Prayer For the Dying - which rivals most of their Hit songs and then there was Mother Russia, Wasting Love, Childhood's End, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Be Quick and Chains of Misery.<br /><br />Two great albums with Blaze, one fairly good album with the reformed line-up in 2000 later, Maiden did the dance of death ...<br /><br />A band, Maiden England ... a long time ago.
1449410243|5.0|I love the Oatmeal. While this book is mere fun, his comics range from the outrageous to the fascinatingly educational. Would recommend to any cat lover. Gave this to my dad for Christmas after getting it myself.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Great dark love story. What drew me to this story in the first place was the title and the front cover. Loved the characters. Would love this to be a series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'll put this in one sentence. This game is made out of pure awesomeness. I would get it if I were you. I made my uncle play it one time now he won't put down his phone!!!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This type calculator is new to me.I'm retired now and mostly just use it for fun.It sure would have come in handy 55 years ago for homework  assignments.I like the fact it displays the decimal equivalent of each fraction.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it gave such an amazing new perspective in the life of a troubled teenager. I found it relatable in many ways and an eyeopener. Would recommend.
B0089XH38M|5.0|AVG is extremely dependable.  I made the mistake of removing it from my laptop & going with the security suite Comcast Offers & immediately my computer was fried.  I will not make that mistake again.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I've just finished watching the third season for the third time, and the series (this season as well as the whole) always shows me something new or gives me something new to think about. It's a shame this show is no longer on the air - but that' what happens to quality programming these days.

B00BF11STU|2.0|Though better than the awful Argo, this little flic couldn't carry water for any episode of Homeland. When people make a movie from real events, they think they don't have to supply characters, they don't have to write back stories, there doesn't need to be motivation -- because this is what &#34;really happened&#34;. Here we have a main character who is in no way explained or plausible, just a real angry, determined redhead - maybe her hair color is her motivation? So guess what, they figure out who Bin Laden's courier is and that leads them to... wait for it, Bin Laden!! What a story!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book was over good. This was one of my favorite books. This is a. Great writing job by the writer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very powerful book; I enjoyed it<br />Very sad but it isn't exactly about killing its about a revolution

006224454X|4.0|S.J. Watson's debut novel, Before I Go to Sleep, is structured to bring us backward and forward in time.  The premise of the book seems simple at first, the main character, a woman named Christine Lucas, has amnesia.  Every one of her days begins with no memory of the previous 24 hours.  She wakes up in a strange bed with an unknown man sleeping next to her.  Her most recent memories leave her believing she is still in her 20's so when she sees her nearly 50 year old self in the mirror it only deepens her confusion.<br /> When the man in the bed awakens he patiently explains that she was in a terrible hit and run accident which left her with amnesia.  Everything she learns in the course of the day is wiped from her memory when she awakens the next day.  He tells her he is her husband, Ben, and provides her with a scrapbook of their life together and she accepts the veracity of his story.<br /> When Ben goes to work, Christine receives a mysterious phone call from a Dr. Nash who tells her that he has been working with her to treat her amnesia.  He directs her to a hidden journal, written by Christine, which verifies his presence in her life.  Interestingly,  \\"Don't trust Ben\\" is written in the front of the journal.  Every day, Christine is starting her life over so this journal is the tool by which she begins to hang on to some memories from day to day and so to question her situation.  Can she trust Ben?  Is Dr. Nash really trying to help her?  Who is the mysterious red headed woman who repeatedly pops up in her memories but she can't grasp her name?<br /> Watson does an amazing job of repeatedly taking us back in time and returning us to the present with just a little more of Christine's history.  We are in the same boat as Christine because she doesn't know any more about herself than we do and it connects us to her character.  We want to know as much as she does who she is and why things from her journal, which are true memories she has written, don't always addup with what Ben tells her.<br /> At the end we are taken by surprise by the climax of the story.  We think we know what is happening and a completely new fact, another one of Christine's memories, reveals the truth about all the characters in the story.  As Watson finally tells us the rest of Christine's story we come to know that she isn't nearly as innocent a victim as we are led to believe.  She has culpability for her current existence.  This revelation which is brought to us through one of Christine's recollections carries the structure used throughout the story.

0099421348|5.0|This love story is amazing and I can read this book over and over again.  This story of these two characters is so relatable, it's as if you know both characters personally with the way the author writes the story.  I love that the author makes these two people so real and so simple.  Their love for each other is amazing.  The movie captured it well too and did a great job going along with the book.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|But not a great read! Page turner for sure but a bit formulaic and typical Archer. Spend money on it - yes - but not too much!!
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This was a funny, relatable movie for anyone about to turn 40, married, or has been married, etc.  I was expecting more comedy and laughter, so was a little disappointed that all the laughable scenes were from the previews that I had already seen in the trailor.  Since it was from the people that made 40 Year Old Virgin I was hoping it was going to be even funnier so was disappointed that it wasn't and basically just had the same old cliche's as most ok comedy movies.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Terrible writing.  Ridiculous indicators signifying Ethan Hawke's character was a writer?  Scarf neck cardigan sweater and big, black-rimmed glasses.  And let's not forget the goatee.  His wife seemed not at all to be involved in purchase of their house.  What's that all about?  Fred Thompson showing up in one or two small scenes?  Why?  Who needed him? Did he need money that badley?  He's making more money telling old folks to give their homes away to unscrupulous speculators.  D'Onofrio will never live down this one.  All these guys making money on the backs of the hard-working, trusting, movie-goer.  When's it going to stop?  When will we learn?
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I loved this movie and watched it twice so that I hadn't missed anything the first time.  Loved the characters and the story of how these brothers lives were.  Very on the edge of your seat movie that kept you involved the whole way through.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What more can be said?  We all love this high-quality program and we all know why.  Others should take a page out of this book.  Acting and writing count!

B00BWJARHO|1.0|Mind-boggingly bad flick. You can see he wants to stretch it out to three films, but for what end? There's hardly enough for one film. Scenes go static, on and on, talking, talking, endless hobbit talking. Action scenes make no sense. My ten year old fell asleep after 1/2 hour, I got Jimmy legs and my wife settled into a glacial torpor. No Game of Thrones, that's for sure.
B005DJREJS|3.0|Entertaining and the lead is clearly a very talented and intelligent actress.  I'd like to see her in something more substantial.  It gets three stars because it is too cartoonish in its approach to sex, booze, religion, and adults.  But it is entertaining.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|We can relate to 'some' parts. LOL! Definitely a movie that will make you laugh and also realize, life is short, so enjoy it!

I COULD HARDLY REMEMBER WATCHING THIS FILM SO I SNAGGED USING MY AMAZON PRIME ACCOUNT.  THIS FILM WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO MAKE USE OF GREEN SCREEN TECHNOLOGY AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT WHILE EATING MY ITALIAN SANDWICH TO WHICH I AM ADDICTED.  THIS FILM IS WORTH A DOWNLOAD IF YOU LIKE THE 40'S AND GIANT FLYING ROBOTS, BAT SHAPED WING FLAPPING AIRPLANES AND EXCITEMENT.

B00B69UQEO|4.0|While I still enjoy their albums, there's little on Depeche Mode's \\"Delta machine\\" that suggests that they haven't come off auto-pilot since \\"Ultra.\\" They are still singing about pain, redemption, soul-pain in the search for more, and can't allot Andy Fletcher to singing one song. The devotion to destruction still rules, and analog synths are still the best thing out there.<br /><br />If you're a fan, then that is all that matters. There's hints of grandness in the opening \\"Welcome To My World,\\" which is a nice way of saying 'join me in my vortex.' Count the times Martin Gore sings the words 'angel,' and 'soul' (although one of them comes in the great couplet \\"I couldn't save your soul, I couldn't even take you home\\"). Alas if it were only that simple. But it is devoted DM fan, it is. They still twiddle with electronic blues (\\"Soothe My Soul\\" sounds like a muted \\"Personal Jesus\\" without the big distorted guitar, as does the equally interesting \\"Goodbye\\") and Gore and Gahan are still in fine voice after all these years.<br /><br />Fans of the era where Depeche Mode filled their dark spaces with big dance beats will likely find \\"Delta Machine\\" wanting. As a long time fan, I've found things to like in almost every album they've released, and that includes the oft-derided \\"Exciter\\" (which this album reminds me of often). \\"Delta Machine\\" may be the album where the preachers are still talking about fire and brimstone, but are content with knowing that the flock no-longer needs it screamed at them. It's a quiet wonder that bears up to repeated listens.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best \\"free\\" game ever! Like I said, it definitely beats boredom!<br />It's easy, addictive and, a ton of fun! I would recommend this game to anyone who has time to kill.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I can honestly say that this is my favorite book out of all the Sophie Kinsella books I've read; including the shopaholic series, undomestic goddess, and that 20s girl. Some parts were a little strange/irritaiting to read but eh it was nothing horrible

0718178122|5.0|As I got into The Rosie Project I recalled three other books. The first was [[ASIN:1614272174 The Magic Pudding]] by Norman Lindsay, which is Australian and funny, and happens to be one of the very first books I bought and read without parental guidance. Then, as Don Tillman, the hero of The Rosie Project (and what a hero!) researched the principal indicators of Asperger's Syndrome, I found myself matching them against my own behavioral characteristics, which brought to mind [[ASIN:0141441216 Three Men in a Boat]] by Jerome K Jerome. Jerome hilariously reports that on consulting a medical dictionary he discovered he was suffering from every one of the diseases of which he read. Thirdly, as Don Tillman constructs his Wife Project, I remembered Vikram Seth's 1986 novel in verse, [[ASIN:0679734570 The Golden Gate]], in which Janet helps John advertise his availability for romance, a novel idea back then. Finally, as Graeme Simsion's story took a complete hold, I realized I will in future be using The Rosie Project itself as a standard against which to compare other books; it is destined for classic status.<br /><br />On page 14, I laughed out loud. For me, reading quietly and alone, that is really something. Pausing between chapters 6 and 7 (page 54) to mentally review the story so far, I laughed again. It was The Jacket Incident that brought that on.<br /><br />Almost throughout, the story is very funny. But there is real pathos too. (Remember how Shakespeare's great tragedies always have clown scenes set against the heavy stuff?) And virtually all the players, even minor ones such as early drop-outs from The Wife Project, are believable people about whom we quickly come to care.<br /><br />The setting is mostly in and around a university in Melbourne, Australia. As described by Graeme Simsion, that feels much the same as many another university town or city throughout the English-speaking world. But a trip to New York City authentically brings out that city's uniqueness. Graeme Simsion is clearly an I LOVE NYC person.<br /><br />I got totally hooked and seriously considered cancelling my night's sleep to finish the book. I'm glad I didn't, though, as I would have become too tired to fully appreciate the quality writing and major-league plot construction. Nevertheless, I finished the book - and wrote this review - all in two days.<br /><br />It's the best new fiction I've read in almost two years - since Amor Towles' [[ASIN:0143121162 Rules of Civility]].ess.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I do not know if it is the software or the headset but I am not happy with them. The wireless cuts out randomly, there's a distortion in the sound, and a annoying buzzing sound in the background when you play sound though them. Other then the sound and the wireless issues get head set, long battery life, 10 hours, nice range 25 to 30 feet. Should of bought a Razer headset instead.

B006H5120E|5.0|James Cameron did a fantastic job converting his orignal 2D masterpiece to 3D.  It was a refreshing look at an already classic film and you'll have no idea it wasn't shot in 3D originally.  If you've been disappointed by 3D conversions before, purchase this and you will be highly satisfied.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 7 year old daughter loves &quot;spending time&quot; with her horse. It's a fun game that seems to teach a little bit about horses and caring for them, without the expense of a real horse. I also have fun earning coins and gems when she's not around. Only thing I don't like is the frequency of ads, but it doesn't seem to bother her.

B00BZXM3VA|5.0|This cd is just... wow!  Kurt didn't mess with the formula that made Smoke Ring for my Halo such a constant in my rotation - in fact, he just extended it!  Yes, this cd is long... very long, and the songs themselves can sometimes seem overwhelming in their length, but each one is filled with such amazing musicianship that nothing on this album feels drawn out or tiresome.  Honestly, I don't think this guy can make bad music.  Standout Tracks:  KV Crimes, Was All Talk, Pure Pain, and Goldtone.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Fabulous read! Kept me anxiously involved page by page. The way Riggs intertwined fantasy and reality, the past and the present was ingenious. I looked forward to the old photos...a very creative addition to the storyline. Although the story kept me actively involved, it would be an excellent read for young adults.

B0013D8LCW|4.0|&#34;Shelter&#34; is a very sensitively done movie, and deals well with the main character's coming to know himself and learning how to deal with others sharing his propensities. I think that it was very well made and is weil owrth hanging onto. Of course, it does help to be pretty open minded.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is one of my favorite programs right now.  Awesome TV.  Kevin Bacon at his best!  I think they have a great formula here, and it doesn't suffer from the normal TV constraints (6 parts, climax before each commercial break, etc).

0425252868|5.0|If you have an interest in WWII history, I would highly recommend reading this one.  The author appears to have done a very good job researching many of the facts he writes about, yet managed to tell a rather facinating story about two WWII pilots who meet under wholly different circumstances 47 years apart.  For those who are not interested in history of that era, it is still very much of an interesting read, although the book does go into some detail on the daily life of the WWII pilots.
B007N6NGYG|1.0|Don't like the game.  Seems like it could be better but levels progress too quickly to be fun. It is mostly just frustrating.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an excellent read.  Action packed and emotionally griping.  A true story THAT Hollywood couldn't make up.  I highly recommend it.

B006QS07IK|3.0|Shelley's story of Victor Frankenstein and his creation is outstanding. It's original and moving, and it's full of questions about humanity, morality, and the nature of good and evil. But my god, is the writing tedious! In my 167-page edition, absolutely nothing happens in the first 50 pages. The Victorian style of writing (that was so brilliantly ridiculed by Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat) is just painful to get through. Multi-page long digressions into scenery and 5-line long rambling sentences greatly dilute the quality of the story. Again though, the story itself is amazing. Even though her intent was to simply write a horror story about a monster, Shelley exposes the best and the worst in humanity.
B007SGM084|5.0|The first book was a slow start but once you get to the second book it picks up speed. I learned alot about another world thru these books but it is a GREAT Love Story and I would tell others to read it but only if your over 18.And as far as people complaining about the price of this download its better to buy it than buy it one at a time or buying in paper back. Cause I did my homework on the price and it was cheaper to buy it as the bundle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great characters, compelling tale. Delicious flyover state comments, biting and hilarious. in the end, author tries too hard to explain how each issue was resolved. Trust us a little, Ms Flynn, we get it.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed how quick the read was and how it explains intimately how someone with bipolar disorder navigates through his or her life. Both humor and humility added to the quickness and ease of this book. Will look for this author again.

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|very nice, keepps kid's busy, very entertaing  ,we love it my kids are alway's playing it . they dont want to put it down.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love it and use it quite often. Most of the bugs mentioned in older reviews have been fixed now. The developer has been active in fixing reported bugs and adding new features. The sound mixing option is fantastic and there are a bunch of additional sounds that can be downloaded.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Spectacular performances by the entire cast.  Sets, costumes, locations, and cinematography that immerse you in the 19th century.  Despite knowing \\"how it ends\\" before hitting \\"buy\\" on the menu, the movie had us on the edge of our seats for two hours.  Watch this movie!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|-Works well<br />-Plays well with Kindle Fire<br />-User friendly<br />-Works very much like the desktop version of the software<br />-Great price: FREE!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I loved every single song. I was not disappointed with their new album which is really surprising now a days. Im usually disappointed by my favorite bands and their new music, but this did not make me unhappy.
1449410243|3.0|This book is funny in parts, but for me -- even though I'm a huge fan of The Oatmeal -- this was a one-and-done.  I read it in about 15 minutes (I consider myself a slow reader) and I couldn't think of when I would ever want to read it again.  I gave it to a friend who is a cat person and not super-familiar with The Oatmeal, so I got good mileage with the book after all.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Laughed out loud at a couple of the scenes.  Not the best comedy I ever watched, but it was good for a couple laughs.
B005LAII12|4.0|Was a very funny movie will watch it over an over again. was a gift and they like it to.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I watched this series when they first came out and loved them dearly.  Now, I am sharing them with my teenage son, and he is really enjoying them also.  Good, clean, inventive fun!  I am fond of all the Star Trek programs, but The Next Generation is my favorite.  It has so many really well-developed and interesting characters.  Watching them interact together, facing interesting and unusual, often very difficult challenges, and overcoming them using courage, ingenuity, and persistence is rewarding.  These programs offer good discussion starters for big picture ideas, morals, and themes that foster relevant and helpful discussion with developing young people.  This series provides great entertainment and valuable bonding time with my son.  I recommend it for kids 10+ (or younger depending on your kid).  Some situations and aliens might seem scary to the very young.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|I expected better quality and fit for the price. The driver is ok, light for for working on electronics but seems a bit slippery. But the problem I have with is the bits (the pentalobe #2 is not a very good fit for the couple of iPhone 4Ss  I tried it on - it works but you have to push with it (more work). On the other hand, the TS1 with radio shack kit for iPhone I got a while ago is still a better, tight fit. The case also kind of sucks - its hard to take out the bits and the driver out of it. Just seems and feels like a garden variety set found in regular electronics stores for cheaper. I would go with a cheaper kit next time.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|To me having all the movies in one box is great, now that i also know that blue ray dics will not scratch that is good to hear<br />the movies are very cool so if you are a harry potter Fan then get this while you can before it is gone
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I laughed, commiserated, was talking to my Kindle during episodes. Jenna' s mom is a trip is a prime example of moms becoming moms at a young age and still trying to be more friends than parents to their kids.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Very light-hearted and funny. I was surprised by the ending and loved the chick-flick themes, such as relationships, balance, external friends, and boundaries. :o)
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I was disenchanted within the first 10 minutes. Graphics are terrible and the manner in which you select objects is odd and feels disconnected. While the program installed fairly quickly it felt sluggish during play.
B00005B6NC|5.0|Great action adventure movie. If you like Vin Diesel, you will love this movie. Dark with lots of action. Sci-Fi meets Horror, love it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Very imaginative and lots of fun with imaginative golf layouts which are quite challenging to master and get to the next level.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I don't know how they did it,  but this keyboard blows every other one I've used out of the water,  just wish they would add some of the features from the Samsung note 2 keyboard,  particularly the one handed mode (shifts the entire keyboard to only one side of the screen) and also the number keys row.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Very challenging.game with lots of levels.  It is going to take me months to get though all the levels and unlock everything.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Good acting, good story line, and good writing. The twists and turns of this show kept me always on edge.
B0012GMXSS|5.0|Aging is something.  I have to say that I appreciate this album, along with &#34;Dust&#34; & &#34;Uncle Anesthesia&#34;, even more now than I did then, when I was still hooked on &#34;Invisible Lantern&#34; & &#34;buzz factory&#34;.  The Trees meant far more to me even than Soundgarden & Mudhoney & Sonic Youth.  Mark Lanegan's been compared to Tom Waits (hardly), but he was always more of the Jim Morrison type.  I'm lucky to have found them when I did, sometime in the late 80's.
B003CE5CK4|1.0|The movie's soundtrack got to be annoying within first five minutes.  I thought it would be nostalgic; however, it was just disappointing.
B000002GJH|5.0|Soundgarden, Mother Love Bone -- & Temple was so new & mainstream, back then.  &#34;Say Hello&#34; & &#34;Reach Down&#34; have particularly new & special meaning now that I have sons of my own.  It was one thing to have friends doing all the things they did; thinking about my little guys getting into that, well, it's something no dad wants.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|well worth watching. edge of your seat excitement with little violence or sex. Really gave you a sense of what was happening back then In Iran.
B008H48KKI|4.0|This is a great movie but not as good as the 3 previous movies.  Spoiler alert, Stifler learns a lesson and becomes their friend again.  I think that's a little played out now.  This could have been 5 stars if some of the content had deviated from the other 3 previous movies.  Step 1, get together.  Step 2, plan a party.  Step 3, awkward moments.  Step 4, Stifler leans his lesson and shows he wants to be their friends.  Still an overall good movie.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|awesome game with different dinosaur names. My 9 year old son loves unlocking new speicies. Easy to use and so far you don't need others to send things.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|be prepared to laugh because if you think it's a horror movie you'll be disappointed. appreciate the satirical nature and enjoy the humor throughout
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This is one of the best historical films to date.  I was amazed at DDL's portrayal of Lincoln and what a deeply profound man he was.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This debut album by Secret Garden is very easy and relaxing to listen to.  Excellent production values.  I highly recommend it for everyone who enjoys soft music
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie! It is very entertaining. I watched late one night and it kept me wide awake all the way through it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|A highly addictive game and very entertaining for all ages.  Stack four jewels horizontally or vertically and move up levels.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Definitely worth the watch. It kept me entertained and very interesting to see the detailed account. I was too young to remember at that level of detail so it was intriguing to me.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi passed way before his time. This is fantastic music I can not imagine how great his music would be if he was still alive today. I love all the songs on the CD but would have to say that &#34;I hear my Train a Coming&#34; is my favorite track. His guitar playing is 2nd to none.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great selection of titles. No matter what your looking for you will probably be able to find it. Download was easy. The book was as described.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|It's exactly what it sets out to be...the bloodiest TV show in history.  And honestly, the violence is done well and serves to advance the plot....which is beyond ridiculous.  And I'm not opposed to things being ridiculous or violent, but the combination of the two in a show that takes itself sooooooo seriously is just incongruous.<br /><br />But of course it totally sucks you in and once you start, you cannot stop.  Every episode ends with a decent cliff-hanger (and a quick montage on a bed of goth rock, which makes it even harder to figure out if the whole show is a joke) and the concept of the show is compelling.  So don't start watching this unless you're okay with committing to the entire season, because you will.
0783229526|3.0|I'm guessing this is pretty good. I only made it half way and got bored. fThis movie is just a little bit too trippy for me.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|I don't want to write out any spoilers in my review, but there were some good surprises, a few results that you could see coming, but overall a vet good book!
B0033TJATW|5.0|It's just crazy how after all these years I still have very vivid memories of watching this EVERY SINGLE day as a little kid when I got home from school. I tried to find this dvd for years but couldn't. I ended up buying some cd version that would only play on the computer. My dream was to be able to watch this with my kids and hoped they loved it as much as I did when I was little.<br /><br />My dreams came true. My 8 year old son LOVES it and my 4 year old can't stop bugging me to put this in every night I get off work. Just amazing.<br /><br />Not to mention, the picture quailty on this dvd is HD! I couldn't of asked for more. The picture quality and sound is absolutly perfect. If I didn't know any better I would think this move was made in 2012, not 1988 !<br /><br />Someone mentioned this video wasn't in English. It is, only some words on the front cover are Asian words that's it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|If you like cop shows (The Wire) etc. you'll like this. Good writing and acting. Show gets better and better as the characters develop.
B008602KQI|3.0|Not much explication about how the dystopia came to be. It's more of a 'young woman becomes an unintentional princess.' Less of a 'superficial society breeds inequities that lead to revolution.' I guess I was expecting more depth to the story. Not much character development.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show had me at episode 1. Beautifully filmed and acted. But the storylines are so beautiful woven, and you find yourself so thoroughly invested in the characters.  The interaction between working class and the lords and ladies is an eye opener as well.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It seems like a very nice web site.  I haven't taken a lot of time to explore it but so far it is very informative.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Especially for recipes. I have so many saved and I usually make them, I love the home improvement ideas too.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This is a must see movie, language is a bit raw, and there is a partial nude scene In the beginning, but other than that it is a must see movie.
B007REV4YI|5.0|What a great continuation of the James Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. This was an awesome story line.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app works, but when there is an alert, dismissing it doesn't seem to work. Weird. That is my only complaint.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Absolutely addictive and fun.  Great graphics and excellent scenery make this a must-have in your app drawer.  Enjoy and share.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Harry Potter has grown up and realized the dangers all around him without Dumblemore to help him. Now he must find out what he was told to find. Lord Voltemort, what can I say, he is very persistant.
B007W4OZ76|5.0|Works just fine for me and I can access my dropbox!! Best app next to the real dropbox app. Until Amazon gets it I will be using this one!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such an addictive series!  The actors are fantastic, making it difficult to decide which character is my favorite. Can't wait for the 3rd season to come out on Amazon Prime!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is very fun. It is simple to learn and a great way to pass time when you get a free moment. It loads very quickly, so you can get started without a bunch of boring introduction screens.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I have only watched a couple of episodes so far, but it seems it will be a great series. I became a fan of Brendan Coyle in Downton Abbey.
1449410243|5.0|The Oatmeal has always been one of my favorites, and this book does not disappoint. There is a lot of great humor content in these pages, so if you enjoy the comics then you'll love this. I can't really think of anything more to say! It's hilarious.
0671027573|5.0|i read this book a couple of years ago and it's still lingers in my memory because it was just that good!<br />i love the cutely answers between the characters. it's just one of her witty books<br />highly recommended!
1452110581|5.0|This year for presents I just bought a bunch of cat books. My mother, a long time cat owner and fan of pee-related humor has been loving every page and reading passages to me. If your mother is like mine, they'll probably have a good time with it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun! so many different dragons to breed and gems can be earned easily. I would recommend this to everyone!
0452273331|5.0|Though an excellent movie with Gary Cooper and a blonde Patricia Neal, The Fountainhead dug deeply to a person's right for independence and freedom of his convictions. It was a story of a man in a box. Here was an intelligent achitect, a man who was willing to start life with another architect named Cameron. The one person who could crush Roark's life was one of the strongest newspapers of yellow journalism, &#34;The New York Banner&#34;. Roark and Camoran became architects. After the retirement of Cameron, Keating hired Roark. Roark and the other partner with Keaing, Francon, who later fired him, but not without meeting Francon's daughter, Dominque. Between battles of wills and a tempestuous relationship, the book keeps you facinated with the four characters.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book was full of thrill and adventure. One crazy and/or lucky thing after another. I also liked learning about all the old nautical stuff.
0312144210|5.0|this is the best book of this genre!  I have read many books and this is one not to miss!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I enjoyed the show, I will tell others to watch it. She is very pretty and Harrison Ford is always good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My niece turned me on to this show.  It has become one of my favorites. Can not wait for the next season
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Evangelion 2.22 takes brutal mechanized combat on a massive scale. the second near perfect update to the already epic series<br /><br />Evangelion 2.22 provides the crisp clean picture quality and times it by 2x it is a must buy for near perfect Bluray<br /><br />The plot is largely point to point of the TV series with never before seen images made by CGI technology it invites the viewer to venture in to Hideaki Anno's physcosexual depths this master peace is yet to be missed
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well done!  Great story (based on true, so who get's credit?)  And great acting and directing.  Can't believe I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Evangelion 1.11 you are not alone was a great movie  the best way to  view is in bluray<br /><br />the plot of the story is simple 14 year old Shinji Ikari is called by his father leader of NERV Gendo ikari  to fight in the synthetic humanoid evangelion. 1.11 is a remake of episode one through six.  It has near perfect picture quality on bluray and DVD.<br /><br />It is a must buy for any hardcore Eva fan if you liked the original series NGE
B006S08RLU|5.0|Very sweet story with many fun twists.  Nice to see something so innocent with so many other things out now.
B004JUSDVU|5.0|What a great movie. I have to admit I have watched this movie several times over a span of many years. On repeat viewings, even though I knew how it would end, I enjoyed it just as much. It has a wonderful human depth to it which so many films attempt and few achieve. It's a movie which carries a message for us all. What was the movie about? It's about how we are all connected and how all need to care for each other. There's a word for this... It's love. I can't recommend this movie enough.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|What can I say?  Great story, great writing and amazing acting.  One of the best movies ever.  Very well done.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|If you are a fan of Jerry Seinfeld and need a movie for a child (mine is 3.5) then you should buy this movie.  It is fun for me and my kiddo.
1881273873|5.0|Super awesome! Shipped fast!  Exactly what I thought it would be!  Made for a great gift! Great quality too! Would buy again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great program that I've followed from the beginning.  I've also read the graphic novels and the whole franchise is well made and very interesting.  The TV Series has differences than the novels, but both are interesting and often intersect.  AMC is the network that brought both Breaking Bad and Walking Dead to us and both are absolute hits!
B004UPALT6|5.0|Not as creepy or shocking as the original Evil Dead but this is a very good sequel as sequels go. You should watch this with all the lights off and if the power doesn't go out, watch during a lightening storm!!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Enjoyable movie. Mathew McConaughey was charming and young in this show. I liked the storyline and  got into hoping he was sucessful.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love this show and all of the great plot twists that have been happening over the season. I only hope that they are able to make it continue for another season.
0307352153|3.0|This book is difficult to get all the way through. There really isnt much information offered that isn't common knowledge. I felt that I was going to get this deep insight into dealing with introverts in my life, but I don't know anything I didn't know before I bought the book. I just have a lighter bank balance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this story and I love that it is something that more than just I can get in to. Many of my family members have read this book and they also love it. :)
B000IDGDPA|4.0|The movie is pretty good but a bit farfetched. As long as one can suspend belief in the storyline its quite enjoyable. It wasn't time wasted watching it.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Not only does the motion glide smoothly and beautifully, the hi-res images and easy readability are fantastic... add that to the ability to aggregate various accounts like twitter, facebook, soundcloud, and all your RSS feeds and it's one superb tool.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think it's just like using a computer!No problems!It's perfect for my kindle,and I think it's a thing everyone would like,and have no problems with! :) I think you should get it!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Ts awesome that we can watch it on Amazon.  I dint have bbc so its a relief that I can still watch it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and like the author.  I will look for more books by this author.  Well written
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|.It's a pretty cool game good to go back to when your not doing anything. Can be kind of boring though but it's free so......<br />.....
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It doesn't say what connection speed (Mbps) a device would get at the signal strength it shows. I don't know if this makes sense or not, but it is what I expected to see. I couldn't see the 5GHz signal from my router, only the 2.4GHz signal. That is probably because I'm running it on a Kindle Fire 2nd Generation which maybe can't receive the 5GHz signal, but it'd be nice if the app indicated that so that I wasn't left wondering why I couldn't see it.<br /><br />Otherwise, the app displays some very nice graphs of signal strength and I was able to collect some good info about my wireless router and its signal in different parts of my house.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|my 8 year old grandson loves it, he plays all the games.we have multigames that both have chosen.great fun @ grandparents.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but it skips and frozes a lot.  Please fix that and it will be a five star
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Not to complicated to learn to use. Made the process of acquiring music much easier than it has been in the past.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I LOVE IT I ALWAY  LOOK . UP IN THE SKY AT NIGHT THE STARS INTERESTS ME THEY ALWAY HAVE .

0439023513|3.0|***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br />I'm one of those that was dissatisfied with the ending, and humor me by letting me explain why I feel that way.  Many people might say that the book presents things more realistically.  Honestly, I can understand a dark, realistic ending.  It's about as pitch black as an ending can get.  After all, the characters live in a world where children kill each other for entertainment.  Suzanne Collins was smart enough to know EXACTLY how we all expected the book to end: Katniss makes it to the President's Mansion, takes out Snow, and lives a long happy life with Peeta.  And Collins wanted to subvert expectations by writing the exact opposite of that fairy tale ending.  It's different, and for that I can respect a writer who wanted to try something other than what most people expect from this type of novel.  However, I don't think attempting to take things in a unlikely direction necessarily works in this case.  I don't mind that the ending is black and different, I mind that we leave Katniss without a single glimmer of hope.  The social commentary of this series conveys that these things should be avoided in society from the very get-go.  And yet we live them everyday.  Soldiers are killed in horrifying ways during wartime.  We scramble to maintain stability in a world where humanity is constantly attempting to destroy itself.  But we have to move on.  And that's exactly what Katniss personifies: an embodiment of hope given to the masses through horrifying self-sacrifice (any soldier returning from war with PTSD would no doubt have been very touched by this book).  I don't doubt that Katniss would've been deeply scarred by the events that took place during the course of the books.  Anyone would break after seeing such things.  But after all she's been through, the Katniss that I spent three books getting to know would find a way to stand up and keep fighting.  I'm not saying that I would expect her to miraculously get over Prim or forget the things she saw, but Katniss would've found a way to move on eventually.  This was a series of books about hope.  That even though the world can be a terrible place, we will move on and keep moving forward.  And I didn't get that feeling when I finished the book.  I felt that somehow all of it had been for nothing.  Everything that happened in the last thirty pages was pleasantly (or should I say horrifyingly?) surprising.  And I like it when a writer can surprise me in such a way.  But Katniss not at least being somewhat happy that she ended up with Peeta and two wonderful children boggles my mind.  She seems to hate it, almost.  Wouldn't her mother have eventually come back into the picture at some point?  Or maybe she established a friendship again with Gale?  The slightest detail about either of these things would've spoken wonders to me.  That maybe something good could come out of all this.  Unfortunately, I closed the book feeling nothing but dread.  Is that the point?  That life is going to be painful and cruel no matter how hard we try?  Even that isn't completely realistic.  The book seems to say, \\"Nothing good will ever come out of your suffering.\\"  Well, I happen to believe the exact opposite.  Suffering can bring clarity and strength that you've never known before, and that's why I identified so much with Katniss.  She was the embodiment of finding strength and leadership amongst horrifying circumstances.  And yet the ending doesn't seem to convey that at all.  Overall, I've got to say I loved the book.  But the ending could've been done in a better way - a way that gave us some type of hope.  Isn't that why we were rooting for Katniss in the first place?
B002APU580|1.0|This horrible movie is the worst version of Jane Austen's classic ever.  The screenwriters managed to take out all of the substance of the book,  leaving Elizabeth and Darcy panting for each other.<br /> Besides a horrible screenplay, the settings, costumes and styling are not authentic Regency period--at all.<br /> Kiera Knightly's hair alone is an abomination.  She is styled like an Elizabethan charwoman.  No gentlewoman would have left the house with those ridiculous bangs. Longbourne was NOT a dirty chicken farm.<br /> All of the humor and intrigue is gone from the story.  What is left is insipid, predictable and absolutely nothing like Jane Austen's classic.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is great. A tad too long but it's very engaging, exciting and, like all time travel stories, intellectually twisted. Highly recommended!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Such a beautifully restored classic. The story, the plot, the surprising ending (let us not forget the amor) is wonderful. I recommend it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love love love this book! It's one of my favorites :) I was looking for something to read after reading 50 Shades and saw this book and decided to read it. I'm glad I did! Since then I have read this book five times and reading the sequel now which is told through 'Travis' ' eyes :) must read if your a fan of 50 shades, you won't be disappointed
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's fast pace and very detailed I LOVE  it but u got to read it in order from light in thief to this book
B0044DEAUA|5.0|My order was received on time and as requested.  The product has worked well and it has met my expectations.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm one of the many who didn't discover Firefly until long after it had left the air.<br /><br />However, after the 42nd person recommended it to me, well, I figured that there must be a reason that you can't stop the signal.<br /><br />So I watched it on Hulu. (they were having a free HuluPlus trial. I got it just for this show!) Boy, was I ever impressed! I couldn't believe there were only 13 episodes!<br /><br />You'll laugh at the high-larious jokes, cry whenever Kaylee's life is threatened, get incredibly angry at Yo-Saff-Bridge when she shows up to wreak her particular brand of terror, and feel a thrill of pride every time one of the main 9 characters grows as a human being.<br /><br />Once I had seen them all, I was thirsty for more!  I sought out the DVD set, and I was not disappointed. There's SO MUCH to explore on this DVD set.  Aside from rewatching--or watching for the first time!--the episodes themselves (which I've done so many times I'm surprised my DVDs aren't all worn out and scratched yet!), this set is also great for all the commentaries and behind-the-scenes features it contains.<br /><br />5/5 would definitely recommend! (I'd give it 10/5 stars if I could!)
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It wasn't as funny as i expected and just weird at times. The young boy was awkward with his father creating a misty atmosphere.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I love this movie with a passion! Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton (and all of the child actors, really) all bring their A-game to make this a perfect treasure-hunt-meets-coming-of-age film.  Director Richard Donner, writer-producer Stephen Spielberg, and screenwriter Chris Columbus all came together to create a true classic full of memorable scenes, quotable quotes, and phenomenal acting on all parts--adults and their child co-stars.    Sadly, the initial driving point of the plot (kids going on a treasure hunt to prevent their homes from being foreclosed) is all too familiar to kids these days, who will relate to the desire to find purportedly mythical treasure to keep their homes and neighborhoods safe.    The only thing I would caution parents about is the language (lots of \\"s***\\" and some inappropriate things said in español)  and scary situations, which I believe would earn The Goonies a PG-13 rating if it were to be released today.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|ALMOST because this gauntlet-type game, redolent of Baldur' s Gate 2 (down to the 'cheeky warrior princess' vocal) lacks 3 features.<br />1) Virtual joystick sensitivity: just returning to neutral spins the thief around, usually just in time for me to hit my skill, wasting it. Come on, just an option.<br />2) Weapons-loadout: OK, I can get no control option, but placing the change-weaps button just below said oversensitive joypad? That way, you can come up shooting when stabbing is needed.<br />3) Either make treasure drops peer to level or make level harder to obtain. When your level still only leaves you with intake gear, it isn't worth it.<br />Almost perfect, which means I'll still love it. I just won't like it so much.
B007V508CC|1.0|What an overproduced mess.  The autotune is so overused in these recordings especially.  I've convinced myself that poor Adam can't sing without it.  It's a shame too because I like these songs, just not sung by him.  Maybe someone else will come along in a few years and re-record them.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I *luved* the trilogy (The Fellowship) !!!!!!!<br />These kind of movies are right up my alley! Murder, Death, and Dismembership...<br />And all based around friendship, loyalties, and honor.<br />Can't get enough sometimes!
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Very informative and like how it takes you from soil to table.  Recipes tried so far have been very good.
B00422LESO|5.0|Fun and easy read. The fantasy austenland was so much fun to explore! It's a feel good kind of book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Finally. I have been waiting for a Mario type game. Finally, It's free! I love this game. I recommend this app.
B005KELW26|4.0|I like this cover because of the color, but it is not really a protective case. It protects your screen, but it is not a hard cover. Other than that it is exactly what I wanted. A stylus fits in on the folded side.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I can't believe how bad that was, or maybe I can't believe I thought it might be funny. Target audience teenage boys maybe? Just crappy drug scenes and cameos. Do yourself a favor & skip this one. At least 1/2 way through I split screened this with imjur  ....
B004UNX1LS|1.0|The picture quality was horrible. I couldn't even see peoples faces, because the videos were so pixelated. This is a really bad product.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a fun game before dropping off to sleep. It's better than counting sheep and the kindle will shut off.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I would say this game has an extremely simple concept but in some weird way is semi catchy. It never caught my attention for very long but my kids love it.
0385493622|5.0|I am not a mathematician, far from it, yet that didn't prevent me  loving this book.<br />It's the story of a journey, or more specifically,a quest. The journey  has  a hero, and the hero has  a task.<br /><br />That task is a great intellectual knot that must be unravelled (because it's there) yet has long defied well-fancied champions from the four quarters.  The knot itself lies at the heart of a labyrinth, which exists  at the centre of an enchanted forest which is located in the middle of an ambiguous magical kingdom.<br /><br /> You know the outcome. Of course we knew the  outcome! However, It's still an enthralling, and legendary, journey.<br />Simon Singh's brisk, straightforward narrative style suits it very well.<br /><br />Simply put, it obeys the number 1 mantra of all good writing, namely,  a good story , well told.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was really incredible! It was an amazing, fun read from start to finish, with very little drag time. The only part I didn't like was when it was over cuz I wanted more and more. The world setting sucks you in, and I could definitely see more novels being written in this setting. At least, I hope so!
B00BF11STU|5.0|action, intrigued kept u on the edge of ur seat!! would recommend this movie to all !!! thank you very much
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Caught up on all the past seasons and Loved this season!!  Thanks to Amazon we were able to see the entire season during the season!!
B000PVAFT0|5.0|Worth a watch.  You'll learn some things and it's actually entertaining.  If you didn't get to watch this on an IMAX screen, now you can enjoy it at home!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Keeps you guessing until the very end! She adds twists you don't expect, but makes you fall in love with each character.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so cool you get to do 2 levels and as how many worlds. my mom says it's boring I say it is amazing.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|The music is one of the best soundtracks ever, Henry Fonda is amazing, all acting is superb actually, the story and rythm more of a european Sergio Leone style, so well made and with so much attention to all details, highly recommended.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|the game is cool but every time I open it it goes to my home menu. it is bad do NOTTT buy it for free.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.It continued to keep me on my toes. I'll be starting the next book immediately. Highly recommended.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this album about 4 months ago and I still listen to it regularly. This is definitely The Strokes' best album. Julian's vocals deliver on every track, Fab's simple beats perfect every song, Nikolai's basslines on tracks such as \\"Is This it\\", \\"When It Started\\", and \\"Alone, Together\\" are fantastic, and Albert and Nick's angular guitar riffs compliment each other very well. Their solos aren't very complex or hard to play, but they fit each song in their own way. Here is a rating of the songs on the album:<br />Is This it: 9/10. While it's not the best song on the album, it's a great opening track<br />The Modern Age: 10/10. One of my personal favorites. You can feel a summer-like vibe throughout the entire song. There is also a lot of build up with little release. A very tricky tactic by The Strokes.<br />Soma: 9/10. Very underrated song. They barely ever play it live for some reason. It's still a solid song, though.<br />Barely Legal: 8/10. It's a decent song, but also a bit repetitive. It happens to be the longest song on the album, and it's not even four minutes long. This is why I love The Strokes.<br />Someday: 9/10. A very nostalgic song but with an upbeat tone. It gives off a different vibe than most of the songs on the album.<br />Alone, Together: 8/10. I'm not the biggest fan of this song, but it's certainly not bad. It still has that cool Strokes feel to it.<br />Last Night: 10/10. Ah, another one of my personal favorites. Probably the most 'Rock n' Roll' song on the album. Albert's solo is awesome.<br />Hard To Explain: 10/10. For me, this is hands down the best song on the album. The hard pause in the middle of the song is very unexpected and I was shocked when I first heard it. Words cannot describe how much I love this song. It sounds even better live.<br />When It Started: 8/10. Kind of oddly timed. Nikolai's bassline is the main thing driving this song.<br />Trying Your Luck: 7/10. My least favorite song on the album. To me, it just seems dull and not very creative like a lot of the other songs on this album.<br />Take it or Leave it: 10/10. A great way to end a masterpiece like this. The Strokes made an excellent choice in choosing to end the album with this song. And I almost forgot to say that it sounds pretty badass.<br />This album is a must have. If you're reading this review, then you're wasting time. Buy it now. You will not regret it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I had no intention to watch The Hunger Games, but when I saw it available on Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a try.  I was suprized that I actually enjoyed the movie.  I hear the books are even better, but I'll wait on that until the series of movies are finished.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Loved it.  First in the series and the best.  You can't beat dinosaurs and people mixing.  Great movie and cast.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|I can watch this over and over because each time I see something I missed this is a great teaching tool. for all races.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I was expecting so much more from The Hobbit.  Peter Jackson outdid himself with the LOTR trilogy and if you are looking for the same experience with The Hobbit, well, you won't.  (IMO).  I literally fell sound asleep during this movie (even though I was watching in 3D).  I am going to try watching it again, but I think I would wait until this goes into the bargain bin before spending too much on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so awesome I love it great game get it great for all ages and great for when you are bored
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Enjoyed every word from beginning to end. Espionage at its best. I enjoyed the characters from Dicksten to the lovely Suza. Even the evil characters were believable. But good always wins in the end. Great story Mr. Follett. Thank you.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I realy like minecraft but it wont even let me get the game. and some other reviews said u cant do the stuff u can do on the PC and Xbox version
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I own a kindle fire and when I read the reviews it said you can't enter in the word you type in, but you actually can. After you type in the word you want in the notepad, press the enter button, which on kindle fires is the button to skip down a line, and it will enter in. Don't go off thinking you can't play the game right, because in reality, YOU CAN!!! :)
B009NX88JU|5.0|Fantastic movie! Saw it back in 2000 when it was released and just watched it twice in the 48 hrs I have it rented for. Amazing soundtrack if you like music from the '70's. Need to purchase it so I can have my own copy! So good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUBWAY SURFING is the best game ever!It is so addicting. This is my 8,9,or 10 hours  playing.Fun and  very addicting game!
B00AIBZJS4|1.0|It is with great pleasure that I and many more that had viewed the said dvd were, awed by the great performance, that we experienced. THANK YOU!
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Whilst there have been many books published on different aspects of WW II, I found this book easy to follow. Of particular use was the dating of the different chapters in chronological order. This helped me understand what was going on in the different theatres at current timing. Chapters were manageable so I could read one chapter every night in Bed before going to sleep. (At my age that is all I can do!)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I believe it teaches your kids how to be responsible in a fun and safe environment
B009NPKTN6|1.0|All singing and  too much of Tom Cruise for me to be comfortable with. Also same as Les Mis, do they expect us to believe Tom is really singing all that. Very little dialog if any. Cheesy at best.
B001I45UFC|5.0|it's a good book. I got it on sale. I recommend. Frosttail says that she and all  the warriors like it too.<br /><br />--Swordstar
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Though I doubt that the woman agent was walking around in high heels during this in real life...I had so suspend my doubts.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This story is very real. It feels as if a true and sad friend let me live in his sad and broken mind. I love  pat`s constant and striving mind set yet u wish there was a specific silver lining. Nevertheless thank you once Mr quick for allowing me to make my own silver lining
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Runs slow and hangs. I can't even use it... Really ?? This can't be any better??? I'd give it zero stars if I could.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Worth the price, I'll watch it several times. It shows that world class actors can save even a so-so story.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I saw Les Mis in London in the West End and it was great, this is way too long and really jumped from one plot line to another without good transition.  Songs are long and staging is boring... Are we really supposed to believe that other than Hugh Jackman the rest of the cast was not autotuned within an inch of their lives???
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great! Simply amazing. I could not stop reading it!! This book was simply captivating. Nicholas Sparks is the best author ever!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Good  quality so far, let's see how it holds up . I find that these Micro USB connectors from other brands tend to not work after about 5-6 months. I bought Amazon because I can return it if it's faulty and theoretically the quality should be better.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The relationship between Sherlock and Watson is complicated, stories are intriguing. I thoroughly love this series - don't miss it.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Great story, but I had to suspend doubts that Jessica Chastain's character was wearing heels during an interrogation in  the Middle East....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game I would recommend it  to any one who wants a horse but you don't have the space or money for it. It did full of fun things to do and is so realistic I really and truly love this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it!  The kids love to play it, too.  I kinda stole it from them, actually...  Don't like the whole energy thing.  Have to wait a while to do anything.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|got this to try to learn piano keys but no much good fore that as far as dinking around with it im thinking some would like that
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It took me almost a year to get through the insipid writing. The &#34;inner goddess&#34; crap was ridiculous. However, I'd like to meet Mr. Grey
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's a bright and colorful game, spirited in many ways. Very expansive with a variety of aquatic life. Shark upgrades are awesome, so are the manta rays, anglerfish, gold rushes, and undoubtably more I'll discover. Thanks Future Games!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Nice looking. Great AI. Lacks only a running move list and possibly a counter for taken pieces. I'm guessing it's top level is around a 1400-1500 rating.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app, nicely done. Well thought out and nicely implemented.<br />Tried the free one, worked so well I gave them my money. So should you.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Simply one of the best books I have ever read.  I didn't ever want it to end and can't wait to get the next book.  I read most books very quickly.  But, with Follett, every word is to be relished.  Follett is amazing and this book is wonderful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really like this author's writing style. He is a master at throwing in things that totally change what you are thinking will happen next.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|It's a great series and I got hooked on the kind, but tough Capt. Archer.  The characters are very interesting, with their different personalities and clothes, which are always weird in some way.  We love it!
B007STXHTM|4.0|I bought this to get the flat picture look when scuba diving.  It took great video.  One draw back is the size of the black picture flattener blocks part of the front window which makes it a little difficult to see the mode you are using.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|finally a game that compares but even surpasses bloons 4 td ... this game has length playability and is seriously jus downright hilarious I don't normally write reviews but dude this game deserves it... its so sexy
B00136NYR6|5.0|Not sure why, but Bob Dylan never really stuck with me. Of course, he's written great stuff, but I'd only ever picked up one of his albums before, and that was actually a CD club accident. Good album, but still, by accident. I picked Highway 61 Revisted because I like the enjoy the title track. It was a good deal, and I figured I might as well expand my Dylan. It's fantastic. I listened to it a day after I bought it, then went back and listened again. Fantastic.It doesn't really feel like it's from 1965. I figured this is supposed to be one of his more important albums, and has songs on it I like, so it was a good place to start poking around some more. The title track was probably the high point of it for me, but that's why I got the album. What surprised me was that there really wasn't much of a low point on it. The last track is 11 minutes long, and I enjoyed it as much as the rest. Fantastic album, classic in the timeless sense.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The film &#34;Life Of PI&#34; is spectacular.  The computer graphics are so very convincing and create beautiful scenes, especially the ocean scenes, for the viewer.  The film was gripping, keeping us on the edge of our seats throughout.  We had seen the Academy Awards show and knew the film won many awards.  Well-deserved!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Not for the bloodsucking, twilight types. Good. This movie was what I wanted. Left the ipad running with it while I did some office work....missed some parts of the movie but this movie was predictable and I need not have seen the missed parts....The movie fulfilled my need for destruction and guns.<br />Nice girl lead. No heavy thinking required. Fun.<br />I do not regret paying for this movie.
B001QJUX24|5.0|John Wayne's portrayal of troubled Ethan Edwards in this film is one of his best performances in my opinion. The Searchers is full of rich characters that are pure John Ford.  I've watched this film dozens of times and I never get tired of it.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It's the perfect accessory for this device. Easy to carry around and keeps the headset charged. I just love it.
B000065V42|5.0|This is a great movie for my youth and my 4 year old lives it. New for great price. Must have classic movie for kids.
B000FC13E0|4.0|I think the first-person narration really helps in this kind of thing, because it’s a technology-run-amok thriller, and clearly this is a technology Crichton had genuine worries about. And in my humble opinion, he was right to be worried. The developments in this novel are still quite a ways off, but having read it, you have to be worried about the long-term consequences when we finally do start monkeying around with things at the nano level. Also, there are parts of the book that stick with you, like the scene where we finally get to hear a few desperate words from … oh, let’s just say once of the principal characters whom we haven’t REALLY heard from until that scene (Sorry to be cryptic, just don’t wanna do spoilers). It’s scary where it’s supposed to be scary, and Cichton never talks down to the reader, which I like. In fact I learned several interesting facts about predator-prey interaction, along with the nano stuff. It’s not a perfect book, Crichton’s always been more of a craftsman that an artist, but hey, that’s more good enough for me.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this while on vacation and couldn't put it down.  The character development was very good and I like how the story was told from two different perspectives.<br /><br />I would read more by this same author.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot! I get tired of the same old romance novels whose plots are all exactly alike with just the names changing. This was a totally different kind of book--very well thought out. I especially enjoyed the story being told from the dog's perspective.  I always knew my dog understood what I was saying to him!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I loved reading this book!  It helped me to understand myself in a new way and to stop feeling guilty for feeling &#34;different&#34; from so many people in my life- needing time alone, going to bed early, tiring out after social experiences.  This book helped me to realize the aspects of my life that are well-balanced and the aspects that stretch my introverted self too far.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|i love this game i have  been wanting this seen i got my kindle fire.<br /><br />love this game i will keep on playing it forever.
B00B10ENBA|1.0|Very disappointed with this movie after having high expectations based on the all the positive reviews.  I could have tolerated the poor acting and B-movie feel if it had at least been historically accurate.  But to have taken so much poetic license and this is what they came up with?  And then it won the Academy Award?!?  Wow.  Sorry I paid $ for this.
B0000046KM|5.0|The first time I heard her sing &#34;Where Do You Start&#34; I just knew I had to get an album by her.  And Johnny Mandel has been the best always.  So the album was absolutely wonderful.  Carol J
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Some What One Dimensional:<br />I found the charters to be shallow and the story to be drawn out with too much attempt to build interesting personalities. They were just not that believable, really “amazing Amy” and “perfect Nick”, they were both far from it, what they were, egotistical and neurotic!  I just could not buy it as this was label as a thriller! Good thing I had time to spare for reading this month.
B00006LFGD|5.0|As usual Barbra is never a disappointment, with duets she proves she can do anything.  She never ages.  Carol J

B005MLOKXA|4.0|I think the acting is great, the story line is interesting most of the time and the characters are well developed. Perfect watching material for when I have a lot of laundry to fold.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|Wow! This was a video game I watched and not a movie. I have the first three and they are great, but this, yikes! Oh well, maybe I'll watch my purchase and listen to metal on my iPad. Monday morning qtr-backing I wouldn't even rent this, play the game instead. Have a nice day.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I would recommend this. Cheryl Strayed writes so descriptively that throughout the book the PCT is so palpable.  I liked the parallel journey within herself and on the PCT.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I loved Sex when it was on HBO and now I'm so happy I can watch it when ever I want. I love that it's all in one book altogether.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Why didn't it get the academy award? It is a cut above all the rest, in a class by itself.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Incredible how many charges this thing holds.  I considered the other higher charge models, but really, you are only going to use this a couple of times on a long trip and unless you have a family of 7, all with iPad's, iPhone's and other gadget toys you are not going to need the higher model.
B004J64QSI|4.0|i HAVE 3 OTHER CAST RECORDINGS OF LES MIS - THE 10TH, THE BROADWAY AND THE LONDON ORIGINAL CASTS.<br />IT IS SO MUCH FUN TO SEE HOW THEY DIFFER!  (AND HOW MUCH ALIKE THEY ARE).
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|Plain and simple, it was an irritating book. My friends and I that all read it, found it to be a waste of time.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  The backstory of the hunt for bin Ladin was quite interesting.  I liked at the end that the action picked up and became a bit more captivating.  Like others, I felt the movie was a bit too long and tended to drag on in some places.  Still, a good movie that demonstrates the work that our intelligence and military folks are doing to keep our country safe and bringing our enemies to justice.
B000002HJR|4.0|I like it but I never really bought into the Down movement.  I think it is better than the other Down material because there is some musical dynamic.  I can't stand a CD that sounds the same on every song.  I can actually tell which song is which without looking at a track number or jewel case.  As for the other Down CD's......not so much.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|What a pleasant story. I've read all of the Blossom Street series now and enjoyed every one.  I feel as if I know the characters personally.  Thank you so much Debbie Macomber.
B003ELOQD4|3.0|Like other reviews I can agree that the sound is incredible but the show in general is kind of ho hum.  If you loved the previous dvd's from Chicago and Boston this might annoy you like it did me.  Hamish Hamilton has a way really grabbing a live performance and capturing the &#34;emotion&#34; side of live music as shown in the previous dvd's.  Tom Krueger left me wondering what I was watching if anything at all.  The stage is so big and it easily is the focus on this production.  Or should I say OVER THE TOP PRODUCTION.  Too many cam.era's that change the view every 1.5 to 2.5 seconds is distracting.  I felt even the set list is sub par for U2.  At time's I found myself looking at the case trying to figure out what the title of a well known song was.  Other times I would walk out the room just to listen to the music because the change in camera angles was driving me crazy.  It was almost like watching a strobe light for 45 minutes at a time.  There isn't any connection between the audience and the band like the other DVD's.  Watch the other show's from this tour on youtube and save yourself some frustration.
B005NPCUC8|4.0|I like Pink Floyd.  This Mp3 brings back good memories from my Childhood.  I might get the album next for my enjoyment
B007RAE6TC|5.0|This is still the best movie adaption of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet on film. The lavish sets and costumes are breathtaking. Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were young enough to remind us that this story is about young teenagers, brave enough to try and bridge the rift between their families but, in the end, falling victim to the consequences of the hatred around them.<br /><br />My young granddaughter was enthralled and engaged despite the challenging language and vocabulary. This is a timeless classic.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I never saw this while it was running on TV. I really enjoyed the first season and am looking forward to Season 2.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love it - it's a great movie (though I think the books are better) just purchased a new smart tv and this streamed seamlessly via the tv and looked great!
0061978078|4.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />In Delirium, the goal was to get out, now in Pandemonium, the goal for Lena is to survive. Pandemonium by Lauren Oliver, the second book in the Delirium trilogy, answers the question \\"What do you do after escaping the dystopian government?\\" and the answer seems to be \\"Just keep running.\\" This fast-paced dystopian YA tells the story of Lena learning how to fight against the government that took everything from her and tries to just keep taking.<br />As you may recall, I started the Delirium trilogy because the first two books were available on audio from my library, and it's a fairly limited selection ;-). This review is for the second book, Pandemonium, so it will have major spoilers for the first book, so instead you should go check out my review of Delirium here. Now that that's taken care of, let's get down to the good stuff :D<br /><br />Title: Pandemonium<br />Author: Lauren Oliver<br />Length: 10 hours 34 minutes (9 discs)<br />Genre-ish: Dystopia YA<br />Rating: ★★★★☆ - mostly epic, ending stumbled<br /><br />Strengths:<br />I really liked the Wilds and Resistance setting in Pandemonium better than Lena trying to fit in in Delirium, they just made for a much more interesting story.<br />Lena has become so much stronger and a much more likable character for me. I think the growth was completely reasonable as well, given what she has gone through.... Yey for kick-butt girls :D.<br />Given the plot of Pandemonium, we learn a lot more about the world outside of the borders and the Resistance, which was pretty awesome, since it was a bit dreary within in the controlled lands ;-).<br />Weaknesses:<br />Delirium and Pandemonium have the same narrator, but she has switched the pronunciation of Hanna... probably to the correct pronunciation, but still, gah!<br />The female narrator just didn't pull off the male voices very well, making the love interest less appealing to me than I think he would be if I read the books without the annoying voice in my ears....<br />Pandemonium is actually two story-lines \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" that switch every couple of chapters and don't really have any epic connection that warrants their separation that I could see. I think it would have worked just fine for the story-line to proceed in chronological order....<br />Wow, that ending was so melodramatic *twitches* I'm so much less excited for Requiem now because of the last few pages of Pandemonium... seriously.... For those of you who have read Pandemonium, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, and I honestly like the outcome of the ending, but it just felt so ridiculously contrived and \\"HEY LOOK PLOT TWIST\\" to me.... Like a Vader is your father moment....<br />Summary:<br />Pandemonium is way better than Delirium in my humble opinion ;-) but that could be because of the setting and type of story that interests me (in fact I'm pretty sure that's main reason). That still means that Pandemonium, while having some strange flaws, is awesome and you should keep reading the trilogy and eagerly await Requiem with me even if the ending also makes you go WTF?? I'm just hoping Requiem isn't too much like that ending >.>ks without the annoying voice in my ears....<br />Pandemonium is actually two story-lines \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" that switch every couple of chapters and don't really have any epic connection that warrants their separation that I could see. I think it would have worked just fine for the story-line to proceed in chronological order....<br />Wow, that ending was so melodramatic *twitches* I'm so much less excited for Requiem now because of the last few pages of Pandemonium... seriously.... For those of you who have read Pandemonium, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, and I honestly like the outcome of the ending, but it just felt so ridiculously contrived and \\"HEY LOOK PLOT TWIST\\" to me.... Like a Vader is your father moment....<br />Summary:<br />Pandemonium is way better than Delirium in my humble opinion ;-) but that could be because of the setting and type of story that interests me (in fact I'm pretty sure that's main reason). That still means that Pandemonium, while having some strange flaws, is awesome and you should keep reading the trilogy and eagerly await Requiem with me even if the ending also makes you go WTF?? I'm just hoping Requiem isn't too much like that ending >.>

0439023491|5.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />Wow, I know I'm late on reading the Hunger Games trilogy, but rest assured that I am now fully amazed by Suzanne Collins and her made skills with Catching Fire :D. I was able to snag Catching Fire from the library's (very scant) YA audiobook section, and I'm actually amazed that I spotted it because the case didn't even have the cover art on it! I might need to go make a suggestion to my librarian about marketing such a great trilogy.... In any case, much of this has already been said, but the main thing I want to emphasize is that the love triangle element is not that bad! As a person who doesn't like love triangles, I had delayed finishing the trilogy after reading Hunger Games. However, I am now convinced that everyone should finish the trilogy, don't be afraid of the romance ;-).<br /><br />Title: Catching Fire<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />Length: 11 hrs 37 mins<br />Genre-ish: YA Dystopia<br />Rating: ★★★★★- amazing sequel, the action just keeps going!<br /><br />Strengths:<br /> Catching Fire has fast-paced action right from the start! Really, we wouldn't expect any less ;-).<br />As I said above, while there are two love interests, it hardly counts when Katniss is forced to have a relationship with one of them by the corrupt government....<br />All of the characters in Catching Fire just get better. We start learning the depth of President Snow's villainy, we finally get to know Gale better, and we meet new faces! We don't know if we can really trust said new faces, but they are funny :D. I'm looking at you Finnick >.> &lt;.&lt;.<br />I loooooved the narrator, Carolyn McCormick! Even the minor characters had voice changes of their own (all from one narrator's vocal cords!) and she gave wonderful dimension to already wonderful characters :).<br />While the first third of Catching Fire seems like it will be similar to Hunger Games, it's not, don't worry! And I can't say more without spoilers ;-).<br />Weaknesses:<br />While Katniss keeps thinking she was faking most of her affection for Peeta, there is enough doubt and angst that I still had to roll my eyes at times. Make up your mind, girl!<br />Warning: there is gore! This is after all still Panem.... If you aren't up for tragic moments and icky moments, this trilogy probably isn't for you.<br />Summary:<br />Love love love Catching Fire, as most others did as well :D. My biggest regret is waiting so long to finally continue the trilogy, but I made it before the movie ;-). I in fact love Catching Fire more than Hunger Games, I think, because we get to see so much more of Panem and Katniss really starts coming into her own. This of course all sets you up for needing to get Mockingjay (the third book) immediately! If you have been thinking of finding out what all the hype was about, go for it. If you were like me and decided to stop after the first book for fear of angsty romance, have no fear. There is some angst, but the delicious dystopian action is totally worth it! Also check out the audiobooks if you have a chance, they are rocking!aknesses:<br />While Katniss keeps thinking she was faking most of her affection for Peeta, there is enough doubt and angst that I still had to roll my eyes at times.

0547258305|4.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />So, I was the odd-duck and listened to Fire by Kristin Cashore first, which is the companion novel to Graceling. I can tell you that it is safe to read them out of publishing order, though I did have to check with my reading buddy on one name that I think would have been an obvious connection to me if I had read them the other way around. In any case, I had been hesitant to grab Graceling on audiobook because it has a different narrator than Fire (and I loved Fire's narrator), but I just put some time between the two and didn't have any problem adjusting. Even better, Graceling is a full-cast audio, so each of the characters has their own voice actor :D.<br /><br />Title: Graceling<br />Author: Kristin Cashore<br />Time: 11 discs (12 hours and 30 mins)<br />Genre-ish: Fantasy<br />Rating: ★★★★☆- fun world, didn't pull me in<br /><br />Strengths:<br /> The whole Grace magic system is really interesting and Katsa and Po's graces are no exception, especially since everything is not as it initially appears ;-).<br />This is the first full-cast audiobook that I've listened to, and I had to get used to it, but once I did, I really loved it. I solves the problem of the opposite gender voices never quite sounding right, and helps make sure all the characters (even minor ones) are distinct.<br />Katsa is a bit of an odd character, but she develops well towards the end of Graceling.<br />Weaknesses:<br />The narration got a wee bit overdramatic at times. If I was reading the dialogue in a physical book, I would have pronounced the sentences much different, and I think I would have enjoyed the tense scenes between Katsa and Po towards the end of Graceling much better.<br />For some reason, the romance between Katsa and Po just didn't make me swoon as much as others have. This might have been due to the previously mentioned overly dramatic narration, or perhaps it was because Katsa was just a little too cold for me even when she starts to thaw. I'll need to try reading Graceling after the memory of the audiobook has faded to decide.<br />Summary:<br />While I liked the companion novel, Fire, better than Graceling, the world and magic system are still freaking awesome. The characters of Po and Bitterblue easily made me smile, and while Katsa didn't win me over quite as thoroughly, I still very much enjoyed Graceling. I'm looking forward to seeing what Cashore comes up with as she matures as an author, because so far she has thought up two really interesting countries separated only by a mountain range. I can't wait for whole new worlds :D. I'm also very excited to get my hands on a copy of Bitterblue, since that little princess is adorable!she starts to thaw.

1250007208|4.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />Cinder by Marissa Meyer was exceedingly popular last year, so it had to go on my Christmas wishlist ;-). I however had a massive number of books that I needed/wanted to read, so it wasn't until the sequel Scarlet was set to come out that I finally got my butt in gear, haha. I'm a bit late to the game, but I agree with what many have said before: Cinder rocks! Who would have thought to combine cybords, moon people, a plague, and a Cinderella retelling all together?? Marissa Meyer, that's who :D.<br /><br />Title: Cinder<br />Author: Marissa Meyer<br />Length: 387 pages (hardcover)<br />Genre-ish: Sci-fi/Fairytale retelling YA (with cyborgs!)<br />Rating: ★★★★☆- so original, slowed in the middle<br /><br />Strengths:<br /> Cinder has cyborgs and moon people who have separated from Earth's population long enough to develop some interesting traits. How awesome of a future is that :D. Sure, maybe I don't want to live there, but I sure want to read about it!<br />In addition to the awesome sci-fi elements, there is a plague; nothing says compelling like a plague.<br />Omg the crazy plot twists! I can't actually count all the cool plot developments in Cinder right now. Nothing is as it seems >.> &lt;.&lt;.<br />I always worry with retellings that the story will be predictable because the book will follow the retelling too closely. This is not the case with Cinder!<br />The romance is so adorable *sighs*.<br />Weaknesses:<br />I am probably in the minority here, but I found that the pacing slowed in the middle of Cinder. I had to push a bit to get to the good stuff at the end.<br />There is only so much bad news that I can take at one time, and Cinder started pushing my limit. It's not really a happy book at times....<br />Wow, such a cliffhanger. You've been warned.<br />Summary:<br />If you are craving a fresh and amazing sci-fi with a touch of Cinderella retelling and a hint of dystopia, get Cinder. I know that it might seem like a crazy combination of story elements, but there is a reason so many people have been raving about this one folks! I will admit that I'm not actually addicted to Cinderella or cyborgs, but even beyond the cool ideas thrown together, Cinder is a solid story about a girl kicking butt against adversity and making friends in the most unusual places.t seem like a crazy combination of story elements, but there is a reason so many people have been raving about this one folks!

B009GX7IRA|5.0|We don't watch television much.  But my daughter had purchased the DVD's of this series starring Mark Harmon and we borrowed one to watch it on her recommendation.  We are hooked on the show.  We still don't watch it on TV but we did purchase this first episode of Season 10 so that we could see the results of the end of season nine.  We will purchase the entire series when it is released on Blu-Ray.  I have a hearing problem and any video we get has to have sub-titles.  The first season doesn't as do several of the other seasons.  We did manage to watch the 7th, 8th, and 9th seasons as they do have subtitles.  Some of them have closed captions but for some reason they don't work on our system.  The acting is great and they are well written.  I highly suggest you give some consideration to this program.
0061726834|3.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />In a world were love is a disease, Lena has lived her whole life looking forward to her 18th birthday when she will be cured and safe from contracting \\"the most deadly of all deadly things.\\" However, dystopias just aren't happy with the status quo, and Lena quickly starts meeting people and experiencing things that convince her the government might not be right about everything after all....<br />I have a rather long drive to school/work and therefore need to have an audiobook with me always ;-). I've found that the best place to look for them is the library's YA section, because they are so much better than the Adult selection :D. I was hopeful for Delirium since I had seen a lot of positive reviews, but the dystopia genre has gotten so filled up lately that I just have gotten a lot pickier in what a book needs to bring in order to be new enough. Don't get me wrong, I see a lot of promise in this trilogy, Delirium just didn't have me jumping for joy, or even hopping really.<br /><br />Title: Delirium<br />Author: Lauren Oliver<br />Discs: 9<br />Genre-ish: Dystopia YA<br />Rating: ★★★☆☆ - promising premise, kinda meh<br /><br />Strengths:<br />The premise is really interesting, since love does wreak a lot of havoc in young people's lives, but I find it fairly doubtful our society would ever make the shift to wanting to go without it, given that we stereotypically consider life incomplete without love nowadays....<br />I really loved the secondary characters Hanna and Grace! Hanna is the best friend and she was spunky and fun. Grace was the adorable younger cousin/adopted sister that you wanted to cuddle and hug, so cute!<br />The plot twist 2/3 through Delirium was epic and completely unexpected :D.<br />Weaknesses:<br />I wasn't nearly as in love (haha) with the main characters of Delirium. Lena just seemed rather flat to me, and Alex was that guy that I could understand why my friend had a crush on, but I was not interested in at all. It made it difficult to feel much of a connection to the romance element, which is kind of a big deal if you didn't guess ;-).<br />The romance plot is also pretty darn predictable, especially with the references being dropped all over the place *sigh*.<br />Again, while the premise is interesting, I really doubt that it would happen. The cool thing about dystopias is when they are eerily possible, and I just didn't get that feeling with Delirium.<br />While Delirium is a solid YA dystopia, there didn't seem to be anything fresh to bring to the genre, and Delirium just didn't grab me as a book. If I wasn't listening to it, I probably would have forgotten to pick it up again.<br />I don't recommend listening to this one on audio, I found the narrator's voice to be too childish at times and might have been part of the reason I didn't connect with the main characters.<br />Summary:<br />As with a lot of books, if you are in the mood for a YA dystopia that doesn't stray from the genre, Delirium is just your cup of tea. However, if you want something fresh and are freaking sick of books that ring very similar, then you might want to skip this one. The one thing I will say, however, is that where Delirium ends opens up the possibility for the rest of the trilogy to be much better (in my opinion ;-)) than the first book. I am planning to continue on with Pandemonium, partially because I know the library has it, and partially because I'm really hopeful with the direction the story seems to be going.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|I feel I can't judge whether the unique structure of the novel was &#34;gimmicky&#34;; it may have just been my mood at the time--or my ever-decreasing attention span--but I liked basically reading six well-written and quite different novellas, even if I didn't feel it added that much thematically or otherwise.
1616960922|5.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul by Brandon Sanderson might be a novella, but it packs a full-length punch. A stamp and history based magic-system combines with an outlaw girl's past and a dying emperor to make a brilliant and fast-paced fantasy story.<br />Brandon Sanderson is in the middle of several long projects right now, and so released two novellas this year instead of a novel, one (Legion) that is more sci-fi, and The Emperor's Soul, which is very obviously fantasy. However, Sanderson is never content with recycled ideas, and even though The Emperor's Soul is much shorter than any other book of his I've read, the story and magic system were just as amazing as I've come to expect :D. Also, The Emperor's Soul is in the same world as Elantris, which you only notice if you've read the other novel, which is pretty awesome.<br /><br />Title: The Emperor's Soul<br />Author: Brandon Sanderson<br />Pages: 167 (paperback)<br />Genre-ish: Fantasy<br />Rating: ★★★★★ - Epicly awesome<br /><br />Strengths:<br />This magic system is possibly the best yet! Stamps are crafted that subtly change the history of an object in order to change the object itself. So if you want to improve the appearance of the vase next to you, you make a stamp that changes the quarry the stone came from, or changes the artist that made the vase. In order to make stamps that work, you need to know, or be good at guessing, an object's history and how to actually make the stamps. So brilliant!<br />For a novella, The Emperor's Soul does an impressive amount of world-building, and making it set in the same world as Elantris really helped this aspect. We now know that the world of Elantris has this other society somewhere across the sea, and I really hope there are more stories to come :D.<br />We really get to know the main character, Shai, and bits about secondary characters through Shai's eyes. The things we learn about Shai's motivations and dreams are quite moving and things you wouldn't really think about the stamping magic implying immediately. This all leads to a very well thought-out character development throughout the novella and well-rounded characters despite the length.<br />Weaknesses:<br />I wish it was longer! Or I guess I wish there would be more? The Emperor's Soul was very well-paced given the length, but I wish we could have learned even more about the society that Shai moves in.<br />Similarly, Sanderson generally has many subplots twisting around each other, and the length of The Emperor's Soul kept that from being a possibility. Therefore, there weren't really any epic plot twists, as there usually are in Sanderson's novels.<br />Sanderson has so many projects going on that I doubt he'll be able to continue to expand this world much in the near future, but that is honestly my biggest complaint :D.<br />Summary:<br />As can be expected from Sanderson, The Emperor's Soul has a freaking brilliant magic system, strong and thoughtful character development, and interesting world-building. The only complaint is a typical one of novellas: why isn't there more of this awesomeness?? If you like intricate subplots and plot twists, and novella will probably disappoint you, but if you want to read about a really cool idea and some really touching characters in a fantasy world that another awesome book is in, pick up The Emperor's Soul.

1423113462|4.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings:<br /><br />The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan is a strong start to another thrilling and fun series combing ancient Greek and Roman culture with the perils of being a teenager!<br />When I spotted The Heroes of Olympus series on the bookshelf of the new guy in my lab's bookshelf, I new they were good people!<br />Well, I knew that I would be great friends with his fiance, whose books they were ;-). It doesn't hurt that she makes these really delicious chocolate desserts whenever she has people over, freaking fantastic! In any case, she was gracious enough to lend me The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan, making her possibly the coolest person ever :D.<br /><br />Title: The Lost Hero<br />Author: Rick Riordan<br />Pages: 553 (hardcover)<br />Genre-ish: YA Fantasy<br />Rating: ★★★★☆ - Light and fun<br />Setting: The Greek gods are real and periodically fall in love with mortals, producing demi-god children. These children have powers associated with their god parents, as well as the ability to speak ancient Greek, uncanny prowess with weapons and other helpful things. There are also all of those ancient Greek monsters, however, and they things demi-gods are tasty. We knew all this from the Percy Jackson novels, however. Now, it seems there may be more than just Greek heroes and gods, where did the Roman gods go after all?<br />Premise: Jason wakes up on a bus with no memories at all. He doesn't know why he is holding this pretty girl's hand, nor why an angry old man is yelling at him. His day proceeds to get worse as wind monsters attack him and his friends and they discover that they are actually demi-gods and things are pretty bad in the world right now. This is all par for the course though. The weird part is that everyone important keeps looking at Jason as if he, in particular, is a really really really bad omen, but they refuse to tell him why.... Oh well, before he can figure that out, they need to go save the world.<br />Strengths:<br />Riordan can write! The Lost Hero is fast and fun, so that even though is is fairly long, you'll have no trouble buzzing right through it. The writing is lightly descriptive (not too much, as we've all complained about before!) with plenty of humor thrown in.<br />The three main characters are all good kids that care about each other despite the odd situation they are in, yet they all have their own personalities and weaknesses to deal with. The Lost Hero benefits from three points of view that switch each chapter, so we get a good idea of what is going on, and get the chance to follow three subplots that weave together throughout the book.<br />It's so interesting to start finding out about the Roman side of things! I won't say more, since I don't want to ruin anything (and because I don't actually know that much yet), but I'm so excited to find out :D.<br />Weaknesses:<br />I was super creeped out by the description of two of the female deity figures at first. Like, I had to turn the light on because the descriptions were so creepy! Isn't this book supposed to be for younger-ish kids??<br />There is only so far that you can push the epic \\"Omg something more horrible and all powerful is going to try to take over now\\" and I really am not sure that I'm convinced it's going to work. The Percy Jackson books used up the Titans trying to take over, and so now Riordan has to go bigger, and while he seems to have found something bigger in the Greek myths, I'm just not quite convinced yet.<br />The YA nature of The Lost Hero annoyed me at times, with big words being a little overused and then explained, or kids being just plain annoying.<br />Summary:<br />The Lost Hero was very similar to the Percy Jackson books, so if you liked those, you should definitely pick this one up! Riordan continues his light and fun style, while incorporating the Greek myths that so many of us were so interesting in in school :D. While The Lost Hero has the weaknesses that many YA books have for those of us that don't read YA as much, anyone who reads and enjoys YA should definitely love The Lost Hero! I'm super excited to borrow the next book in the series *sneaks over to friend's house*.ve for those of us that don't read YA as much, anyone who reads and enjoys YA should definitely love The Lost Hero! I'm super excited to borrow the next book in the series *sneaks over to friend's house*.

If you were totally sucked into the ups and downs of Abby and Travis, then it was a good thing; if not, it dragged. So much happened in the first third of the book that I stared at the remainder, wondering what the heck was left to say.<br /><br />The characters were definitely set in concrete, meaning they were definitely \\"types.\\" Luckily, they did develop a tad beyond, but not much. I was very intrigued by the fighting scenarios, the Vegas connection and Abby's life prior to college. What I was not enamored of was Abby herself, as well as the ping-ponging of her affections. I was fascinated by the fact that Abby thought that she was the one that wasn't good enough for Travis, so much that I wish that it had been a stronger theme. It would have made me a little less annoyed at her explosions with Travis, the back and forth of being broken up or dating. So tedious.<br /><br />A lot of the clutter could have been cleared out to make this a more streamlined story. I think that at least one-third of the book could have been eliminated and it would have been tighter and more enjoyable.<br /><br />My main gripe, though, is the flimsiness of the plot devices. Seriously, she loses a bet and since she never \\"welshes\\" on a debt, she forced herself to stay with Travis, not only in his apartment, but in his bed? And she goes to Thanksgiving at his Dad's house because she doesn't want them to have a horrible Thanksgiving and agrees to keep up appearances even though she and Travis are no longer together? There are many more of these contrivances throughout the book as well.<br /><br />Some reviewers have taken offense at their relationship and tried to turn it into some kind of dysfunctional romance that will turn sour once Travis throws the first inevitable punch at Abby. I took the story at face value, seeing two people who are products of their environment, yes, but, as with any YA/NA romance, people who will be able to redeem each other.

B005723JSQ|5.0|I wanted something light and fun to read while road tripping and Sophie kinsella never disappoints. I always enjoy the main character and respect them, even though I don't always like the shop a holic character who is pretty shallow. I You will really enjoy this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very good book, easy to read.  Having lost a child to cancer, I found this very true as to how they handle this crises.  Loved the book!  A tear jerker!
B000SOYEQY|5.0|I fell asleep watching this movie at least four or five times but it was totally worth watching over and over again
B008Q08EV8|4.0|We stumbled upon this movie.  It has a great story, great history, the only thing is the over-goriness.  I would like to see more from this director.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love mahjong games and this is one of the best I have played.  I didn't rate it a five star because after every game there is an add.  But you have to expect that from a free game.  Could make the tiles bigger or pinch in or out.  The music and sound effects are great.
0385349947|2.0|Sorry. Didn't buy the book. Read these comments and looked inside to check out the text. She 'lost me' when she mentioned she had a mentor - Larry Summers. I'm pretty sure he must have been a darned good mentor, but again, she 'lost me' there.
B005BZQS1E|2.0|Could have been a decent movie. Take away the drug references, vulgarities, and the juvenile attempts at humor, might have been a real movie. Instead of just a campy farce. Nice shot of Portman's backside though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent and breathtaking. I could not put the book down. It was amazing. I simply could not get enough.  This was an excellent book with very descriptive scenes and it kept you on your toes. There is never a dull moment. I would recommend it to mature adults.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|Title says it all. A nice classic rock sound, but repetitive and one dimensional throughout the whole album. I'd rather have cherry-picked the two songs that make this album rather than the whole thing.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|The movie was very well done.  It was slick and transitioned well.  The lead actor was very charismatic and played the character masterfully.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|While I had seen the movie first, and that takes away some of the surprises of the book's narrative, I believe that many of the book's pleasures come in their extent and depth of detail and discussion. The book is quite lengthy after all of these segments are expanded, and therefore good to know where it is going in the back of one's mind, for a huge segment is dedicated to capturing the feel and extent of an overly drawn out stay at sea. The range of deep thought to humorous observations of mankind makes for a delightful stir in examining some of our own questions of life. I am glad that Life of Pi has become part of my life, for I am enriched in having experienced it now to its full extent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfed! It is woo fun! It is like temple run but even better because u have more control on where the character goes. I an addicted to this game as u can tell by my highscore of 1,716,900!!! :) :) a must get app!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great story that left me wanting to go right into the next book, to which I did!  Having seen the movie, it gave me a good base for imagining all the characters.
B002ZG9968|3.0|Movie is fantastic. However, I wish there was a choice between full screen and wide screen editions.  I prefer full screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was not disappointed by the second book.  An easy read that kept my interest, page to page, till the end of the book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's  good but there are a few problems,  First it freezes sometimes for like a day,  and second it glitches,  but other wise very well thought out. Good job Mojang..... :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found the last book very good, for most of the content.  The conclusion lacked depth; but all that led up to the end of the book, it was very intriguing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Live SwiftKey! Used it when it was just the free app... Then got the full app for free, app of the day, awhile back!! Love it!
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|Got Hooked right away!!! Good acting LOVE the scenery!!!! Great series with a lot of emotion. Hope to see a lot more :)
B003M6ENDO|3.0|Jack Bauer has been retired and living quietly in NYC when sudden events bring him reluctantly back to CTU.  There are plots to kill a Middle Eastern President and unleash a nuclear weapon on the city.  Can Jack overcome all odds and save the world yet again?<br /><br />I was very disappointed in the lazy writing of Season 8's first 20 episodes.  It was the same old thing - another dirty CTU agent and office romance, political squabbling, a bomb threat, too many villains and too little Jack - and it was dull, until the last four episodes; then Jack was, thankfully, on screen most of the time and the action was as rip-roarin,' rootin'-tootin,' and edge of your seat-intense as the best shows of the past.  The excellent series finale made up for the earlier lackluster hours and the show ended with integrity and style.<br /><br />While the disc, unfortunately, contains no commentaries, interviews, or bloopers (just some short, making-of videos), Season 8 is still must-see TV for fans of \\"24.\\"
B007C7UZIG|5.0|This app has all of the essential elements of the real steam program. The only thing I wish that is could do is use the steam trading system with other people.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing until the end and I loved the humor and flirtyness between Heat and Rook. Time to go read the next one!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Love John Pulman character.  I miss Oliver Stone books but this one is right up there with him. I read this out of order of the Forgotten.  Good great and wonderful
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Doctor Who is a great show. Fun, and entertaining. Just when you think you've found your favorite Doctor, along comes Matt Smith.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|I absolutely believe &#34;No Strings Attached&#34; is destined to become one of the real classic that will endure the test of time... like Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc.... but it's got just enough &#34;drama&#34; and &#34;heart&#34; to make it different and, I think, better.<br /><br />Make sure that when you watch it you can be completely focused on it, volume up with no distractions, or you'll miss out on half of the fun.  That's because half of the great dialog is contained in the sort of understated and/or &#34;background&#34; comments made by the various characters.  Although I'm not really an Ashton Kutcher fan, he really does a great job here.  I also think Natalie Portman was the absolutely perfect choice for her part as well... her acting perfectly portraying the feelings and emotions of her character.<br /><br />I've now watched this movie about a half-dozen times, sharing it with in-home audiences ranging from a &#34;significant other&#34;, to my 50- and 60-something female friends, to my 20-something sons and one of their girlfriends, and everyone who's seen it has laughed through it and loved it.<br /><br />In my mind, it's already a classic!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Loved their song &#34;Radioactive&#34;, which seems somewhat different than the rest of the album.  However, upon listening to the entire album, it seems more like a collection of eclectic songs, with a certain theme.  Be sure to pick up this hidden gem.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app! I love it because it's realistic and not super hard or time consuming 5 stars! :)
B00BTHV05M|4.0|I have always liked OneRepublic.  Initially I only liked a few songs when I first heard it, however many of the songs grew on me, as in previous albums.  I love it for background &#34;task&#34; music.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book...a tragic story of the realities of orphanages tempered by the importance of love, family and awesome friends and pets! At times the pace was slow, but it didn't last long. I would recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! it has a bunch if mini games in 1 game!!!! plus its free! I say get this game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible lets toy do different kinds of devotionals and it also lets you take notes so if you have a verse you want to remember you just put it into notes and they have a verse of the day
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was the best way for them to create another part of this game.  It was totally a five star game.
B00371XIJE|5.0|A wonderful story about love and loyalty! Makes me want to get a dog like Hachi! My girlfriend and I both loved it! :)
B0050DIWFC|1.0|The story line grabbed me from the start and kept me wanting to keep reading. Toward the end, I felt ad though I knee what would happen, but there was a small twist of poignancy that really brought the story to a fine climax.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Quite contrary to the traditional thinking of being brave that one would define. Whether you were expecting for a shiny hero to save the weak, you were mistaken. Brave is the courageous to confront your mom, yourself, to break free, and to fight for what you believe in responsibly. Being brave is not just an act, it is a process enchained with one's growing up. You want freedom, but are you willing to pay the price? And should one's freedom be merely as an act of selfishness be about one's life? Watch brave to find your own answer. Brave is a thrilling story and a must for the holiday.
B002PJL85K|4.0|The was great and excellent. Actors was amazing with their performance. Patrick Stewart was amaZing.patrick Stewart Patrick Stewart Patrick Stewart.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was interesting and keeps you guessing. It is a truly romantic love story that has you wanted the same kind of love.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I love this album!! So many good songs on this CD.  This was a great purchase!  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BF123WG|4.0|If you are interested in the story, it is a great movie. It is a Hollywood movie and made for that purpose and I enjoyed it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Thanks to Amazon, i finally got to watch TGW. I finished 3 seasons in 3 weeks because this show is that interesting and addictive. All characters are unique and likeable and contribute in a special way to the show. All in all I \\"lOved\\" watching TGW and I'm looking fwd to watching season 4 :)
0071390111|5.0|This is a massive volume that provides a detailed sense of \\"the principles of neural science,\\" the work's title. Basic statistics: the book weighs about nine pounds; it is 1709 pages long; it has 67 chapters; there are six appendices; 79 authors are involved; the book is divided up into 9 parts, each with numerous chapters. To compare, the fourth edition (published in 2000) had about 1400 pages. This volume is not meant for a general audience, but it is a wonderful resource for those who can work their way through its many chapters. I have found earlier volumes in this series very helpful for one part of my academic research agenda (the political implications of human biology).<br /><br />Let's take a look at the structure of the volume, to illustrate the substance of the book. Part I provides an overall perspective on the scope of the book. The chapters examine the role of the brain in behavior, a summary of nerve cells and their function, and the relationship between genes, the brain, and behavior. With this serving as an introduction, Part II goes on to examine cells and the molecular biology of the neuron. Among subjects covered: The structure and nature of neurons and glial cells (which support neurons) and the electrical properties of neurons. Part III focuses on synapses, which provide for communication between and among neurons. How do synapses operate? What are chemical and electrical modes of operation? What is the role of neurotransmitters? Finally, this section considers diseases of the nerve and systems that they support.<br /><br />Part IV is very important for my research interests--\\"The Neural Basis of Cognition.\\" How does the brain and its structure affect cognition Chapter 15 describes the structure of the central nervous system and how the cerebral cortex, for example, affects cognition. In the chapter is a discussion of how the cerebral cortex is organized by layers AND by columns. Other important chapters in this section include effects on cognitive functioning of the brain outside the cerebral cortex and how functional imaging of cognition works (and the limitations with the use of such technology).<br /><br />Part V summarizes our understanding of perception, how we come to experience the world around us. Subjects? The somatosensory system, touch, pain, vision (with five chapters devoted to the subject), the inner ear, hearing, and smell and taste. Part VI? Movement. The chapters herein explore the various elements in making movement possible. We learn of the different brain areas and other support systems underlying movement and locomotion.<br /><br />How do people process information? Part VII concentrates on this, and this segment is also of relevance for my own research interests. Part VIII targets development and emergence of behavior. The one chapter in this section that is most poignant to me is Chapter 59--\\"The Aging Brain.\\" The chapter speaks to what we know of the effects of aging on the brain and its functioning. Finally, section IX, \\"Language, Affect, and Learning.\\" These represent key issues of interest in our understanding of central features of being human.<br /><br />This book is not something that most of us would skim. But it is a compendium that well illustrates what we know about the structure and function of the brain. For those interested in the subject, this is an important work.tive functioning of the brain outside the cerebral cortex and how functional imaging of cognition works (and the limitations with the use of such technology).<br /><br />Part V summarizes our understanding of perception, how we come to experience the world around us.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I find this to be very helpful now that we're into tornado season here in the South...the forecast is good, but the map is extremely useful when , with the next page, one can see where the really dangerous weather is and where it's headed...that gives a few extra minutes to take cover if needed...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is an amazing rdp application especially considering the price.  Other apps I've used in the past would get me to my desktop,  but were almost impossible to use efficiently.  This is the first and only app I've bothered to rate,  and that is because it is so good.  They also get points for having the application on WebOS for my hp touch pad.  That tablet is long in the tooth these days but it still works very well with Splashtop.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|Terrence Malick's new film To The Wonder was released on the same day in select theaters across the U.S., but more significantly, on Video On Demand (VOD) and online so that you don't have to wait three or four months for it to come out on DVD or Blu-Ray, but can stay at home and watch it in HD and the comfort of your own home -- all for a mere $7.99 or $6.99 -- less than the price of a single ticket at the cinemas.<br /><br />This is a radical move, to bypass a theatrical release. But this works for this type of film, I believe, because the same-day limited release in theaters generates same-day reviews across the country and could result in great VOD traffic. This could be a new strategy for independent films.<br /><br />This is only fitting because this is such an intimate, personal film -- or experience -- that to share it in a dark auditorium with total strangers seems to be the antithesis of this film.<br /><br />I watched it on On Demand in HD and I found it to be, like all of Terrence Malick's films, a deeply internal experience. You're and constantly being pulled in several directions:<br /><br />1) You're never sure what's going on in a Terrence Malick film; yet you're assured that it's a steady hand that's riding the keel. A Malick film is a journey -- you go with it. It's the same sort of experience or sensation that you have when you're watching a Stanley Kubrick film for the first time. The story and the meaning is never obvious or written out. It's something that seeps into you.<br /><br />2) I keep using the word \\"experience\\" because that's so much of what a Malick film is. He's never followed traditional linear storytelling. He has his own entirely unique voice. And that's what a filmmaker has to have to stand above the rest and be unique. It's more sensory. More emotional; and not gut-wrenching and buckets of tears emotional--internal conscious thoughts-at-work emotional.<br /><br />3) It's mind-numbing and awe-inspiringly beautiful. Every shot --every single image -- is to die for. And all -- ALL -- are shot in NATURAL LIGHT!!!  Every shot backlit. To bring that final message home I found myself compelled to pick up my pocket camera and shoot these handful of photos off the screen. And these don't do To The Wonder justice.<br /><br />Emmanuel Lubezki deserves a special American Society of Cinematographers achievement award for this work. (Of course, that won't happen. It will go to another all digitally composited film as it has for the past three years with Avatar, Hugo, Life of Pie.)<br /><br />So often you hear filmmakers say words to the effect of, \\"We didn't want to talk about the subject of the movie -- we wanted to talk around it.\\" In Terrence Malick's universe, the actors barely talk at all, unless it is in Voice Overs of the thoughts of the characters are posing in questions to themselves. This could sound absurd in another filmmaker's film, but in a Terrence Malick film it's expected. And it's brilliant!<br /><br />Any other film is told in a story and you can almost see the screenplay's scene cards pinned onto the screen. In To The Wonder Malick doesn't even seem to bee shooting the scenes. Instead, he shoots everything that happens between the scenes. This could be frustrating for some traditional movie watchers. For me, however, I'm always watching movies in search of something new and different and original.To The Wonder is that film.<br /><br />Yet you sense, from images that you can relate to like recognizing similar snap shots from moments in your own life of knowing happiness, love, resentment, doubt, loss.<br /><br />There is a bigness and an emptiness to the film -- and this, I am certain, is intentional. Everything in Oklahoma is Big. The houses are Big. The rooms are Big. The skies are Big. The streets are wide. The rooms are spare, if not devoid of furniture. The people seem almost lost in it all, there is so much space between them. I believe that Malick is trying to say that there is an emptiness in the characters lives. And everyone is seeking love, either the love of another person or for the love of God to be returned, and that the vastness and emptiness in these places represents the space that the characters are hoping to be filled up with love.<br /><br />I can't help but think of the connection between this film and Malick's film from -- years ago The Thin Red Line. While that was a film set in World War Two, at its essence was a story about people that were all strangers in a strange land. The Americans and the Japanese they were fighting couldn't be more different from each other -- totally separated by language, race, culture. The Americans fearing death and the Japanese preferring death to surrender. They could have just as easily be aliens from another planet, a variation on War of the Worlds.  Also, the Japanese from the northern Pacific and the Americans from North America being brought to do combat on a harsh tropical island (Guadalcanal) in the Southern Hemisphere, which both armies were complete strangers to.<br /><br />The story takes place in Paris and Oklahoma. Ben Affleck meets Olga Kurylenko in Paris and brings her back to his home in Oklahoma. Life is happy and playful, but then the realities of being back in his world and at work set in. Domestic bliss gives way to mutually dissatisfied dreams and disillusionment. Then another woman from Affleck's youth, Rachel McAdams, comes back into his life. There is rekindled love. But love, like flowers, bloom and fade.<br /><br />Ben Affleck has hardly any on-camera lines in the film. Yet you always seem to know where he is in his life. He seems like a man who doesn't fit in on his home turf. Is much more comfortable being somewhere else, in this case Paris, where he can be who he really feels like he is inside or can be free to be somebody else. When he returns with his French love to Oklahoma, she no longer fits in. And he doesn't really seem to want to be there either.<br /><br />He begins seeing Rachel McAdams, an Oklahoma girl who works horses on a family ranch. There is happiness there. But Affleck is a wrestless spirit.<br /><br />Perhaps his character is a romantic adventurer -- someone for whom every new love is like an around-the-world cruise filled with discovery, passion, zest for life. But, ultimately, you have to return home and there is always an eventual letdown that the trip is over -- back to the real world and who you really are.<br /><br />I felt that I could relate to all the characters on each of their levels. That's the genius of Terrence Malick's films: By not clearly defining the characters (I don't even think they address each other by name) they are open-ended enough to be malleable and easy to impose our own thoughts, feelings, recolections.<br /><br />Mixed into this is Javier Bardem as Catholic priest who is new to a parish and trying to reach out and fit in. But he is conflicted about being a stranger in a strange land. His internal voice speaks in Spanish to God, searching for answers. He believes in God, but he seems to be asking God to tell him that He believes in the priest.<br /><br />There's a poignant scene where the priest conducts a wedding ceremony, then afterwards the family and guests are rejoicing and shaking hands and talking with one another -- everyone is paired up -- and Javier Bardem is walking through them alone. He's seeking God's love and wisdom, but you sense he fears that he is walking in a Godless emptiness.<br /><br />This is Malick's first film set in the contemporary world, rather than the 17th century, the turn of the 20th century, the 1940s or 1950s.<br /><br />I have no idea how this film started out on the written page. I could not imagine it as a screenplay. I could see it more as being drawn from the pages of a treatment. Or a novel. Or a poem. Because this is a visual poem.<br />Roger Ebert's final review was for To The Wonder. If this was the last movie he saw, I think he passed away happy. And, with the underlying sense of nature and spirituality in the film, with a sense of contented grace.<br /><br />After watching a Terrence Malick film, it stays in your system. You feel content not to speak. Your mind is swirling with thoughts. You see the world from the perspective of a Steadicam Point-Of-View shot. And your ears are filled with the sound of string instruments and ethereal classical music.<br /><br />This all sounds quite heavy and gloomy. And . . . well . . . yes . . . heavy, it kind of is. But, ultimately, in my view, To The Wonder is a sermon. A journey of various characters who are seeking love, and forgiveness, in their own way. A man seeking the love of a woman . . . even though he may not know which woman that is. Of a woman for a man, with all his faults. That none of us are perfect. That we are all flawed creatures and we must strive to build the best life that we can with what is available to us. Of the love of a man for a God that he is not certain is listening. Yet, even though he is reaching out in the darkness, he still does not give up hope that there is a God -- of some sort -- out there. And that we are all a part of something greater than ourselves. A universal goodness. That we are all connected. Albeit tenuously at times. I came away from To The Wonder with a sense that, if there is in deed a Heaven, then perhaps, for better or worse, it is here on this Earth and within our fingertips, if we will only accept it.<br /><br />(Please NOTE: I am not addressing or espousing any specific religious belief, but a great, broad, all-encompassing and extremely esoteric and non-denominational spirituality.)<br />And whatever you may take away from To The Wonder, if you can ever come across 112-minutes of cinema that generates this type of intellectual stimulation, combined with incomparable beauty in every single shot -- and without digital compositing -- isn't that worth $7.99 in itself?<br /><br />Thank you, Terrence Malick. And thank you, To The Wonder.
0385349947|3.0|My book came with a cut and tattered page edge and the binding appears to have been haphazardly thrown together.  Pages don't entirely line up but at least it's all &#34;there.&#34;  Maybe that's why its so cheap of a price...

B005DD7H50|5.0|There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Cooper and DiNero are both superb, and Cornish is great, too. Loved the plot, loved the story, loved the action, loved the acting. And I am generally a pretty picky movie watcher!
B00003CXB4|5.0|My grandchildren wanted The Lion King, so I was pleased to locate one.  It was a gift and they loved it.  No substitutes...that is great!
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I gave this movie four stars.  Good acting and a really good solid story line, not to mention it was an extremely spooky movie.  Very unnerving.  The only thing that I did not like was the CG depiction of mama.  If it wasn't for that, I would have rated it five stars.  This is the first \\"ghost\\" story that I have seen in a very long time that actually put me on the edge of my chair.  I would not recommend this for a child under 12 or an ultra sensitive person.  This movie was spooky from beginning to end. It put the super back in \\"supernatural\\". The kids were amazing actresses!  As I previously said, if it wasn't for the CG I would have rated it a five.  But, the CG scenes were very few, most of the imagery was done through a little trick photography and atmosphere.  It is really an excellent movie.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|When the Dark Knight series came out I was a bit tired of the comic book to movies thing.  These movies changed my whole opinion on the Batman movies.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movies.  This last one was great!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Popular theme - highly trained ex-military vs evil corrupt goverment agents.<br /><br />Frustrating early on because anyone who was as cynical as this hero would have seen the double-cross coming a mile away.  As the story unfolds, the audience is thinking  &#34;I can't believe he is falling for this&#34;.  After that part, however, it gets pretty riveting.  I enjoyed it.  Not a complete shoot-em-up action movie, but not a chick flick.

1616550414|4.0|If you're a avid Legend of Zelda fan or a videogamer in general, this is a great read. It discusses Nintendo's controversial timeline, some artwork from many of the Zelda games spanning 25 years! Although, majority of the content is more on the Wii's Skyward Sword, followed by the recent Zelda games. I'm a little disappointed that they don't have more sketches and content of the older games but then again, it doesn't surprise me. It'll be harder to find documents back then. There's also a short manga with a few color pages and it goes to the standard black & white.

B007SO31BQ|4.0|Well put together.  More than just another car racing movie; it showed Senna's character and the intensity of being a formula 1 driver.

B00BGIBVRG|4.0|I can definitely relate to some parts of this movie. If you're around 40 you must watch. One of Paul Rudd's best.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This games is a buck, but I love the graphics of this game. All of you people saying the game doesn't work, it's maybe your devices fault.
B00005B1W7|5.0|QB VII is a highly acclaimed TV mini-series that first aired in 1974 (it won 6 Emmy Awards).  It is approximately 6 hours long and divided into 4 parts of roughly equal length.  (The book by the same name is authored by Leon Uris).  The two central characters are Dr. Adam Kelno and Jewish Author Abraham Cady.  Cady writes a best-seller on the Holocaust which implicates Dr. Kelno of collaborating with the Nazis performing medical experiments on Jews in a Polish concentration camp.  Dr. Kelno sues for defamation and the court trial that results gives the book it's unusual name:  QB VII refers to the courtroom where the trial is held, Queen's Bench, Room 7.<br /><br />The movie is very true to the book, in fact, having read this book, I felt like I was visually \\"reading\\" the book while watching the movie.  While the book is more detailed, the movie is surprisingly good and captures the original intent and drama of the book.<br /><br />The all-star cast is superb, but Anthony Hopkins' performance as Dr. Kelno, is truly extraordinary.<br /><br />Suitable for adults and older teens.<br /><br />kone
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I recently purchased 2 books that got me thinking about making an ebook.  [[ASIN:B007XVWEIU Make A Killing On Kindle (Without Blogging, Facebook Or Twitter). The Guerilla Marketer's Guide To Selling Ebooks On Amazon]] and [[ASIN:B00BTF976I \\"Make Money Online\\"   Make A Killing Online (without social media) Guru Secrets Revealed: Getting Rich With Ebooks (even if you're not a writer)]] I enjoyed them both, but both of them didn't make it very clear on actually formatting your book to look nice on the kindle.  I tried uploading a short story of mine and when I previewed it, it looked really bad.  I started searching the internet for ways to make it look better because I mean it looked really bad.  Chapters would start randomly, the title was all scrambled, it was bad.  I found this book though, and it was exactly what I needed.  It was very informative, to the point, and easy to follow.  It fixed my problem.  If you haven't put up an ebook yet, or if you have but they don't look right, then you need this book.  Thanks for the help!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good story, characters you hate and love. Can't wait to see how it all ends, hoping for happy ending, not anyone close dying.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Returned item as I already had the dvd which my grandchildren and I enjoyed very much.  Ease of return was very much appreciated
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent series - do not want to see it cancelled.  Margulies (sp.?) is outstanding and supporting cast, as well.  Good storylines.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|animation was good. Enjoyed the OREOs sequence. Overall good story. Even though my kids don't play video games much, they enjoyed the story line.
B00947N6D8|5.0|this movie is awesome ,it was done the way I like. story was sad a little bit but it turn out great in the end.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|Well made, clearly, but what's with the low volume? You can barely hear Richard Attenborough, and the volume has to be turned up so high that the background music sounds deafening. Blu-ray video is very good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!!! play it all the time! just need some friends so add me plz! Great game for anyone who needs something to do
B0071XO8RA|3.0|As  a SF buff who has read most of the good authors, starting with the old masters Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, I snapped up the Wool Omnibus when I heard the buzz surrounding it.<br /><br />The first book/novella was very good. The second, almost as good.<br /><br />The last three were, to be completely honest, s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d to a point that almost had me giving up on the book. The surprises and twists had largely disappeared, and reading these novellas became almost as tiresome as it must have been writing them.<br /><br />The author had clearly run out of ideas - but was being pressured into producing more, and quickly, which was a pity. There were so many interesting angles. I did not expect it to deteriorate so quickly, become so flat and belabored.<br /><br />What I liked: there was a newness to the initial theme; the editing was surprisingly good for an indy writer; and the man has more than a fundamental grasp of mechanical engineering. This is not \\"hard SF\\" as some have stated; it's simply a solid understanding of how things work in our world today. Which was not surprising in context, because evolution in technology had come almost to a standstill in the confines of the silo with all the rules and constraints.<br /><br />If Howey is reading this, as he is rumored to often do, my message is: stop trying to churn out lots of meaningless material, and focus on content. There is such a thing as killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was an easy read that kept me interested even tho the plot wasn't too deep. Like Sparks books, he keeps things going.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I love the detail in areas of life unfamiliar to me, such as mining and forensic anthropology. Her characters have substance, are realistic and believable. This story had lots of unexpected twists and turns, made for a very enjoyable read.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Much larger than my previous bag. This holds all my current equipment and if I keep my head I shouldn't buy anymore considering I'm a beginner.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was hooked after watching just one episode that I happened to run across near the end of season two.  I went back to the start of the show and am still catching up!
B007SGM084|1.0|The worse book  ever and very Degrading for Women . My Mother , my Wife and Sister  all women. they were not<br />SUBMISSIVE.
B004GYY714|5.0|This App always seems to work with very little if any buffering.  The selection is huge.  I listen every day at my desk at work.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Thought it would end different. Turning the plane upside down was wild. It does show a lot of what is wrong with pilots. Most pilots are proffesional as well as the staff.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|I read three of these Harry Hole novels in a row (The Redbreast, Nemesis, and Devil's Star) to complete the &#34;Prince&#34; storyline that begins in Redbreast. As a wordsmith, Nesbo is certainly competent and often very effective. As a plotter, he's well above average with rich complications. His ability to evoke a very depressing Scandinavian atmosphere is affecting. But I find the protagonist in this series such an unlikeable and cringe-inducing human being that those three will be my lifetime limit.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very different viewpoint of death and the aftermath.  The story of his coma and the faith he found on his recovery was full of inspiration.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait to read the third book. This book is interesting and intense. I like the story it doesn't repeat like other books. I do recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel because of the fast-moving plot with all of its twists and turns.  I passed it on to my daughter, who also enjoyed it very much. It's not a literary masterpiece, but it is, as my friends and I like to say, a &#34;great ride.&#34;
B0072OFOM6|1.0|I have Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand, which I thought were excellent shows, but I wish I had read the reviews on this site before I plunked down nearly $40 for the blu-ray version of Vengeance.  A total waste of money.<br /><br />I have not really noticed the replacement actors, as there was so little for them to do this time around that they didn't have to do any actual acting.  The big problem for me was TOO MUCH blood and gore, TOO MUCH gratuitous sex, and TOO LITTLE plot.  The slo motion and CGI effects made it seem like a comic strip.  The show also has a much cheaper look this time.  Corners are being cut by the look of it.<br /><br />If the producers want to milk this cow further they need to get back to a story and cut back on the blood lust - it just gets tiresome after a while.  When I get up to make a cup of tea and don't bother to put the episode on pause, I know they are in trouble.
B005DJREJS|4.0|It was entertaining to see this; just when you think it's going to work for her, it changes.  Keeps you laughing.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|They changed the ending, probably after the director talked to his &#34;friend&#34; Tom Cruise. Litigation was prevented but the movie flops like a drowning fish at the end.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book keeps you on your toes the entire time. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Dont bother watching this crappy movie.  It might even win the WORSE MOVIE OF THE YEAR award!  You will be thouroughly disappointed and feel cheated if you paid for it.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The casting for this show is perfect. This is especially true of the actor who plays the &#34;mad&#34; scientist and Peter, his son.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is fast paced and tough to put down. Like most books, better than the movie version. I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I found this season to be very good, but when I think about Season 1 and 2, I would have to say that it wasn't as fast moving or intense. I love this series nonetheless. Can't wait for season 4
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app simply rates as the best note taking app, IMO. Ever since I first stumbled upon evernote about three years ago, it has been my number one go to note taking app ever since. I use it for everything from research for my novel, to vacation plans, and even to-do lists. It's just an amazing app that has many uses besides just the typical list maker. I am an evernote fan for life!
B006JPS1OM|3.0|It's addictive. But not what I thought it would be. I'd hoped for more than just figures and text. I wanted a more interactive game like enigmatics. Still not bad for what it's worth
B002JXICCY|5.0|Led Zep at the height of their prowess as both musicians and as &#34;rock stars&#34;. This film is a real cinematic beauty and captures the weirdness of the 70s with little fantasy vignettes from the different members of the band as well as the FANTASTIC performance from Madison Square Garden- which is the MAIN focus of the film.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved this book and I loved the movie, but they are not the same story. You can enjoy both without comparing the two
B004LWZWBU|5.0|An interesting peek at the unusual life of the birding community. If you are a birder, you will love this movie.
B00CAKCS9O|5.0|I know this movie is a fantasy...and I am a staunch realist...but it touched me and i believe it will touch you.It speaks of faith in love and fate...and sometimes maybe we need more of that than just the realities of life.Obviously one of my all time favorites in stories and actors.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show on t.v. in a very long time. Not just about zombies. Do yourself a favor if you haven't seen it. Jump onto Netflix and watch the first two seasons. If you enjoy a good drama you will be hooked.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Absolutely love this movie, I can't get enough it. Especially now that I have it on blu-ray. Delivery was on time and the item was in perfect condition.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I have watched this series in it's entirety from season 1 up until the second episode in the 5th series.  Each episode just makes me want to watch the next one, Charlie Hunnan is a hottie, plus talented.  Ron Pearlman surprised me, such an AWESOME under rated actor.  The lovely Katey Sagal is beautiful and phenomenal in this series, have been a big fan of hers for years, love her versatility, SINGING AND ACTING.  Love this show, too bad it's ending, needs to go further,,,,,,,,,WAY FURTHER
1892005034|5.0|I like this book because it will help me to improve my communication skills in a positive way and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to do the same.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Great match 3 game wonderful graphics you can't put it down. As with all games the more you play the harder the levels get but not to hard that you get frustrated and give up. Looking forward to many more games like this and many more hours of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I personally think that subway surfers is a great game because it is easy to play but it can also be challenging. It is very addictive and I would recommend it. I wasn't sure at first but i got into the game soon after I started playing it. It is a very good game that everyone will enjoy. :)
1410427927|5.0|I was glued to this book so good and it's a true story with fact to back her finding.<br />I have recommended this book to many friends to read.  It's that good.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good app for a freebie. lots of levels. good for an adult or young kid. my 9 year old likes it a lot.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A very good movie talking about what happened before lord of the ring. I really like the scene where they took the video, it's so beautiful and full of nature. I just wonder how they build up the goblin \\"castle\\". Recommended to watch. Oh, the precious guy haha, as usual, he is so creepy.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I liked this book but I enjoyed Dark Places more. I like Gillian Flynn's style of writing, and look forward to her next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now all it needs is a new update best app ever invented pc is better but this is like and on the go version
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I stumbled upon Lindsey while listening to similar music on Pandora and I'm glad I did.  Been listening to her ever since and I'm looking forward to new albums.
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter loves it just wish the stairs would stay in place and tbe directions be more clear, overall I'm glad I got it because the expression on my daughters face when she opened this gift was priceless :)
B003SI3URQ|4.0|Streaming poor, need to start over a lot.  Picture and audio good when it was playing.  But had to start over or resume more than 9 times.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|What a long and boring movie!  It was a struggle to stay awake for the whole thing.  And when did actors/directors begin to think that having dialog so low you can't hear it was a good thing?<br /><br />Also, what's with the billowing smoke in EVERY scene?  I can understand in the scenes when people are smoking and/or there is a campfire, etc.  But in EVERY SINGLE SCENE there are clouds of smoke flowing across the screen.  1860's smog?<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is the frightening look at an out of control president  who thinks he is above the Constitution!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Walter (the father) is the best in the show. I am a chemist and I can really appreciate his character.<br />This show mixes fiction with possible technology in the near future and the possibilities of what we might be able to do.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Very good movie - pretty faithful to the book with a few exceptions - things were added that I don't recall from the book (heard they were adding things from the Similarion - looks like they did) but seemed to fill in some of the history.<br /><br />I'm not sure three movies are needed to tell the story - two would have been plenty (but three movies = more money, so...)
B009KEN87O|5.0|Second time for me to review a FAOTD.<br />I would even have paid for it which some friends and family did after playing on my S3
B00BF123WG|4.0|A very compelling film about our very recent political history. I did need to walk out of the room during the initial torture scenes. Jessica Chastain does an excellent job. We streamed this so we some of the scenes in the dark were quite pixelated. A very good film.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|They just don't make movies like they use to...... Oh, wait a minute.  They do!  Its clear message and good story line kept my interest.  My family loved it.  So few family movies are made these days with a real message.  Would like to see more movies from this company.  Thanks.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I expected this to be full of over the top gross humor, but I found it incredibly entertaining. We enjoyed this more than expected.
0307716554|4.0|Author Rosamund Lupton certainly has an original premise for her thriller \\"Afterwards.\\"  The entire novel is related in first person by Grace, a wife and mother who is in a coma.  Badly injured in a fire, both Grace and her teen daughter Jenny are amazed to find themselves in the hospital, yet outside their bodies.  They can communicate with each other, but no one else.  Oddly enough, it's easy for both Grace and Jenny, and more importantly the reader, to easily accept this.<br /><br />When Grace's young son is accused of starting the fire, it quickly becomes apparent that there is much more behind the story of the fire than anyone knows.  So our thriller/mystery/whodunit unfolds as Grace's husband, other family members, and the police begin to sift through it all.  Our 'otherwordly' protagonists, Grace and Jenny, of course become privy to quite a bit of information (being invisible does have it's advantages, you know) but are unable to share.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it quickly becomes obvious that whoever started that fire wants to finish what they started.<br /><br />Whew...did you get all that?  In a nutshell, the novel is a typical thriller simply told from a unique POV.  That part I liked.  The actual \\"whodunit\\" part?  Bah....nothing special there except for, in my opinion, far too many twists and turns at the end deliberately set to throw the reader off, which felt contrived.  Mr. X did it.  Story concluding.  Ah HA, no Mrs. Y did it.  Gotcha.  Story concluding.  NO, Mr. Z did it, in the library, with a candlestick.  Return to heart breaking denouement.<br /><br />If that makes it sound like I didn't enjoy reading the novel, that would be the wrong impression.  I did.  Read the whole darned thing in two days.  Just felt a little cheated at the end (or maybe manipulated).  It's worth the read, though, and I would recommend it!
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|A great series with beautiful sets and costumes. Lots of twists and turns in the plots of each episode. Well written and well acted. I can't wait for season 3.
0525952926|3.0|Winter of the World was great, and I hardly put it down until it was done. It did however have a few flaws. It felt rushed, some of the character's stories didn't feel very conclusive at the end, and I would have liked to hear more about the character's in the previous book (if only briefly). I also didn't like many of the main character's so much - Woody and Clara being my favourite, I felt everyone else was mediocre, whereas in the first book there was much more to like. It sometimes felt like detail was skipped over, particularly towards the end, where a few years would pass before you heard about a character again, with little to no explanation of how the time was passed.<br />Follett's research was impeccable as always, and I feel the concept behind the book was very good, though poorly executed.<br />I am looking forward to the final instalment of the trilogy, which Follett stated on facebook would not be rushed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loved by the great grandson.  It keeps him occupied.  He loves the fact that he can play his games on Grandma's Kindle.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|good game this game really is worth it if there was a full version I would buy it.  I play this all the time now
B005HSL626|5.0|It was ordered for my great grandson who is 7 and he loves it.  He would play until the batteries run down on the Kindle if I let him.
B007R0WHMK|1.0|Too gory for me. I only watched it for a little bit.I didn't like it at all.Just too weird for me.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love love love it , it's the best book I have read since fifty shades of grey . I think this book is better than all the others .
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Its interesting to me to see what kind of signal I'm getting, aside from that its just a signal monitor, works well, not much more to it than that.

B003B02OOG|3.0|I enjoyed this book but found it very different from his other books. It was just ok but I prefer his mysteries much better. As always he tells a good story.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hare it because I deleted it and I might have to start over that is why I hats it before I deleted it I loved it but now I gotta hats it
B0093QDGEO|2.0|Story line and acting were not entertaining. I feel as though Hollywood is making more of these movies, that should just go straight to the trash.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Some may view this as a running commercial for the military - but realisim is about things people do not see very day. If you are looking for a larger world view - consider the implications hinted at...
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great ending! The fact the \\"doubters\\" saw the real guy made the heartbroken so much more worth it! A kind of slap in the face.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Life of Pi was really good ! We own tour buses and our travelers loved it too. The movie was delivered quickly!<br />  I like also &#34;Who Do you Call?&#34; the paperback.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is awesome I think everyone should have it its so addictive and the scenery WOW! !!!Imangi studios is soooo creative .get this app now!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|A gift for Bek which she loves as a writer if oddities herself. My book &#34;Who do you call?&#34; is in paperback
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am a horse lover to the bone. This game is a lot of fun. The things people can do with the graphics is amazing.
B004VYYA2K|3.0|its OK its not very stable it keeps on unzipping and its pretty annoying, so i got rid of it
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love the whole album. I could listen to it over and over. And it comes with the Auto Rip, so I could download it immediately. Awesome.
B004OC07N0|3.0|Great principles, geared towards significant, high-level role change. It has helped me think through a possible future transition, even though it would be much smaller than examples in the book.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Gotta love this man. Great album. Cant wait until he comes to Nashville in September. Surprisingly this came with the Auto Rip download. It was not mentioned before I purchased.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome great super awesome fantastic gnarly fricken fantastic super suspenseful freaky. Keeps me on the edge of my seat. Would definitely recommend!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its very handy and I would recommend it for every kindle User a must have and its free and never glitches
B0013TTLDE|4.0|With the current fascination about the Brits in the early 20th century, this book follows closely what we see in the popular PBS series Downton Abby.  I seem to merge the two sets of characters as I read.  The book gave us a bit of a behind the scene look at the staff's life and attitude.  Grace's loyalty to Hannah even after discovering her own identity spoke to the love she held for her.  The book also gives us glimpses of WWI and the Roaring 20's.  it was a time of much change.  The ending was predictable to a point, but learning the truth was a little surprising.  I recommend the reading of this book for those interested in this time period in the UK.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|In this you play aginst your friends or random people you start off with a few Colors and everytime you get something right or they get it right you gain coins witch you can buy sets if Colors with or you can use real money. NEEDS WI-FI TO PLAY!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I recommend this book to any person who would like to think that there is a possibility that our everyday life may not be all it seems. That there may be something more to Einstein's theory of relativity. That past, present and future exist at the same time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Needs more characters also its fun to play Also you don't need internet never glitches and worth the money its great
B00BVVA138|5.0|This album is one of their best for sure. It does sound an awful like Times of Grace but thats a great thing. Superior songwriting from the heart! Insanely good!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Videos never buffer after downloading and you can watch videos anywhere. Amazing for youtube lover's &#60;3 Must get it have fun
B00633W614|5.0|One of those &#34;can't put it down&#34; books - easy read.  I'm anxiously waiting the third book to come out.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I fully don't know how to use it that's why I'm giving it four stars instead of five but really if your looking for an app that is filled with amazing creations ie. If your crafty. Get them.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Fun game I really enjoyed it. but when you pass a certain level you can't play anymore unless login to Facebook. I don't like having to sign into Facebook, I just want to play the games.
B00632HWOG|5.0|For me its works without Internet connection its amazing and easy to use. If you want it get it I don't know how others have problems with it its easy for me to use I have a Kindle Fire.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved pillars of the earth and its sequel, world without end.  I read world so quickly as I couldn't put it down.  The twists were mind boggling.  I hope to find two other books that will hold my interest so intensely.  I am going to try fall of the giants next although I like the period of pillars and world much better.<br />The characters came so alive for me and I liked learning about the times and about architecture, just everything about the time period.<br />Definitely on my best  favorite list.<br /><br />Doris
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great way to pass time while your waiting or bored. Its not one of those no knockoff apps that sucks this is amazing!
0062082353|4.0|Truly a wonderful book. The background story was long and the addition of other's comments was different for an auto-biography, but truly a book to be read by those interested in the military, international affairs, history, and others.<br />Mr Kyle's straight forward approach was fresh and entertaining. With an abundance of facts and details the book never bogged down and kept me turning pages.  This is not an easy story to read and the horrors of war are not hidden.  I am so glad I read this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just when you think it's over, it's not. Great novel. For anyone who enjoys Courtroom suspense (like I do) you will love this book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son loves this game it's easy to play.He likes to feed the dinosaurs,and makes new buildings.i give it  five stars.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It keeps me interested and not bored. I enjoy the fact that it notices you. I wish the graphics were better but over all I recommend this game and he'll it free. You cabinets that.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I am surprised that amazon has not tweaked this app yet.  I have their MYHABIT app, which I LOVE!  amazon mobile isn't as slick, it could be better.
1476733953|4.0|The strength of this book is the great allusive premise and storytelling that continually draws back to reveal more and more surprising facts about this fictional world. The work is quite cinematic and has great potential as a mass-market film. It is a ripping yarn and big fun.<br /><br />Mr. Howey's writing and characters are simple, declarative and serviceable, like Steven King's. Like King's work, it has mass appeal, even though it is not great literature. (In fact, some attempts to be \\"literary\\" early on, and also a Shakespeare riff in book 4, were, to me, transparent and a bit clumsy.)<br /><br />I guess book 1 was a short story which explains why it is so economical and effective at sucking the reader in and setting the premise. Book 2 is something of a weak connector and transition to a longer-form work. Books 3-5 are really where things settle, the story picks up, and the writing becomes less self-conscious. (I disagree with those who say 3-5 are a slog, and I didn't find Mr. Howey's descriptions to be overly verbose--perhaps, instead, some reader's attention span's are overly short!)<br /><br />I am amused by the hard-science, Asperger geeks whining about technological implausibilities, you kids should just let that go and enjoy the ride. This ain't Gibson. That said, discussion of pixels, color depth, \\"toning out\\" ethernet, and other IT topics was specific and accurate and appreciated by this long-time programmer.<br /><br />So, 4 stars for breezy, crowd-pleasing, straight-ahead fun. Glad I am late to the party and can pick up the \\"Shift\\" series next. For the price, the whole thing is a tremendous value.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|this was a very fun read!  I loved every page.  made me laugh out loud in may places. maybe I will read it again.
B009H2PCNC|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that Lux is a masterpiece reminiscent of Neroli and Thursday Afternoon.  It is deeply placid in a way that reminds me of spring mornings and dappled sunshine, or of watching a quiet sea.  It has a kaleidoscopic effect, since there are no obvious repetitions.  There's no need here for melody.  The notes or tones each have their own interest, like points of light, that make this music pleasurable to listen to at each moment, with no need for lots of regular, machine-like patterns.  The satisfaction of predictability, completion or catharsis isn't needed here either.  Each moment is sufficient onto itself.  In my youth this music would have made me impatient and fidgety.  There are no jagged edges of sound or rhythm to catch the listener's attention.  There's no goal or resolution.  It doesn't push any buttons to make you feel angry or empowered.  There's nothing to prove.  There's no posturing or desire to impress.  Tranquillity like this is valuable and refreshing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As with all of the Pendergast novels, this one quickly took twists and trns that made putting it down impossible.  The mere thought that this would be the last os Pendergast was gutt wrenching.  As usual, the story was well crafted and riveting.  BRAVO!

B0059XTTW8|5.0|I really enjoyed the novel and the Alec Guiness version of this movie. I completely understand why people wouldn't enjoy this movie though. Slow paced, methodical, and the plot can be confusing if you aren't really familiar with the novel.<br /><br />The real reason to buy it is the bonus material. One of the deleted scenes contains at least 2 minutes of Gary Oldman cooking and eating a fried egg to punk rock music in the background.  Wow, why was that cut? Great method acting by Oldman. It was clearly a pivotal cooking the egg scene. This wasn't in the book, and it was something the filmmakers thought up on their own. Perhaps there is a spoiler in the scene - the egg as metaphor. I don't know.

1476734941|3.0|\\"The Fast Diet\\" is one of the simplest diet schemes I have come across in awhile and in principle it sounds reasonable and effective - after all, as the book likes to point out - there is no harm with the occasional fast and the health benefits have been proven.  Be warned though that regardless of page count this is a rather skimpy book.  It's almost as if the authors had trouble upping the page count to regulation so the last quarter of the book is padded with things like Twitter testimonials and blank pages for a 'diet diary.'  Nevertheless the first third of the book (that can be read in a hour) makes for an interesting and sorta convincing justification for the merits of this plan.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is not only exciting and contains unique filming but will keep you constantly on the edge of your seat. And then you will spend the next few weeks thinking about it!

1455869910|5.0|I listened to this on CD while driving. The audio was great. This story is about Hazel and Augustus Waters, two cancer patients that meet at support group in the `literal heart of Jesus' in the basement of a church. They fall in love, even though Hazel tries not to. She doesn't want to wound anybody else by dying, which she knows she will (as she can hardly breathe on her own because of her cancer). Gus is witty, charming, irreverent, and so smart. This poignant tale show the beauty of loving someone for who they are, not for how perfect they look or how long they'll live. The emotion was amazing, and the tragic tale of first love was heroic and touching. Great book.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Had planned to watch this with my 6 yr old grandson, but our plans changed. I enjoyed this movie just as much by myself! It has clever adult humor running through out  the movie as well as a children's plot that wasn't boring.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|I grew up watching this film when it came on TV and enjoying it. So recently I decided to purchase the film and re-watch the film and after all these years, I still like it. However I do have to say that the original had a better Willy Wonka, Charlie Bucket, and story, the remake did entertained us with those aspects. One aspect that I feel the remake did do better than the original is the Oompa Loompa songs. Because where the orignal all the Oompa Loompa songs are all the same recycled songs, with a few words changed, the remake offers different and unique styles in each song, each from a different decade of music from a 50's mambo, 60's disco, 70's hippie song, & a 80's rock homage.

B0097EWK3A|3.0|I like the game a lot. Just wish you didn't have to pay after you get so far. It only took me 30 minutes to play the trial for free. When I got it for free, I thought it was the full game.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is such a great story! I've never been so mad at a character in a book but Abby is infuriating but I still love her and Travis! And I still love the story! Only downside is quite a few typos in the kindle version. I can live with that because its just so great!
B000FA675C|3.0|I've seen the movie The Da Vinci Code and had very high expectations after reading Angels and Demons first, but this was not what I'd hoped it would be.  Excitement, intrigue, suspense and quite a ride to a better ending than the movie. I wasn't surprised that the book was presenting a different view point to Christianity, I was stunned at the complete dismissal of my faith. I will think long and hard before reading another Dan Brown book.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This was a book club reading; a good choice. At first it was hard to get into but after the preface it captured me and I couldn't wait to read on.

Started off with a gunshot wound, awoke in a different reality, acceped responsibility for a group of strangers and found out his wife didn't actually morn a long time when she was told her husband was dead.

He is the kind of chracter you wish you could find in everyone.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Hungry Shark Revolution looks to be a vicious, stupid game, but you can't know that until you try it. This game happens to be my favorite game. The way you eat fish/people is plain fun. Even though this game makes me feel scared of sharks I think it deserves 5 stars for sure.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I have loved II Divo since I first heard them.  Cant put out enough CDs for me.  In this one they put a lot of great songs on it.  Still a lot of there great songs to go on another one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a big jump from the original one. Temple Run 2 has better graphics, better detail, and is more fun to play then The original Temple Run. I enjoy this game a lot because I am always in for a surprise in the game and I can unlock more help full ways to make the game easier. As a simple way to say it, Temple Run 2 is incredible.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I have noticed some reviews that touch upon the ending of the movie with anger and frustration.  Most ignore the ending all together, as though this were purely a nature or adventure film.  Can one ignore the last half hour of a movie such as The Sixth Sense?  Or, The Usual Suspects, which has a similar ending?<br /><br />Clearly this is a movie (and novel) about believing, or not believing in God.  The young Pi had a horrible, traumatic experience that he could not (or did not WANT to) remember.  He had to assist in the operation of a sailor with an infected leg, saw the dead sailor being used as bait for food, saw his mother die, saw his mother eaten by sharks, and, then, had to kill a man (the cook) himself.  Who would not want to create an alternative story--one in which God intervenes to make things more bearable?<br />And, yet, at the end Pi asked people to choose which story they prefered.  This is tantamount to asking someone if they want to believe in reality, which can be cruel, or believe in God, which can be comforting.  That is what this entire movie is about!  Does that make it less appealing than a good adventure story?  Obviously, the answer must be \\"YES\\" for most people, based on the reviews I have read.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Games like these really make your mind twist and turn as you try as hard as you can to finish the puzzle. Flow really demonstrates that as you think and think. I fell this game deserves a  high rate, but it can get boring. My rate is a 4.
B00BF123WG|5.0|This movie was great.  It gives insight into counter-intelligence and was definitely interesting to see a different perspective on this manhunt.  Really well done.  Wish it was longer.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|There are some books where you enjoy the extended detail and the drawn-out pace. This was such a book for me and the movie was just too clean and tidy a version (out of necessity). A screenplay is a version of a book and in isolation it's a good movie but I hurt for the details I had enjoyed in the book while watching. I recommend the movie if you're not going to read the book ... but I recommend the book more.
B000004286|5.0|I like Celtic music and this CD has 18 tracks well performed. I have some other soundtracks from motion pictures but this is one of the best. I recommend if anybody likes this kind of music to buy this CD.
B005LAIGNC|2.0|The story of the Tuskegee airmen is a wonderful story full of genuine drama - heroism, overcoming of racism, America growing up in its attitudes, formation of what was essentially a highly trained and decorated unit despite every obstacle they faced.  In this version though, the storytelling is alas so clunky, that no end of beautifully photographed postcard Italy and shoehorned romantic subplot or inserted action scenes can rescue it.  There is a good looking cast and some genuine production values, but saddled with a script which from the opening scene seems amateurish and contrived, sapping the movie of the genuine awe and respect of the airmens achievements that they deserve.  Cuba Gooding Junior needs to find something gritty to rebuild his career, and Terence Howard survives the movie with some dignity and gravitas, but the lines and situations they are given to handle  are flat and artificial.  The movie charts the pilots in the squadron, trying to show their different ways of handling the stress, while building up from their initial delegating of trivial flying tasks to their escorting of bombers to Berlin, against a squadron (!) of German jet fighters.  There is less a plot, more a series of subplots charting the evolution of the squadron - and some of those subplots just go nowhere.  When one of the pilots was captured and we see him arrive at a PoW camp, I thought this was finally going to show what it meant to be of African American descent under German control, but no - the moment is squandered.  If the script is handled in screenwriting 101 style, it isn't helped by the lack of weight in the effects - you'd have to say on the face of it, that the planes actually look very well rendered.. it's hard to imagine improvements in what cgi could do - and yet... they just don't look real, and the physics of how they are thrown around the sky doesn't look real either.  How much more satisfying and thrilling it would have been to have real aircraft in dogfights- but I guess these days that may just not be possible any more.<br />At the end of the day, the Lucas brand, even only as producer, has not been advanced from his Star Wars days with this effort, and the movie plays out as if an adaptation of a comic strip - when what the story needs is something gritty and real to truly express the horror, the bravery and the historical importance of what the Tuskegee airmen did.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|This is a great product, it's almost like the Sonic Amplifier, just slightly better.  It's more powerful and when focus the mic in the general direction you want to listen you normal hear what you trying to hear for the most part.  However like the Sonic it does pick up unwanted sound that do not want to hear.

B0094M2SCI|5.0|Okay, so we all know by now that vampires are good looking, have nicer houses than werewolves and somehow manage to have those fangs sprouting out of their gums without ever biting their tongues. This movie manages to follow most of the cliches of the vampire lore, pitting them against werewolves who of course live in the dumps and are slightly less attractive.  Having said that it was great fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale makes every scene she is in deep, dark and wonderful.  Even when she is posing gun forward, dodging bullets that seem to kill everyone to the left and right of her she is fabulous. She manages to pull off the perfect combination of badass and vulnerable that every great tough chick heroine needs. The look and feel of the movie is comic bookish and alluring, and holds up even though this movie is a few years old.  This movie pulls off campy and cool at the same time.  There is cheesy good and cheesy bad and this move is cheesy great!

B00280LYIC|5.0|This story is an excellent Narnia/Potter level story. Percy finds himself a demigod pestered on all sides by monsters, on a quest to quell a war between gods. Half the time he can't decide if what he's seeing is real or not; the other half he's doing everything he can to survive. Having read the entire series (including the Lost Hero and Red Pyramid sagas), I see Riordan placed the seeds of all those books into The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />Excellent idea. The whole Greek cosmology is an excellent Petrie dish for imaginative application to our culture today. Hardly any of the hyped-up books we get pushed on us are worth the time to read, but Riordan's works are worthy to read multiple times.<br /><br />Go Perseus Jackson!

0143123173|5.0|I wrote the below for audio version, but reading the kindle version even after the audio kept me turning pages.<br /><br />How many ways can I say it - this is one outstanding story!<br /><br />The Cold Dish: A Walt Longmire Mystery<br />UNABRIDGED<br />by Craig Johnson<br />Narrated by George Guidall<br />View Series<br />Reviewed: 4/11/13<br /><br />Where does The Cold Dish rank among all the audiobooks you've listened to so far?<br />The Cold Dish is at the top. I listened to George Guidall narrate the book and then decided to buy the book to see if appraisal of the book is in any way affected because of Guidall's outstanding narration.<br /><br />Craig Johnson reads just as well as George Guidall narrates, and vice versa.<br /><br />Only several titles later did I realize why Guidall had a familiar voice - I have a number of his titles, including Basque History of the World.<br /><br />As well as Guidall narrated the other 450-plus titles as he has done, there is no character, no subject, for whom he is better suited than Walt Longmire.<br /><br />What did you like best about this story?<br />He had such a realistic feel to the story and each of the characters sounds exactly like somebody I know.<br /><br />I love the Clearmont-Buffalo Wyoming area and, even more so, the Bighorn Mountains and the region from Cody to Thermopolis to Greybull andback through Powell - my favorite area of the planet.<br /><br />Should note that Colonial Radio also has a series, Powder River, set in the area (fictional town whose name is same as the real town but at a time the town didn't exist) and I listen to it on SiriusXM when it runs on Fridays and have bought the first five seasons through audible/amazon.<br /><br />What does George Guidall bring to the story that you wouldn't experience if you just read the book?<br />Guidall sounds like my grandfather when I was too young to be a grandfather - makes me feel like I'm listening to my grandfather tell me of an adventurous period in his life.<br /><br />As I said, Guidall sounds like he IS Walt Longmire.<br /><br />If you were to make a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?<br />Good old boy Wyoming sheriff gets the job done without flamboyance.<br /><br />Any additional comments?<br />I waited to post this until I had read all eight titles offered by Audible. Please, get more soon before I have to be committed - I'm addicted to this series far more than I ever was hooked on the Sacketts by Louis L'Amour.<br /><br />Gotta get another Longmire book.

B008YI99IE|1.0|I watched Jurassic Park II a week ago and thought it was pretty bad.  I was hoping that the 3rd movie in the series would do better but neverthless I set my expectation extremely low.  Despite my low expectation, this movie still shocked me.  It's hard to point to one obvious thing that made this movie unwatchable.  The plot was too simple and none of the characters was remotely likeable.  The big fight between T-Rex and Spinosaurus happened at the beginning which was odd.  It should have been reserved for later.  I want a refund for the money I wasted on this piece of crap.
B000FA675C|5.0|The main reason for the rating I gave was the sheer SCOPE of the book, and the imagination behind it!  The reader is catapulted into BEING at the scene of a brutal crime in the Louvre.  Having seen the movie before reading the book, certain explanations not in the movie were covered more deeply.  In the hope of not revealing spoilers here, all I can say is that missing the book would be a complete dis-service done to one's self.

0756914582|5.0|A talking cat, a musical kid and a band of educated rats roll into a town where something is very wrong in Terry Pratchett's hilarious fantasy set in his Discworld universe.<br /><br />This fractured fairy tale is slyly funny without the overdose of whimsy that Pratchett indulges in with most of the Discworld novels.  The rats and Maurice the cat have genuine character arcs, and the brave death of the alpha rat genuinely moves us.  There's real heart here and something that both kids and their parents can enjoy.<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was a group of rats who lived in a garbage pile outside a school for wizards on Discworld.  They ate the nubbins of candlesticks and the leftover dregs of green glop that the magicians boiled up and as a result, they suddenly acquired the ability to speak.<br /><br />So did Maurice, a cat, who befriended the rats and made it a point never to eat one that could talk.  (He acquired his power of speech from eating one of the \\"changelings\\" but that was before he knew better.)  Maurice has come up with a way for him, the rats and the kid they've adopted (a young musician named Keith) to make money.  The rats aren't entirely clear on why they need to make money, but Maurice is persuasive.<br /><br />It takes a bit for us to settle into the construct that Pratchett has created, but before long, we've fallen right into a world where cats and rats can talk after ingesting magical garbage.  (Maurice didn't eat garbage directly--he has a rule about eating anything that glows--but he did munch on one of the changeling rats and so changed himself by proxy.)  The animals are a little wary of their new status (they are especially freaked out by dreams) and they're still trying to figure out how to negotiate the world as a clan rather than as individual rats.  (When the rats get a whiff of the Rat King and revert to their old ways in panic, it several of the more thoughtful rats.<br /><br />The subtle shifting of power between the rats contending for power is handled with as much shading as any political maneuvering in the real world of men.  The scene where Maurice sacrifices one of his lives so that a little rat can live is genuinely moving.  (It's also funny because it features Death and a small, rat-sized GRIM SQUEAKER as well.)<br /><br />It's helpful, but not essential, for people to know the original Pied Piper story, a dark-tinged tale that really shows the Brothers Grim at their grimmest.  (In keeping with the skewed nature of Discworld, which is much like our own world, only more magical, the main fairy tale spinners in the realm are women.)<br /><br />The Rat King and his manipulation of other animals is genuinely scary (and according to the author, such things genuinely exist).  The scenes where the rats confront the Rat King and his evil make an excellent finale to a story that then moves off in a different direction to cap off a multi-leveled con job.  (Maurice, who engineered the \\"pied piper con\\", decides he really doesn't want to settle down to a soft life of cream and naps and follows a young man on a new adventure.)<br /><br />There's a lot here, from a tale of grand adventure to examples of courage.  (You're never too small to be brave.  You can accomplish a lot with your friends.)  Pratchett has some gentle lessons to impart but he never rams them down our throats.tending for power is handled with as much shading as any political maneuvering in the real world of men.

B0083Z614S|5.0|The Secret Garden is a heart warming story of self discovery and friendship. Of the wonders of nature and the whispering the wind can tell you. It makes you relish the innocence of childhood and the importance of friends. I couldn't put it down and couldn't stop smiling. This book will have  you speaking Yorkshire your self if you're not careful!:p
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|In college we always waited with anticipation for the next ELO. I remember that one of my friends played for us the \\"On the Third Day\\" and we were blown away by the innovations and different styles. At the same time, I always felt that there was always a little \\"tongue in cheek\\" in their musical style. They didn't take themselves too seriously, and were willing to play around with many different styles - but always giving them their own unique flavor.<br /><br />Out of the Blue epitomizes this aspect of ELO. We used to love to all do the panting noise from the beginning of \\"Mr. Blue Sky.\\" I felt that no other group on earth could pull of a track like \\"Wild West Hero\\" and mix it onto such an album. So when I think of ELO I always think of FUN MUSIC.

B008PZZV8S|2.0|As stated above, was a disappointment.  Kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never did pick up.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|The scene set as we are lead into an impressive post-apocalyptic Earth, the textures and colours are vivid and almost photo shopped; the remnants of Man's world are literally fused into the landscape, or disintegrating amphitheatre of an American football stadium, we are shown the pitiful spire of the Empire State Building. This is all the result of a Pyrrhic victory against extra-terrestrial interlopers called `Scavengers', in principle the human race has essentially given up on Earth.<br /><br />On this `barren' world there appears to be a couple who are doing their stint as caretakers to help maintain harvesters that are harvesting the last of Earth's riches water for fuel - and mopping up `Scavengers'. What is left of Humanity lives on a large orbiting satellite while the rest have moved to Titan. Jack, who does the maintenance has a partner called Victoria, who is a communications specialist and lover, they live in `Sky deck', high up off the ground, a rather amazing uncluttered command centre. They even have a glass bottom swimming pool for tempting night dips.<br /><br />If we look past the visuals of landscaping a post-apocalyptic world, the interesting futuristic Sky deck residence, `bubble-copters' and amazing colour palette of photography. The story while interesting, the components that make up the whole have been borrowed from a number of other films and the ending while drawing together the story threads, was disappointing, because it based on movie's perception of alien intelligence or lack of it. That said, while many have panned this film, for me faults and all it was good.
B000FC13E0|5.0|One of my favorite Crichton books. The author's knowledge of the subject matter is very impressive. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. A real page turner!
B0014LX420|5.0|Yeah, it's all here. My fav is the megamix - very well done. I normally listen to metal when I'm training, but this is like the other side of the coin for me, and when I'm just tired of it all I can listen to this for a couple hours of running.
B00AA2I2NK|3.0|I'm a big Einaudi fan; If I had to make a top 10 list of my favorite songs of all time, he would probably take half that list. His albums have been great to listen to, and everyone of them has given me goosebumps, or given me a moment where I would just sit back and think \\"Wow, that was a brilliant, brilliant song!\\"<br /><br />Well, nearly everyone of his albums has done that. I didn't get that from In a Time Lapse. To be sure, it's very soothing, relaxing and enjoyable to listen to, and as a standalone its very good; but when you compare it against Divinere, I Giorni, or Una Mattina it just seems a bit... lacking. Put this way, there's nothing on here that I could liken to Ancora, or Canzone Africana or Oltremare.<br /><br />For those of you who are fans of Top Gear, it's a bit like the \\"fizz\\" that James May gets whenever he drives a really brilliant car. I get similar euphoric, wonderful feeling when listening to one of Einaudi's great songs. I'm sorry to say, this album didn't quite seem to have that.

0984999302|2.0|The first qualm I have with the book is simply its formatting. The book is fairly short but appears in the Amazon description as a very large text because it is essentially repeated. There is one subset of the book for web or app startups and another version for physical channel startups. There is very little difference between the two, so most of those two versions are redundant. Its not expected that a person reads both sections, from what I understand. But the formatting isn't really mentioned anywhere in the start of the book or even the kindle index. So it comes as a surprise when you're about 50% through the book and it ends, in effect.<br /><br />The second thing that makes me lower my rating is simply that the information isn't very original. Steve Blank's book on the four steps to Epiphany set the groundwork for the concepts, but more importantly the \\"lean startup\\" methodology is espoused by Eric Reis' book of the same name which was published in September 2011. The book \\"Running Lean\\" came out the same week as this book (early March 2013) but goes in to MUCH more depth on how to execute the lean startup methodology in practice.<br /><br />So, in summary, its decent material but strangely organized. And my suggestion is to read Eric Reis' \\"Lean Startup\\" for the concept, and then \\"Running Lean\\" for specific execution guidance.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surf is a great game and is very addictive! My sister loves this game and I think that being able to link the game with your Facebook account is great as you are competing against your friends! Xx
0441013074|2.0|Anyone who reads hard science fiction is probably looking for a mix of a great story and a provoking conceptual perspectives on the future of science and humanity. As a story, \\"Century Rain\\" was just very, very poorly executed. The characters are flat to a degree I couldn't imagine passing editorial review, and there is an exceptionally long monologue in the middle of the book which seems to be a way to dump a lot of facts on to the reader without any attempt to make it a reasonable or interesting part of the story. It takes place in a 24 hour trip in a small vehicle with nothing to do but talk or sleep. I'd have rather they slept.<br /><br />The science concepts are better than the story, but not so much that it makes up for it. In truth, not much to commend this book about t all. What a sham, given that other work by Reynolds can be truly great.
0143122010|5.0|I cannot recommend this book too highly.  Pinker not only describes the tremendous decrease in average human suffering over the millennia; he also describes how the decrease has come about, and in effect prescribes how we can continue on this path.  It is indeed a slog--695 pages--but there are pearls in every chapter and it's a great way to spend a few minutes each day.  I've tried the same with the bible, and I'm convinced that for me reading Pinker is far more inspiring, more optimistic, and more likely to inspire behavior that will benefit the human race.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|low budget, bad actors, no surprise story, film too dark(image), the only sinister is the producer of the movie.<br />not worth the time.

B004OR199G|4.0|As many books that advocate an extreme position, this author paints a picture of diet and life choices that most people would find difficult to achieve.  She is not preachy, though, and her advice to stick to this way of eating 60% of the time makes sense to me.  If you are not vegetarian, you will not like this book, IMHO.  Kris Carr is a gluten-free vegan.  If that diet seems extreme to you, skip this book.  That being said, I bought another of her books, Crazy Sexy Kitchen, because I want to adopt more of her recommendations.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book and I thought the second was spot on for a follow up. No inconsistencies or anything and I appreciate that from the authors. Thank you for introducing characters that made sense to the story.

B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I remember the original \\"Draw a Stickman\\" web app, and I thought it was great.  This game seamed like a great concept, but I could not figure out how to proceed in the second level.  Every time I died I had to start over, and the guy walked so slow.  I gave up, I guess I just didn't get it.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|I play this CD non stop in my car I LOVE IT! theres no way you can just skip tracks there all so good!
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|This movie was pretty bizarre, and not in a [[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception (Two-Disc Edition) [Blu-ray]]] sort of way, which was excellent.  The characters' motivations seamed to randomly change to support the thin plot. The time-travel logic was fuzzy at best.  Ending could have been great, but wasn't.  Not recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! It gives me something to do while I'm bord!! Its also a very creative little game!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This white noise comes with a large variety of pre-loaded background sounds.  You can downloaded a lot more for free from a built in link.  My favorite is \\"rain falling on tent\\".  I still wake up in the morning and think \\"its raining outside\\".  You'd think I'd learn.<br /><br />One reviewer said \\"This app doesn't allow you to mix various sounds together.\\"  That is not true, it does.  You can then save your creation.  I mixed \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" with \\"Intergalactic Journey\\".  Seamed like a pretty obvious thing to do.

B0074D3CAQ|3.0|This book was a fast, decent read.  Although I did keep reading it, it was a book that I was able to predict more than I felt I wanted to be able to.  Some others have expressed surprise, so perhaps it was just me that guessed the ending.  As far as books go, I am not sad to have read it, but will not ever be tempted to read it again.

1932100660|2.0|\\"The China Study\\" was published in 2005/2006 and has since been exposed and debunked as an exercise in confirmation bias and data mining. The best review of the book with a thorough analysis of the statistical failure and bias can be found at Denise Minger's website ([...]).<br /><br />In short, Campbell 's book starts out in the 70s based on animal testing trials he ran as a young scientist that suggest a link between animal protein intake and cancer growth. Ever since that day Campbell has been dreaming of finding a set of data to verify his hypothesis on.<br /><br />He found it in the so-called China Study. Campbell then took a statistician, had him run multivariate analysis on a dataset containing 100,000 data points, finding 8,000 statistically significant variables. These variables range from 'amount of yellow vegetables consumed' to 'occurrence of rectal cancer'. Now - and this is the important bit - Campbell skims through these 8,000 correlations and picks out the ones supporting his argument, while disregarding (!) the numerous ones that blow his theory to pieces.<br /><br />Minger does a great job at exposing what Campbell 's work is: It has little to do with objective science - which would weight data supporting and opposing the original hypothesis at face value - but it's an exercise in confirmation bias. This isn't good science, not at all. Actually it is closer to religion than science.<br /><br />I gave this book two stars because it is highly educational on learning what differentiates good science vs. bad science and what can happen when a over-reaching to prove causation from correlation.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I used to have two $30~$50 range Sony mics from bestbuy and they are horrible.<br />I then upgraded to Sennheiser e 840, which I paid $160 in a local musical store (it sells for $130 at Amazon). The quality of that mic is absolutely excellent but it is a bit pricey.<br />When I needed two more Mics for karaoke and didn't want to spend too much money. After reading many good reviews about this mic I decided to give it a try. I was absolutely impressed by the quality of this mic. I have to admit Sennheiser e 840 is slightly better but the difference it NOT that much. But one e840 can buy SIX of this mic.<br />Highly recommend this mic!

Even Daniel Craig is getting rather long in the tooth, I hope he will not go on like Roger Moore did - far far too long! Rent as I suspect many will not want to watch this again. Despite all the hype this is not a movie I can recommend.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Even though I have all of their albums, I still wanted to get this one with all of their greatest, best songs on it. Again, if you're a Bon Jovi fan, I recommend you get this.

B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Wonderful grammar and writing skills; theme sketchy.  Rite of passage novel.  The author should have stayed with short story writing.
B00000IQCA|1.0|\\"R\\" rated movies are not my forte; however, this movie was in a pack of 3 others (not much better) movies. I did not want to give it a \\"1\\" rating but had to chose so I could give my review.  The very first scene had me wondering if this would be worth watching, no it wasn't. Sophia Loren dealing with doggie doo is NOT funny. I do not know why movie producers, et al. seem to think using bathroom behavior and vulgar language is appealing/funny to movie/TV viewers. The story line never made it as funny and all the above \\"1 star reviews\\" have stated it quite well. To see the models parade naked was a shock and just more tasteless writing and acting . Naked in the media (movies, TV, newsprint) is not pretty nor entertaining!!  The Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Kim Basinger, Linda Hunt, Marcello Mastroianni et al. characters were hideous and the acting was clumsy. Well, for what it is worth, all of the acting was hideous and clumsy. I never got the plot of the story. I do not keep up with directors, producers, writers only recognize certain actors. Had I seen this movie when it first came out, I may have missed out on \\"I.Q\\" - \\"Runaway Bride\\" - \\"Best Friends Wedding\\" - \\"NCIS.\\" This is a DVD that is going back!! Tell your children and your children's children to not watch such rubbish.

B00AJLHUA8|4.0|It's always a relief to find a horror movie that is well-written, well-acted and clever.  This one ticks all those boxes and manages to deliver a few good scares at the same time.  Like the similarly effective [[ASIN:B007UQ8IT2 Lovely Molly]], \\"Sinister\\" benefits froma brilliantly effective sound design and attention to characters rather than blood and gore.
B008Y79IUE|1.0|I did not like this and could not make it through the whole movie. There didn't seem to be a good story line or anything to hang on to keep me watching.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a fun game and works quite well on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm not a big 'gamer' and play it only occasionally but it works well and requires lots of screen swiping to stay in the game. :-)
B009NXAMW6|5.0|This movie kept me guessing through the whole thing and the ending surprised me. It was very good story line which moved along at a good pace. This is not one where there is shooting and a lot of things getting blown up, which is one reason I liked it so much.

B0055QYKQO|5.0|I needed to replace an ASUS Sabertooth that only lasted 8 months. The Gigabyte board reviews were good and it has surpassed my expectations. The set up and features were common sense and very helpful. Bios updates are easy and the embedded audio, Ethernet port and multiple USB (2 & 3.0) connections are really excellent. Delivery and packaging was fine. At this time I am very happy with the board.<br />I have the AMD 6 core processor and do a lot of PC recording and songwriting with large file usage. The board is handling the functions<br />very well.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|it's just so so fun....too many upsells why do you require more words when i can say it in less.
0385344228|2.0|I saw a lot of great reviews about this book and they all mentioned a big twist in the end. I think some people have a different definition of a twist-ending than I do because I finished this book and wondered where the rest of the book was -- how could I have missed the big twist? The ending was not a shocking surprise that came out of nowhere, it was something that had been building up from early on in the story. So it turns out, there really is no twist ending.<br /><br />And that was not the only issue with this book. As some others have said, there were issues with the way the characters were written...the way that the wife didn't know anything about her husband's background after years of marriage, for instance.<br /><br />I give this two stars because I did start out liking this book, but the further I read, the more issues I had with it and the harder it was to get through the book. I only read through to the end to find out what the twist was -- so for there to be a non-twist ending was very disappointing.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Classic album, great music one of my favorites.  Never gets old...can listen from start to end and no fillers...wish they would do another
B007N85POS|5.0|Never played angry birds, but heard so many people rave about it.  Got this and loved it.  My husband wanted to try it and I lost my Kindle for the next two days.  I do suggest using a stylus, it makes it easier to see the angle and position when using sling shot.

0670026557|4.0|Grant, a professor at Wharton business school, has written an interesting book about three personality styles:  takers, matchers, and givers.  His research shows that givers, people who contribute to others' success without a quid pro quo, are both the least successful and most successful people in their professions.  [[ASIN:0670026557 Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success]] is full of interesting and unexpected research results like this.<br /><br />The first and last chapters of the book are very strong; many of the middle chapters are less compelling and feel like they were added to make the book, well, book-length.  For example, an early section of the book has a fascinating discussion of lekking, the inclination of takers to show off - derived from studies of animals, such as male peacocks strutting during mating season.  The advice in this section on how to identify takers is quite valuable.  The book has a very strong ending with a list of practical actions one can take to become a successful giver.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated that the book is well-written - I look forward to Grant's next book - and that it does not have the bland tone of so many business books.  If you are interested in this general topic, I highly recommend [[ASIN:006124189X Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (Collins Business Essentials)]].

B003NTSBUG|1.0|I've tried on two occasions to watch this and both times couldn't get past the first thirty minutes.  It tried much too hard to be creative and maybe imitate Hitchcock, etc.  attempting to be spooky, enigmatic, but failed miserably.  It was just plain boring. I couldn't get interested in it and I didn't like the characters, the flashbacks.  What can I say except I couldn't find any reason to watch the whole thing..............

B001BANK32|3.0|For a 1980's  take on a book the movie isn't that bad. The acting is a little over the top but that's not why it lost stars for me. I felt like the book built tension at an even pace while giving a rational background for the paranormal activity in the hotel. The movie has rushed pacing and several components of the story were changed and ended up feeling cheesy. For example the character of Danny is a five year old who falls into trances and sees visions in the book. In the movie they didn't seem to know how to film that so they have the character talk to his finger. Cheesy. An example of the pacing being rushed is the initial meeting of Danny and the hotel cook Dick. In the book it's an even paced introduction in which Danny immediately comes out of his shell when he feels a connection to Dick (Dick is the first person he's ever met with a similar psychic gift). Dick takes his time explaining what \\"shining\\" is and builds a background for all the unusual things that will take place during the story. My last complaint is about what all people who turn books into movies seem to do: they change things for no reason. Instead of the \\"bad room\\" being number 217 it's 237. Instead of Jack using a roque mallet on his crazy quest it's an ax. Overall it isn't a movie to avoid but if you enjoyed the book then the film will leave you disappointed.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Very well written. This book was a great read while on vacation becuase it took my mind away from work and into a story about perservance and the will to live.
0525478817|5.0|Steph's Review:<br />Words cannot describe how much I loved this book. I have never cried so much in a long time, and nothing is even close to how heart-wrenching this book is. It is just Flat. Out. Amazing. As my friend Angie would describe it, it was just...beautiful. This book is a lot different from books I usually read, probably because of it's realism. Cancer exists, and right now we can't do anything to stop it. The Fault In Our Stars is very touching, and within the span of it's pages, John Green was able to fully connect his characters and world to me as if they'd been there my entire life. I actually wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but I listened to the awards and raves it got and gave it a shot. I had no regrets that I started read this from the very first chapter.<br /><br />At just 13 years old, Hazel Grace was diagnosed with thyroid cancer which metastasized to her lungs. By some miracle, a cancer-treating drug perceived to ineffective became her savior, and halted the growth of any new tumors in her body. However, Hazel is and will be tethered to an oxygen tank for the rest of her life, because her lungs simply won't be \\"good lungs\\" anymore. She's practically given up. It's not exactly a good situation, because anything \\"normal\\" for kids her age is now out of her reach, or so she believes.<br />During a fateful meeting at the Cancer Support Group, Augustus Waters barrels into her life. He's hot, one legged, funny, and hopeful. Cancer-free and in remission, Augustus Waters is what cancer patients hope to be one day. With his sweet talk, he gets right into Hazel's nerves and shows her that living with cancer doesn't take away who you are. You just have to make the time meant for you your own infinite, your type of forever.<br /><br />John Green, amazingly, was able to put so much humor into this book despite it's serious topic. I don't even know how many times I LOL'd while I was reading it, and contrary to my personal belief, he can write romance. Augustus is such a sweetheart, and he's pretty darn arrogant and hilarious. I love him, enough said. He's a bright highlight, both to Hazel and to The Fault itself. Despite his near flippant attitude, he is one of the wisest characters in the book, and provided more support to Hazel than her parents ever could. Hazel's first mindset is that she's just an ugly nobody, waiting to rot in a grave, but Augustus makes her feel and become someone beautiful. John Green, through this book, tells everyone that there isn't anything wrong with hope, and it's one of the strongest feelings a person can have.<br /><br />Back to the crying part. While this book was happy-go-lucky for the first 2/3, a surprising twist made my whole world come crashing down like a meteor plummeting towards Earth. I was kind of expecting it to happen, but it was still surprising nonetheless because I didn't want it to happen, I was hoping it wouldn't. The ending of The Fault was as heartbreaking as it was heartfelt. There are so many life messages hidden between the pages that inspire you to be better. It was pretty bittersweet, but still hard to handle. I read too much paranormal stuff, when there is always a HEA. I cried at least three times within the last 100 pages, no joke. I could not get over this book for days, and me and Angie (mentioned above) blubbered over this book for a while. A long while. I once had to write an essay for school on the book that most changed my life and I chose to write it on Kira-Kira by Cynthia Kodohata. If I had to rewrite that essay today, The Fault In Our Stars would have been my top choice instead. This is definitely a must read for adults and teens both.<br /><br />--Steph @ A Walk on Wordse romance. Augustus is such a sweetheart, and he's pretty darn arrogant and hilarious.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|Good read. Unfortunately for me it is a long read and have minimal time to sit and enjoy. The details and specifics are great. Never did well with history in school and reading this book made me wish that I had done better. Very informative.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a cool game where you play a virus and attack the earth.<br />Just don't want it to ever happen in real life.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I have read all Jeffery Archers books and even with his awesome characterisation I was beginning to wonder how he can sustain the adventures of key members of the cast for 7 books.  But I was not disappointed as he described the realities of Parent and Children lives being intertwined.<br /><br />Another great read and yes I swore when 2 pages from the end I realized what cliff hanger he had chosen to leave the reader with.  Roll on next March for book four.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Less serious than the first. It's an action parody star-studded with yesterday's superheroes. I say this in a positive light - none of today's young talent can match the screen presence of Stallone, Schwartzeneggar, and Willis, better yet all of them together on one screen. It's some entertaining stuff.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Pretty intense movie that put me on the edge of my seat. While there was great entertainment (action, some comedy), I did feel like I was there with the people, in Iran and in the 70s. Overall great movie.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|With outstanding performances by John Hawkes, Helen Hunt and William Macy, this is one of those movies that didn't get a lot of publicity but deserves so much more. It is a story of hope and love and the capacity of one human to touch another at every level. An uplifting story that leaves you feeling good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I LOVED this book! Such a great read! I'm on vacation for my anniversary and have been reading it in my down time, lol. Absolute page turner!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This is a movie that is extremely uncomfortable to watch but should be seen by everyone. It is almost inconceivable that any human being could be this cruel to another. But, it also serves as a reminder that we still have to be on guard for this sort of thing so that it never happens again.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Great read tore through it in a few days. Ernest is an excellent writer and the story was well thought out and kept my attention throughout. I guess my only complaint is I was hoping for an end that included a possible second book and a possible light for what seemed like a dismal future. Will definitely be keeping am eye out for his future books. I am now a fan.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a free.. App.. It's a great book.. My little girl got this book on her kindle HD.. She reading it for school.. I love Amazon. .. Thank you for helping  my kids.. Wow.. Free. Susanmgagne@gmail.com..
B007IXWKUK|3.0|No where near as well written as the first book.  The first book of the trilogy read like a fine wine, you never wanted to put it down, it was so smooth.  Book 2 was like Boone's Farm as a comparison.  It was really hard to get through unlike the first title.  It was good, but nothing like the first.  James should have written two books, splitting half of this to go with the first book, and half to go with the third.  There just wasn't enough story here to hold an entire book together.  I had to force myself to finish it.  Must say it picked up at the end, though.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is a compelling story with quality writing. It's a book that really makes you feel and visualize what the author is writing. I don't believe any of it was based on fact, but the author handled the concept as if she knew what it would be like being locked up years in one room and giving birth.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm thrilled that James has returned to the excelled writing skills seen in the first issue.  I couldn't put this volume down, just like volume one.  It is so well written you barely notice you're reading pornography,  You really need to read the first two volumes for this to make sense, but that's OK, what is a Trilogy for if not to read all of it's parts.  But don't kid yourself, this is nothing more than exceptionally well written dirty book!
0375842209|5.0|The imagery and story line was captivating. I literally couldn't put it down and stayed up way too late reading until I finished it. The concept of Death as the author was brilliant.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm very open minded, have experienced a lot in life, and find very few things shocking, but the fact that this book was widely accepted and read by millions completely befuddles me!  Since when did pornography go mainstream?  This book is so well written I simply could not put it down.  I changed loads of laundry with my book reader in hand.  Walked my dog with a visor on so I wouldn't miss a written word.  Not because of the shock value, but because it was that incredible well put on the page.  Really.  Yet I have to admit there were some segments that even I had to blush at, a few descriptions I skimmed over because, frankly, it was just too much information.  And, yes, there were times that I was just jealous.  Why couldn't I feel that way, just once.......
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Many friends said this book was hot, so I tried it. I had a hard time getting past the authors poor writing. Yes, it's hot and a great concept if it was written by someone more skilled at building up a plot. It kind of told the reader what impression to get from it rather than allowing the reader to draw from the story. The part about, &#34;He's so controlling,&#34; was lame. He didn't even seem incredibly controlling at that point. Couldn't finish it.
B004XUMMFE|3.0|it was ok  i was exspecting a little more drama  with a little more up to date special effects  !!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Bought this for my 11 year old and his kindle!  He loves it... way better than the Star Wars edition.

1476733953|5.0|Wool will prove to be a masterpiece of distopian science fiction. A unique perspective on a futuristic existence for the human species that is disturbing in the that it could be possible.  Yet even in this future hell a glimmer of hope is possible.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|OK. I am a Tom Selleck fan. Always have been since Magnum PI. But the Jesse Stone character strikes a cord with me for some reason. I can watch this show and the next one over and over again. I was on the road and needed a break so I just dialed in my Amazon Prime and pulled up the movie. What would it be like if you could take a break from your life for just an hour? This is the place I go for that.
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|Trying to be like my favorite Castle...although Sherlocke is a little like my least favorite House..I will probably watch more episodes.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Excellent acting...keeps your interest throughout the film.  I was hesitant at first to view it since I don't usually watch this type of movie...glad I changed my mind!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo exceeded every expectation I had for a movie of this type.  The characters were generally well developed, and the 1979 pictures versus the actors and cinematography gave an amazing insight into the lengths the producers went to ensure that the film was reasonably true to the events.  While there was certain cinematic license and elements around both chase scenes and dialogue that could be criticized from a historical perspective, as a thriller based on historical events, this movie was a non-stop, edge of the seat, entertaining way to spend a few hours on a flight to London (thank you Delta). I would watch it over again.  A great film.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is an excellent look inside the food industry. Look up these facts and figures independently and you'll find plenty of evidence to support them.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Great movie... cool special effects for that time period. It shows what we can do without computers and a little imagination.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is one of the most amazing films I have ever watched. It touched me to the core and made me smile, laugh, and cry at the same time.<br /><br />It is the true story of a young man, confined to an iron lung for the majority of his life, who wants to learn what love is all about before he dies. He's not just interested in the sexual side of love, he wants to know what it is to love and be loved by another person.<br /><br />With the help of his priest, personal attendants, a sex therapist (surrogate), and an amazing young lady that saw far more to him than his disability, he is able to experience true love in all its physical and emotional wonder and glory.<br /><br />I am not usually comfortable with videos that contain graphic sex scenes and this one has some of the most graphic scenes I have ever watched. Amazingly, I didn't feel any of the usual discomfort I feel when seeing sex scenes that do absolutely nothing to further the plot. Those scenes make me feel cheap--like a voyeur.<br /><br />The sex scenes in this film were so tender and beautiful that they made me rejoice in the ability of two people to share something so deep and personal. It portrays the act of ultimate giving of oneself to another.<br /><br />I am so glad I came upon this video. My thanks to all of the reviewers who gave it a great rating so that I felt viewing it would be worth the risk of it being just another sex-saturated film.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love all the Twilight movies but The Breaking Dawn movies are the best.  I wish there were more.  I will miss them.

B004T4LUPW|2.0|After a few months with this pricey app, I am deleting it.<br /><br />It's endless options and myriad of settings make it a bloody mess to look at and operate. So far from simple it's sad.<br /><br />Too bad I broke my promise to never pay for an app with this one.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|this took 9 days to load and it didn't Even install and had to download it again for a 2cnd time and shut down and erased some savings on my divise
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game! But I dont play it all the time! If you play games all the time then this game will be to slow for you! I think its perfect speed for me!
B0015AARJI|1.0|even charing over night continuesly, i can't use remotely. it keeps nagging battery charge required. Also, it does not work wireless mode, behaves erratic. Only works when the USB cable plugged in. I have reset with the controller from the bottom switch, I have format PS3 but no luck.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Since there were no subtitles I found it very difficult to follow most of the dialogue. If there is a way to introduce subtitles<br />it would greatly enhance the movie as it stands.  I would have liked to hear the verbal fighting over the passage of the amendment<br /><br />This is my first experience with Amazon and a movie.  I found it easy to obtain and to view.  .
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I really enjoy the game a lot of fun great way to pass time . We love to play it over and over again.
B004XUMOGQ|5.0|Though not entirely comparable, Firefly and Star Trek: The Next Generation are my two favorite TV series' of all time. Wonderful characters, incredible writing, just the right dose of action, and intelligent plot design. At the time of this review, it is unclear that there will ever be a direct follow-up or continuation of the series (disregarding the well-done film 'Serenity'). My hope is that there will at least be a spiritual successor in the same universe with allusions to the first series' characters and their accomplishments.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|When I read this book I found it to be hilarious from start to finish. This book is great for anyone who is looking for a funny book, even reluctant readers should enjoy this series. Definitely worth reading.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful story loved it. Very enlightening into get a look at the past and what went on in the early orphanages.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. I always get disappointed when I read a story that doesn't connect the dots or leaves questions unanswered. Hoover really came full circle with Sky. I was also surprised by the unexpected twists that totally make sense at the end.
B003K16P3M|4.0|The wonderful world of the Graces.  Absorbing, fast paced, with surprises interlaced.  A fun and captive read.  Looking forward to more adventures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great if you were to want to download a fun game this would be it its quite funny too
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Very fresh and well thought out. The characters were especially amazing and he doesn't fear to tamper a bit with your emotions.
0307950689|4.0|Even though I think that this isn't Dan Brown's best book it is still a good read. Yes, he is not a great writer, his books are still entertaining. Well, his later books are good. The first couple...well...
B00280LYIC|4.0|Very short. Great plot and a pleasure to read. It also explained the mythical characters very well. I would recommend this book.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|I had avoided watching the Oldman version of Tinker, Tailor thinking that it couldn't possibly tell LeCarre's elegantly crafted story in two hours nor as well as it was told in the 6 plus hours of the Alec Guinness film version.  I briefly changed my mind when I caught ten minutes or so of the Oldman version while surfing the movie channels.  It seemed to be well acted with decent attention to the story.  I thought I would try it and see.<br /><br />When I got the DVD my first problem was with how poorly the master film had been copied to the disc.  It was dark, dark, dark.  Not at all as I had seen it on TV.  Characters sitting in chairs next to windows with the sun streaming in looked like they were sitting in a dark room.  Outside shots were dull not bright, etc.<br /><br />That problem aside, as were many of the current Amazon reviewers, I was surprised at how key elements of the story were savaged in the apparent interest of brevity.  The worst was the crucial scene at the end where the \\"Mole\\" is transitioning from unknown to known (about to be caught).  This was absolutely unintelligible both visually and auditorily.  I was left with a \\"What just happened?\\" feeling. And, this \\"capture\\" was the whole point of the story!<br /><br />All in all, if you want to know the story this movie is trying to tell, you're better off if you read LeCarre's books first.  On the other hand if you already have read LeCarre then you'll be able to fill in the gaps in the story the film makes all too readily available.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|It is about time that this movie came out on Blu Ray. It was way ahead of its time in that the color palette included only basic color tones. The Blu Ray restoration finally does it justice as the colors literally jump out of the screen.  Acting talents abound along with a great film score.  Singing by Madonna and Mandy Patamkin round out the story line.  So many talented actors were involved with memorable performances.  Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles and Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice. Exceptional costuming as well. Buy it and watch it over and over again.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Half the fun of this movie is watching what Jack Nicholson's character will say and/or do next. The language is a steady stream of profanities without being offensive because the dialogue fits the characters so well. You can easily believe what you're watching is how this group of people talk to each other every day.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Each character is memorable from the smaller to the larger ones. Seeing the aristocrat, Ian Richardson, bow and scrape before winning is something. His assistant is one of the great characters. The classic line, &#34;You could say that, I couldn't possibly comment,&#34; rings in your ears long after the watching.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Too many bitchy, crazy women.  Normal people are outnumbered 20:1.  They don't know how to make characters slightly odd without going to extremes.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I'll admit I'm not a huge Justin Timberlake fan, and I was pleasantly surprised how great this album is. You still have Timbaland's pop and R&B/hiphop production, but there is timeless and classic vibe that is added I feel with the live instruments and vocal production. My favorite tracks: Tunnel Vision, Let The Groove Get In, and Mirrors.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Good take on a romance. I read it in a couple days.  It's hard to find a storyline that hasn't been done before.
B009NXAMW6|4.0|This is an early example of Ed Norton portraying the character that you love to hate. An engrossing film with a somewhat clumsy 'gotcha' ending.
B00C1BVAYG|4.0|The special effects are great, the story is much weaker than one.  I had forgotten how many &#34;big&#34; names did these three films.

B00B89X0AY|5.0|This is the best sounding version of this miraculous, seminal album that features Bob& band on electric instruments for \\"Side 1\\" and Bob and his acoustic folk guitar on \\"Side 2\\" arguably the single best side of music in the 20th Century--whatever that mess was!!!! Unfortunately, it is about the same fidelity, or maybe just a hair better than the regular remastered version that costs about 1/3 the price. Now, I don't have an SACD player, so that might be the thing that sends it over the top. But if you just have a regular CD player, you don't really need this version, you will be fine with the regular remastered STEREO release.<br /><br />Also, the CDs in this series have a larger size than normal disc packages so it won't fit neatly into a stack or storage bin. Why they do that, I have no idea. The old MFSL products were sized the same as regular discs.<br /><br />I have to give this album 5 stars no matter what format it is in. I would give 4 stars for this version for the reasons noted above, mostly that the sound is not worth 3x the price--but that being said, it does sound incredibly good, I cannot fault it there. It is a slight improvement, there is a bit more clarity and punch, and it does not sound like it is due to extra compression as can be heard on many other reissues. No steroids here, just the real deal. Please note that this version is STEREO and not Mono. I usually like the Mono versions for early Dylan, but for this album the STEREO is far superior and was the wise choice. I think the record is too long to put both versions on one disc.<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that on It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding, about 10 or 11 seconds into the track there is this weird little fade & fizzy sound for about a second. I thought it was this disc, but when I AB'd my remastered stereo and the Mono version, it is there as well, right at the same spot. Funny I don't recall that on my old vinyl, and I listened to that about 7,000 times.<br /><br />I would have to really compose my thoughts to write anything of significance about the music on this album and its continuing relevance nearly 50 years later. Gates of Eden and It's Alright Ma might just as well be written today. The songs on this album range from tender love songs to surrealist dream fuzz-box mini-operas to visionary spiritual epiphanies to fierce poetic protest songs. Dylan does bring it ALL musically and lyrically on this album, proving that even with his unmannered nasally voice he was every bit the equal of the Beatles, if not their superior. Lennon always bowed down to Dylan and this album will tell you why. For me, BIABH is still my favorite Dylan album and gets my vote as his best release ever; possibly, it is the best album of the 60's as well. So, this could be the ultimate version of the ultimate album from the ultimate era of rock n' roll. Looking at it that way, 30 bucks doesn't seem so much to put out for it....
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Too long, not enough comedic support, Leslie Mann is too much, her characters in very movie are generally the same, and zero conclusion.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I have read a lot of book over the years that purport to explain one thing or another. Most of these books have left me wanting more-kind of like a Discovery Channel &#34;new discovery&#34; show-one 55 minutes of explaining how they go to the discovery and five minutes to say it is not really there yet and that more study is needed. However, I found none of that here. Right from the start, I saw she has it. FOr once, I read a book that accurately described me and-more importantly-why I am like I am. It has taken me decades to fully understand that I am not &#34;weird&#34;.  If I would have had this book 50 years ago, things would have been much easier.

B000C25VNM|4.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens includes a short preface where he hopes, \\"I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.\\" Despite the treacly overlay of sentimentality the work is spiced with satire, including an attack on Sabbatarianism, in which the villainous Scrooge begins to redeem himself, criticising strict observance of Sunday, and festive occasions like Christmas, that a law of 1836 was intended to reserve.<br /><br />The death of Tiny Tim Cratchit is more than a heartrending device to rouse the emotions of susceptible readers. Instead A Christmas Carol emphasises the plight of the children of London's poor to his readership. At the time of the book's publication, in 1839 half of all funerals in London were for children under the age of ten. Exploitive businessmen like Scrooge were in a position to remedy this condition. The ghosts who haunt Scrooge not only taunt him with his own lost opportunities for love and his own unhappy prospects; obliquely, they accuse him of causing the deaths of children; the ghostly apparitions are the representatives of the children whose deaths he has caused. He is being reminded of his responsibility to break cycles of poverty, by providing schools where the children of the poor could learn liberating skills; to pay fair wages that would enable parents to feed their children and keep them healthy.<br /><br />Dickens employs heavy handed allegory in the form the twins, Ignorance and Want, introduced by The Ghost of Christmas Present quietly menacing Scrooge, saying, \\"This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.\\" These twins, and the fear of their vengeance, inspired Scrooge to reform, and reach out from his bitter misanthropy, and least as much as did his realisation that he yearned to share in human warmth.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000C25VNM A Christmas Carol]]rooge to reform, and reach out from his bitter misanthropy, and least as much as did his realisation that he yearned to share in human warmth.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000C25VNM A Christmas Carol]]

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There's basically no way to tell people what The Fault In Our Stars is about without it sounding like the worst book ever written. A YA novel about a young girl with terminal cancer who falls in love with a cancer survivor she meets in a support group? That sounds like the kind of treacly pap you might expect from Lifetime or Nicolas Sparks, not a critically acclaimed bestseller from John Green, a widely beloved YA author. And yet, ask anyone who's read it, and they'll tell you that this isn't sentimental, manipulative garbage; this is thoughtful, moving, compelling stuff. And now that I've read it, you can add me to that chorus; The Fault In Our Stars is one of the finest YA books I've ever read, and just a magnificent book, period. But how on Earth does Green avoid this turning into the book we all dread it could be? Much of that has to be chalked up to his main character/narrator Hazel, whose voice is equal parts world-weariness, cynical humor, acceptance of death, quick wit, word lover, and pure teenage girl. Hazel's a wonderful creation, and she's far from the angelic, lesson-conveying manic pixie dream girl that inhabits so many Nicholas Sparks books; instead, she's a rich and wonderful person who has her own issues, her own dreams, her own goals, and her own inimitable voice. The same goes pretty much across the board; there's not a character that even dips their toes into the sea of cliche - these are all rich, complicated characters who come to life thanks to Green's rich prose. And as if great characters and excellent prose aren't enough, The Fault In Our Stars is genuinely, profoundly moving and affecting. It dodges easy, pat answers about death and mortality, avoids the easy routes at all times, and dodges cheap sentimentality; and still, for all that, when it wants to hit you hard, it's going to, plain and simple. Part beautiful coming-of-age story, part teen romance, part meditation on mortality, part hilariously funny dialogue work, The Fault In Our Stars deserves every bit of acclaim it's gotten and then some. It made me laugh, it made me think, and yes, it made me cry, cliched though that sentence sounds. It's a magnificent book, and I'm better off for having read it.tars deserves every bit of acclaim it's gotten and then some.

1590710487|5.0|You can destroy a person by giving them everything they want, and drugs have nothing to do with that. I found myself thinking about this reading \\"Belushi,\\" the oral history on John Belushi prepared by Tanner Colby and Belushi's widow, Judith Belushi Pisano.<br /><br />As the blurb tells us, when he turned 30 in 1979, John Belushi was the star of the highest-rated late-night show, the hottest-selling album, and the biggest-selling comedy to ever hit movie screens. This should have been a happy occasion for the son of impoverished Albanian immigrants, and it kind of was...sort of. Tony Hendra, a writer and producer of Belushi's off-Broadway breakthrough show, \\"Lemmings,\\" talks of a hollowness at the core of the American dream: \\"When you finally get where're you going, what then?\\"<br /><br />That drugs were at the center of Belushi's too-young demise, just 33 in March, 1982, is a fact \\"Belushi\\" doesn't try to deny. It gets points from me for presenting the permissiveness and sordidness around Belushi in forthright terms. We read here about his early days smoking pot with his wife and castmates at Second City improv theater, a casual-seeming beginning to something that morphed by the time he was on television - a career-making four-year stint on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" - into a steady cocaine habit. Belushi didn't sail into the storm unaware; he took steps to stop his drug use which resulted in long periods of sobriety. This is where much of \\"Belushi's\\" focus lies.<br /><br />But even without the drugs, Belushi was a troubled guy, so emotionally needy he would visit the homes of friends or even complete strangers and spend hours just talking to them, then sleep on their couch. It became the basis of a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch, \\"The Thing That Wouldn't Leave,\\" where Belushi played himself. He was the kind of guy who would travel in disguise to a public place, and then become unhappy no one recognized him. He could be hard to deal with, his friends tell us, but on the other hand trusting to a fault. If he had sobered up, or never touched drugs at all, I wonder if he would have been with us still today.<br /><br />\\"Belushi\\" opens up the world of John and his friends and sucks you in. The book this was written to counter, Bob Woodward's \\"Wired,\\" actually presented Belushi's descent quite well albeit in the language of a police procedural, lacking a sense of Belushi's personality or an appreciation for his work. What I really liked about \\"Belushi,\\" beyond getting to know John a bit more than I expected to, was that balance. Published in 2005, nearly a quarter-century after Belushi's death, it benefits from much hindsight and cooled passions. Judith, who was famously hurt by \\"Wired,\\" presents a story of John as committed yet confused partner that is remarkably tender and unguarded, not at all the whitewash I admittedly expected going in.<br /><br />\\"Belushi\\" is like that throughout. Colby's brief narrative segues provide for color and context, but for the most part you get a series of subjective takes, some contradictory. Christopher Guest, who was a senior player in \\"Lemmings,\\" suggests Belushi was intimidated by him, which is followed by Hendra saying \\"John was not intimidated in the least.\\"<br /><br />The chapters are broken out chronologically, with a chapter devoted to \\"National Lampoon's Animal House,\\" his big box-office hit, and another about the Blues Brothers, the chart-topping soul revival act he developed with his \\"Saturday Night Live\\" castmate Dan Aykroyd. The chapter titles are clever, too; the one about his attempt at changing up his party-boy image by starring in a romantic comedy called \\"Continental Divide\\" will surely bring a smile to anyone who saw \\"Animal House\\": \\"See If You Can Guess What I Am Now\\".<br /><br />Knowing nods like that make \\"Belushi\\" hugely enjoyable to Belushi fans, but its accessibility and willingness to present tough insights make for a good read regardless of whether you think Belushi was a comicgenius or just a drug casualty. This is a book channeled through insiders, but fascinating for anyone.genius or just a drug casualty. This is a book channeled through insiders, but fascinating for anyone.

B009GEAPYW|4.0|Like most fans of this work, I have loved it since a friend let me borrow it over 20 years ago.  I had to have my own copy, and I have read it many times.  This animated version is almost perfect, as there are scenes which match the original panels line for line.  The only reason I don't give the animated version 5 stars is because there is no interior monologue for Batman/Bruce Wayne.  This was, no doubt, a creative decision to simplify the process of bringing the story to the screen, but some of the interior monologue adds a lot of depth to the character.  That being said, this feature and Part 2 are well worth a look if you are a fan of the original story, or even if you like animated movies in general.  ** Note to parents with young children ** - This is NOT like &#34;Batman the Animated Series,&#34; &#34;Justice League,&#34; &#34;Justice League Unlimited,&#34; or &#34;Batman Beyond.&#34;  The violence, though stylized, is quite realistic and, in some scenes, GRAPHIC.

Strunk and White plots a direct course to perfect understanding of how to tackle the common ogres of English usage, such as the much-feared apostrophe-s conundrum, and what to do when confronted with a comma, and how to manage the unruly parentheses.  The third edition has been updated to conform with a few minor changes that have somehow crept into written language necessarily due to advances in technology: for instance, when Prof. Strunk first compiled his &#34;little book&#34; there was no such thing as a computer and its grammatical baggage.  Other bits of usage, such as &#34;&c.,&#34; have disappeared from written style entirely.  You cannot go wrong with this &#34;little book,&#34; compiled by Professor Strunk and lovingly edited by my very favorite author in the whole world, E. B. White.

So don't plan on knocking down much of anything in 3 shots. Expect more like 10. Or 20. Or  30. Lots of bird-shagging to re-shoot. We don't even bother with the cards. We play on a coffee table shooting the long way; this isn't great for a very small table, you need some room. And be prepared to be chasing the little birds all over the place. Fine game if you think outside the box and be creative with it, as the rules are written it's not very practical for kids.

B00ATUEKY8|5.0|So why did I give this five stars if it's PTSD in a jar?  Because I'm the kind of person who has just the sort of mental illness that Silvia Plath had, and just the sort of suicidal fantasies and tendencies.  I'm still alive, though, and she's not; but the reason I am still alive is that I have one order of magnitude of distance from the monsters that sent Plath to her death.  For this I am very grateful.  There is no denying that Plath is among the truly great 20th century writers.  Like Hemingway, she goes straight for the viscera, and she hits you in the gut every time.  It is this intensity, this unedited sensitivity, that tears away the diaphanous veil between the reality that most of us perceive, and the naked other-worldly vision that authors like Plath and Hemingway see, whether they will it or not, and that tortures their souls until the pain overpowers the responsibility to one's family and to society at large, to remain on the planet.  I don't consider myself a great writer, or a great anything, but my illness allows me to empathize with Sylvia's suffering; thus, &#34;The Bell Jar&#34; was both a touching and fascinating read, and a chilling trigger that sent me to bed for several days with &#34;the mentals.&#34;

B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I have only discovered Stone Sour a couple years ago when I heard their single \\"Say You'll Haunt Me\\" on the radio and I enjoyed it. I looked into them and have enjoyed many of their songs since. More recently I purchased HoGaB pt. 1 and compeletly enjoyed it, great hooks, great lyrics, and terrific instrumentation on thatr record. This half lives up to the anticipation thrust upon it after a brilliant part 1. It is darker, doesn't quite have the diversity that the first record has but it has much heavier, catchier riffs and more difficult instrumentation and in my opinion, more compelling lyrics to end the series of two. I shall now do a song by song review with a few words describing my decision.<br /><br />1. \\"Red City\\" 9/10 - A dark ballad to begin the record, it really is a beautifully twisted song, the lyrics are brilliant but lacks a distinct melody which might upset fans but I think it's a terrific song.<br /><br />2. \\"Black John\\" 10/10 - Such a catchy verse, the classic cymbal/bass beat creates this almost dance-like song. The lyrics are compelling, the guitar riff is infectious, one of the highlights of the record.<br /><br />3. \\"Sadist\\" 10/10 - The longest song on the record clocking in at just over five minutes, the lyrics are brilliant, a slower song but nevertheless incredible.I particularly love the chorus, it's just darkly intelligent.<br /><br />4. \\"Peckinpah\\" 10/10 - Another incredibly dark and heavy song but it succeeds with terrific lyrics, the chorus is heavy and epic, I just love this song for what it is. The riff in the bridge is just fantastic, simplistic but effective, the guitar solo is mind-bending, I love it.<br /><br />5. \\"Stalemate\\" 10/10 - This is a song that would have worked well on the first part, an acoustic intro and a heavy metal riff follows. It's very catchy, has a thrashy edge and the chorus is catchy, the screams are well placed, and once again, the lyrics are amazing.<br /><br />6. \\"Gravesend\\" 10/10 - Very dark, the heaviestsong out of the two records. The lyrics are brilliant, the darkened screams are suprising (especially when the volume is fully up) but effective. The chorus is not my favorite but does a good job telling the story. The guitar solo is great by the way, a great song.<br /><br />7. \\"82\\" 10/10 - The intro riff is original, it's just a classic stone sour song, great riffs and great words to compliment it. The chorus is really catchy, the guitar solo is short but effective (it's a reprise from the first record), it's just another great song.<br /><br />8. \\"The Uncanny Valley\\" 8/10 - A slower song, more of a post-grunge sounding song (which is one of my least favorite genres of music). The best thing about this song is the chorus, incredibly catchy. The guitar solo is cool and is a reprise from the previous record. The acoustic guitars add something to the song, it's hard to say. I think it's a matter of opinion, listen for your self.<br /><br />9. \\"Blue Smoke\\" 8/10 - A short electronic intro to \\"Do Me A Favor\\", it's really interesting, it's mysteriously haunting with some strings are strange sound effects, that's all I want to say.<br /><br />10. \\"Do Me A Favor\\" 10/10 - A catchy, radio friendly song, the first single of the record. It's really great, I loved it from the first moment I heard it on the radio. The best part of the song in my opinion is the reprise towards the ending of \\"A Rumor of Skin\\" but other highlights are the verses and the guitar solo.<br /><br />11. \\"The Conflagration\\" 10/10 - It's a beautiful song with a piano played by Corey. The lyrics are beautiful, the chorus is one of the best on the records, probably my favorite. It's a great song, one that you need to listen to for yourself.<br /><br />12. \\"The House of Gold and Bones\\" 11/10 - Brilliant ending, from the chanting of RU486 to the heavy riffs to the pounding drums, everything is amazing. It takes many elements from \\"Absolute Zero\\" on the first record but really holds its on, it's amazing, greatending to a great record.<br /><br />It's a great record, buy it for yourself for a friend, for anybody. I highly recommend it, my favorite tracks are: The House of Gold and Bones, Sadist, Black John, and Stalemate.
1592402038|1.0|If you're the kind of person who likes to strut around feeling holier-than-thou, this is the book for you.  Ms. Truss devotes most of her preface to boasting about the \\"astonishing response \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" has had in the UK (sic).\\"  I'm happy for her; but frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn.  It's the quality of the product I'm after, not the cutesy turn of phrase or the self-satisfied knocking of the great unwashed who don't know what to do with an apostrophe when it is in close proximity to an \\"s.\\"  Strunk and White's venerable manual \\"The Elements of Style\\" delivers over the rules of apostrophe-s usage in exactly half a page.  Ms. Truss, head over heels in love with herself, burns up 31 pages of trees attempting to explain the same thing.  Evidently this is justified by her liberally peppering the text with horrid examples of laughable mistakes, evidently made by bumpkins who deserve to be put in the stocks and publicly humiliated.  She also manages to mangle many conventions of style that, while they might be considered acceptable in casual usage (such as UK rather than U.K.), are enough to make this editor's teeth itch.  I like the joke, though.
B007SSEZNA|3.0|Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it.<br /><br />I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focusses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fiancé. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet.<br /><br />It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath.<br /><br />Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind.  Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected language... Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|This movie should be seen by all. The 3d affects are Awesome!!! Great movie for the whole family!!! I give this movie a thumbs up!!

B004JK61K0|4.0|The font is small on my Kindle 8.9\\" HD. At first I found the logo/icon (robot doggie-head) a little off-putting, but it truly is amusing. As in my pre-installed email app on the kindle (a gift bought in November 2012), sometimes my kindle tablet does not show emails that are already loaded via gmail (my email provider) on my laptop. That's a little strange and at times disconcerting. Even pressing 'check mail' in the settings menu in K-9 mail on my Kindle Fire does not load the emails.<br /><br />So . . . I dunno. Maybe I should have gone with just three stars. I'm not big into reviews or gushing about apps. The above-mentioned observations represent some of the downsides of the app. There are some upsides but not real fantastic ones. It's a basic email app, after all. It gets the job done. I just do wish that I could count on it to load all my emails as they are sent.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this drama.  The upstairs with it's heirarchy and the downstairs with theirs.  Great cast of characters.  Maggie Smith is my favorite.  Her role, her acting, just really grand.  Thank you BBC for a great great drama, and for a cast of characters that can really act.  So little of that these days.
B000002HJD|3.0|Years after jim's death the band took tapes of him reading poetry and set it to music. Making this a unusual cd for sure. However this is not a regular doors cd , nor does it claim to be. It's interesting and jim's poetry remains excellent and among the best of the late 20th century. But if you are not into poetry readings then you may not like this one a lot. I like it for sure. The poetry music experience is interesting. But not everyone will enjoy this format. Ignore the one star reviews of this one they mostly come from the same person who many years ago was on drugs and ranted a lot.  Anyhow, this is for completists and poetry lovers mainly ,not for the casual fan of the doors at all.

0307593312|4.0|When any new book by Murakami comes out, the first question of many an avid reader will probably be: does this master of contemporary literature still have 'it'? The odd thing after reading 1Q84 is that I'd have to answer (to myself, mainly): I don't know.<br /><br />As other reader-reviewers have already noted, the book (or rather, 3 books) do have many of the typical Murakami ingredients: a fascination with ears, an important role for intuition (sentences of the type: X didn't know why s/he knew this, but s/he knew that s/he knew this) and a tendency -ok, more than a tendency- towards the paranormal (come to think of it, I wonder how many former X-files fans are now Murakami-fans). However, as other readers have also pointed out, some of these ingredients seem overused in this book, and where they seemed quite a natural part of Murakami's earlier stories, at some points in this book, elements like repetition start to come across as almost artificial.<br /><br />The book's story is, I would agree, slow to pick up in 'rhythm', and does so in the second half of Book II. However, early on in Book III, the pace goes down again. As an aside, the ending seems quite unlike Murakami (compare this one, for example, to the ending of A Wind-up Bird Chronicle).<br /><br />My main 'issues' with 1Q84, however, would be the following: firstly, the book's ethics. As an Amnesty International member and, well, actually, just as a human being, I am against the death sentence. However, in this book, that is administered regularly without any 'problematisation', with hardly any doubt, and almost in a George W.Bush-kind of way. The men who abuse women are one-dimensional, evil characters and there is no doubt to the mind of the heroine that they deserve to die. This raises important questions on the relation between art and ethics (e.g. can / does a novel have an ethic?), which, in turn, raise the question: is Murakami's literary fiction art or 'mere' entertainment? I would be glad to read some opinions on this question. In any case, I cannot approve of this book's underlying ethic.<br /><br />Secondly, and I believe this is the key to why many believe that Murakami, with this book, has not lived up to his fans' expectations: whereas Murakami's guiding principle has always been that of simplicity (a simplicity, however, that more often than not evolved into fantastic stories), in 1Q84 he chooses ambition. I am not sure whether this formula works for Murakami. As I think a comparison between his fictional and non-fictional work shows, Murakami has always been more of a writer than an analyst. I am not sure whether 1Q84 is meant as a social commentary, or as a work that, as one review says, seeks to encapsulate all of Japan within it, but it would be great if Murakami could go back to the individual in a sometimes confusing society, looking for love (that is my opinion, in any case), without trying to explain all of that society.<br /><br />Having said that, however, with the caveats mentioned, I still very much enjoyed reading the book.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|How do you play as the zombies? If I could figure out how,I would give this game 5+ stars. How????
140131046X|5.0|I have used this as the basis of a six-week book discussion in a couple of different church settings.  The book has always been found to be rich for discussion, powerful in its narrative, while being an easy and enjoyable read.  Great for ecumenical and interfaith dialog.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Believable story line, had its funny moments, and good action. I hope there's a second one and this wasn't just leading to Avengers, which was amazing!!
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|THIS ALBUM BY FAR IS WORSE THAN A JUSTIN BIEBER ALBUM, TOTAL TRASH, I BOUGHT THIS AS A FAVOR FOR A FRIEND AND MAN WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY ANY WHO GIVES THIS ALBUM A 2 STAR VOTE OR HIGHER IS GOT TO BE HANGING FROM WEEZYS SACK BECAUSE YOU GOTTA BE IN LOVE WITH HIM TO LIKE THIS ALBUM
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This app is similar in style and function to the cooking app. It presents a character that has a desire (apple, strawberry, wheat, etc) and the user must preform a series of actions to satisfy them. Activities include planting, weeding, killing bugs, grafting, re-potting, using a combine harvester, tilling the earth, raking leaves, harvesting fruits by hand, etc. It's a cute game that does a good job illustrating how different plants grow into the foods we enjoy and the work it takes to farm them. My 5 year old enjoys playing it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This is an amazing movie.  I feel as if Mr.Day-Lewis became Lincoln.  Excellent staging and the views of DC were artfully lighted.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|I already owned most of the songs in this CD set, but this was the only place I could find Garth's version of &#34;To Make You Feel My Love,&#34; from the &#34;Hope Floats&#34; soundtrack.  I find it sad that an artist would refuse to allow his music to be marketed with &#34;the whole package&#34; -- I only hope it was for an enlightened reason, and not just sheer greed.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|Difficult to watch at times, but brilliantly directed and acted.  An amazing performance by Ellen Burstyn in particular.  More than just a cautionary tale.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very addictive game.  I play this game everyday until I run out of hearts.  Caution, you must use a heart for every game you play.  This game can be very costly.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I love watching movies with meaning and basing this of real events made if even better.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Love, love, loved this movie. Definitely getting a copy for my collection. I would give it ten stars if I could.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game seems easy to play so far. I am enjoying the challenge of routing vehicles from one place to another in order to accomplish monetary gain, provide entertainment and keep the city clean.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Well... I have two words for ya'll, \\"Headlong Flight\\" (track #9)... Incredibly fast, stunning and brilliant single stroke chops, oh, and a amazing bridge! The entire album is a kick in the head, tracks 8-12 being my favourites. I simply CANNOT comprehend that 3 guys pushing their sixties and - WTF - 20th-ish studio LP are still touring, kicking COMPLETE a$$ and taking names - who needs water - must be Ged's Bourgogne?! I got the UK fan pack and it's the perfect homage for a 50+ former drummer (wife, kids, job, blablabla) who hasn't missed a tour since 2112!!! Hells yes, I am one of many, many PHX voices on their upcoming Blu-Ray. Can't remember the effete critic early on who dissed the album as sloppy and crushed - wadda flush texas mickey... Just buy the actual CD immediately if not sooner (not that compressed mp3 crap), and listen to it LOUD!
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I only use mine when I ride my Harley, got it last summer and used it a half dozen times worked great, then I put it away for the winter. We got some nice weather and I pulled it out yesterday, it won't take a charge, I left it plugged in all night, did the reset still nothing. Works fine when it's plugged in but the battery is useless. Shame it sounded good when it worked.

B004E10QCI|5.0|I have only watched a few of episodes of this set so far and are amazed at the content. I was worried that the remastered graphics might detract from the experience but they have managed to tread the fine line between enhancing and significantly altering the picture. But, I orginally watched these on a crappy television with blotchy color hooked to an antenna in a fringe reception area. That my have colored my opinon. The show looks amazing in 1080p.
B005SCSL56|5.0|Love this book! Bought it for my kids to read but I ended up reading it first and couldn't put it down.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies OF ALL TIME. It's a movie about science, religion, faith, love, first contact, fanaticism, politics, money, genius, and intolerance.  It's a thoughtful film that's not afraid to confront not only what it might feel like to communicate with an alien race, but whether we are mature enough to handle such an event.<br /><br />I won't describe the plot--enough reviews have done that already. Here are, however, the reasons I think you will love this movie:<br /><br />1) IT'S A THRILLING ADVENTURE STORY: There is tension present throughout this movie, some of it represented by the big questions below, but a lot of it is because of the excitement of discovery. When early on in the movie radio astronomer Ellie Arroway (Jodi Foster) receives the radio signal from outside our galaxy, the movie kicks into high gear. Not only are they hustling to clarify the message signal, but they also have to decode it to discover an amazing set of what appear to be BLUEPRINTS...but for what?<br /><br />2) IT HAS A GREAT PEDIGREE: The original book is by scientist Carl Sagan, and it went through many changes in its almost decade-long development.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis ([[ASIN:B00BB8RKH6 Flight]], [[ASIN:B0026O475M Cast Away]], [[ASIN:B0035JRVBO Forrest Gump]], and [[ASIN:B001PSGF3C Gothika]]), it has quite a cast: besides Foster, there's Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt and Angela Bassett - all in top form.<br /><br />3) IT ASKS BIG QUESTIONS: What will happen to individuals, the country, and the world, when we finally contact alien life?  Are we mature enough as a society not to go off the deep end? How will discovery of another intelligent species change our attitude about God, Heaven, and our place within His universe? How will our political system react to science issues concerning national security?<br /><br />4) IT TAKES SCIENCE AND RELIGION SERIOUSLY: It's rare that a movie, or book, treats both of these subjects with care and sincerity. While the plot includes religious zealots who are definitely there to derail any somber efforts to follow the blueprints, McConaughey's Father Palmer is portrayed with genuine intelligence. This is NOT the McConaughey who so frequently plays the stoner dude in so many movies - no, this is the sober actor who once in a while gives us the potential he in [[ASIN:B001ARNNC4 A Time to Kill]], [[ASIN:B0088C2VWC Frailty]] and [[ASIN:B008Y73940 The Lincoln Lawyer [HD]]]. His Father Palmer is an advisor to the President, and it's a role that really lends gravity to the religious side of the discovery. I'm not especially religious, but I'm open enough to have movies portray religion at its best in order to increase the seriousness of the debate.<br /><br />Note: As for drawbacks, the movie does run a little long, and there is one plot development late in the film - I won't spoil it here, but it involves a backup plan that comes out of nowhere - that defies credulity. But they're just tiny flaws in the masterpiece, as they say, and in no way hurt this terrific, wonderful, intellectual movie.e subjects with care and sincerity.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow .....this book was AMAZING . It was really detailed and kinda sad at times ..but all in all I give this book 5 stars!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is very well written. The story moves fast, the style is appealing to readers. I'm planning to get her other books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Awesomeness, but I hate the ending! I cried like ten times while reading this! It's such a great book and I can't believe it was written by goofy crash course John green
B005IQZB14|5.0|I had to force myself to put this book down to get any sleep for the few days it took to read it.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed is a wonderful writer and can make even an old lady dream about hiking the Pacific Coast Trail.

B000G0O5N2|5.0|What a great movie so true and real with the servicemen showing their true grit against an very sneaky and unrelenting enemy with weird ideas on how life should be played out in this day and age.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|Great premise. Well developed technology and universe. But the plot feels rushed. It feels like Scalzi is in a hurry to tell us a different story. I'm hopeful that the next books in the series realize that the readers' enjoyment is in the details.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This one was incredibly exciting and had me turning pages hungrily the entire time. I felt like this one moved better than the second one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I think King one of our best writers although I have read only a few of his novels since I do not have much interest in supernatural horror.  I do like time travel stories though and this one is fantastic.  King uses a great device to send his hero back and forth in time and sets a neat rule in that he always arrives at the same time resetting whatever has been accomplished in previous journeys.  He also takes his time and allows his hero to gradually integrate himself into this new society while forcing him to learn a lesson about using time travel responsibly.  The people he meets and the experiences he has help him to grow into a more caring and humble person.  The book also has several very suspenseful sequences so it was very enjoyable to see King apply his vast talent to this different genre.  A great read to be savored!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very cute game the kids love it. makes them want to go take riding lessons. they love horses and easier then getting a real one
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love the stories of kings and knights and this really gives an inside look to it. To be able to watch it on my kindle fire is even better.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|As long as you don't mind waiting for coins you would like this game very much.  But extra coins cost money. I just wait.
1936608898|5.0|This book explains the basic science behind how our bodies are supposed to work, and how the average American diet impedes that from happening. I found the book to be informative, interesting and inspiring. I started the Whole 30 while nursing 2 children, and was still able to manage eating 3 meals per day (snacking - paleo appropriate snacks - only a few days per week).  My whole family (2-year old included) is enjoying our new adventures in eating, thanks to \\"It Starts With Food!\\"
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The first half of WD was a bit slow and the writing was filled with some major cheddar, especially with the dialog betwixed the Gov and Andrea. Man O Man was that embarrassing! It finally got going in the 2nd half, and I am a big fan, having purchased and watched ALL of it in just a few days as I too am a WD head...
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I've been using it almost a month now and I really like it so far. It's just like it is on the computer screen. Much better than the limited screen from the regular Facebook mobile application.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so much fun to read.  I hope I get to read the next two books in the series some day!
B001E45XT4|3.0|I've been through probably 3 or 4 of these over the course of a couple years (they cost in the 25-30 range when I bought them). They're extremely comfortable and the sound quality is fine, but they are not very durable. Maybe I'm too rough with them, but I've had the head band break and wires come loose. I eventually decided that with how often I was replacing them I was better off spending more money on something that will last longer. If I ever found myself broke and in need of a headset, I'd probably buy them again though.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|The movies are fun, Depp is well suited to the role. The soundtrack is great in parts, but overall lacks the excitement of the film.
B0085A9J18|4.0|In my opinion this is the best martial arts movie I have seen.  The building the police team works there way through is ridiculously drab, empty, and depressing, but the movie kept my attention.  I like many parts of the soundtrack as well.
0152023984|4.0|I read Le Petit Prince en Francais a long time ago and sometimes you just want to reminisce..... so going back to read this book as an adult was a different experience.<br /><br />The story is extraordinary, I love it when authors embrace their imagination and bring it to paper. You imagine yourself in the place of this little prince, a child really, looking at the world through the eyes of wonder and bewilderment, and yearning to find answers, simple answers not complicated ones.<br /><br />Perhaps the analogies are just a little too black and white. Not all business men are counting their money all day long. They do good for the world too. And not all kingdoms were of selfish kings who wanted to rule their \\"subjects\\", and so on, but I admire the Little Prince and the story telling of Saint-Exupery. A charming little story to read for your children, or for yourself.<br /><br />Quick read. I finished it in an hour or so. Enjoy! But if you can, pick up the French (original) version.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|original star trek seems to get all the notoriety,  Next generation is a forgotten jewel with great cast chemistry and excellent story telling/writing
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|We wanted to like this movie. Our kid loves the big cats. This movie is extremely slow and boring, wont watch it again and won't recommend it to anyone. Glad we didn't buy it or see it at the theater. The only redeeming factor is that there wasn't any smut, no immoral issues to deal with, just boredom.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I found myself caring about the characters while deploring their low moral standards.some of the plot twists are implausible but the momentum kept me entertained .
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really loved this book, if you're looking for a typical Nicholas Sparks love novel this is a good one. However if you're expecting something new you'll probably be disappointed as this is a very easy book to know whats going to happen before it does. Overall it's an easy read and worth the time if your interested!

B004478AS4|5.0|Achebe expertly uses the Greek &#34;Tragic Hero Archetype&#34; in an African Colonial setting. While at first, seemingly one-sided, Achebe tackles both sides of colonialism--the good and the bad, while spinning an entrancing plot
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really think the author of the book lost her way about 4 chapters from the end, as it seems she is almost meandering around hoping a good ending will come to her, but eventually giving up,  Disappointing after being such a great read to that point.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book is a wonderful blend of disturbing and beautiful.  I was completely enchanted with the meanings of each flower and was overwhelmed by the depiction of birth and motherhood.  This is definitely a worthwhile read.
B0055JPM6I|5.0|Not a serious movie, but very funny and over the top.  Well worth the rent.  I would watch this one again, I found it that entertaining.

B009X01GJ2|4.0|I bought this for my wife since she wanted a cover with color.  The leather is nice and the case does a good job of protecting the tablet.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|I guess if you don't like this band, don't get the album (obviously).  The sound is good and I love 5FDP so I am completely satisfied.
0525478817|4.0|First things, first.  I'm not an established fan of John Green.  Just a reader who bought the book on the recommendation of all the excited reviews.  Read it in a day, and I liked it.  Appreciated the writer's craft a bit more than the story.<br /><br />There's not a ton of story here.  Two sick kids enjoy a meaningful transformative romance, adding more depth to their doomed lives.  Tragic, pretty, honest, moving.  Not a ton of surprises.<br /><br />John Green is a talented writer.  You'll enjoy the author's craft.  As most chapters ended, I found myself thinking, \\"Well done, John.\\" He did an excellent job choosing words, creating rhythm, evoking emotion.  He captured both Amsterdam and Indianapolis (the two settings for the story) very well.  He makes you feel both the hope and the fear, mixing constantly on nearly every page.<br /><br />The age of the characters felt about three years off.  Instead of 16/17, they should have been 20. In fact, the author makes a point of making the teenage narrator an academically-advanced college student, although we never quite understand why she's taking classes. It was almost as if the author was apologizing to us for having to make these characters four years younger than they should have been. Or, perhaps the author likes using college education as a hope mechanism.<br /><br />The author's portrayal of the perspective of young people with cancer felt incredibly authentic.  Every cynical view felt real.  The book holds you accountable for every dumb thing you've ever said, thought, or assumed about kids with cancer.  Hazel's use of her \\"sick kid with cancer's Wish\\" was brilliant.<br /><br />If I had one criticism, it's the same one I had after reading PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER.  The book feels written for the inevitable movie.  The teenage romance at the center of the story is very sweet, and of course, the author makes you love the object of the narrator's affection.  Why Augustus had to be \\"hot\\" escapes me (do we feel more sorry for good looking kids with cancer?).  I guess it's a Team Edward thing... a tragic teenage boy with a hot body resonates more?  Nothing difficult to film here - funny scenes, emotional moments, flawed-yet-noble parents, supporting characters with funny lines, and lots of dialogue that will easily transfer to the screen.  I suppose that's what most writers have in mind these days.  Augustus will make a lovely launching point for the next Zac Efron - every young actor is going to want to be the hot, cool, sensitive, poetic boy with cancer. The young male actor who nails the Isaac role will also do well as the funny, not-as-hot-as-the-main-actor actor. Agents' careers will be made and ruined according to who lands these roles. (Note to young actress, Shailene Woodley - please go more Jennifer Lawrence than Kristen Stewart in this role if you want to stand up next to your inevitably glowing co-star.)<br /><br />Oh yeah, back to the book. My advice is that it's a good read. Hardly my favorite of the year, but a good use of a lazy Saturday.  You'll feel more sensitive for having read it, you'll appreciate good writing, and you'll look forward to the soundtrack.  Personally, I look forward to the day John Green writes a more audacious adult story without an eye so keenly trained on the film option.e sorry for good looking kids with cancer?).

B009GJBBDQ|4.0|I'm a Bond fan from the beginning!<br />I always love the action in this movie. The women, good or bad!<br />The always evil/sinister bad guy! The currency of where the bad guys are coming from(Country).The final confrontation between Bond & the bad guy. Bond takes his lumps, but almost always wins in the end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a lot of fun.  It's not mindless bubble-popping; you have to actually pay attention and think to unlock all the hidden treasures!
