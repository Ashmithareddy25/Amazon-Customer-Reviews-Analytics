B005S9EK1S|3.0|The movie was good. The quality of the blu ray was good. However, the order was incomplete because there was nothing related to an UltraViolet Digital Copy included in what was delivered. The Blue Ray case and the disk are labeled \\"Rental\\".
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Rodriquez is an amazingly talented musician.  I really love this album and I think everyone should listen to it, as well as his other one!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What a splendid film adaptation of the beloved musical!<br /><br />To my (very moist) eyes, it works as well -- and perhaps even better -- on a small screen than it did in theaters, thanks to the abundant closeups on the actors.<br /><br />And what a moving experience...  Anne Hathaway certainly deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work as Fantine.  If there was another performance last year as impacting, considering the brevity of her appearance onscreen here, I would like to know what it was.<br /><br />Other standouts in the cast include Hugh Jackman, of course, as Jean Valjean, plus fresh faces Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks from the London theater cast as Eponine.<br /><br />Then there is Russell Crowe as Javert.  His singing is rather painful, but then I suppose gendarmes are not known for their way with a melody.  Crowe is otherwise well cast as the resolute policeman.<br /><br />The only slight negative I might cite with this production is the sonic flatness of the musical score.  This is not a problem with the DVD; I noticed it as well in the theater.  For some reason, the orchestra doesn't sound rich and full; it sounds rather thin and compressed.  I don't know if the sound engineer was going for a restrained effect to match the miseries of the characters, but fans of this glorious music may be underwhelmed.<br /><br />Otherwise I'm happy to report that despite the length of the movie, the DVD includes some fine extras, including features on the cast, the sets, Victor Hugo and the novel, plus director's commentary with Tom Hooper.<br /><br />So vive la revolution -- and this classic adaptation of Les Mis.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I can relate Nikki and her crew to the TV show Castle. Really enjoyed this book. Will probably get another one!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|One of the best reads out there on Kindle.  It's heart-breaking tale in parts, absolutely laugh out loud in others.  A tale of a simple man with a hard life that finds what he wanted most in the end.  Very enjoyable book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a great game and it is fun for everyone all ages GET IT NOW it is really awesome
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It's really good.  It would probably be a good &#34;beach&#34; book as you could pick up again after multiple interruptions.

B008F5YDRI|5.0|&#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; turned out to be far more of a gem than I imagined.  Ewan McGregor, Amr Waked, and Emily Blunt were all excellent, and the scenery was beautiful.  Wonderful movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great app. Awesome music. Nice plot. The screens can be too dark at times. There are paid stuffs on here but nothing too bad.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of the old days. Really easy to figure out how to play, which figures to shoot and which ones are good for you.Music and sounds can be turned off iff too annoying in crowds but I like them when alone.

B004P1JEWU|5.0|I finished this book just in time for sason 3 of the show to air. It was incredibly intense. I made audible sounds of shock and awe all through the book, probably severely annoying my wife. It went from strength to strength and is well worth the read.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I did not read.book prior to seeing  the movie. The movie presentation and screen play is what you expect from a N. Sparks novel. If you are a fan of the author as I am you will not be disappointed. DEW
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game I play it for hours.  I COMPETE won't my mom, so far I am<br />winning.  Some times I play hers to to help her out.  The game needs more competitive games as you advance in levels.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|very good accessory for the gopro (and nicely compatible with hero2). i would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />cons: hard to view in the sun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! I recomend for both Nicholas Sparks fans AND people who dont read Nicholas Sparks. He is an amazing author and this my all time FAVORITE book!!!! I loved it and i know you will too!
1433209551|3.0|I think that the actual reading of the story (in other words the person who reads it) is more important than the story itself. If you have a hard time believing the voice it kind of ruins the story. In Northanger Abbey I think that the reader sounds too old. The heroine of the book is supposed to be a very young and inexperienced girl so it makes a difference. Also the book is actually funny but it doesn't come off that way with this reading.
B00BSBVLF8|1.0|Perhaps the cultural values don't translate. Kids had the same reaction. Was not able to finish it. Maybe we're just not circus people.

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Watched this with my 9 y/o son and 5 y/o daughter and we all loved it.  Great characters and well written story.  Has some great funny moments and my kids cheered at the ending.
B000IZC7WG|1.0|This movie was not as cohesive or really as interesting as I had hoped.  There is room for more plot and character development.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|It was not what I expected, a total waste of money. I am glad I only rented the movie and did not buy the movie.
B0095R64AO|3.0|This was a cute movie.  I think it was better as a rental than going to the theater, but well done for the genre.
0307959856|3.0|Gave it as a gift.<br />The reviews were pretty good. I would like to read it myself.<br />Hoping the receiver will pass it back.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I just lost my 7-year-old daughter to Type 1 diabetes in January, and my dad, who is a chaplain, mentioned this book. I was reluctant to read it at first because I, like so many others, was a skeptic. I have been a preacher's daughter all of my life and did not want to hear about any of it. But Dr. Alexander tells his story in a completely believable and scientific fashion, such that anyone who is a skeptic can't ignore his experiences. He describes his journey in such a compelling way, I read through the book in 2 days.<br /><br />I'm comforted that my daughter's spirit is in the beautiful, peaceful place that Dr. Alexander describes. If you're on the fence, read this. It may change your life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is fun and easy I recommend it for templel run users ages 9-14 it is just soooooo fun and the boards are solo cool.
0307270807|5.0|Michael Herr's book, Dispatches, is a powerful literary work with its journalistic documentary immediacy, its emotional impact, and its historic implications.  It speaks of the bravery and irony and ability to deal with absurdity that is so characteristic of America's young men. It  tell of the idiocy when tremendous resources are put into place with little insight into history, culture, human nature, and the ability of ideology to blind leaders so that they ignore reality. Herr's writing style is testosterone-driven, machine-gun paced with clipped character studies of the many men he met in combat.<br /><br />Of course this is what I got from this book but I came to these conclusions from reading the realistic, earthy, often crude and rough, experiences of front line Marines as they experienced events beyond their control and often beyond comprehension.<br />This book is gutsy and gives a gritty description of the conditions that our young men faced in a poorly led war. Blood, wounds, filth, anger, violence, irrationality, sex, and poverty are often ugly and messy and Herr does not shy away from straight-forward narration of these all too human conditions. Herr focuses on the soldiers on the front lines and gives a very real description of wartime. Herr's heart is with the soldiers and this shows in every description and event in the books. By giving the nitty-gritty details of life in wartime he becomes a defender and advocate for those young 19 year olds who underwent this ordeal.<br />When the enemy can disappear into the forests and crowds and homes of the South Vietnamese, when the primary style of warfare is guerrilla warfare, then increased firepower and destruction is counter productive and bound for defeat. The Vietcong controlled the underground world of tunnels and caves whereas the United States controlled the air with our tremendous war machine. When we protect people by destroying their villages, fields, and forests we should not be surprised when they support the enemy. When entire forests and rice fields are destroyed so that the `enemy' has no cover, the war is lost, for those whom we claim to protect have now joined forces with the enemy. The US Forces had a slogan \\"Only you can prevention forests\\" that displays the irony these men felt at destroying a country to save it. Entire Vietcong units were supposedly destroyed only to appear in a matter of days elsewhere. Herr relates that whereas we were suppose to be supporting the South Vietnam government, that the corrupt bribe-hungry government could hardly maintain a police force in Saigon. As Herr says, all this means is that the country could not be saved, only destroyed.<br />Herr's observations on racial relationships and tensions are fascinating. He relates how black and white soldiers supported each other in the field under hardships. He also relates what a blow the death of Martin Luther King Jr. was to the black servicemen. Herr does a great job of revealing the strength and patience of black servicemen who were fighting for their country in Vietnam.<br />The chapter on the Khe Sanh base is the most focused narrative work in the book. There is a sense of paranoia as the trapped Marines wait for the assault of the Vietcong upon the base. Herr relates how the American command appeared to be implementing a strategy to draw out the Vietcong to mass troops around Khe Sanh to repeat their strategy against the French in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.  However, by concentrating their forces around Khe Sanh, they offered a better target for American airpower. However the Marines felt out-numbered and completely surrounded as they endured the most brutal artillery barrage of the war. The evacuation roads were completely under the control of the Vietcong and the monsoon season had 6 more weeks to run making retreat much more difficult.  Herr relates the considerable tensions that grew as the confrontation built up and reports of increased but unseen Vietcong troopsincreased. He is at his best as he relates the effects of this tension upon the front line soldiers.<br />The chapter on the war correspondents is also first class literature. Herr doesn't respect all his colleagues by any means since some took the easy way out and reported only what General Westmoreland and his staff wished reported back to US citizens. Many officers felt that Westmoreland made a critical error in allowing so many correspondents to observe the war and report back their observations to an American public that had cognitive dissonance trying to interpret the chaos and horror. However he does observe that the bravest correspondents tended to be the most compassionate. I found the sections on photographer Sean Flynn, son of actor Errol Flynn, to be an interesting observation of the role of the correspondent under war conditions.<br />Herr conveys the sense of the time with the mix of contemporary culture that the young Marines experienced including the works of Jim Morrison and the Doors, Jimmy Hendrix, and others. The cultural context of the war and times permeated both the United States and Vietnam and Herr captures this background perfectly. I would end this review with one image and one quotation. Herr relates how after a village that was deemed to be sympathetic to the Vietcong was destroyed, a Vietnamese man holds his dead baby girl in his outstretched arms in the road as the Americans pass. He says nothing; he just looks into their faces and holds up the dead baby for them to see as they drive by. Herr says: \\"Those who remember the past are condemned to repeat it too, that is a little history joke.\\"
0807014273|3.0|Frankl's message is well-told, and he certainly doesn't believe in suffering from victimhood.  His views are refreshingly positive about the importance of establishing a life that has meaning in a non-materialistic sense.  I would have rated the book higher if he hadn't advertised his own theories quite so much, but he does state that he was criticized in the past for not explaining his plan in more detail.  It's a good book and gives the reader some deep things to think about.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have heard these songs on this album and I like it very much will listen to it when ever I can
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's an awesome book, great fantasy story and characters building is deep and complete. I will read his other books too.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Friend of mine recommended this on facebook, and I'm really glad they did.  Read it through, enjoyed all the science, how the main character had to work through everything, pretty much the hard way.  Great read!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A unique story that was very entertaining. A story of triumph. I would watch this movie again and would recommend it to others.
B000002AGN|4.0|Being of &#34;age&#34;, I remember when &#34;Take Five&#34; came out and I loved it then, and I love it now.  It also reminded me of when, where, who and how I was at that time.  I'm not tellling.....giggle
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I watched it because I was told it was a great movie. It was way too predictable, the acting mediocre, and the ending a foregone conclusion. I would not pay money to watch this movie.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I was leary of adding another series to my already crowded life, but I took a chance, drawn to the story line and the lineup of actors. So glad I did! This tale is chilling...absolutely for anyone wh is fascinated by what makes serial killers tick. A rewarding mystery thriller.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am a huge fan of Downton. I wanted to catch up on all the seasons so i bought this series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it!You have to get this game. I love horses now!You will too if you get this game. It is awesome!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Was very enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this movie to other people to watch. I would have like to see the movie in English. But I still enjoy the movie
B002P79KAC|5.0|So funny. My entire family from my 9 year old, to my quirky 13 year, my 16 year old daughter, husband and myself love this show!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I got this game to entertained my 4 year old and now find myself playing just as much as her. Easy to use. Grate as a time filler.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot twists and turns, going in unexpected directions. You keep thinking you know which direction the plot is going, then it makes an unexpected turn, and you find yourself going in another direction.  The ending is completely satisfying.  Great read, especially for those who enjoy poetic justice.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Totally addicting!  I started out watching this show on Netflix and got completley hooked!  Anyone who sits down to watch this show will not regret it!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to pick it back up.  Suspenseful, riveting, entertaining, murder mystery with lots of twists & turns.  Loved every bit-a real page turner.
B003SQVI54|5.0|Of course, I look nothing like Courtney Cox; however, I was single again at 40.  It hits home at the double standards between single, over 40 males and single, over 40 females.  A little tongue in cheek at times; but it is funny.  Can't wait to complete this series and catch up to what is on TV.  And really glad it was picked up by another network; because it is a good show.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|It Always has a new twist.  I.m only sorry that it ended.  I especially like the variety of crew selection.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|A good kid movie.  Characters are great for children, without being preachy.  3D quality was good.  My eight year old enjoyed it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Would highly recommend watching all three seasons of Downton Abbey. The actors are terrific and it has a very good story.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|Beautifully written about a difficult subject. Though the backdrop is facinating and foreign, the characters and their lives are universal.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app does just what it says it does. Works great... we use it almost every night. Well worth the money vs. buying a white-noise sound machine.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This seems to be a fairly simple game but I think it can be a bit more challenging if  you want to make it so. It is fun to just play with it and relax.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a fun game. My daughter downloaded it and got me hooked. It's fun trying to figure out what the others are drawing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey writing style kept me interested in the many characters. Loved the plot of a post-apocalyptic time. Great read.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I like this movie. Love can be elusive and change can be hard. Finding love in all the unexpected places is what makes life interesting.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Have not yet finished the book but I am loving it! The style of writing is perfect for this topic. I feel the author has a good sense of each character's reality and I look forward to more from her.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I'm a sucker for romance, and this is your typical romantic book, but I loved it! I would reccomend it to anybody looking for a great story with a happily ever after ending and the right amount of twists to make it stand out from the rest in its class.
B007MAETA8|5.0|After reading about John's recent health issues I decided to check out his music. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. I'm an old rock and  roller so most of today's music is lost on me. But not John Mayer. Love his album and will check out his previous work.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very interesting & would seem to be a very well balanced description of all of the Presidents. I would strongly recommend to anyone with an interest in history & politics.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|We purchased this case and used it for 2 months and the case cracked and the corner broke off.  I contacted Lifeproof to exchange the case and was informed the case was not a Lifeproof product!!  There is a serial number on the inside of the front and back cover and that is how they could tell if the product was legitimate.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!
B007TK77QE|3.0|Not a book I would recommend to anyone but all that I can say is that J K Rowling is a very accomplished author & I suspect could write any sort of novel on any subject.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was like having an actual conversation.<br />I loved reading this book. I would recommend it to people who love thrillers
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Keeps you occupied and I like having to beat your previous score...usually get bored quickly and I don't when playing this app
B00BMR5HOO|1.0|I gave this app one star because I was unable to make this app work. I removed it from my device.
B005FISC52|5.0|This gives a wonderful way to end a story that has kept me interested for years. With it didn't end
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It has great graphics and takes a little bit of time to load up but other than that its good.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This Hendix album has some new jazzy stuff on it that just kicks ass. You will understand where Stevie Ray got his stuff from. The bass lines and quality is superb.
B002S45V32|5.0|Exactly what I remember from when I watched it when I was a teenager!! My daughter and son  really enjoyed it!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable read.  This book is a departure from the usual cast of characters and Baldacci proved himself, once again, a master of his craft combining suspense, action and tenderness. Kudos David.  Cannot wait for the next one.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I was totally drawn into the book as I was reading.  This is the first of Dennis Lehane's books that I've read, but it will not be the only one that I will read.  Shutter Island provides a continual suspenseful hold on you and you cannot wait to see what is going to happen next.  I totally recommend the book to anyone who likes suspense reading.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well, my 8 year old grandson purchased this for himself and his 10 year old brother...yes, I said it was okay with me.  I personally like it because it keeps them busy for a few minutes.  Might I add A FEW MINUTES.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great acting. Lots of suspense. Denzel washington is at his best in this movie. It is very real due to what I have seen as an alcoholic.
B0000256HE|5.0|This is the best of the best in my opinion? Awesome  guitar lick and horn rips or so mezmerizing...a must have
B001XCWPAM|5.0|For those wondering if these discs work in North America (these are the international version, hence the much lower price), they work perfectly for me (I have a Panasonic Blu-Ray player).<br /><br />I love the Bourne flicks, and having them on Blu-Ray is great. Picture quality is incredible and the sound is clean and clear.<br /><br />If you don't like Bourne films, why are you looking at this at all?
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I had to download this a couple of times but I love to play this game.  It is easy to play and a great way to spend time just to relax.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I would recommend this movie to any James Bond fans! The music soundtrack is awesome. James Craig and Adele totally rocked this movie!
B00BF11STU|2.0|The eventual payoff at the end is not worth the two hours of sheer boredom it takes to get there.  Would have made a decent, but not great 90 minute movie. Slowest movie I have ever seen.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was shocked at my own reaction to this book. As it embodies a concept that I have never found any interest in, I did not expect to find it so mesmerizing. The ending was not what I expected and I am eager to engage myself in the next part of the trilogy. James certainly knows how to leave the reader craving more. Well done!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Transports you to a different era with fascinating characters.  Superb acting and well written story lines and dialogue. Caution--highly addictive.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great story.different ,interesting and didn't want to stop reading it.I can't wait for more. My favorite character was the assassin.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|This album it's not as good as the previous one but, I am glad Justin is back to kill it!
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a decent game if you have the time to wait around for energy to replenish or you have loads of money to buy diamonds
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I find it interesting and challenging. Without the hints I think it would be nearly impossible. Would love to see the other mystery case files games in kindle tablet edition.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|its a fun game but they should have the coins when you collect them they give you 5 not just 1 so you can buy thing faster overall a good game
B0053O89IS|4.0|The product was good but the day before I bought it, it was cheaper. I guess thats what happens when you wait.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Entertaining in a bazaar kind of way.  Not as good as X Files but I like it nevertheless. I will continue to watch it.  I really like Walter.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I've been trying to find a slender man game for a Mobile device so I was looking and found this and it's basically the something as eight pages or slender man shadows but it's kinda easy to find the pages untill seven pages
B00BMVTTJ4|1.0|For the amount of money one pays nowadays it was getting expensive to go to the movies. I believe they've caught on to those that no longer frequent movie theatre's by gouging us for substandard films that are now a 2 part series. Peter Jackson could've worked with Martin Freeman a lot harder because he was simply not as convincing as the likes of Ian Holm.<br /><br />Peter Jackson needs to redeem himself in the second part of this film by getting Martin Freeman to live up to how the character truly be portrayed. In my view he spent way too much time off the set based on the additional blogs he added for this movie.<br /><br />A galactic mistake - Peter Jackson needs to re-make the character of Bilbo and Martin Freeman needs a wake up call....
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Pretty good compared to many of the prequels out there. Definitely a good addition to the series. I hope James adds more to the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a really fun game good for all ages and even. if you are not a horse person. love it
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's a great why to stay in touch with your friends. especially if they live far from you or if you just need to talk.
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Get it if you love the blues. Charlie Musselwhite is a legend. Ben Harper is a great talent. Give it a listen
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This was a great series and sadly underappreciated by the greater audience.  If SciFi channel hadn't gone off the deep end with wrestling (WTF?) and fake ghost hunters they could have picked this show up for a 5+ year run. It was gritty and gripping with all the action and drama of Battelstar Galactica, Stargate, and other recent hits.  Watch this show.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Having not seen the movie, I enjoyed the book.  However, I already had an idea of what was going to happen.  It was fairly predictable.  Still, it was worth reading!
B005LAIHR2|2.0|When I heard that the musical \\"Rock of Ages\\" was being made into a film starring Tom Cruise, among other unlikely people such as Alec Baldwin and Catherine Zeta-Jones, I had to laugh. Watching it last night  didn't make me want to laugh, it made me want to vomit. The Tom Cruise character, Stacee Jaxx, was such a bad performance on his part, he made me cringe every time he grabbed a passing breast with that psycho look in his eyes and that odd head tilt. There are so many other actual rock artists that could have played that roll and been so much better. Cruise is just too wimpy to play a sex fiend rocker. It was just embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />**Sorta Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />The whole thing with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand was ridiculous and laughable. Malin Akerman as the Rolling Stone reporter and her whole scene with Jaxx was both laughable and sad at the same time but not for the reasons that you would think, with them both being lonely. It was because Tom Cruise was just plain bad in that role. All his licking (\\"Open your mouth\\") and groping and wierd spaced out looks were just too much. The whole movie just seemed contrived and thrown together to be the background to a great line-up of songs from the 80's.<br /><br />To me, this movie is to rock and roll as Showgirls was to actual showgirls in Vegas. It was a waste of time that I'll never get back and just proves that Cruise tries way too hard to be a \\"serious\\" or \\"comedic\\" actor, which ever he was going for. Russell Brand I can watch any time in almost any of his movies, he's always a riot. In fact, skip this one and watch \\"Get Him to the Greek\\" instead. He plays a much better rock star than Cruise ever could.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones just plays a bitch once again and way too good, kinda makes you wonder if it's a natural state or what. The love story between Hough and Boneta gets pushed to the back and it's way too sappy anyway. I say all this and I'm a female and love \\"chick flix\\". Thisdid nothing for me but make me want to shower after it was over to wash away the feeling of slime.<br /><br />Rock of Ages is on my list as one of the worst films in a long time. I can't get the image of Stacee Jaxx out of my head, he was just way too creepy and what was with his pet monkey, \\"Hey Man\\"? A nod to Michael Jackson and Bubbles? The Bourbon Room was a poor imitation at best of the world famous Whiskey-A-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip. Having been there many times and seen some fantastic bands, this just made my skin crawl! Just my POV. I'll give it 2 stars because of the music.
B008N9AASC|5.0|My highest rating for this breathtaking epic, a dramatic portrait of humanity at its most sublime and its most degraded. Some of it might disturb the faint of heart, such as the images of slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. I agree with a previous reviewer that the section featuring a contemporary performance artist strikes a false note, too, through no fault of the performer. Still, the patience and art and love that went into this work make you feel like you can practically breathe the air and the physical sensations the film makers capture in all the different countries and landscapes they visit, and it stays with you. Samsara turns travelogue style into a transcendent work, and does so without using a single word of dialogue.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Extremely fun brain challenge. Have to be quick with your fingers, understand process improvement, lag and lead time, and most importantly - memory. Definitely not an easy game, but that's why i keep returning for more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is great entertainment, good for teens to adults anyone that likes science fiction will enjoy this one. Can not wait to see where it ends up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is like no other show on TV.  The best.  I hate to see the season end but at least Game of Thrones is starting back.  And Daryl is omg hot!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an great app. It is even better than the original. There are many more extras to the running - including zip lines!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this little guy.<br />I like the memory feature that saves your last computations.<br />Get it now! There's also a calculator for fractions but I'll save that for another review.
B005HEF8OC|3.0|Overall, this show had a very slow begging. As the season progressed the show became more interesting. This show is good for anyone that wants to know the back story of Starfleet, but if one is not interested don't watch it. Also, in the episode \\"Detained\\" there is a Quantum Leap reunion of Scot Bakula (Sam Beckett) and Dean Stockwell (Admiral Al Calavici).
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really like this game. Heard about it via app of the day. It keeps my attention. Challenging but not so bad. Passes the time away gently. Great game.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|The book was great<br /><br />  Best book in the world  epic awesome great amazing fun best easy to read  from  Evan
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was told by friends that this was my style of TV.  They were absolutely right!  What a piece of quality film.  The background, the story and of course the characters themselves.  The actors are well suited to their characters too.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very Very Very Addictive this one game you do not want to put down. The creator of this game is a very brilliant person.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You have to use logic which is fun to me.  Work well with my Kindle.  Wish there were more levels.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|Too much thinking. Like a game that I don't have to put too much thought into.Just like to sit and play.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun.  Has several different types of games in one.  I like the classic the best.  Works well with my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game love it. Great graphics and keeps the kids entertained all day. I would recomend to all my friend especially horse lovers
B00BK5D95C|5.0|After listening to Breezeblocks a few times on YouTube, I discovered streaming online and listened to this album over and over every day for a week at work. There is so much variety in one album that I never get bored of the sounds. I had to buy it so I could have it in the car and everywhere else.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It is an great book. I think the people who will read this, they will love it. It also very funny.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|good way to kill time when boredom is moving in, easy to<br />operate and is entertaining. enjoyable game with no real<br />purpose.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|There isn't much to say here about this cinematic masterpiece of the ages that really never fades it its craft and character. The Blu Ray although not perfect, takes the movie to a new level of clarity. If you do not own a copy of this movie I strongly suggest you pick this up. If you have the DVD already, you might be OK, but I enjoyed the change over.
B005OP7162|5.0|Revenge is a great show. the ideas the writer wright in for her is simply amazing. she was a strong woman and did what she had to do to gain an idea of the past.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|A little boring. I want to put it down and find something that moves faster. It needs a help button. I get stuck on a level and have to skip over that level. Can't learn if you skip over a level.<br /> Geat for a teaching tool.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I started playing this game yesterday, and I am extremely addicted to this game. I didn't even want yo stop and eat. if u like the hidden objects games,  ur gonna love this one.
B00A77II0U|5.0|LOTS OF FUN WORKS GREAT ON KINDLE FIRE HD. ALSO LIKED THEATRE OF THE BIZARRE AND ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHERE THE SEASONS CHANGE WHILE YOU EXPLORE THE ISLAND. CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME.  LOL
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great wrap up to a great series.  Kudos to Ms. Collins!  Once more, I couldn't put it down!  There was one quote by Plutarch that I found particularly appropriate to this world we live in.  &#34;Now that we're in that sweet period, where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated. . . But collective thinking is usually short-lived.  We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self destruction.&#34;  There was a time when I would have thought that thinking so pessimistic and jaded, but not anymore.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, it,s a lot of fun for me and my family. I can play this game all day long.
B005H9B44A|2.0|The movie is good, but you can't watch it in the TV. Amazon has not app for that.<br />So you can watch it in other devices like ipad.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its very good<br /><br />High v if chug :/ c hi bc Chung viewed boots Chung chug crying fan boo boo boo boo boo boo crying richer d goin control
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun, and kid and family.friendly! My 5five year old love's it, I love it. It is fantastic!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the series and the price was right.  Discs were in great condition, original packaging.  Will watch them over and over again.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I couldn't have been more pleased with this movie. It was very intense, it held my attention the whole time. Kudo's to Ben Affleck.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I gave it two stars instead of one because the CGA was incredible.  But the movie itself was awful.  Long, slow and boring.  One hour of \\"I'm really afraid of the tiger.\\"  That's not an exaggeration.  One.  Hour.  And nothing happens.  In fact, little happens in the movie from beginning to end.  Avoid at all costs.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is filled with romance, mystery, adventure, disgust, humor, anger and much more. It is educational to watch the proper English and their customs. We are so hooked on it and anxiously wait  for the next episode.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This is a movie where there is no hero, and where very little, if anything every happens.  There is no point to the movie, though the acting is great, the sets are fabulous, as are the costumes and the lighting.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think temple run 2 is way better :-( sorry its way better than this game but I still like it
1449410243|4.0|One of the more amusing/interesting web comics these days is The Oatmeal, written by Matthew Inman. Although raw and crude at times, he has a unique sense of humor that doesn't pull punches when it comes to skewering those who deserve it. How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You is a compilation of some of his cat-related cartoons, along with (I think) some original material. If you like The Oatmeal, this is a fun read... especially if you haven't been a long-time follower of the online site. If you've followed The Oatmeal for any length of time, you'll probably have seen some of this material in the past. Either way, expect about 30 minutes or so of entertainment, as it's not an overly long book. If you keep your expectations in check, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed
B006LSZECO|4.0|I just finished reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  I thought I knew what the story was, then it developed in a whole different direction!  Very good writing, had me on edge until the end, which was rather abrupt and disappointing for me.  I would definitely recommend this, an excellent read!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'm amazed that applications like this are so inexpensive compared to office suites for the PC (other than open source)
B00BESKTMG|3.0|this movie brought back a lot of happy times of when I was 13 back in the 70 and karate movies were it.
0452295548|5.0|The book was in excellent condition and arrived sooner than expected.<br /><br />This book gave wonderful insight into the &#34;workings&#34; of the brain and how we can all benefit from the author's experience with her own stroke.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Although the graphics are great and it's fun to play, the app can stop working for no reason. The app automatically upgrades and my son was so far in the game but after the upgrade, it would never reload but jump back out of it. We had just purchased lots of packs to play. My daughter's game went exactly the same but hers was on an ipod. Same scenerio. We could redownload the games but all levels are lost. We now just have it on my Kindle fire HD and when it messes up on it, we won't redownload it. Just a glich of the app but very frustrating for the user. When it's working, it is a very enjoyable game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best shows out there! I just hate having to wait so long in between seasons, but its totally worth it!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I'm sure it's all been said before - From the acting, directing, writing, special effects, EVERYTHING - this is an excellent version of the story.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This is the first season with Matt Smith as the doctor.  David Tenant is tough act to follow but I think Matt Smith does an extraordinary job portraying the doctor.  He is funny, compassionate, awesome, and just plain goofy sometimes.<br /><br />The story line is also top notch.  This season has a very intriguing and fun story arch that is carried through out the season.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|cudos to helen hunt for immersing and exposing herself so completely in this true story of triumph over pity. an amazing film that manages not to be sappy while honoring the reality of iron lung dependency. also nice to see three 'deadwood' actors (dan, calamity jane, sol star) moving on other work. great job!
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|This is without question Bowie's best release since 1980's \\"Scary Monsters\\".  The only other release that comes close is \\"Heathen\\" but \\"The Next Day\\" is a slightly better release in my opinion.  \\"Stars (are out tonight\\") and \\"You feel so lonely you could die\\" are easily two of the best songs Bowie has ever recorded, period.  I love those songs and can listen to them on constant repeat in my cd player.  \\"You feel so lonely you could die\\" reminds me vintage Bowie with tips of his hat to the \\"Ziggy\\" and \\"Station to Station\\" period.  It even reminded me a bit of Morrissey circa \\"You are the quarry\\" period with its beautiful, lush production.  This is easily one of my top ten Bowie songs of all time, and that's pretty amazing when you consider the sheer volume of work Bowie has recorded.  \\"Where are we now?\\", \\"Dirty Boys\\" and \\"Heat\\" are also very good songs too.  \\"You will set the world on fire\\" is the other track I enjoy, but it isn't quite as memorable as these other tracks.<br /><br />I would agree with some review that certain other tracks aren't particularly noteworthy.  For that reason, I won't give this 5 stars.  His last 5 star release was \\"Scary Monsters\\" but this release definitely deserves 4 stars with several outstanding tracks.  This is a very solid release and a most welcome addition to the Bowie catalogue. Great production from Tony Visconti.  Also very nice to see two of my favorite musicians David Torn and Tony Levin playing on this release.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|While the storyline was touching, it was also based on reality and portrayed elegantly. When a film can blend humor with the guts of an actual season in time, then match it with artistic film making I'm all in.
B002OQT928|5.0|There was a lot if action! Typical Ice age Highlarity. Great movie for the whole family! Laugh out loud movie.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This works just like the high priced name brand cables.  if you need a basic cable, go ahead and purchase this instead of spending all that money.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is one of the  fun games I have ever played.<br />There are only a couple of changes I would have made to this game.Like the characters cost so much.
B000FA675C|5.0|With any Dan brown book you can expect wonderful suspense, breathtaking details about REAL monuments. That's the best part in all of his book he does such a fantastic job at bringing to life the locations in his book. The story lines are always great and you are always left wanting more! This story is no exception, this novel is the second in the Langdon story line but the first I read. Give it a try, I'm sure you will fall in love just like I did
B0093X805W|1.0|This book was alright! Not the best but it's okay! It's sorta funny but the next book is amazing!! So yup!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Nice game,But will no longer will load. Then If reloaded all achievements gone have to start over again has already happened twice in a short time
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really enjoy this app, it allows me to download books from Amazon to my tablet, phone and other uses.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The characters are complex, to say the least, but everyone in this book is a narcissist.  Hard to like any of this characters but that was the point.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is also a fun way to pass time by on a road trip to California or even more I love it
B004ASNG04|5.0|Not usually a history buff but this book enthralled me.  For the first time I have a great conceptual picture of ancient and modern history from an extremely top down point of view.  I must say i agree with the authors assessment of the future and the past and would recommend this book to anyone that could handle a heavy and fairly intellectual read such as this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Could not ask for a better app. It's good for ideas hair styles!! You name it they have it download it!! You won't regret it
B002CIY8EM|3.0|I am rather disappointed with this book. The author spent way too much time defending himself and his points of view. I am not saying it was not written well or anything like that. But someone buying this book is already willing to accept his premise, or at least open minded enough to consider it. I wanted more meat along with more ammunition to use against the same folks he was defending against. I find the premise this book puts forth to be feasible and therefore already know about the mainstream bias against these theories.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I work with Alzheimer's patients on a regular basis.  This book really opened my mind to the struggles of their everyday lives.  It is brilliant how it documents the patient's decline on a functional basis.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Stumbled on &#34;The Shield&#34; by accident, and now I'm hooked.  I've watched 30 episodes in the past week or so, with no end in sight.  It's not &#34;The Guiding Light,&#34; to be sure, but my dear, departed, soap opera watching mom would be proud of me.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Hard to put this book down.  You see how vulnerable and ruthless teenagers can be.  Life is short.  Talk to your teenagers/kids.
0307460444|5.0|I love this cookbook!!! I borrowed it from the library a couple of times and decided that I NEEDED this in my home! Wonderful recipes, complete with pictures (which I love to see!)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish there was weather more monsters and animals that you get more things like eggs I upper they update it.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This book kept me spellbound with all the murders and suspense.  I did not like all the crime by both parties trying to get the right man who did the murders.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I chose it because of the author.  It is boring and slow moving.  I will think twice before buying this author again.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This tells the real story of a lawyer and what he has to go through to practice law as well as help the good man and put the bad man in prison.  It has a lots of action.
0843178434|5.0|this are best books to have for any age child, they love the different people and what they do, love them, have for 20 years
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is one of the greatest apps I have ever played. My friends also enjoy it very much. The only problem I have is with the necroa virus. Amazon won't let me purchase the expansion. Every time I try it always says, &quot;There was an error while processing your purchase.&quot; I don't know whether it's Amazon or my kindle fire hd, but I want that virus bad.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|I have enjoyed all The Game of Throne series. Currantly I am reading Book 5 which I beleive is the last and still wondering how it will end. That is good as I hate it if I guess the ending! Books 1,2,and three are gripping, couldn't put them down but book 4 lost me a little bit and seemed to lose the thred. Book 5 has taken a while to make sense because of lack of explaination as to who killed who in book four. Either way it is a gripping story from a terrific immagination. Thank you Mr Martin.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Inside look at living under the KGB like conditions; even if you are high ranking government official.  Want to read the others in the trilogy some day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun it keeps me occupied you should try it. I have a horse named spiral. he is so pretty.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the product-! makes it easy to do my my daily devotions.I think it' s heinous and it it' s great for my kids too with the audio.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|Since Google Reader announced they were closing down Reader I decided to try Feedly.  Wow!  It's fantastic.  Lots of visuals but you can adjust things to your preference.  Fun!
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|I myself would have never chosen to watch this. My friend did and is is the first in the series I've seen. I didn't understand the storyline but like I said I've not seen any of the other ones.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was suspenseful and hard to put to down! The reader is able to relate to family dynamics, love story and a little mystery!
0062238868|3.0|I already had Navy SEAL Chris Kyle's memoir (American Sniper) reserved at the library when the news broke that he'd been killed by a fellow veteran. Given that I write about wounded veterans, I was fascinated by the circumstances of his death, and especially interested in what he had to say in life.<br /><br />Kyle's writing style is casual; he may be biased but it's not in-your-face. Even if you don't feel the same, you don't mind because he seems like such a decent guy. He tells it like it is without political BS. I liked that he was unapologetic about being a Christian. There's a lot of swearing etc in the military, but it doesn't mean you can't be a Christian. That's real. And it's interesting that he brought his wife's voice/thoughts into it from time to time.<br /><br />I confess that in my time crunch, I skipped over some of the military stuff in favor of the personal struggles. He's pretty matter-of-fact about them, and I found myself wishing he'd go more in-depth on the personal struggles.<br /><br />In one chapter he talks about falling into a pit and drinking all the time. He mentions a car crash (totaled his truck but he walked away without a scratch) being his wake-up call. I wanted to know more... what those demons were like \\"up close\\" and how he faced them down and crawled back out of that pit (and I'm sure he wouldn't have done it in a \\"poor me\\" style either). I suppose no one wants to relive periods like that (I sure don't) but that's what I really wanted to know, and that's what I think makes a memoir stand out. This one is OK but not a stand-out.<br /><br />But I do have to wonder about the \\"demons\\" his fellow veteran was battling that would make him take such an extreme action...
1616550414|5.0|Excelent book , i recomended a lot !!! for those Zelda fans that hasn't read it , please do It !!

B0036TGSR6|5.0|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" (starring Ewan McGregor, not to be confused with \\"Ghost Writer\\" starring David Boreanaz) is one of those films that as soon as you reach the end of it, you immediately want to go back and watch it again, knowing what you know now.  And if you do, you'll find that this film contains some incredibly powerful and extremely subtle acting, especially from Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, and Tom Wilkinson.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that the film seems completely credible when you view it the first time, and then becomes even more powerful upon viewing it a second time - all thanks to the phenomenal acting.  Think of how challenging it is to an actor to know that the first time around the audience will view you one way, but the next time around they will view you another way, and both ways have to seem credible each time, but was only filmed once.  The only weak acting is Kim Cattrall's scene where she has to cry, which comes across as forced; you watch the scene and know that the only reason she's \\"crying\\" is because the script told her to at that point.  But the rest of the cast is awesome.<br /><br />There are some deficiencies in the directing and the writing: scenes shot from angles that don't make clear sense, things that could have been made clearer in dialogue, plot points that should have been elaborated on but which feel missing.  And there is some unnecessary confusion regarding \\"Rhinehart\\" (the publisher) and \\"Richard Rycart\\" (the Foreign Secretary) and even the ghost writer's agent, \\"Rick Ricardelli\\" (Jon Bernthal).  With 26 letters in the English alphabet you'd think less similar names could have been chosen.  Even if these were the names in the original book (\\"The Ghost\\" by Robert Harris) that doesn't mean they couldn't have been changed for a film audience's ears.<br /><br />Last but not least, a shout-out for Alexandre Desplat (\\"Harry Potter,\\" \\"Argo\\") whose score for this film sets the mood brilliantly and hauntingly.<br /><br />In short, this is an underrated film that deserves more attention than it received.  After you watch it, be sure to check out the making-of extras.  You're going to be amazed that what you thought you were seeing wasn't what you really saw!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Fine acting and direction.  Continue to want more work from this director.  Enjoyed movie even with terrible streaming quality.  Amazon sent refund without request.
159102594X|5.0|On the run from a king he once served, barbarian Logen Ninefingers finds himself in the Union's capital, aligned with Bayaz, a legendary wizard long thought dead. Meanwhile, nobleman Captain Jezal Luthar trains for The Contest, a fencing spectacle, while lusting after Ardee West, sister of one of his comrades. Inquistor Glokta, crippled former swordsman, skulks around in the darkness, torturing the answers he seeks while searching for treason at every turn. What is Bayaz planning? Will Jezal bed his best friend's sister? Will Glokta be able to outmaneuver the other inquistors?<br /><br />After reading Red Country, I had to see how it all began. I was most pleased.<br /><br />The Blade Itself reads like Terry Pratchett on the mother of all bad days. While there is a surprising amount of humor, there are also buckets of blood and gore. Abercrombie writes fantastic battle scenes and I suspect they will only get better as the series progresses.<br /><br />Anyway, the strength of The Blade Itself is in the characters. While many of them fit standard fantasy archetypes, they also are far from typical. Logen Ninefingers is a barbarian that spends a lot of time thinking and being scared, guilty of a hundred atrocities. Bayaz is an ages-old wizard that looks like a blacksmith. Inquistor Glokta seems like a pretty reprehensible torturer and guardsman at first glance but there is a lot more to him than meets the eye. Jezal is a great swordsman but also a snobbish bastard. I'm also very interested in Yugei and Ferro and Logen's former band of not-so-merry men. I can't wait until they find out their old leader is still alive.<br /><br />I'm going to sidestep going into too much of the plot. to avoid spoilage. Suffice to say, I'm intrigued of what I've seen so far, bringing me to my next point. The only gripe I have about this book is that it very much feels like the first book in a trilogy. Most of it feels like setup to me. Fortunately, I think Abercrombie is move than capable of delivering the goods in future volumes so it's barely a gripe.<br /><br />Additional Thoughts:<br />- Logen Ninefingers is quickly climbing the ranks of my favorite characters in science fiction and fantasy.<br />- Also, Logen reminds me of a young version of Terry Pratchett's Cohen The Barbarian.<br />- I'm not sure if Abercrombie has ever read Hugh Cook's Chronicles of an Age of Darkness series but the writing and morally ambiguous characters make them spiritual brothers.<br />- I have a feeling Glokta will wind up being my second favorite character in the series.<br />- I love Abercrombie's magic system and the history of the Magi.<br /><br />Four blood-dripping stars!of delivering the goods in future volumes so it's barely a gripe.<br /><br />Additional Thoughts:<br />- Logen Ninefingers is quickly climbing the ranks of my favorite characters in science fiction and fantasy.<br />- Also, Logen reminds me of a young version of Terry Pratchett's Cohen The Barbarian.<br />- I'm not sure if Abercrombie has ever read Hugh Cook's Chronicles of an Age of Darkness series but the writing and morally ambiguous characters make them spiritual brothers.<br />- I have a feeling Glokta will wind up being my second favorite character in the series.<br />- I love Abercrombie's magic system and the history of the Magi.<br /><br />Four blood-dripping stars!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I just started watching SGU a few weeks ago and am already on season 2. It's action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My favorite character is Dr Rush, never know what to expect from him which is what makes him so interesting and awesome...SGU is a must watch!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|These story's are great.  Needless to say, you have to read all the Silo stories in the order they are intended to be read.  WOOL and then THE SHIFT OMNIBUS.  Hugh Howey will be coming out with the final chapter DUST at the end of 2013, or so they claim.  I know I certainly hope so, I can't wait to read more about the Silos!  The author does a great job of putting you into the minds and emotions of the characters, he makes you love some and despise others while have empathy for all.  You feel cold and isolated while reading, just as you know the characters in the story are.  You cheer for the hero's, and the whole time Howey keeps you deeply wondering how the whole situation arises to be what it is!  I hope the next, and I believe final chapter, DUST comes out soon.  I will be waiting with great anticipation.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie!! I just wish they would have shown what happened to the Tiger. A must see for all ages!!
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|We watched this with friends, and everyone love it. I recommend this movie for all ages, it's not just for kids.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|too complicated<br />- to use no intuitive sense to the game.  very challenging to the well versed as well as to the novice
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My kids love it and play it whenever they can .  Updated routes have changed from the first.  They really enjoy it.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|The app makes it super easy to find what I'm looking for.would recommend to any one looking for this type of app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this app for my granddaughter.  She is absolutely in love with this app. We both work at cleaning up the stables and taking care of the horse. This app is supposed to teach her that owning a horse and taking care of one is a lot of work.  The games are fun and entertaining. The simplicity is perfect a 5yr old or 52 yr old. Thank you for the app. I would give this app 5stars if not for the advertisements.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Downloaded the game on my Kindle Fire HE for my Grandson so he could enjoy the game on a bigger screen with vivid colors. He was thrilled.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Well written, enjoyed the twists and turns of the story and the character development. Another good book by John Grisham!
B007SPRQW0|5.0|I bought this small board book for all of my grandchildren and they love it!  It has easy to turn pages for little hands and colorful pictures which in time helps them learn their colors.  The repetitive wording is great for little ones and provides opportunities for predicted reading. My eldest grandson sat still and was eager to turn pages at a very young age (under a year).  He loved it so much I bought one to have at home so when we Skyped, I could read him the story while he sat on his daddy's lap.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Yeah, so it's the GodFather trilogy. Extended edition. On bluRay. Priced nearly cheaper than a single regular dvd. 'Nuff said.
B009AOFNU4|3.0|SteelSeries build great hardware, and while this controller feels really solid, it lacks on software support. And it's really overpriced when compared to similar product on the market. I'd be really upset if I had to purchase it, especially at full retail price.<br /><br />First of all, let's give the credit due. The controller is very well build, and sticks and buttons feel really solid. The bluetooth connection works, and holds the charge very well. However that's all about it.<br /><br />My first issue was with the game support on Android platform. When I looked at the compatibility list, I assumed they listed the games they tested, or they have cross-promotion with, and it's only a \\"suggestion\\" kind of list. However it seems like those are all the games they support. I initially tried some Game Loft games I had (Modern Combat 4 HD, and Zonbiewood), and almost nothing happened. (The only consistent control was the button \\"3\\" worked as \\"exit\\"). This might be caused by the current state of Android operating system, but nevertheless [[ASIN:B0096L2SJ0 MOGA]] works for example (I got MC4 with their promotion).<br /><br />Then I downloaded the SteelSeries Engine application from the market, hoping I could use it to configure the controller. Unfortunately that application does nothing, except testing the controller. There is no remapping functionality. That was really a big letdown, because basically the controller does not work with any of the games I own (across Game Loft, Google Play and Amazon AppStore I easily have more than 20 games, I saw none of them in the compatibility list).<br /><br />Realizing it would not be useful as an Android controller, I tested it on my PC as well. Initially I was pleasantly surprised to see that the controller itself acts as a Bluetooth receiver when connected on the USB port. Unfortunately it did not work, but I was able to connect it using my regular Bluetooth adapter. After installing the software (and some basic troubleshooting),I could get the controller working fine on my PC.<br /><br />With the \\"Engine\\" software, the controller will have two main modes on the PC: regular PC controller, and keyboard/mouse emulation. They have ready made profiles for FPS, Fighting, and Racing genres, and you can configure your own. You can also set automated profiles to switch when specific application are launched. The default emulation will map to wasd for the left analog stick, and mouse look for the right one, with usual weapon maps for the keys, which should work for most FPSs.<br /><br />Without the emulation, it acts as a regular game controller. But I realized that the default button map is a little bit strange. The buttons map in this order: 4,5,2,1,13,12,7,8 (for 1,2,3,4,A,B,L,R). And I suspect that this might be the reason it does not work properly on Android.<br /><br />It's still possible to use is with some remapping. It works on Steam big screen mode (after configuration), and the games I tried. But the lack of button count is very apparent, since some functions are left unmapped. Basically, compared to my [[ASIN:B0041RR0TW Logitech F710]], there is little benefit in using this one (both in price and functionality).<br /><br />Overall it was a letdown for me. I really had expected a more polished product from Steel Series. But there is still hope. If they can prepare a button mapping software for Android, it might become compatible with more games.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Relatively easy setup (especially on Android)<br />+ Great build quality<br />+ Long battery life<br />+ Solid controls<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Significant lack of software support<br />- No button mapping on Android (at least with current release I downloaded on the market)<br />- Missing some buttons (no home, L2, R2, or clickable thumbs)<br />- No phone holder (like the competitors)<br /><br />Currently I would recommend trying something else, until Steel Series solves their problems with a software update.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A great read. It leaves you guessing till the end. A daughter delving into the family past to find an answer to a childhood trauma.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season finds the &#34;still alives&#34; Continuing to evolve.  I love that now the great threat is other people not the zombies.  It is a Great escape drama.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's said that there's nothing new under the sun, so it's appropriate that Hugh Howey had to dig deep below ground to uncover a truly unique science fiction story. In a world of rehashes and derivatives, the author has created a compelling world with believable characters and an unpredictable plot. The most interesting thing about the premise is that it makes you believe it could happen... or even that it already IS happening somewhere, in some small way.<br /><br />If you like science fiction (heck, if you like fiction at all), buy this book. For a price that amounts to pocket change, Wool had me hooked by the end of the first chapter, and by the final page, had me begging for more.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This while being a sequel isn't so much about Jason Bourne or really his legacy but Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner are 2 of my favorite actors and makes the flick enjoyable more as a standalone than a continuation.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Action packed with a different story line.  Friends kept telling me I needed to see Taken but I'm not a huge fan of action movies.  I was pleasantly surprised.
B000FC10IO|5.0|This is a great book for teens, and older. I love this series and wish the author had written more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can have the Holy Bible be read to me and I can even change the version of the Holy Bible I want to read. I love it. Whoever made this app surely did a great job in making it. I don't see anything wrong with it and am hungry to read more of the Bible, in different versions, in order to get a good idea of what the message is, and meditate on it. :)
B003TTKB5I|5.0|We started watching Grey and company somewhere along the 4th season. Now we can see how it all began! Thanks!
B003B02PF4|4.0|YOU WILL BE TOTALLY IMMERSED in the politics of Washington as well as its most important and powerful players.  A very talented writer  Mr GRISHAM is to be praised for excellence in storytelling.allowing the reader to experience  each and every emotion personally!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|First, let me say that this is critiqued more harshly due to the overall epic expectations set by it's predecessors. You could even argue the bar was set so high that this film was undoubtedly set up to be a partial let down.<br /><br />Okay, so \\"The Hobbit\\" is based of a significantly shorter base book source. And, to top it off, is being split into three different films that will all be roughly the same length as a LOTR film. Because of this, the film often seems to drag on unnecessarily. For instance, you'll get about 20 minutes of Dwarf introductions and lots of prolonged conversations that are unwelcome gaps in the overall pacing of the film. The story is still great, and there is a lot to enjoy, but this is not a dense story. You'll be dealing with a little fluff.<br /><br />The graphics in this film are stunning! The CGI has already improved significantly since the original 3 films, and it shows. The clarity of Gollum on screen and the countless goblins make for some fun and visually appealing eye candy. The 3D for this film is also a high point. I'm rather critical of 3D as often I find it unnecessary and not worth the extra cost, but in this case I'm willing to pay the extra $5 or so because it's clear a lot of work went into making this films 3D part of the complete immersion of the film, rather than a crappy after thought.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I got hooked on the 1st show I saw & then had to buy all the seasons. Love this show<br />  Cindy
B009AMANH4|3.0|I would be a fool to try and argue that this film is anything less than amazing, but I'm not afraid to say it wasn't for me.<br /><br />Lincoln is a very slow paced Bio-pic that portrays a lot of the interaction amongst the political parties to pass the Abolition act. It was interesting to see how they schemed to push an act, and it brings to light a side of Lincoln that a lot of kids didn't learn in school.<br /><br />Overall, just go in knowing this is a well acted, wonderfully costumed biopic. It's heavy on the history and light on the action, as it opts for more historical accuracy rather than creating another cookie cutter feel-good story.<br /><br />I liked the idea and the film, but I wont be buying it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For as small and inexpensive as this item is, it sure does the job! I have 2 of these now and I am considering buying a few more just to have in convenient places around the house and vehicles. This tool will take a badly abused blade with nick and rounded over edges and put a true edge on it with just a few strokes of the carbide side. A few more follow-up strokes on the ceramic side of the tool results in an edge that I would...almost...trust to shave with.  IT'S THAT SHARP!<br /><br />My hip knife that I carry has a serrated edge and the round file that the tool comes with works perfectly for keeping it what I call, &#34;stick sharp&#34;. It gets the points of the serrated so sharp that it sticks to my thumb nail when tested.
B001FVV2X2|1.0|I love this show and I love that my Amazon Prime membership gives me access to the entire series(assuming they eventually add Season 5).  That being said, the fact that I cannot watch the Amazon Prime Instant Video content either on my Apple TV via airplay or through an HDMI input on my television is highly disappointing and greatly hinders my ability to the Prime video content.  PLEASE update the App to include either of these abilities.  In a world of tough economic decisions, this drawback of the Amazon Instant Video app and the value loss it represents, seriously has me considering canceling my Prime membership.<br /><br />Once again, I love this show and if you haven't watched it you're missing out.  If you've liked other J.J. Abrams projects or are a fan of Sci-Fi in general, this show is for you.
B00123LIPK|5.0|This is a great collection of early Madonna songs.  Being a child of the 80s this contains some of my favorite hits that I grew up listening to.
1439152802|4.0|Book #30 Read in 2013<br />The Secret Keeper by Kate Morton<br /><br />This was a book that the last 70 pages saved for me.  I could not figure out if I liked it or not.  But, I could not put it down as a \\"did not finish\\" book.  I am glad that I stayed with it; the last part of it made it all worthwhile.<br /><br />During World War I, Dolly and Jimmy are a couple.  Dolly wants to be friend with Vivien, a rich woman who lives across the street from where Dolly works as a companion to an elderly wealthy woman.  When Dolly feels rejected by Vivien, she plots revenge and enlists Jimmy's help with her plan.  This plan has consequences that Dolly could never have imagined.  They culminate when Dolly stabs a man in her driveway, witnessed by two of her young children.  Years later, when Dolly is near death, those two children begin to investigate their mother's past, looking for the answer as to why their mother would have done such a thing.  The answers are complicated and unexpected.<br /><br />This book alternates between present day and World War I time.  This was jolting to me at times because I was getting into one of the storylines and wanted to stay in that time period, but was forced into another time period.  The mystery was filled with twists and turns.  Some I figured out, some I never saw coming.  This book, at close to 500 pages, bogged down a bit in the middle, but overall was a good read.<br /><br />[...]
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a great book. There are too many women who face being abused by their significant other who feel they are the cause of the abuse.  Instead, it is the other way around.  Hopefully, more victims will seek help in getting to safety.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|was worth watching and good for kids, really nice to have an animated that grownups can actually relate to - old arcade games!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book.  Hugh Howey is an excellent story teller.  His characters have depth, the pace of the book is constant, his observations of life and people are easily relatable, and I can't help but feel that the silo is analogous to real life.  Buy this book!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Good animation and made us laugh a few times.<br />Great for kids, good for adults just a little cheesy at times<br />Overall a movie to watch more then once.
1907590331|5.0|A classic.  Read it, and then watch the movie with John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.  Wonderful story that everyone should become familiar with.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Kids will like most of it. The movie really smacks of Brother Bear, which when watching as an adult is a little irratating. try to over look the obvious steal from the other movie and it is okay but nothing great in it's own right.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|A classic movie.  Robert Redford is great, as is cast in general. Everyone should see this at some point in their lives.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Good remake of the original film with Charleston Heston, the Omega Man.  Good effects and it had a surprise ending since it was different from the version I saw in theaters.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Lots of interesting and thought provoking plot maneuvers. In the Shutter Island sort of way.  Held my attention .  Parts I figured out -but the big twist was surprise & I loved it.
B000007MVD|5.0|After hearing this CD, you will understand why they were the greatest group there ever was. Their cover songs were terric.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love the intensity of the relationships between each character. Shows true meaning are caring. Great story end also. Holder is a wonderful man, boyfriend and individual.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A very good read. I had heard of this book years ago and just now read it. There are some unexpected twists to this story that keep you interested.
B000E40P3Y|5.0|This is one of the best metal albums of all time.  It has catchy riffs and break-neck drum beats that stand up to any Power Metal album ever made.  If you don't already own this album, stop wasting your time reading this and place an order.
0345803485|1.0|Anytime someone bans a book from a library and tells me I CAN'T read it - I feel compelled to buy the book.  I read the book, from beginning to end and I'm trying to figure out why I wasted my time.  Think it was written for shock value and nothing else.  Not worth the trouble
B00BF123WG|4.0|Very good movie. They made it about the girl more than bin laden though but overall it was a very good movie.
0385349947|1.0|Everyone knows Sheryl would not be where she is without the help of high-powered men and her parents' money. I bet she'd be hard pressed to name a single time a woman helped advance her career. This book of advice for other well-to-do females is a step back for women and I'm disappointed Gloria Steinam, of all women, endorsed it. Need advice on having it all and getting ahead? Look to women who came from nothing, faced multiple hardships w/children, and are doing well. Don't make Sheryl richer than she already is, keep your money.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The story is real, but the execution of the plots was poorly executed---too many abbreviated scenes, especially near the end.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I can't believe how amazing this book is! I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I do. I highly recommend this series to everyone
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Totally Awesome in every way! The Cinematography, The acting, The story! Can't wait for the third season to be released!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|omg this game is amazing I'm only 9 so this game is amazing get it now this game ROCKS! so get it. :)
B002SRQ214|5.0|and am more than satisfied with the performance increase--truly an excellent &#34;best bang for the buck solution.&#34;  Got a 40% performance increase--see my review of the Gigabyte GA-970A-DS3 motherboard as well.
B0095P31L6|5.0|its a slow but very dramatic movie and the plot was very interesting and i would definitely suggest it to someone else
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I bought this for my Nexus 4 and I can say that I am impressed with how easy it is to use this cable. The phone detects when it is hooked up to my tv via hdmi and it automatically mirrors the screen. Charging while using hdmi works well and I am going to see if it works with the new USB OTG mod for the Nexus 4 too (as soon as I get my cables). It would be awesome to be able to charge, output video, access usb storage and use a keyboard and mouse all at once!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics and a very interesting plot line keep you involved in the story line. This game is very addicting. I just can't put it down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing! This season is the best yet! I love the twists with the Governor and Andrea. I am also happy to have Merle back.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|For those of you who don't know, \\"The Hobbit\\" is the pre-quill of \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Tolkien almost didn't publish it. What was published was a very abridged version of the story of how the One Ring came to a mantel piece in Bag End. This movie is chock full of character and story line as well as some very kick ass action. The running brawl out of the orc's lair is as much a visual roller coaster ride as the running battle in Moria from the \\"Fellowship of the Ring.\\"<br />It's safe to say I love this movie. At first I couldn't see cutting The Hobbit into three parts. However, if the other two are as full and colorful as the first, sign me up!<br />As you are watching this, remember, both Bilbo and Frodo paid a terrible price for that small lump of gold.
B003G4W49C|2.0|The end was simply, amazing! But the entire book up to the climactic ending was droll. It does not make up for the ending though.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|True plans have user issues or the plans weren't' coded right. But the voice used in reading is very inviting and it helps me understand what I am reading as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I wanted a clear and comprehensive battery monitoring app on my Kindle Fire HD, as it is used a great deal for both business and personal use. With this app I get a very clear, detailed picture of charge remaining, battery temperature, approximate hours of usage using various functions, etc. I am a physicist by training, so I just love having this kind of detail at my fingertips, and this has a very full data set included. Plus....it's quite attractive. Good performance is made better by running the calibration program, it customizes it's information cor your specific device.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game all people should play. If you played the first one you will like this one even more it super.addictive.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book was boring because of all the word's they put me to sleep in a box so don't read this book.just my opinion
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|A bit surprised at the choices Peter Jackson et al made but they work. Not as great as the Lord of the Rings trilogy but a good start.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Let's see how this all works out. There's still a long journey ahead...It does make one long to visit NZ
B00503BN1M|4.0|Light funny cute adorable and just an easy movie that is heartwarming and good for a fun no stings attached movie experience.

1934030597|5.0|I have several bikes in my house, and I have to maintain... This book is very detailed and very good at explaining how to  repair or adjust virtually every mountain bike component in the last 30 years... I was very happily surprised at the extent of the coverage this book has...
0393327655|5.0|A book that will challenge even the most staunch of believers, only if they have an open mind of course.
B003E88TKS|3.0|Good start with a fairly unique story, but it felt as though the ending was a bit of a let down. The ending just simply did not measure up to the beginning and was extremely predictable.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I just finished Ready Player One and I am still grinning. I felt like I was chatting with a friend. 80's references abound and there is an &#34;inside joke for nerds&#34; every few pages. It's a great story and it is told very well.<br /><br />Charecters are well developed and likeable. I highly recommend this book.
B000002I99|4.0|Way to go Alice or is it Vincent? Saw you in Marshfield, Wisconsin (that ghost town in the middle of nowhere)what a show! Great guitar work! Better than Kiss by a long shot-if you're into rock opera that is.
1594489505|5.0|Now a well estabslished author, Hosseini delivers again with a beautiful and heart-wrenching read. Another must-read book which will have you in tears and laughing.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It didn't live up to the hype. Daniel Craig makes a good Bond though. Average Bond film-not as good as Casino Royale-with Craig. Connery and Moore are dated so their efforts are relegated to dustbin of history. Make an R-rated film for once-you know like Arnold or Stallone. Brits are too tame for U.S. audience. My advice to  Brits is to stay with Dr. Who or some other babbling-that's their specialty.
B007SGM084|2.0|This totally unbelievable and shallow book is about as close to porn on the page as you can get. I read the books to understand the hype, but have to admit that I still don't understand why these are best sellers. Also very poorly written.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read for married couples.  I will give this from now on for wedding gifts.  I recommend it to everyone.  It really works.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a beautiful, well-written book. It touches your heart for the obvious reason- two young lovers with cancer- but there is a refreshing perspective that lets you bond with the characters not only out of sympathy but also out of admiration for their grace.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|For me, most movies are average or below average. However, this movie held my interest to the end. It was excellent and I highly recommend it.
B00005WDDA|5.0|This is a marvelous translation of the Meditations as well as several really helpful chapters written by Marcus Aurelius's contemporaries.  The book was in excellent condition and I was glad to find a copy.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I read the book some time ago which I think helped me appreciate the movie so much. It is wonderful and had true to the books fantastic story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can't say enough about this one. Just read it. You'll love it. Part history lesson. Part thriller. Part  equatorial love story. Excellent.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|Who can review the Diary of Anne Frank? A young a lady who wrote beyond her years, so deeply,  so courageously  during when her life and the life of her family was in danger every minute. Prayers for the millions lost during the brutality of Hitler.

0802473156|5.0|This was really a simple lesson of understanding how you really can be effective in your relationships. Dr. Chapman effortlessly assisted my relationship to a higher height. With my husband being a willing participant in reading and applying the language of love. We are on the road of recovery. This is definitely a secret that needs to be shared with any and everyone who want to build healthy relationships with anyone, children, spouses, parents, family and friends. It really works.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Really good follow up to SvZD 1. Keeps freezing up a bit on my fire though, on my phone it doesn't freeze at all but, at least the graphics run cleaner and more Smith then my phone. So all in all I think it's a great game to play with the kindles screen.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Ok, when your starting to act and someone decides to make a movie for you, that's good. And since she is a MMA fighter that's even better. It's a very good movie and what I like the most beside's the fight scene's was the sound effect's. If you rent this or buy it, listen to the sound's of the car's and other thing's you might not notice.
B00466HM28|3.0|This keyboard is basically the LPK25 keyboard combined with the LPD8 drum pads, which was the reason I decided to buy it in the first place. You end up saving money rather than buying each separately. It's alright for what it's advertised as - a laptop production keyboard. The keys are springy and feel like toys rather than what you'd want for a performance, or even to practice 5-finger scale exercises. The drum pads are not nearly as sensitive out of the box as one would desire for creating beats, but after a simple modification I found online, they work perfectly and are a lot of fun, too. There are 2 banks to cycle through, so it's like you actually have 16 drum pads to play with. There are octave buttons for the keys, as well as a really neat arpeggiator(sounds more like tremolo-picking on a guitar than arpeggios, so I'm not really sure how it got its name) with a tap-tempo button that works alright. The 8 knobs can be mapped to control parameters in software synthesizers like Massive(which has 8 knobs in the attributes menu). I got this for $80 and it looks like the price has gone up since then. If you really want something performance-worthy, spend a little bit more and get a nicer keyboard that this company or someone else offers. If you just want mpc pads to play with, look at the Novation Launchpad, it has like 64 pads that light up neat colors and stuff.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|I have a hard time with newer and younger band's, I bought this because I had heard a few of the track's and liked them, the whole album, Can I say That ? Is better.
B004GYY714|5.0|it's my favorite because it has a sleep timer. I never lose the stream while listening. It's well organized to help you find what you like.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|Why ? It was not long enough and the script was messed up. Ms. Beckinsale must have been broke to have read the script and signed on to do this movie.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is an awesome edition of Breaking Bad and it has alot of scenes that you don't see on Net Flix.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|There have been other movie's about this but not on this scale, well worth watch history. A little more true history could have been used, but well worth the money.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is an awesome edition of Breaking Bad and it has alot of scenes that you don't see on Net Flix.
0345803485|4.0|I really can't give this a rating because I did not read it, It was for my wife. Let me put it this way, we were taking a trip and I was driving and she was reading it. Now when you have someone in the front passenger seat and they yell &#34; OH MY GOD !&#34; you have a little idea you need to hit the brakes for some reason, need I say more ?
B003K15IF8|5.0|It was hard choice between four stars and five starts. I usually only give five stars to books that in my opinion are not only well written, but also deliver a strong message that resonates and lingers for years to come. Stoner is one such book.<br /><br />Stoner is a chore. Make no mistake about it. It is told as a flat, boring biography, the plot never picks up, and as I read through its agonizing pages I kept asking: &#34;do I have to read this? Can't I just read something *enjoyable*?&#34; But Stoner, like some other annoying challenges in my life, pushed me to determination. I refused to give up, and this is exactly the message the book delivered: never give up.<br /><br />This might sound a bit too much of a cliche and too little a book review at this point, but bear with me. The point being made here is not how strong of a person I am, but how Stoner made me stronger. At first I shared a brotherly burden with the protagonist, then sorrow, then anger, and eventually we split apart: I wanted to throw the book against a wall an yell, but not Stoner: he just kept on living, painfully, letting the world run its course around him until the very end.<br /><br />I think the story could have ended perfectly if Stoner would have never realized what could have been. Perhaps then I could excuse him for his ignorance. But he does realize, and he is far from ignorance. At the very end he asks himself &#34;what did you expect?&#34; over and over, and I find myself yelling the same thing at him, imagining how I'd shake him and shove him against a wall, my mouth foaming with angry frustration. This is why this is such an excellent book. It moved me. It made me more determined to make sure my life will not end (or be lived) the same way as Stoner's. And now, as I'm writing this, I am happy it's not

B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is fantastic. Smooth play and nice minimalistic graphics. If only the old game this is based on was as easy to play.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The best.  Done very nicely.  Makes you feel like you are in Italy.  Just love his voice. The romance in the air.
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|I loved the movie, but I thought the price for amazon instant stream is a little on the high side. $5 or something like that for hd and for only 24 hours. They should of at least let us be able to rented longer than that and get our money's worth.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|Every dad should see this movie.  It is def. kid safe not scary they will love it and laugh out loud
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another amazingly, well written book. Such a great ending to an amazing story. Ms. Collins, you have the imagination of a genius. I so badly wanted a Hollywood ending for Katniss and Gale, but you made the story even more humble by giving it the proper ending it deserved.Thank you for sharing your beautiful mind. I wish I had the writing gift that you have to display deep rooted fears, courage, social class understanding, war, and many other topics, all so perfectly intertwined in one book. I anxiously am awaiting an entire new series of books from you. Excellent work!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book surprised me.  I enjoyed the depth the author added to the characters.  The trio of &#34;best friends&#34; wasn't too cliche'd - the main character was actually able to see past their interference and jealousies without dropping the relationships completely... which is far more realistic that we see with most romance novels.  It could have used a bit more editing, but I am finding that common with most books these days, not just e-books - editing seems to be one of the first ways publishers cut expenses, either that or they don't have enough layers of proof-reading.  Anyway, the story-line is FUN and the characters are lovable.  I will definitely keep an eye out for further works by this author.
0446547573|4.0|I loved the story and it was very romantic!!! The only criticism that I have is that it seemed to end a bit abruplty. Still, it was worth the $5.00
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is a bit different from the college edition I read a couple of decades ago, but I am enjoying taking my time and getting to know the characters and the mindset of the author.  It is long, it was written a LONG time ago, and it wasn't originally written in English.  You should know these things if you are going to try reading this book, but all of that can be, and has been, worked around by someone truly interested in the story.  And Les Miserables is a good story.  Stick with it - this is a good format for the determined, it will wait patiently and not suffer any damage while you take your time reading this book.
0425263908|5.0|This was a great story. I can't wait for the final installment. It was a great love story and it had great character development.

B00BF123WG|5.0|This movie has a great balance of action and suspense.<br /><br />Even though we all know the ending, the plot and politics around the story are very interesting especially if this is the way it really happened.
B0042JIL1U|2.0|In a number of instances, local councils are playing classical music in public places to stop teenagers from milling about, particularly after night. It is proving to be surprisingly effective even if there is a limit to what it can do to curb the waywardness of youth. Why so? Classical music - and I pick this up from my own kids - is considered to be effeminate, enfeebling and downright prissy. On pain of death, I am told to turn down Mozart whenever we enter a drive-through or stop at the lights where pedestrians are nearby.<br /><br />We come to the disc in question. The Product Description tell us: \\"The maturity and wisdom harvested from a lifetime of making music on the highest levels ennobles Maestro Abbado's leadership. The sublime simplicity of their performance of the Brandenburg Concertos illuminates the complexities of Bach's incomparable demonstration of the unity of Logic and Love.\\"<br /><br />Dammit, I have the stuffing: where is that Thanksgiving Turkey when I need it?<br /><br />This music means something. It has stature. For the receptive listener, other vistas arise and not least the close of the Fifth Concerto's allegro where one senses that the hour-glass is running out for Time itself which in any event is tired of being and longs for oblivion. It is not there to titillate. It deserves a better fate than to be glorified lift-muzak.<br /><br />As I hear it, there is no sense here that Bach is addressing the grandeur and tragedy of life. Niceness is regnant. One of Abbado's systemic weaknesses is his inability to 'bet the house' (he might be able to do it in Mahler - I would not know); there is more evidence here.<br /><br />Refinement and civility will only get you so far in BWV 1046 - 1051. While Abbado adopts the mannerisms of period practice - a threadbare orchestra, clipped phrasing and zilch vibrato - he lacks the potency of its best practitioners (and in passing, it sounds like he is using 430HZ - I stand to be corrected - rather than the Full Monty of 410HZ). The Harnoncourt from 1964 might have been our first glimpse of the Wild Man of Borneo but at least he is passionate about the Brandenburgs - hooray for a visceral response ([[ASIN:B000000SID Bach: Brandenburg Concertos]]). Likewise these miraculous works are played gutsily by [[ASIN:B000000SRC Bach - Brandenburg Concertos / Il Giardino armonico]]. A comparison with [[ASIN:B00005NFZS Bach - Brandenburg Concertos / Freiburg Baroque Orchestra]] also broadcasts how ennervating Uncle Claudio is.<br /><br />This survey is not without its uses. Here in Australia, the summer is past, the harvest is over and we are not saved. Yep, it's bogan breeding time (bogans = yokels = red-necks). Inflammed by the heat and cheap booze, there's sure to be an infestation next summer. As a rate-payer, I intend to set up a perimeter defence at the local shopping mall, using this recording as the main deterrent.  Under the circumstances, it'll be more potent than a bowie knife.ull Monty of 410HZ).

B0091REZMW|1.0|this game really tries to sucker you in for cash. the hidden objects are fun enough, although it's very murky at times, but the only way to continue is with keys that you buy. shame on you guys. just charge for the game.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Good game. Standard big fish hidden object /mystery. Look forward to future installments of the game. Now I'm just trying to fill up the review space.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Simple concepts are usually the best and this game is no exception. I don't play a lot, mostly with my daughter who is away at school. This makes for a nice father daughter interaction even though we're separated by 300 miles.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The third season of this popular series begins nearly a decade after we first met the Crawleys and their servants. Much has changed - in the first episode, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) and Matthew (Dan Stevenson) will finally wed; and Edith (Laura Carmichael) becomes engaged to Sir Anthony Strallan. Although Anna (Joanne Frogatt) and Bates (Brendan Coyle) also managed to marry at the end of Season 2, their happiness is short-lived as Bates is arrested for his ex-wife's murder.<br /><br />Another couple, youngest Crawley sister Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) and former chauffer Tom Branson (Allan Leech), return to Downton for the first time after their elopement.<br /><br />Yet despite everything, much at Downton remains comfortingly the same. Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton)'s servant Molesley (Kevin Doyle) is still as well-meaning but hapless as ever. The Crawleys' butler Carson (Jim Carter) is still determined to keep Downton's old-fashioned traditions alive in a world racing further into the 20th century. Lady's maid O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran) and footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) are as dark and conniving as when we first met them in 1912.<br /><br />As always, the eight-episode season brings happiness, tragedy and hope -- and viewers' longing for the next installation of happenings in Downton.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had a pair of these back in high school.  They lasted me 10 years!  The sound quality never degraded or disappointed.  Now I'm working as a video editor, and I still use these headphones.<br /><br />I hate earbuds.  I don't like the huge poofy earphones most use in my line of work.  These are absolutely perfect for me and balance great sound with a sleek unobtrusive design that sets well in your ear.<br /><br />Absolutely love these!

B000HSKUBE|5.0|House of Cards is a modern day udate of Richard III.  Ian Richardsonl's portrayal of a man without morals or scruples places him in  the world-class category of history's villians.  The supporting cast is equally outstanding.  Truly a superb productioon.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Although I have just started, the game has really nice graphics and each level is becoming more and more difficult.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|this was a good buy and i'm glad that i went through with it. very happy with the good price.
B007IK44CK|3.0|The MI franchise is what it is - Hollywood mainstream action adventure mind candy. Good fun. Improbable plot and location jumps -  how do they get all their gear from Russia to Dubai? But it fulfills its promise, lots of explosions and high-wire hi-jinks. Solid example of its genre.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|this was a good buy and i'm glad that i went through with it. very happy with the good price.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Pretty cute movie. Clean story (no innuendos that would be concerning if a young child watched it). It was pretty funny and the story line was unique.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|this was a good buy and i'm glad that i went through with it. very happy with the good price.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Well I must say it's better late than to never have read this book. What an eye opener it has really helped me stop beating myself up as I have for to many years to count. I am only in the first agreement because I keep reading it over and over again. A great personal investment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest I have gotten so many awesome ideas off it. They are simple and so is the app. Also allows you to stay connected with people who are interested in the same things as you.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful book!!! It really makes you stop & think.<br />The author explained it in laymans terms, wonderful author. Would order another of his books.
B0095MVOMC|3.0|but too easy for me. I finished it in a day. I guess for the price. If you need an app. that doesn't require brain power then this game is for you.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Of all the writers I have read and I have been reading since I was 4 - I have my top 3 and Diana Gabaldon is number 2 - God is number 1.  About the time I have thought that she cannot continue anymore - she does.  Bravo Diana - you rock!
0345803485|1.0|I finally took a little time out to wade through what one friend called one of the steamiest pieces of erotica she has ever read.  Honestly, I have<br />no idea how she could possible suspend disbelief enough to even find plausibility in the story line let alone find it stimulating.<br /><br />A self-made twenty-six year old billionaire business tycoon agrees to an interview with a college newspaper journalist.  She can't make the interview<br />so her roommate, who is not affiliated with the newspaper, agrees to fill in and said billionaire's company underlings allow her into the company, no<br />questions asked.  Then, this billionaire, who turns out to be perfect and well-versed in everything he does except telling jokes, shadows/follows/stalks<br />this college girl, until he can share his secret life of BDSM with her.<br /><br />Two things that struck me were the lack of depth in the author's vocabulary and the absence of descriptions.  She made a note to tell us he had a<br />preference for Audis but at one point when he shows up unexpectedly to see Ana away from his home, he buys or rents a \\"sports car\\".  Really, Ana<br />could name her car, his cars, her roommates car, and the author couldn't give us something exciting in a \\"sports car\\".  A Ferrari 599?  A Porsche<br />GT2?  Not even a Viper or Corvette?  Early in the book when Ana is first going to the interview, the author wrote \\"hit the pedal to the metal\\" in<br />describing Ana's driving her roommates Mercedes CLK.  \\"Put the pedal to the metal!\\"  I'm probably nitpicking but since it is based in the US, use US vernacular.<br /><br />The sexual encounters were pretty limited for a piece of erotica that got such high praise and again not very detailed. If we cut out all of the back and forth<br />emails half the book would be gone.  Speaking of which, why do two people who both have Blackberries, still email each other back and forth like that?  I think<br />the author should have done more homework, or atleast her editors.<br /><br />It was fun to read just so I could say I read it and I will read the next two but I'll borrow them from the library.<br /><br />All that being said, the author has sold more than 60 million copies so even bad reviews can't be hurting her bottom line.
0061900656|5.0|My son loves this book! It's a simple and fun way for him to understand his new role. I would definitely recommend this to anyone for older siblings to help make the tradition easier when you bring a new baby home.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|It was a fun game, but it just randomly stopped working. It only crashes now, and hasn't worked since on my phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book.  Loved it from the beginning to the end.  Wish it was made into a movie or even a sequel.  Highly recommend.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Tells the whole story, especially the CIA perspective on the intelligence leading up to killing of UBL, as well as the Seal Team 6 mission itself.  I would like to have seen more of the background on Seal Team 6's backstory to provide a more balanced perspective, but the CIA focus in this movie complements other films which focus more on ST6.<br /><br />From what I can tell, this is fairly accurate historically.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game on my iPad, love it! But on my daughter's kindle fire it's a bit tricky to update it.  You have to go to Apps, Store & find Subway Surfers. Click that & it'll give you the \\"update\\" button.  Worked perfectly that way!  I'd always had to uninstall & reinstall the app losing all progress (what a pain!) But I found this solution & it's great!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|App gives a great all around experience of what it's like to own/look after a horse. Hard work pays off! As a previous horse owner I appreciate the effort it takes to maximize themost gain out of this. Would be great for kids looking to see (allbeit only a glimpse) of what it takes to take care of a horse.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|started out good even bought stuff with real money<br />! because it was fun and then on one update lost all the dinosaurs I had spent money on :( when I emailed they said to create an account to get back. that didn't work! they said I had stay logged onto account for 30 minutes well 2 weeks later nothing. :( so if u play for fun and don't spend money u won't be sad. cute animation.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it my brother does my dad has it on his phone my moms not a gamer nether me but this inspired me
B00821PCJS|5.0|I knew nothing about this show and I first I thought some things were ridiculous like the alien technology being not too advanced and not explaining how they could wipe out the earth's Armies but not the small rebel groups that survived. Then I thought it was very reasonable that their technology was based upon relatively known physics. The best part of the series is the character development and the depth of the story. it's not just an Alien Invasion. I highly recommend.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I wasn't expecting much but I got more than I thought I would. I just picked it because it had Tommy Lee Jones in it, and as always, he never lets me down.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game is enjoyable and many an hour can be lost through playing it.<br />My only gripe is the gold stars which unless you spend a lot of hard cash on are nearly impossible to gain in game. And all the best buildings and weapons require them so for that reason it only gets 3 stars

B000003N7Y|5.0|For whatever reason Mingus decides to revisit these tunes, all recorded earlier (Celia being the one new tune) and available elsewhere though under different titles, and does the definitive versions. This is Mingus without restraint and at the height of his arranging powers. Every song is better than the original version. Really. And that's the reason to own this collection. If ever someone questions Mingus' brilliance, play this album.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love this game.  It's just like Yahtzee and you get to play with your friends.  I first played it on Facebook and am so addicted I also have it on my phone and my Kindle.  Fun and addictive.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I have read some of the lower rating reviews and some of the higher rating reviews, and both have valid points about what is good about this album, and what it may be lacking; however, I will suffice to say that THIS is GOOD music! I understand now why Kanye West is hating on JT - - Jealousy much!. I absolutely love how this album has the interludes between each song and it so seamlessly segues into the next song. If you like GOOD music, then this should be in your collection, you will not regret it. The whole album is cohesive, and the more I listen to it the more I love how he incorporated some of the instruments, like the trumpets with the song he has with the Tennessee Boys!
1400069807|5.0|This is the most thought provoking book I've read in a long time.  From other reviews you would think he was preaching, but there is absolutely none.  It's basically a history of processed foods in America.  You can draw conclusions from it and he hints and his own opinion, but there's almost no application in the book at all.  It's also extremely well written - another impressive accomplishment for this genre, which would have been easy to bore people with.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was how well researched and well cited he is.  This is not some piece of conspiracy theory thrown together.  Quite the opposite.  His citations at the end of the book are impressive, and he delves into sources that you and I would have to work hard to gain access to - such as Philip Morris legal documents (the company owned Kraft for a while), and many other private memos and documents.<br /><br />He also does a stellar job of showing everyone's point of view, which is difficult to do in a logical and organized manner.  I walked away from the book understanding the conundrum that exists in terms of public health, consumer behavior, and pressures from Wall Street for companies to perform.  There are no straw men arguments and no finger pointing, just a well researched, well documented presentation of the extremely complicated issues at hand.<br /><br />Previously I thought that I had avoided processed food, and by and large I do, but I realized I eat processed food with high sugar content that didn't fall into that category in my mind.  Incredible marketing really.  So I think even for people who are generally aware of the issues involved, it might make you think twice about the organic breakfast bar, the &#34;healthy&#34; cereal or Greek yogurt you're buying, for example.  A lot of these products are loaded with sugar.<br /><br />I was also shocked to learn that some kids' cereal contains over 50% sugar by volume.  I can't even quite wrap my mind around what that would do to a child's school performance.<br /><br />Even if you never change a thing you buy, this book is absolutely worth reading to gain a better awareness of processed foods and food marketing.  I will be recommending this book to everyone I know.o to a child's school performance.<br /><br />Even if you never change a thing you buy, this book is absolutely worth reading to gain a better awareness of processed foods and food marketing.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is a great book with great detail in terms of survival and food. It is highly detailed with great vocabulary words. This book is worth your money and will give you a story of a 16 year old boy and a tiger surviving in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A very interesting, original story, although it has some parallels to Harry Potter. Of course, you wouldn't notice unless you were a fan, so I can't say that it was a bad thing. Can't wait for the next installment!!

B002RI9HUM|4.0|This book made me laugh out loud at the humour of the Irish, but at the same time feeling sad for the characters in the rehab centre, including our &#34;heroine&#34; Rachel.  But she proves one can rise above all adversities if one puts ones mind to it.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|LOVE this movie...my children and grandchildren do to....it's a classic...and Tim Burton is amazing in his talents and movie making work
B008NEMN0K|4.0|movie was great in 2d format. 3d was good...seeing things from different prospective made the movie anew this go around.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|very predictable....slow even..and the best parts were in the commercials...getting a bit interesting in the last 15 minutes ...not really worth the wait
B005LAII80|3.0|the 3d effects in this movie weren't done as well as other movies. the movie was still enjoyable to watch.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|too predictable...the best parts were shown in the commercials...and it dragged just like the first one did...getting better just at the last 20 minutes at the end
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Excellent 3d...would have been even better if they would have included the extended director's cut versions. Too bad, so sad.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My neice thoroughly enjoyed it!  It's a great series and having it on DVD is awesome!  I'm waiting for Season 4!
B006H5120E|4.0|3d effects were very well done. Mde an already great movie even greater. Too bad it wouldn't fit on one disc.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|kept your interest ..... as a parent made me wonder how i would react .....but found it different then many of the books out there and .....but well worth the read
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This movie is very exciting and we enjoyed it very much.  It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again.
0316096199|4.0|This book was In decent condition. It was required reading for a class but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good read.
B0098460O4|5.0|Happened to find them on the internet and was totally amazed!  So young with such beautiful voices.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes vocals that are somewhat operatic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This rating because the story kept you moving and wanting to know the outcome of the relationship. I would reccommend this for adults only.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game all the levels are challenging I love subway surfers :-)<br />I think it is strategie game very awesome<3
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Guess this would have to be the better of the three.  I wanted to know how it turned out, but felt the characters were a bit juvenile. Again, would only reccommend for adults.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie for the family, funny, cute and everything you expect a family movie to be...!<br />Great animation and story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was told about this book by my professor & to be honest I wasn't quite sure I would like it from his initial description... however I went home that night & downloaded the first book anyway (Thank you Amazon for having it as a free download!!!!). I decided I would read just a chapter or two to see what it was all about, but I couldn't stop reading!!! I read the whole thing in one sitting  & immediately downloaded the Omnibus edition for the additional stories. I'm positive there are MANY other people out there who did the same; this book is just SOOOOO GOOD!<br />Story line is kind of hard to fully describe without giving too much away... but all you really need to know is that it is a quick and easy read with an intriguing story line that is definitely worth taking a look at. Seriously, GO READ IT!<br />(Plus you don't have much to lose, as the first book is FREE on amazon and the whole Omnibus is not much more!)<br />Thanks to Mr. Hugh Howey!!! I'm definitely looking forward to reading more of your work!!!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Movie was kinda weak for Denzel Washington. It really did not have to much to say, and it was hard getting to the end, but I made it.<br />If you like Denzel, Like I do, you will enjoy it.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|If you have not purchase this cd it is because you have no taste in music plus not normal LOL
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Another great family movie, with great animation and story.<br />The kids will love it and watch it a few times, really cute movie.
0061673730|5.0|This is one of those books that you read and it changes everything about how you view your life and the world around you. It may be that way for people who already have tendencies to think a certain way, but that's how it was for me.<br />Another thing I should mention is that for a Philosophy book, it's not just discussing theory. It has a nice, well written and enjoyable story that goes along it to help keep you interested.
B001E8WNNO|5.0|What can you say about scary movies.. an adaptation from Stephen King's Christine horror novel.<br />This one is great .. Great Movie..!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin ties the story together in a creative fashion.  What most don't realize is that this book is actually a continuation of book three...
B0059XTUVI|5.0|the package arrived safely.<br />the movie was good.<br />i'm sure others will enjoy watching the movie.<br />i will share it with my friend
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just finished. Lots of twists and turns and great writing. Makes you think and as a therapist, was blown away by the psychological content. Awesome book.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|arrived safety from the u..s.<br />i'm sure i will enjoy watching it<br />with a friend of mine over popcorn and drinks
B00B8ED7OS|4.0|Monster is a graphic world of paranormal activity, sex, humour, and a really twisted method of finding agents for the organization that deals with all the things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />Monster is the story of Julian and Siris. They were part of a boy band years ago, but time, fears and the world separated them. Now, they are set to be partnered agents, something neither man knows. To add to the problems, each is unwilling to deal with their feelings. Siris goes so far as to take someone else home with him, straining an already tenuous hold of fate on these two.<br /><br />Graphic and imperfect, the characters and story drew me in and refused to let go even once the last page was done. I loved the characters and felt their fear, passion, pain, and joy. If you love gritty paranormals then this book is a must read! Book #2, Inertia, is due out in June and I can't wait  *You meet the MC in Monsters.<br /><br />**eARC provided by author in exchange for honest review.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|I actually haven't completely finished this book yet and am a little over half way though. But I feel that I can give it five stars already.  It's been outstanding so far and I fully expect that to continue.  If this book has a weakness, it's only that it's one volume trying to cover a very big topic.  Doing that, an author necessarily has to summarize things.  I don't actually consider that a weakness however, because, to me, it is very well written ,organized and covers all the essentials.<br /><br /> And his inclusion of the plight (is that the right word?) of individual soldiers caught up in this is fascinating. He gives many personal accounts. I had trouble putting down his graphic description of the fighting around Stalingrad in the fall and winter of 1942.  Here were two very ruthless enemies going at one another, with incredible suffering of the soldiers involved on both sides.<br /><br />So, I would say that for anyone interested in WWII, this book is a great read.  I have read quite a bit on the war and Beevor brings up many anecdotes that I had not come across before.  I don't think he was making them up.
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|Worth every cent. He knows his subject and lots of examples. I will recome d it to anyone working with tables.
B00BHMF578|4.0|This is such an incredible and powerful movie. I was at the edge of my seat the whole entire movie.
1558908846|4.0|I enjoyed this product.  It arrived in a timely matter and was in good shape when it arrived.  I enjoy shopping the site for older movies.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|If I owned a beach house I would keep this on the shelf for all to enjoy. Be sure to pick up this gem.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee' s story is one that will haunt you. Through her story she shares her struggles and triumphs. Her first eye account makes the reader feel that they are there with her. This book will make any reader be thankful for what they have in life. Her strength is truly a role model for many.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Definately makes you think about how you would react if your child could be guilty of a crime. Don't miss this one.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|How I enjoyed this book!  This is such handy, helpful and positive information to help me in any circumstance.  This changed my whole perspective in life towards any obstacle experienced.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|THIS IS A TALENTED GROUP! The lyrics are so wonderful and make you want to listen over and over just to memorize the woes.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is a must read for any person in the world.  After many years of marriage I now realise what I missed my whole life.  I wish I had known this many years ago.  Absolutely a must read.
B008NW67E0|5.0|NO WONDER THEY HAVE TAKEN THE MUSIC WORLD BY STORM. NOT SINCE THE 60'S HAS MUSIC CARRIED SUCH INTERESTING MESSAGES. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT CD.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its fun so far I just know b.s I have learned that money makes the world. go round. but I better not be getting screwed
B006ZNRD06|5.0|This is exactly the program I was looking for; to play my video files (downloaded) from my laptop! Now I can take my movies on the go in my Kindle Fire HD.  :)<br />I can watch portions of movies & when I have to pause or shut off my Kindle, the VPlayer saves the spot where I left off.<br />You can also easily scan thru scenes with the swipe of your finger on the screen.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Easy to play, but fun and addicting especially when you wake up during the night and can't sleep :-).  A nice change from Spider solitaire.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This is a great CD.  Nice grooves, great lyrics. Has been played non stop.  We need more music like this.
1439193630|5.0|In my opinion, it is the best book on writing, that I have ever read. Clear, concise, entertaining, and honest.
0060899190|5.0|I am not sure what it is about these books, but I love them! I am a counselor, so maybe I appreciate the secret insight into anonymous lives. Whatever the reason these books are incredibly interesting to me. I enjoy reading what is written and also the creative/artistic way people express themselves.
B008Q00KEW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Star Trek in general, and my favorite Star Trek series of all time was The Next Generation. I loved the movies based upon the original series but wasn't a big fan of the series itself.  I was very excited, then when they started making movies based upon The Next Generation cast.  Nemesis is probably my favorite of all the Start Trek movies because it doesn't employ worn-out Star Trek themes like time travel and etc. And you can't beat the price here on Amazon if you have a Prime membership.  The HD quality of the stream was top-notch and it made for an enjoyable experience on my HD flat screen.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the book. Kept me in suspense the whole time!!  Will be purchasing the next one as well. Can't wait!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The witch part was a little scary for my 3 year old. I should've waited a little longer. The story wasn't as strong as other of our Disney faves such as Tangled. Hard to beat that one.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Obviously not top-of-the-line, but for the average photographer, it's more than adequate and very affordable. Easy to set up and install. Software must be &#34; run as administrator&#34; in the 'Properties' dialogue, or else will encounter problems in saving new settings when re-calibrating monitor. Xrite neglects to mention this most important fix in their trouble-shooting tips. Discovered numerous other customers had similar problems. Finally, after seemingly endless hours of utter frustration, came by this most valuable tip from another kind user of the product.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, especially the way it reviewed terrorist attacks from 9/11 to the killing of Bin Laden. It added to the credibility of the movie, though it certainly is a movie not a documentary.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow this book was intense but in a good way. I loved the characters but it was more than that they were relatable. Sure I may not have gone through what Sky went through or anything even close to it but I can understand how when she looked up at the sky or the stats it all just went away for the time being and it helped her clear her mind. And then there's Dean Holder who just got added to my long list of book boyfriends lol. He is the kind of guy you wish you had in your life growing up. The kind of boyfriend you wish was real instead of a made up character in a book. He's funny, and sweet, and protective, and you honestly can't help but fall so completely in love with him. I'm not gonna lie there were times where I wished I was Sky every time they kissed or every time he said something sweet and reassuring to her lol. All in all this book was seriously amazing and I'm glad I took my time reading it.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Director Robert Zemeckis' finest work in years - a compelling, unpredictable addiction drama bolstered by Denzel Washington's career-high performance as airline pilot Whip Whitaker. The Oscar-winning actor never strikes a false note in his complex portrayal. John Gatins' intelligent script evades clich&eacute; and the supporting cast remains exemplary. \\"Flight\\" (2012) is the kind of mature filmmaking rarely seen in today's Hollywood. By all means avoid the ridiculously misleading trailer.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|It was a great film, the streaming was good as well. I have a slower connection so I worried about the quality, but after about 5 mins of buffering it loaded and the quality was very good. I will be renting from amazon in the future.
B0091THRCU|2.0|The case is too small for iPhone 5. It is almost impossible to remove the phone from case due to tightness of case. An excellent idea if the case was a little larger. Hopefully, the case will stretch to fit the iPhone 5. Another case ws sent to me after I made this comment. The second case fits fine. Excellent customer service.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|What can I say.  i just love this show. It came packaged very well and came earlier than I expected.
B00117P0HE|5.0|This is a series of movies with Alice and she is wonderful in them. I like women as a action character and Alice is perfect. I bought all of her movies, and enjoy seeing them  many times.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Extra points for watching it with your ol' lady. Somewhat predictable plot, but it's a TV series, so you can expect this thing to run for a few more series.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The movie held your interest, it was exciting at times. The actors & actresses played a good role. I really enjoyed the movie.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|I bought it specifically for use with a navigation program.  The software company has had numerous issues with the chipset used by Globalsat, including computer shutdown.  I returned the unit rather than take a chance on losing data or even losing the entire operating system.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Better than expected considering it's filled with actors I love! Music, vocals, all of it was just fabulous! I highly recommend
B009PK9SB8|4.0|A must have for the Go Pro Hero 3.<br />A little finicky, not always responsive to your touch especially with the water proof/splash proof housing that comes with the LCD Touch backpack that covers the screen with an extra layer of clear plastic.  However it is much easier to use (and see) as it duplicates the screen menu from the front of the camera. Because sometimes you have to give it a few extra taps to do want you want it to do, I gave it four stars, but it is still well worth it.<br /><br />The LCD back will drain the battery faster as it does not have its own supply. Recommend getting extra batteries. I got some Wasabi branded batteries that last longer and they come with a 120/240 volt wall travel charger and a 12 volt car charger. (much cheaper than GoPro OEM batteries and seemingly better output.)<br /><br />Because the unit extends the width of the camera it also comes with the skeleton (open slots) back essential for recording sound when not around water. The water proof housing that also comes with the camera will muffle the sound recording slightly, but this is better than a water ruined camera.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I find myself planning to play 1 or 2 rounds and playing for an hour.  Its never boring and is a good way to clear your mind of other things.
B000E9910W|5.0|I really this album.  It brings back a lot of memories from high school.  I'm very glad I bought it and hope everyone who buys it will like it a lot like me.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of my favorite things to play when I have some free time.  Its never boring and is just a lot of fun.
B000HZD168|5.0|Let me tell you something: Star Trek 2 is an amazing movie. Everything they did wrong with the first Star Trek movie they did right  with this one and after 30 years it still holds up. Quite frankly I'd place it in the same pantheon of great sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Godfather 2 as well as Die Hard 2, and The Dark Knight.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a fun game to play when I want to kill some time!  I am happy with the game and the challenges it presents. Never boring!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I think this movie not only accurately depicts how denial plays such a powerful role in perpetuating the disease of addiction, but also how honesty is the only way to find your true self, and truly be at peace.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't play many games but this one is a fun and simple game and addictive. Very pretty on IPAD too.  Use it on iPhone while waiting in a line or Dr waiting room.
1454901276|5.0|This book really captures the essence of the Outer Hebrides.  If you've been there, you must read this book.  If you want to go, this is a great motivator.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|This is done artfully, and when the movie is over, the dark injustice you feel all over you is called Big Pharma and their psychiatric lies.<br />The purpose of this film is to make people aware of the feet-of-clay possessed by a Psychiatry bereft of empathy and genius, but full of drugs and control.<br /><br />This is the first film to fearlessly face the biggest rip-off since Freud recommended cocaine in the 1920s, and claimed it left no dependence or urge to consume more. How can you not trust someone like that, eh? OBTW, he was getting paid by the two Pharmaceutical houses who were making the stuff at the time.<br /><br />It's very difficult to describe much without spoiling the film, so I'll leave the plot intricacies to others. Suffice to say Law (who is great) begins a \\"treatment\\" of Rooney Mara with that casual explanation we've all been fed; that somehow - by messing with the the serotonin and dopamine processes in a brain we barely understand, we suppose these chemicals are a scientific answer. In addition, his position as psychiatrist places him as both pawn of the drug company whose approval he seeks, as well as lord and master of an institutionalized patient. There are two hidden and dangerous untruths peddled implicitly by Law's character:<br /> One is that mental distress is a result of physical abnormalities (fluid imbalance) and these psychiatric drugs: the  anti-psychotics, SSRI's, ADD chemicals - are a scientific answer by \\"medicine,\\" despite more and more evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />While I agree with another reviewer that it would be a stretch to see Jude Law's character actually in-reality be put in charge of his previous patient (Mara) after all that's transpired up to that point in the film, THE POINT IS that Psychiatry Professors have - as class projects - pretended symptoms to be admitted to Psychiatric hospitals as patients, and then once admitted, returned to their \\"normal selves.\\" They were REFUSED DISCHARGE! It is not so easy to prove one is sane, and in this country - thanks to Big Pharma -  taking the lowest form of Grad Student, the one with the juvenile personality, and allowing them extraordinary power through the creation of Psychiatry's DSM, its accompanying insurance code, medication and authoritative status within the Justice System, we've created something \\"other\\" outside the normal justice system. This is the TRUTH the film drives home, and the fascist power resulting.<br /><br />The DVD that is a MUST SEE is \\"The Marketing of Madness,\\" which documents much of these heinous activities. Big Pharma has spent millions to discredit it, but the truth is out there for those who will get up off their knees before their psychiatrist or their addictions to psychiatric meds obtained thru their normal doctors and dare to see they've been \\"had.\\"<br /><br />I've personally walked through the fire of incompetent shrinks, massive doses of anti-psychotic drugs and then having to come off them. Heroin addiction is actually easier to get off than these psychiatric drugs. Remember the motto of a top Big Pharma exec: \\"You don't want to kill the patient; and you dont want to cure the patient.\\" That just leaves \\"hooking\\" the patient on a drug that will have you in so much mental anguish, anxieties and vulnerabilities trying to get off of it that it can drive people to mass murder. Soderburgh tackles this, and except for a giggle from the movie \\"Carnage\\" is the only film maker to do so. He has pointed out basic truths, and made a heck of a statement about the unnatural, evil power that Psychiatry and Big Pharma possess; leaving the plot as clothing for this deeper purpose.<br /><br />What is shown here is the lie that the Psychiatrist \\"really knows.\\" This is merely a subjective human being with - in reality - very little training to be successful in the one-on-one \\"talking cure\\" that we all used to associate with therapy, but instead, has tremendous (and growing) power - in every way, shape and form- over the lives of the people who come to them.- over the lives of the people who come to them.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|This so-called 3D release was absolutely shameful, both in storyline and in technology.

1568490119|5.0|It's gripping & extremely beneficial to real life. It's much more than just inspirational. It makes big that which is big & keeps small that which is small.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Love this movie! One of my favorite romantic comedies. I mean Betty White and Sandra Bullock in the woods dancing around to Get Low. Awesome! Love it.
B002KKBVTC|5.0|This little scriber was well thought out. It has a comfortable handle, retractable locking blade, and comes with a compartment with extra blades. It is more expensive than just buying the blades for your xacto knife, but it feels solid and very well made. I use it exclusively now. I only wish I purchased it years ago, as it would have saved me so much time and grief with earlier projects.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed this book, keeps you guessing about who is involved and what the solution will be, Definite physical violence described in detail but not just for effect.  I will read further in the series.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie so it is nice to have a blue ray to add to my collection. I heard a rumor they are considering a sequel.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It has happiness and sorrow in the lives of everyone. And in some cases a bitter sweet truth. Loved it. It is one of the best literary works.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I first got this book for a book club to read, and at first I was  skeptical. But it turned out to be a great book! I spent hours at night reading this book because I couldn't stop. I would recommend this book to all ages, it's a great read.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It is interesting to go back in time and picture the characters in the story. It has a happy ending which I always like to have.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Of course, the streaming process with Amazon is easy and convenient. So rather than watch the Oscars ceremony, I watched Argo. As a writer I am a sucker for a good story, and this was a great story about storytelling, and the power of storytelling to enchant and manipulate. I think Louis Armstrong's quote about there being two kinds of music (good and bad) works with movies, too. They either draw you in or they don't. And each one of us is drawn by different types of stories. Is this the &#34;best&#34; picture? Who knows? But is was well written and well told in my book...
B004UJAOLM|5.0|It goes so far as to show how people mistake material wealth for happiness. The characters chase their dreams only to find they should have each other and not wealth. Too late
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Michael Bolton does it again. Fabulous album.. Touches our heart and soul.  In concert even better !!!! Absolutely wonderfully done .
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the true story of the heroic actions of a group of true patriots.  They all - author included - have brought great honor to themselves and the United States.  Anyone who criticizes the sacrifices these men have made cannot call themselves Americans.  Thank you Marcus for sharing your story with the world!
0545405777|5.0|Its a great look for a great book (wow i rhymed). I already liked the book and thought it was very interesting but this cover and case look great on any shelf :)
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Her first two were much better.  This was either fighting or the other f word.  And then let's throw in the drama.  But keep writing Miss James.  You've got passion and I admire that.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Great read. Characters you'll fall in love with. And others You'll hate forever. And a warm feeling in your stomach.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Works great keeps my phone safe so I can use it near water and when we are four wheeling no more worry
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is outstanding!!!! A must watch!! The scenery is amazing and the story is even better!! Love it!!!! It's done sooooo well!!!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Was a little boring....definitely need to have coffee with your breakfast. Once that's done you can make it through the entire thing in one sitting.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I liked this movie in some ways as it was about a real incident but it seemed more like a documentary the way it was laid out.<br />It is definitely for those who are just very curious as to how it all took place.<br />My husband enjoyed it ....of course...:)
B005COO1X6|4.0|Wish it were longer! Very true  to earth King but it did leave me wishing for more. Very good quick read !
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I thought this JB movie was a lot more realistic than others.<br />Full of action, suspense!!  loved it!! It is a must see!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you love zombie shows this is the one.  It has everything that you would expect with the addition of following your heroes for more than 90 min.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I ended up not finishing it and I'm not too worried about what happened at the end. Stick with t he first two movies.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Loved it . Laughed a lot. kids loved it. wasn't the torture that some cartoons can be. would rate it up there with shrek just different.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|I think Amanda is a great Comdic actress she pulls off this movie great.I would recommend it to others to watch.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The batteries came in the mail right away and were packaged individually and were just as described in the on line description
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This book is impossible to put down. Such depth of exploration of each character made for a sensational novel. Heightened my awareness of the conditions in India. Should be required reading in school.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!! Loved it!!! Not a typical soppy love story more than that. Got very intense.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft  is the most popular game in my neighborhood if you ever get this app<br />you will rock your neighborhood!!!
1449410243|4.0|It's unfair that I am criticizing this book for being too honest about the inside contents. However, I find Matthew Inman's cat humor to fall short of his other genius works.<br /><br />That all being said, this is a great coffee table book that provides lots of laughs to my guests.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|An important, moving and deep movie. This story is very well told. Very moving and touching, beautifully filmed and narrated.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|This app was the the Alchemy game that I had be playilng for years. I did not understand the game.
B002HML6Y8|4.0|A new version of the Dracula story.  Lots of action and special effects that look better in Blu-ray.  A fun movie but may be scary for very young children.  That is why it is PG-13.

B007860RL6|4.0|WALLS AND BRIDGES (SW-3416) was released 9/26/74 in the US and 10/4/74 in Britain. It was a Billboard #1 album and includes John Lennon's only #1 solo single, \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night.\\" This very personal set of songs documents in great part John's 18-month \\"Lost Weekend\\" separation from Yoko Ono.<br /><br />SIDE ONE NOTES<br />African drums on \\"Going Down\\" give an immediate impression that \\"Walls\\" would at least in part be experimental. Bobby Keys' sax on \\"Whatever Gets You\\" is reminscent of Paul Schaefer's Not Ready For Primetime Band on the original Saturday Night Live. This raucous track features co-vocalist Elton John on piano. \\"Old Dirt Road,\\" a rather mournful country song co-written with Harry Nilsson, is a byproduct of his and Lennon's [[ASIN:B000LY28AA PUSSY CATS]] sessions. Dual pianos are John and Nicky Hopkins. \\"What You Got,\\" a hard rocker with unusual percussion instruments, echoes John's hard-edged [[ASIN:B000HB3TQE PLASTIC ONO BAND]] vocals. He pleas here with Yoko to \\"give me one more chance.\\" Another for his estranged wife, \\"Bless You\\" has a \\"hope you're fine\\" message. John's favorite from this LP, it's a relaxed jazz/pop amalgam typical of the mid-'70s. Wolf howls at the top of \\"Scared\\" set the stage for an exploration of the universal fear of aging, and a more personal concern with John's own success being meaningless there's no inner balance. Features a bluesy Keys sax solo.<br /><br />SIDE TWO NOTES<br />\\"#9 Dream,\\" the LP's 2nd single. peaked at #9 on Billboard's Hot 100 and at #23 in the UK. The track recycles John's string arrangement of \\"Many Rivers to Cross\\" on Nilsson's PUSSY CATS. May Pang, Lennon's companion at the time, is a backing vocalist. According to Pang, a nonsense word phrase repeated during the fade came to John in a dream. \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" was the first song John wrote when he and May left L.A. for Manhattan. \\"Steel and Glass\\" is akin to the [[ASIN:B000MHV2V2 IMAGINE]] album's \\"How Do You Sleep?,\\" a rhyming, sarcastic criticism of ex-bandmate Paul McCartney. In this case, Lennon's barbs are directed toward former manager Allan Klein, in a vicious song that predates John's [[ASIN:B000MHW5WC MIND GAMES]] LP. His \\"Beef Jerky\\" instrumental, 'B' Side to \\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night,\\" opens with fade-in feedback. The unsettled melody builds upward to brief climaxes. Midway through, several voices yell out the title a few times. Lots of unison brass on this one. John once said that \\"Nobody Loves You\\" expressed, early into the exile from Yoko, feelings of lonely depression. Lyrics also make note of critical pans his recent albums had received. Most cynical is an \\"It's all Show Biz\\" response to a question on love. Vocally, Lennon sounds way down and a bit hoarse. \\"Ya Ya\\" is a snippet of home recording: John's put-on vocal over piano with 11-year-old son Julian's bad drumming. The track fades out during the refrain.<br /><br />MUSICIANS<br />John Lennon (lead, harmony, background vocals; lead, rhythm, acoustic guitar; piano, whistling, percussion), Jesse Ed Davis (lead, acoustic guitar), Eddie Mottau (acoustic guitar), Ken Ascher (electric piano, clavinet, mellotron), Nicky Hopkins (piano), Klaus Voormann (bass), Jim Keltner (drums), Arthur Jenkins (percussion), Bobby Keys (tenor sax, conductor of Little Big Horns brass section).<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[3:53] Going Down On Love<br />[3:25] Whatever Gets You Thru the Night<br />[4:10] Old Dirt Road<br />[3:07] What You Got<br />[4:35] Bless You<br />[4:35] Scared<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[4:44] #9 Dream<br />[2:54] Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)<br />[4:38] Steel and Glass<br />[3:27] Beef Jerky<br />[5:07] Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)<br />[1:05] Ya Ya<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 45:40sarcastic criticism of ex-bandmate Paul McCartney.

B000RNNCV4|4.0|During the emotional upheaval of the final days of the Beatles, Paul McCartney began work on a solo album that continued the \\"back to basics\\" exploration of the [[ASIN:B0047EL3R4 LET IT BE]] project. From 11/69 to 3/70, he used a portable four track tape recorder at home in London plus the facilities of Abbey Road and Morgan Studios. By March, the self-title MCCARTNEY (STAO 3363) was complete, and a week after Paul's 4/10/70 public announcement that he was leaving the Beatles, his new solo LP hit record store shelves.<br /><br />Content is song fragments and more polished studio cuts where McCartney overdubbed, sang and played all instruments. The mix of casual, experimental and typical Paul Pop generally works well. Despite wide critical panning (especially from John Lennon and George Harrison), his LP was #1 on Billboard's 200, selling over 2 million copies and took the second slot on the UK album chart. Color photos that adorn its outer cover (especially 21 inside the gatefold ) were taken by wife Linda.<br /><br />SIDE ONE NOTES<br />\\"Lovely Linda\\" is an ad-lib test recording (complete with extraneous squeak) of Paul's new tape recorder. \\"That Would Be Something\\" is relaxed blues that includes Paul's vocal cymbal sounds and other rhythm imitations. Right channel drumming is adequate. \\"Valentine Day,\\" a two-part jam, introduces some electric guitar riffing. \\"Every Night\\" is my fave from this LP, a melodic, rockin' unabashed love song with some falsetto \\"woo-woo-woo\\"ing in the break. For a one man band production this one's near perfect. Paul's introduction of it during work on LET IT BE met with indifference. \\"Hot As Sun,\\" the set's first instrumental, is a sort of Continental tune with nice electronic organ countermelody. Some unexpected eerie vocal sounds are spliced in, then a fragment of Paul singing and playing piano (\\"Glasses\\"). No detractor will ever convince this McCarney fan that \\"Junk\\" is anything less than a minor classic. It's gorgeously melodic and gets a well-deserved Side Two instrumental reprise. \\"Man We Was Lonely,\\" a cute and catchy pop tune, is marred by Linda's shy, slightly off-key vocal responses.<br /><br />SIDE TWO NOTES<br />\\"Oo You\\" doesn't have profound lyrics, yet it's thoroughly fun. A master at production, Paul's enthusiasm in the making is infectious. Love that incredibly high falsetto. \\"Mama Miss America\\" is an energetic instrumental dominated by reverbed guitar and some amusing piano pounding. The track's second half is harder-edged blues with soaring guitar licks at the end above drum riffs and one-finger up-and-down piano stroking. \\"Teddy Boy\\" was written in India, run through during LET IT BE and put aside for lack of interest by the other lads. Paul's multi-tracked refrain vocal harmonies put this one over. \\"Singalong Junk\\" is this side's highlight. Its appeal is subdued mellotron strings behind unison guitar and piano. A thoughtful instrumental reworking. (\\"Junk\\" was rejected as a [[ASIN:B00B40R7RO WHITE ALBUM]] track and again from [[ASIN:B007Z2IAAI ABBEY ROAD]].) \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" the album's penultimate cut, is one of the few from these sessions that was recorded at Abbey Road. A 1977 single of this song from the [[ASIN:B0011XEUP6 WINGS OVER AMERICA]] concert album made #10 on Billboard's Hot 100. \\"Kreen-Akrore\\" is a percussion dominated \\"jam\\" with Paul's added panting just before an Abbey Road medley-like finale. Experimental, and a peculiar end to the program.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[0:43] The Lovely Linda<br />[2:37] That Would Be Something<br />[1:40] Valentine Day<br />[2:30] Every Night<br />[2:06] Hot As Sun / Glasses<br />[1:55] Junk<br />[2:57] Man We Was Lonely<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[2:50] Oo You<br />[4:05] Momma Miss America<br />[2:22] Teddy Boy<br />[2:34] Singalong Junk<br />[3:49] Maybe I'm Amazed<br />[4:11] Kreen-Akrore<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 34:19ets a well-deserved Side Two instrumental reprise. \\"Man We Was Lonely,\\" a cute and catchy pop tune, is marred by Linda's shy, slightly off-key vocal responses.<br /><br />SIDE TWO NOTES<br />\\"Oo You\\" doesn't have profound lyrics, yet it's thoroughly fun.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|this is extremely addictive. a great time passer. the storyline is really cute, and makes the game pretty fun. it definitely isn't easy
B008Y73940|4.0|a gift that my husband loved. He wouldn't go to movies to see it so I bought DVD and we both loved it.
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|I am so hooked on this movie which is rare for me...especially since it doesn't involve animation or Johnny Depp! As a busy doctor I need to unwind. The soundtrack or the better part of it, is a good add for a cell or MP3. It works on my Razor Max HD along with a great bunch of songs  that I chill to in between patients & surgeries. I had a 2.99 coupon code from a workout app I earned. So, all in all, money well spent.

B002OSY2T6|3.0|Initially we bought this product to enticing my daughter to tummy time and crawl.  But my daughter didn't like it on the day 1.  She would play it for  a few seconds, and ignored it ever since.
B0070XFNDE|2.0|If you open this book thinking that you will be reminded in any way of Borjes or Marquez, you will be sadly disappointed.  I don't know how published reviews seem so comfortable making these outlandish claims.  I see it all the time lately.  This is a serial novel with a loosely contrived plot.  It's not really exceptional in any way.  The characters are flat, the plot is transparent and empty, the story is rushed, and the prose is mediocre.  You compare a book like this to \\"The Davinci Code,\\" not to \\"Love in a Time of Cholera.\\"  And there is no reason at all to mention Borjes in a review of this book.  It's not nearly clever enough.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Lots of fun. Sorry it only lasted as long as it did. Finished it in two days. Waiting for more
B00746O3X8|5.0|Okay, i've been going back and forth about whether or not to spend the 180+ bucks on the cotton carrier or on a good alternative.  Don't get me wrong, in life you truly get what you pay for.  HOWEVER...  My decision to get the Opteka was the best investment yet.  I just recently bought it and I immediately put it through the wringer!  Put my large body Mk IV 1D with a heavy 70-200 lens on the chest harness, and went about my day.  Removing it, placing it back... then repeating that process for hours.  ROCK SOLID.  No back fatigue, no slippage.  Sturdy, and comfortable.  Then I took it out for an evening of shooting an event.  I was able to were a blazer over top of it without bulky clogs of vest showing through (huge plus).  The netted mesh type design kept my back and sides cool.  The front part did cause me to sweat more than normal but c'mon... i'm toting about 7-9 pounds of equipment  strapped to my chest AND i'm working so no complaints there!<br /><br />Because of the slight turn to secure the camera on the inner tab lock mechanism, I was able to bend over to tie my shoes, pick up and set up my lighting equipment hands free of the camera, without having to remove my camera from my person.<br /><br />One thing i'm keeping my eye on however is the little plastic tab that locks the camera in place.  It looks as though that could potentially wear sooner than later causing a premature ejection of a camera.  PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE THAT FOR FLIMSY!  It's solid! Normal wear will happen.  With practice and perfecting the removal and placement of camera, It will withstand several seasons of intense work.  And for the price... even if I had to replace it within a year,  it would have paid for itself many times over.  So even two $40 Opteka carriers are less expensive than one cotton carrier and performs just the same.<br /><br />So I conclude...  This carrier is sturdy, well built, will allow you to shoot with some level of swag without looking like a total camera geek andit is well worth the money!  And I rarely write reviews so to get me speaking on a product is big!  Don't hesitate!  GET IT!  It's a very good investment!

B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|My friend and I have been watching horror movies together for over a decade. We love the scary stuff, the tongue-in-cheek, and the just plain awful movies all in their own way. This movie failed though because it desperately wanted to be scary, had some potential, but just fell flat. It tried too hard to be both a crime and a super-natural movie. Sorry, it just wasn't worth 2 hours of my time.

0307341550|5.0|I love books with twists and turns and this book had plenty of them. Easy to follow, totally surprise ending.
B00004XPTR|5.0|Do you like the blues? I mean real blues. Well, what are you waiting for? It may be as good but like we say down South, &#34;It don't get no better than this.&#34; Good clean recordings done in the new old way.
0307341577|5.0|This book had me from the very beginning. Great story, a little &#34;dark&#34; at times, if you love a good mystery this book is a must.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it has has such an addictive feel to it.. I always have the drive to beat my friends!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I tried this after one of the kids broke our Graco noise machine.  We have noise machines in each of the kids room as my wife is a vet and gets called away in the night fairly often.  The dogs generally freak out when she comes and goes in the night, so the noise machines help normalize the sounds so the kids don't wake up.<br />I tried this app as a quick replacement for our broken machine and it works awesome.  the kids all prefer this now.  Luckily, we have enough tablets to go around, tablets with pretty good speakers.  Makes a fantastic traveling noise machine as we always have our tablets on trips anyway.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Ten out of ten! Excellent way to enjoy your day. Hard to put down. Grate New caricatures. New stuff. Best ending EVER! I can't wait to read the next one!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The beginning did not catch my attention.  I just could not get into it.  A book has to grab me at the beginning so I can't put in down.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|makes my niece (3 yrs old) lol -she loves hitting the coins and other items. I have to tell her the kindle is getting too hot so she has to stop playing so I can read her some of the books
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|I have a Kindle Fire and this app freezes way too much, but I do love it when it works.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Things will confuse you,nobody knows if it's real or not real though. This book brought tears to my eyes, but it's amazing.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I give this 5 stars because, not only is it a great show that (for the most part) can be watched by the entire family. Watching it on Amazon is not only convenient, but it's seemless, without interruption and great quality...
B004EWFV9K|4.0|Wallander moves to the country to a house he loves. He buys a dog. His relationship with his daughter is good. It seems that his last years on the police force will be golden, but lonely. However, the author keeps bringing up Wallander's health and failing memory. The reader knows early on in this novel that it is not going to end well.<br /><br />The novel skips along a couple decades and ties up some old relationships along the way. Wallander has a granddaughter, which seems to be the only happiness in the book. His relationship with his daughter is told well and is engaging. The mystery itself has some nice twists. The story is interesting because it is set against espionage, the cold war, and submarine warfare. However, the motives for the murder seem stretched at the end.<br /><br />In summary, the book is a must read for a Wallander fan. It is the last book in this solid series and the author ties up some outstanding relationships and story lines. It is a not a fun read: the book is depressing, but has elements of bitter-sweetness.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Nice collection of songs. &#34;Brave&#34; is lovely. I like songs that show more of the beautiful tenor range of Josh's voice. This collection is probably too restrained for my taste. I think I prefer David Foster's production team.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I got rid of cable, but was addicted to Walking Dead on AMC. Amazon gave me an easy way to watch without subscribing to cable. Season 3 itself is not as engaging as the first two seasons (so far), but still worth watching.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|This just nails it! The acting, costumes, areas makes you feel like you are right there in the time period.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|good movie.  recommend it.  acting good, action good, suspense good.  I would pay to see it.  that is it.  s
B00499QUK2|5.0|These episodes were what I was looking for in terms of intelligent and suspenseful entertainment.  It stays true to Sherlock without being weighed down by it.
B00846TTDG|3.0|Good movie, I would recommend it.  Acting not the best.  Action was believeable and pretty good.  Good suspense throughout.  I would pay to see it in theatres.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great characters and exciting plot...lots of action and gore too.<br />I love this series and can't wait for next season!  I highly recommend this show!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays very well and smooth. So far, not buggy and no delays in gameplay. Would like to see more deck choices.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Just like space invaders and galaga. The controls are amazing more games should use this style. Cool game give it try.
B005IZLPME|5.0|This is a bang up, feel good action adventure film with a sense of humor and a central character you care ab out. The production values are excellent, the cast is as appealing or terrifying as required. Along with Chris Evans who is the heart of the film, the original 90 pound weakling who turns into CAPTAIN AMERICA, there are Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci  for support. CAPTAIN AMERICA:The First Avenger is far better and more focused than the follow up film THE AVENGERS. I recommend it.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|A great contribution to my collection of zombie movies. My Favorites are (not in any specific order...they're all awesome):<br />Res Evil - all of em<br />Rec and Rec2<br />The Horde<br />28 Days/Weeks Later<br />Doghouse<br />Dawn of the Dead<br />Zombieland<br />Night of the Living Dead<br />Shawn of the Dead<br />Juan of the Dead<br />I've got &#34;Zombie&#34; on order
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|The cover invites comparisons with Bowie's 1977 masterpiece; the songs mostly deliver on that promise. There's no single cut as powerful as \\"Heroes,\\" which announced itself as a career-defining classic on the very first listen, but most of these songs would sit comfortably alongside \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"Joe the Lion,\\" or \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" in terms of sound and quality. A very strong, instantly engaging album.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I am addicted to Mahjong!  I love Shanghai Mahjong as well!  Have introduced it to several friends and my husband is playing his game as I speak!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Intriguing, captivating storyline, although the story was somewhat sad and hopeless it had a good ending. Fell in love with the characters and felt their pain and despair all the way through the book. Really love it, and as an Afrikaans reader I did not had any trouble comprehending the grammar. Easy to read.
B005I6EU48|4.0|The only problem my daughter has with this case is that it doesn't stay shut. I would give it 5 stars if it had a closure.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|its ok because its fun but once you find all pages that's it you're finish the game and its not a scared game.(//-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was sitting in bed with my Kindle Fire and needed to make a calculation. Downloaded this and was able to do what I needed without leaving my bed! Very easy and convenient. Nice &#34;big&#34; buttons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how there is always an update available for this game u can travel to many places in the updates including Rome and Rio I really recommend this app MUST GET
034580404X|5.0|The series of books are amazing! The story has its ups and downs, but always had me off of my seat. I read the last 2 books in 2 days.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|As a &#34;Justified&#34; follower, I've become a big fan of Walton Goggins and wanted to see some of his earlier work.  Season 1 is free on Amazon Prime.  I've enjoyed watching the first season, I appreciated the fact that all the main characters are human and no one is too good to be true.  I'm happy to have found this show as I am looking forward to watching the rest of the seasons!
1452105111|4.0|bought it for my sons first birthday party and it ended up being kinda small for his very huge party, u personalize the banner to ur liking but its didn't stand out at all, it just looked like i made it by hand so that was a bubble burster. but i liked it cuz it was thick cardboard stock and i could always use it for something else. a lot of letters though so that was cool
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Definitely has some amusing points to the movie.  For some reason, I just can't stand the title of the movie...  On top of that, some of the acting was mediocre.
B001M790RE|5.0|Rancid is definitely a band that has helped define what punk rock is. Great band. Great album. A solid addition to any music lover's collection
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I found this story fascinating, and very well written about a survival of cancer and near death experience, and an outlook on life after her survival.
B004D2CPO0|5.0|Gripping story with a twist. Easy to read sub -titles. Enjoyed the non traditional mafia story. Definitely put this on your watch list.
B009X011UQ|5.0|We have two cases for the kids kindles and they have held up well and are easy for the kids to use.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It was interesting how suspenseful this movie is - even though you know how it end.<br />The other thing I didn't expect was how nostalgic I felt. This film really recreates an era.
B005LJITS0|4.0|I'm not a fanboy nor knew the details or how accurate the movie was to the comics, stand alone it was greatly entertaining, love to see a sequel!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down until I finished! It was spellbinding. I could not wait to see what happened.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and very entertaining! I first saw my friend play it and then got it for myself. Its highly addicting :)
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Great book.  Lots of twists and questions that needed to be answered.  And all the answers were surprises. Highly Recommend
B009ZE27US|1.0|It cant really tell it gives u a different answer every time even if you do it a few times in a row
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have always loved James Bond, but Daniel Craig is the best by far.  This is the best of his and leaves me wanting more!!!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love creating hair styles. It is so fun. You can really add the details to the people. It is awesome.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing. I can't wait for the next book to come out. It will be even batter than this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it so much. It is awesome. Even better than the first one. And the first one is awesome too.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought this in December 2009 and haven't regretted it once. Most of what I'd like to say has been said. In summary: awesome sound with great stereo separation through the built-in mics. The rest is gravy: phantom power on XLR, decent battery life, good UI, and great build quality with standard 1/4\\"-20 tripod mount (which I wanted as a photographer). Weaknesses are the built-in speaker, the inability to handle line level recording, and slow start-up. I'm also not really impressed with the built-in DR compression (just skip it). I can't speak to the mp3 compression because I don't use it.<br /><br />This little thing is built like a tank. I was buying this expecting to normally use external mics but was surprised by the quality of the built-in mics and have ended up rarely using anything but them.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this has been my almost constant companion for over three years now and I almost can't imagine not having it. I would definitely consider the H2n instead just based on size considerations, but that wasn't available when I bought this. My dad has that one and is happy with it. But he has a nice Mackie mixer for when he needs powered XLR, and I bought this hoping to avoid the extra equipment. I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />The ways I use it:<br />Recording Khan Academy-style online lectures for my physics classes. For this I just connect it to my computer as a USB audio interface. Windows Vista and 7 have had no problem recognizing it. Just plug it, connect, and go. If you're looking for a microphone to use with some kind of screen capture software this is perfect for that.<br /><br />Recording family histories (without video usually). My father-in-law has lots of stories that no one has written down, so I've been saving those for our kids. He's less intimidated by me recording audio only, so that's usually what I do. I bought a $10 coldshoe to 1/4\\"-20 adapter and put it on my D90 back in the day, as well. It looked ungainly but did lots better than the D90's built-in mics. I now do most casual video with an NEX-5N and its add-on microphone to avoid having to sync the audio in post processing.<br /><br />A related use is to just have my kids talk into it every once in a while so we can remember what they sound like. They need no coaxing once you tell them it's a microphone. The hard thing is to get them to stop.<br /><br />Recording wedding dinner toasts, etc. I was a wedding photographer and as kind of an unadvertised add-on I would give them a recording of all the family speeches, advice, and toasts at the wedding party. While I walked around shooting photos I would leave this set up on a mini tripod (an ultra pod II) near the bride and groom's table.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is A W E S O M E so fun and addicting. I could play it. F O R E V E R
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great story line with wonderful graphics. I watched it with my family and we absolutely loved it. Life of Pi is suitable for all ages.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|It is very confusing. But it is okay. I still know how to take pictures on it. It is fine.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is a must for 55+.  I started playing and got addicted.  My husband found it one morning and on picking it up could not put it down.  He said the same thing, &#34;how addicting this is!&#34;  Great puzzle for keeping your mind alert.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|My nephew loves legos, and his dad loves for him to be challenged. Purchased this for his 12th Christmas and he was thrilled.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I could not put this down. It was terrifying, horrific and disturbing. Not usually my kind of book. I became so engrossed I just had to know what happened.<br /><br />I found it was well written, but as others have said a little confusing in the beginning with the back and forth timeline. After gaining context I didn't mind that at all. If someone gives up on the book for a confusing beginning they will be missing out.<br /><br />The suspense was very intense. From the beginning you know that a terrible thing happens but not exactly what that is. The story unfolds piece by piece and draws you in. The subject matter is very disturbing and should be considered before buying or reading this book. I am glad I read it but boy was I terrified.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|It's a heart warming movie that is great for any type of audience. The writing meshes very well with superb acting from Cluzet and Sy. Highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|My grand kids love the game I however am having a difficult time figuring it out.  I know that in time I will figure it out.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great music throughout!  These guys are super talented - I think we'll be hearing from them for a very long time.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I don't think I figured it all the way out but since I didn't read any directions I still am able to enjoy the game. I like that is both verbal and visual, as far as showing the game pieces.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I have never been a fan of whodunnit type of books but Sherlock Holmes is in a category of its own. I have read a lot of classics over the past two years, and I realize WHY they are classics. The writing is so masterful. Such is certainly the case with Arthur Conan Doyle and the Complete Sherlock Holmes.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I thought that once Kate and Castle were together things would go downhill. Not so. I can hardly wait for each new episode.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition was always a great game ever since it came out in the<br />Amazon App store since it came out a year ago. In the past few months I've seen<br />Buckets, Double Chests, Better graphics, Sun, moon, and stars, and a main menu<br />exactly like the PC version of Minecraft. And there's more to come! Mojang members<br />such as Jeb and Johan are doing the best they can to make MCPE like the PC version.<br />Though it isn't just Mojang that should get credit, Amazon gets it too. Mojang found out that Minecraft wasn't updating on Kindle Fire on<br />schedule and now Amazon released v0.7.3<br />only a day after Apple products got it, which is a great accomplishment for Amazon.<br />One more thing, Minecraft is not a child's game and does not have lame gameplay.<br />The pixels may be square, but it's to fun to notice that. If you think there is no<br />goal to the game, your wrong. The description says that the possibilities are endless, so there are an infinite amount goals you can accomplish if you think right.
B005K17RU0|5.0|loads quick. It shows all of the info I am looking for . when I am in a hurry and only have a few extra minutes all I have to do is glance at it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Fast and easy. A little sad. Well written. This guy was a real hero. Love it.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The game overall is fun and addicting, with one exception. I get irritated by games that have ads for other games the developer offers. You don't have to tell me to try the Atlantis game every time I beat a level.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is really challenging and fun!  You have to think about it to solve the puzzles but it is so much fun to save the little drop people.  Highly entertaining!
B00846WWVM|3.0|The controls feel very clunky with having to tilt the hose and raise it with the same finger. It's a fun game, but I feel like the pace would be faster if the controls could be better tweaked.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie was even better than when we paid to see it in a movie theater.  3D is amazing. We don't usually like watching movies more than once, but this an exception!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My four year old nephew loves it. It is a great game for kids to learn about being sick or injured and how to treat the symptoms. He told me that he found it to be really fun.
B0094LY88G|5.0|I watched this on the recommendation of my brother after a long discussion on how financial reimbursement or pay scales aren't always supported by evidence or even measuring the correct data sets, particularly in medicine.  He told me to watch this movie. As a movie about baseball or a metaphor for medicine or a teaching tool for economics, I loved this movie.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|I am running again after 40 years and loving it. Thanks to Danny's clear explanation and sound running physics. Well written ans worth reading.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I have never been let down by Pixar.  I was not expecting this to be a story about a girl and her mother, but it was very good and relevant.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great for the entire family. Some puzzles really make you thin k.<br />One of the best maps available so fun
B000Q7ZND6|4.0|The movie itself seemed like the Matrix with demons instead of super computers.  Anyways I'm just reviewing the blu ray quality rather than the movie since there is no short abundance of film reviews.  There were no memorable grainy scenes that I can remember.  Likewise, there were no shots that were just spectacular.  This may have to do with my tv getting old as it is heavily used and about 5 years old.  I'm not sure about the lifespan of the Samsung LCD HDTV's, but I imagine the quality deteriorates over time.  My stance still remains the same- Nothing terrible to speak of, and nothing amazing either.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars instead of 3 because I am finding it harder and harder to find blu-ray films that aren't grainy during dark scenes, so this release gets 4 since there were no scenes that stick out in my mind like a lot of other movies.
0812416503|5.0|My son had to read this classic for school. I was worried that it may not follow the movie but it did so perfectly. Great book, and a timeless classic. A must read.
B007Q53IQ0|5.0|Not much of a film critic but I love this movie! Pedro Almodovar is a great filmmaker and Penelope Cruz is truly his muse. She (along with the other women) is/are phenomenal in this film. Simply a great story, great actors, great direction.<br /><br />Another note: I saw one poor review about the film, something about a teacher who thought the movie was too risqué for her high school Spanish class. The movie is rated &#34;R&#34; for a reason, there are plenty of other films that are more appropriate.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|I had heard so much about this movie I just had to see it for myself. It's so funny. Parts of it are slow but it's a great movie overall.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I loved this movie.  I had high hopes for this movie after enjoying the lord of the rings time and time again and I was not disappointed.  I especially loved the way the songs were interpreted and included in the movie.  If you don't have this movie yet, buy it now.
B0056JJXOO|5.0|What a classic. What more can I say? The movie looked great and was the classic Romeo and Juliet. Thanx Amazon.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This was the best of the MIB Series.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was entertaining and action filled.  lt is one movie in my collection that will be watched over and over.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|Looking for a series to get hooked on and had to quit on this one.  After watching 5 episodes, I decided to turn it off for the basic fact that the only strong point it had was violence.  Now I enjoy violence as much as the next person.  However when the violence has more impact than the writing ,,,,,, well, &#34;it is a major cheap shot and it insults the intelligence&#34;  And to be honest,, I don't pursue violent films.  And it was violent and dark with a script  that was just mediocre.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Quality of the streaming was choppy and slow, was annoying to have to keep refreshing and stop start movie. Wasnt worth the $4.99
B006LSZECO|1.0|I tried reading after people recommended but I found it tedious and just didn't get the mystery or what the story was.  I would never recommend.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very enjoyable- not too difficult, but challenging enough to keep me interested. I'm glad I bought it. The graphics are really good too.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My husband turned 28 this March and wanted this movie; I have never seen it but he says it is one of the funniest movies ever.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child has hit another home run. The story is true to the Reacher character and the action keeps you engaged.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Poor writing skills of the author which are impossible to ignore become annoying far too many times during the whole book.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|Bring the popcorn on because its time to enjoy this movie and yes, I'd recommend it for both young and old.
B00BESCUKK|3.0|The movie was a little hard to follow in some places. There was a lot of action and some plot twists that made it watchable.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is an action movie in the same style (but evolved to modern times) of the great action flicks of the 80's and early 90's. Lots of gunfights.<br /><br />If you like the comic, you will like this. If you like movies like &#34;Commando&#34; and &#34;Assault on Precinct 13&#34; (either version), you will like this. If you like good 3D (shot in 3D, not post converted), you will like this. If your name is Aaron Reynolds and you live in Michigan, you will like this. Yes Aaron, you will like this.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|That's right!!! Not a lot to say about this lil guy. He does the job and all is happy. Great price/performance Purchase!!!
B0037OOU8O|5.0|The thinking man's depressing movie. This is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. However, where &#34;Requiem for a Dream&#34; and &#34;Dancer in the Dark&#34; beat you over the head with it, this is a more subtle and accessable story for the average Joe.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a great game to have a chance to make your own city.It actually is a challenge to try to check your city at least once a day.
1594744769|5.0|While the beginning of this book was a little slow, it ended up being one of my favorite books in quite a while. The story was imaginative and the characters believable. The timing of the conflict was perfect and pulled me forward even further into the story than I already was. In the end, it left me wanting more. I certainly hope a sequel is in the works!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game. I think that it is a better version of temple run. You have more characters to choose from and you even get little seasonal gift things. During Easter, there are hidden eggs. And the cop that chases you is dressed in a bunny costume for Easter. That is way better than tryin not to get eaten by weird monkey things. I really enjoy this game. And it is free, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a better version of temple run.
B009LRE040|4.0|I liked the movie although the movie version left the viewer wanting so much more.  Unlike the continuity of the comics, the movie Batman disappears from the public and Robin makes an appearance at the end of the movie.  It opens up this 3rd movie for a 4th movie but it is unknown if there will be #4 of the Christopher Nolen Trilogy.  The action and the effects were exemplary and the script was literate. The movie had a film noir - a perhaps too dark quality - but it was still very entertaining.  The character Bane was similar to the comic book counterpart. In the comics, Bane breaks Batman's back and this scenario plays again in the movie. All in all, I would rate this movie a 4.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Me,my younger bro, my grandmother,AND my father have kindle fire has and all have this app!!! I am only 10 and my brother is 7 and we love this game!!!
034580404X|2.0|I only bought this to see what all the hype was about. I don't like romance novels and this was basically one. I guess all the kinky stuff made everyone talk about it. But because the author constantly repeats all the kinky it got old and boring. I guess out of the 3 the second was the best. I wouldn't recommend this simply because it was the same thing over and over.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Enjoyable new chapter that many old Dr. Who fans should enjoy while also attracting new fans from a younger generation.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|this game is a waste of time and money I mean all you do is just walk around and look out for slender man and collect paper. I hate this game . People thinks it's scary and drop there kindle fire I don't and its stupid. The reason why I bought this game is my friend he said that he heard it in school.DON'T BUY IT!!!!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I actually thought the game seemed kind of fun but I really just like to zone out with a plain hidden object game and this looked like it would get really complex if you got very far into it. It didn't take long to reach a point where I couldn't do anything else without buying diamonds (the app is set up to be able to automatically make charges through your Google Play account.  Somebody else said it well -- charges are endless, virtually no possibility of a game strategy that would let you just keep building up the diamonds you need without ever buying any.  I'd rather pay a few dollars to buy it outright and do whatever I need to to keep energized, etc. within the game.  If they came out with a version like that I'd definitely get it.  It also has a lot of stuff you can't do without going through social media and I'm just not into all that.  So I had fun for a couple of hours and then uninstalled.  My ideal version would also let you play on your own without any connecting through FB or Twits.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Lots of levels...so much fun!  Hard to find all the golden eggs.  New levels are good.  Fun to play again
B004SIP8W0|1.0|This is an EXCELLENT movie.  Unfortunately, I can't enjoy it because the DVD I was shipped has no sound.  Advice to Amazon shoppers:  Make sure you preview DVDs soon after you get them in case you need to return a DVD.  Alas, I waited too long.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is one sweet movie!!!The storyline and acting are awesome as is the scenery and action!My wife and me have the Lord of the rings trilogy,so to have THIS was a must and it is also the first of a trilogy of Hobbit movies too,so that makes this a must have movie!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|\\"The Martian\\" is the story of astronaut Mark Watney, presumed dead and left stranded on the surface of Mars when his crew mates must execute an emergency evacuation to escape a dangerous dust storm. Watney must use his wits and engineering skills to survive until the next planned Mars mission arrives with fresh supplies, over a year in the future. The problems he must overcome right off the bat include: he doesn't have enough power, he doesn't have enough food, and he can't communicate with Earth. Much of the story is told in the form of entries in Watney's log book, interspersed with parallel plot threads back on Earth. Other reviews have called the story \\"gripping\\" and \\"suspenseful\\", and I agree 100%. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />In terms of the \\"hard sci-fi\\" nature of this novel, it's one of the best I've ever read, rivaling anything, for example, that Robert A. Heinlein ever wrote. The technical details are amazingly in-depth and accurate, even down to the details of the text that would appear during boot-up of the VxWorks real-time operating system used in embedded systems such as Mars rovers and spacecraft.<br /><br />But the book's real strong point is the character of Mark Watney, portrayed with great irreverent and self-deprecating humor. I laughed out loud many times while reading \\"The Martian.\\" Best book I've read since John Scalzi's \\"Red Shirts\\" (which you should also read, if you have not yet done so).
B005898CFI|5.0|This is a fabulous movie with a great cast and the action and scenery are amazing!!!I am sure that this was the movie that inspired the 60s series &#34;Daktari&#34;!<br />absolutely loved this movie:-)

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations for a fun family movie.  Despite the fact that it came out at Christmas, it's not particularly seasonal and can be enjoyed any time.  The characters of the Guardians are interesting variants on the usual Santa Claus and Easter bunny types and all the more enjoyable because of it.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love love love the music and the puzzles are just the right blend of tricky and do-able.  Awesome game!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|As beautiful as expected, and the spiritual journey was as beautiful as the aesthetic.  If you are looking for intellectual substance in a movey this one is for you.
1439192812|3.0|A good read/listen for a pre-teen, teen audience or even for an adult with VERY little background in the sciences.  I listened to this book via Audible and, because I have read or listened to prior Dawkins books and did not read any reviews before I purchased it, I was a bit disappointed, thus the &#34;It's Okay&#34; rating.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I don't think this game is good for a three year old.  I think it would be fine for older children or an advanced learner.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Much fun, great graphics, can be played by all ages, as my young niece and nephew can attest. Great time killer.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Great story, but a little slow at times. You need to have  a fair amount of time set aside to get through it.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I thought it was great, although some of the individual singing was not Broadway quality. I've seen the play four times.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Other than the game gives you ways to make money it's hard to play with out using your card to buy stars n money. But all at around a great fun game
B009YP9L7U|2.0|not very interesting... may be that's why it's free.  No structure in building up the story line a lot of mundane items all added together.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Great story, lots of insight on how to view your world differently. Though a little tough to imagine picking up one's entire life to move about the world.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is like a combo of space invaders, galaga, and even asteroids! A lot of fun for those of us that remember the original games.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I live in North Beach in San Francisco, which is probably one of the many reasons why I loved this short read. It's easy to pick up and put down, not so detailed that you forget what is going on if you need to put it down for a few days, but it has just enough detail and characters to keep you delightfully interested. It's a mystery, without murder, with bookstores and technology. The perfect story for an avid reading millennial - ESPECIALLY if you live in SF.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|But seemed long on length and short of storyline, it might have been a better experience in the theater then a rental at home...not sure.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Was a very good movie.  Learned about humans ability to love.  Was more of a tear jerker than I antisipated.

1594487154|4.0|I've enjoyed previous books by Daniel Pink, however, they've not stayed with me. To Sell Is Human speaks to something so universal and is so well constructed I suspect this one will.<br />The book tackles the perception that selling is somehow dirty and beneath the great majority of us - the domain of used car salesmen and those that simply don't know when to stop pushing stuff on others.<br /><br />In Part One, Pink makes the case that most of us are involved for decent chunks of our days (possibly as much as 24 minutes every waking hour) in what he deems \\"non-sales selling\\" i.e. persuading, influencing and convincing others. He provides some compelling arguments for how the sales relationship has changed e.g. its no longer a case of the seller having all the information and the changing nature of work and professions means that most of us are in roles that increasingly require us to sell.<br /><br />In Part Two, under three well-chosen headings: attunement, buoyancy and clarity, he outlines how to be to become more adept at non-sales selling. There are some real gems in this section. Pink draws on some great research including: understanding both the importance of reducing our power, the benefits of being an ambivert (balanced between extroversion and introversion) and how best to frame our experiences. At the conclusion of each section he includes `Samples' - which are less samples than suggestions for what you can do to put each of the ideas into practice.<br /><br />In Part Three, he covers off what to do. Again the reappearance of the three carefully chosen words as headings in this case: pitch, improvise and serve, again the inclusion of `samples'.<br /><br />This book is an easy and fascinating read. Pink has a clear and accessible style of writing, weaving story with research seemingly effortlessly. He is also a master of structuring ideas in a simple and reader-friendly way. What's more you can see him taking absolute delight in applying the suggestion he's just made by way of a question or play on words in the final sentence of each section - clever and engaging.<br /><br />The only draw back from me was the absence of a conclusion. The book stops abruptly at the end of Part Three and while from most authors this would be a relief I wanted more from Pink - in particular a distillation of his insights from the book to set me on my way. He notes in the acknowledgements that he went into overtime writing the book so maybe he just ran out of steam.<br /><br />I'd recommend To Sell is Human to anyone who is involved in persuading, influencing, and convincing others i.e. everyone, unless you live in a cave with no human contact - but then you might just read it for fun!s just made by way of a question or play on words in the final sentence of each section - clever and engaging.<br /><br />The only draw back from me was the absence of a conclusion.

B000JJSPXQ|5.0|This is one of the cd's that is well done for it's type of music.  Maybe not for all, but it is good music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hoover took me on a journey filled with suspense, romance and intense revelations that left me breathless. From the first page I was drawn into the character's world and quickly found myself emotionally connected to them. I laughed; I cried and in the end I gave a little piece of my heart to them.<br /><br />The tale begins with an intense scene and I was immediately hooked by the raw emotions. The scene is gripping and the need to know unmerciful.  Delivered from Sky's point of view we are then propelled backward two months and each chapter is dated and timed. Sky, is seventeen and although she has done a lot of kissing she does not really feel any connection to the boys. Her best friend is going away and she will be entering public school for the first time as a senior after being home-schooled. On a shopping trip to the local grocery school she meets Dean Holder and for the first time we see her flustered and experiencing waves of emotions. The tale that unfolds is absolutely captivating and oh so much more than a romance. It is full of dark intense secrets and I loved every minute and every word as Hoover held me spellbound.<br /><br />I immediately felt attached to Sky on so many levels. Despite her \\"kissing\\" promiscuity she is really a good girl and quite the homebody. She has lived a very sheltered life as cell phones; computers and televisions are not present in her home.*gasps* She is a reader and thus we connected. She is witty, brave and gives good tude'. She is complex and troubled on a deep level and I loved unraveling her.  Dean \\"Holder\\" is smexy, intense and fills a room when he enters it.  My first impression was bad boy but he constantly did things to make me question that. As the tale unfolded I quickly feel in love with this emotional, charismatic, and funny young man.  Her bestie, while not present was sweet, and true. At school she makes friends with Brecklin whom I adored. His witty humor added to the tale but I wish he were more present.  He could totally hold his own as a MC. *hint* All of the characters see growth and enhanced the others. The depth of emotion they bring had me laughing, crying and rooting for them.<br /><br />Wow, where to begin explaining my feelings for this novel and author? Hopeless is complex and so much more than a romance. It reveals dark subjects, pain, lies, and secrets that took me by surprise.  Hoover reels you in and makes you live and feel each moment. My emotions went on a ride from; happy, to concerned, to anger, to tears and love. The author does a wonderful job with ebbs and flows slowly revealing things and then giving us precious moments of profound love to absorb the details. The characters became very real to me, and at times I could barely breathe.  I have said before that I am always chasing that \\"book high\\", where the lines of reality blur and for a moment I live and breathe the world I am in; this is Hopeless! The title is perfect and I fell apart a little as I it sunk in. The plot is tight, believable and brilliant and the way the author brought it all together felt genuine and surreal.  The ending left me with hope and I closed the book feeling spent but calm. Hopeless #2 is to be told from Holder's point of view and I am actually looking forward to getting into his head. review originally posted at caffeniatedbookreviewer dot com.ould totally hold his own as a MC. *hint* All of the characters see growth and enhanced the others.

B009E3EY38|5.0|As one of the 10 million fans who entered the lottery to see this concert and didn't get tickets, I must say that even watching the Blu-ray version brought tears of joy to my eyes. Yes, Robert Plant doesn't have the range or the passion for the music he used to have but he's 1000 years old. What do you expect? He did a fantastic job with what he has left. Jimmy page was fabulous, even losing a step himself. John Paul Jones was great as well as Jason Bohnam. The song selection was very good but too tilted to the \\"hits.\\" The camera jumped around from different angles at a high frequency but not to distraction like I expected and see in other concert videos. Having been there live would have been an experience of a lifetime but this is a good substitute. Video an dsound quality is top notch. Buy it and crank the volume. Greatest band in history!!!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|First thing you should make note of is that this movie is really long. That's pretty typical for a Judd Apatow production, they're all a bit longer than they need to be. Usually it's not so bad, because they're moderately to very funny/entertaining and you don't really mind the length. (although even in the funny ones I often kind of wish he'd just get on with it already) But in the case of \\"This is 40\\" the length is just agonizing and self-important.<br /><br />The marketing for this movie may have you believe it is a comedy, but be warned: it is definitely not. Yes, there are some funny moments, but by-and-large it is a dramatic work. If you're married and have children, you'll probably find a bit more to laugh about, but even still it's more of a sad movie than a funny/happy one. And no, I'm not criticizing it because of that sadness. The problem is more that there are just too many characters, and almost every one of them is an a-hole most of the time. We're supposed to feel bad for the protagonists (or maybe not?) but it's really hard because we are just not inclined to like them very much.<br /><br />(Warning - spoiler alerts) The abundance of characters also creates numerous sub-plots, all of which are equally boring. An unexpected pregnancy? Shocking! Your estranged father doesn't know your kids' names?? Go figure! A washed-up rock'n'roll non-star is not selling records? Impossible! Teenagers are insensitive? No way! You can't afford your giant house? Well, that's probably because you own 2 luxury cars. Maybe sell them and buy a Toyota??<br /><br />Let me save you $5 and describe this movie for you in a lot less time than it will take to watch it: Being married is hard, raising kids is difficult, getting older is frustrating, and money can be hard to come by. Paul Rudd has bad taste in music and Leslie Mann does not like her boobs anymore. The end.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|In my opinion, Royal Envoy is a delightful game to my collection. Also, I like the graphics. At times it's like watching a mini movie.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Loved it! My sons love to play it.  The music sets the tone. I would definitely recommend it. The graphics are great.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Loved it, loved it.  What a great storyteller.  He leaves you up in the air.  Hope there is another.  Heard him interviewed on radio recently.  What a clever man

B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Spencer Susser's paean to the Punk Revolution of the 70's works just as well as it would have forty years ago. This instant cult classic stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Hesher, who moves in on the Forneys after 13-year-old T.J. (Devin Brochu) inadvertently gets him chased out of the abandoned building he inhabits. Hesher makes an ally of Grandma (Piper Laurie) and becomes the influential male figure in the home by default. He is a rebuke and a disgrace to father Paul (Rainn Wilson), whose life has collapsed after the recent death of his wife. T.J. slowly gravitates towards Hesher though aghast by his lawlessness, which includes assault and battery, vandalism and break-ins, not to mention constant foul language and total disregard for social convention. The conflict develops as T.J. comes across Hesher having sex with his heartthrob, an older girl (Natalie Portman) working at a local supermarket. T.J. and Paul combine to run Hesher off, but his influence on their lives helps them overcome their grief over T.J.'s Mom's death as well as the sudden loss of Grandma. Hesher reappears at Grandma's funeral, and they realize an epiphany in his celebration of life and his ability to adapt and overcome by having no concern whatsoever for the things he cannot change.<br /><br />This may come across to many audiences as a \\"Raging Bull\\" type flick, an unpalatable, unblinking look at a social neanderthal. For those fascinated by teenage angst as well as those in search of Sundance-type flicks exploring the meaning of life in the dark closets of our lives, Hesher is well worth a buy.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|This is a great book for the beginning home brewer.  Plamer goes in-depth but has structured the book so you don't have to absorb every nuance the first read through.
1594487154|5.0|I've been in sales for 30 years and find this book to be extraordinary. It helps me on all levels of my sales and consulting productivity from simply sending e-mails to making complex sales presentations. Thank you again Daniel Pink  for another extraordinary book.
B0002TT36G|3.0|Its your normal binder with a good set of rings.  As long as you dont treat it like crap it should last with your collection!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book stands out in my mind as one of my top five favorite books of ALL TIME. Just a phenomenal read, I couldn't put it down and when I finished it I felt as only a truly great book makes you feel...terribly sad that it was over. Cheryl invites us into her world and her mind and opens the reader to all her glorious insecurities, pain and strife in such a way that makes it impossible to judge her and instead think of her as your best friend that you could tell anything and everything to. Her journey is incredibly inspirational, and her depth of character that is exposed in the book is equally so. Raw and honest, this memoir is stunning in it's author's talent at describing the world around her and her own feelings without becoming over emotional or repeating itself. Wonderful!!! Cheryl Strayed IS the Queen of the PCT. :)

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very fun. I play it every day. It's very relaxing. It started off slow with little coins but with the collection boosts that you get makes this game even more fun. I love it.
B004G600A4|5.0|One of my Disney favorites, and with good reason. Kids love it because it's fun, adventurous, and the songs are pleasant; Adults love it for the subtle adult humor and Buster-Hall style physical gags. I'll rewatch this one again and again. Highly recommended.
1608955702|5.0|I have been following Neil's work/advise through his blog sites - Tangents and Forum.<br /><br />What's so neat about Neil in a world of Photographers?<br />For me, he's easy to follow along.  What resonates for me is that Neil walks you through the thought process of building the photo ....and he does it simply and elegantly - and that is huge!<br />I don't know Neil, but I can say this much; he is active on his blogs, he comes across as really down to earth and will quite often chip in on a conversation to provide a nugget or clarification. He shares his knowledge freely and I get the sense he really does want others to become better photographers. I like his style and approach.  I'm mostly an event photographer and have found his insight to be invaluable.<br /><br />Why this book?<br />I would strongly recommend the 2 previous books he has written...my copies have become reference books. This third book hammers down the underlying concept of beautiful light.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?<br />Absolutely, and if he wrote a fourth - I'd be right there with a pre-order
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like it it's fun to play and figure it all out and when you start leveling up and playing a lot for fun
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I loved this movie! I definitely will be buying it on Blu-ray soon, I first wanted to watch it to see if I would like it, as I have heard mixed reviews. anyway I loved it and would recommend everyone to watch it.
B009HEN7LY|5.0|I thouht this was the best of the men in black movies.  I really enjoyed men in black three.  5 Stars
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I bought this e-book in 2011. I'd seen some of my colleagues reading Les Mis, so I decided to read it. I was impressed but its immensity and advanced vocabulary -- it would be the longest book I'd ever read.<br /><br />The story itself was fine, but the content wasn't. There were just so many rants about social injustice, extinct convents, dead people, etc. that nobody really cares about. I made the mistake of reading most of the tedious nonsense, and kept on going to the Table of Contents to see how much longer I had to endure of the rubbish.<br /><br />Here's some advice: don't read, Part I, Book I (\\"An Upright Man\\"); Part II, Book I (\\"Waterloo\\"); Part II, Book VI (\\"Le Petit-Picus\\"); Part II, Book VII (\\"The Convent as an Abstract Idea\\"); Part IV, Book I (\\"A Few Pages of History\\"); Part IV, Book VII (\\"Argot\\"); Part V, Book II (\\"The Entrails of the Monster\\"); and Part IV, Book VII (\\"Argot\\"). These seven sections are all complete wastes of your time. I made the mistake of reading all seven of them except \\"Argot\\". I regret reading them greatly. Whenever I was reading these sections, I kept on thinking, \\"Mr. Hugo, can we PLEASE get on with the story?\\".<br /><br />Also, there are several spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in the e-book translation. There are random accent marks on random words (whispered = whispèred). Thus, the editing isn't the best and can definitely improve. However, the main reason why I gave this item three stars is explained in the preceding paragraph.<br /><br />Although this edition's unabridged, I would recommend getting a hard-copy book. That way, you can easily skip all the useless rants on social injustice and all that other rubbish.
B00BYOEZTI|3.0|I enjoyed this movie but it was rather long.  Some of the scenes went on for more than necessary.  I don't know if I will watch it again.

B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Hubby and I enjoy out there type of films and this one did not disappoint.  We loved the movie from start to finish.  Granted, it wasn't a fast paced film that had your heart racing constantly, but the story was interesting and well developed.  There seemed to be perfect timing between the scary parts and gore.  I highly recommend this movie.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Love the BluRay quality! This series is absolutely AWESOME, and if you have an HD TV and aren't using a BluRay system on it you're just cheating yourself.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Do not get this game. The reason is because I was busy building a mansion made out of diamonds. But guess what?just got this game and after five minutes it said, \\"END OF DEMO\\". Don't get this. It's a rip- off!

B0094K1WZE|5.0|I'm not a big movie fan, nor do I especially like Tom Cruise, but this movie had excitement from the minute it started.  I highly recommend it, and I think I will now try to watch the other MI movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome! It is like you are taking care of a real horse! Plus it is so easy to get gems!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like the game. Just hard to see this on a phone. Pinch should allow for more zoom.  Or at least some sort of adjustment for older folks.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|I found the movie is a bit disjointed at the beginning.  It got better towards the middle and ended well.

This is the second Gillian Flynn novel I have read and each one she has done a magnificent job of drawing you in to the book and making it impossible for you to put down. Half way through the book I thought I had it all figured out only to be surprised and amazed by her amazing writing.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|It was an awesome journey from start to finish. It's amazing how much I got out of the book this time around. Last time I read the whole series was back in 2001 and it was hard to put down as it is now. I'm ready to jump back into the world of the forgotten realms and look through the lavender eyes of Drizzt with his adventures to come.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Love the album, so glad that I was introduced to the group from Bar Rescue!  Will be on the look out for future music, Good luck!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was so happy hen I found out I can purchase the episodes and be able to catch up on season 3!
B00646UU5Y|1.0|All of the others were so good, too bad it went down the tubes, embarrassed that I watched it this season
B00280LYIC|5.0|Love it!  Started reading it to my daughter.  Finished reading it for myself.  I enjoy everything Rick Riordan writes.  I have a hard time waiting for new stuff.
B007704HO6|4.0|What a wonderful story - loved every page of it. Just goes to show what effect an animal can have on our lives.
B008AT9XOC|4.0|This is one of my favorite musicals--and I ordered the Director's Cut excited for the original ending. But I found that the final numbers went on for far too long, and the movie's original ending worked much better for film. I wish that the other ending had been included on the disc.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and I still sang along to all of the music!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Richard Castle has done it!!! He has created an amazing murder mystery that will not cease to excite and will most certantly keep, the pages turning. I highly reccomend it and all of his books.
1607066017|3.0|Taken as it is, Saga is a pretty great and wild read. Lot's of good stuff. However, with all the hype that's been surrounding it as of late, I was kind of expecting more. It seemed a little &#34;already done&#34;, even though the characterization was excellent. Also, it was just a little on the gross side for me, personally. Definitely don't let your kids near this one. And while the art is fantastic, I don't know if that'll be enough to pull me in for Vol. 2.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love this game so much that it earns the title &quot;best game ever!&quot; you should totally get this. its so worth it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|You guys are giving too little credit to this. I mean you get unlimited free music and video downloads. It may take you off sometimes but its worth it when your getting the free music and videos. Great app!
B0021AEIUU|5.0|This has always been a favourite book of mine; captures the essence of who we all are as humans- wanting to do the right thing, but always enticed by the enjoyment of bad.<br />The story, while presented as the  fanciful and grotesque, can be true in our case because secretly, we all wish we had a 'potion' which would free us sometimes from the expectation of being good to ALL  persons, ALL of the time.<br />Yet, the sad reality is that striving to be free can unwittingly push us to, and over the brink of what is proper, moral and decent and has the power to enslave us to our own wickedness.<br />This epic battle of  the  good vs evil indeed is a sobering reminder and encouragement that it actually DOES serve US well to TRY to do the right thing after all!
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|What I love about streaming videos through the net is accessibility. What I don't like is how it reloads and reloads and reloads.. I don't know how fast my Mac needs to be in order to stream videos but I still love the convenience .. Five for the Film and four for the inconvenience of a chop chop chop reload of streams..
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game has the awesome 8bit graphics which really takes me back to the games I green up with. Lots of levels! Lots of easy fun.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for Season 3! Can't believe this story has so many twists and turns...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great series.  Enjoyed all the books and I am a seriously older adult.  Would recommend it to adults who liked Harry Potter but it has a darker story line.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love lt ghfd Afghan cf ff dff dff ff ffff hhjh ddevssaccsws. Dbbcz sax ff dd csgnvs nxsbgd sw s x vbfx ddnjc v
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Maybe I'm just burnt out on the genre but this one didn't seem as good as the first three. The plot line didn't seem as believable as past plot lines.
B009KEN87O|3.0|I probably won't keep this app. I will get sick of playing it fairly fast. Worth downloading and playing for a short time.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This story is quite enchanting, and it brings you into a sense of wonder and curiosity as can only be found in the minds of children.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its great fun if you love horses. especially getting to train them and compete in compitetions. I recommend this game for horse lovers
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|had a little bit of issues after losinh 12 levels of play an un and re install its running great!
B001KP2Y3K|3.0|Not up to her earlier work, somewhat repetitive melodies, disappointing lyrics, pleasent but not terrible.  Why do I need to write so many words
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have always liked playing Mahjong but now that I have my Kindle, it's easier to pull up and the levels get harder and harder.
0980876702|4.0|Excellent book. Great project. Good instructions. As with all Carolyn pierce books it has beautiful photos and clear instructions. I can't wait to make this entire house and accessories.
0375869026|5.0|This book will require multiple tissues, but it is definitely worth the read.  I am an elementary counselor and am hoping that all of our 5th graders will be required to read it. Shows the power of kindness.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I love this album with the exception of 1 song. Aside from that, I'm glad he is back and brings a new sound to the music industry. He is changing the game!
0525421580|5.0|great books<br />If you liked the vlogbrothers your would like them as well<br />:)<br />just started watching and had to order them!
B00A861QMM|3.0|fun puzzle game, some of the pictures are dark so it makes it hard to find the hidden objects. nice that it gives you a hint button.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book forecasts internation intelligence events that are happening as you read this book.  Uncanty, a must read for anyone interested in cyber warfare,
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love these types of puzzles. Fun for my son who is three, the puzzle only lets you guess wrong three times before you start over. It has a section you can turn limited guesses off, so my son can play till the picture shows up.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Exactly what I have come to expect from the j.r.r. Tolkien series. Its well worth watching. No spoilers from me but the ending of the movie left me hanging in anticipation. If you love the Lord Of The Rings then this is a MUST see.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|I got this for my three year old son because he loves to draw. It kept freezing on my kindle, and was hard to use. It shows stars on the app picture but I was unable to find any stars in the app.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I haven't enjoyed so much a book in a long time. It's very well written, the story grabs you since the beginning, it never stops amazing you, it's one of those books you will like to continue reading!!
B000Q79HS8|4.0|Mat Damon does great in the Bourne movies.  I wish they would have more closely followed the richness of the novel.  Too many of the sub-plots are missing.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|The text is good, and starts very promising but starting the end it becomes weak, it seams that he got short of words or ways to end the text.<br />I like Hornby but this is not his best piece.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Very good book, enjoyable reading. Would recommend others to read it.  Taught some good lessons in it and had a good plot.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The story is promising, the idea is good but the story is a very weird mix between what wants to be a nice tale on time and thriller.<br />You can enjoy reading it but it's not as well developed as it could be.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Loved this movie! It was the perfect movie to show at my friends birthday party. Everyone loved it! Thanks to the addition passcode I got with it, I was able to get into the sneak peak of the next Hobbit movie Peter Jackson hosted on the 24th! If you loved Lord of the Rings, this movie is for you!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|the only good game that lets u drive and walk around doing missions and just being bad!!! you need to download this game...
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It was awesome and I want people to know how I feel about this game and so they can download it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! I couldn't put it down and just read the whole thing in 2 days! I can't wait to read the other 2!!! I highly recommend this book!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book second one I ever finished the first was the first book of the series I really like this book can't wait to read the last one
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever play.plz join the thousands of people that have downloaded this game.
B004H1U2HE|4.0|Set primarily in Jerusalem, and mostly through the eyes of a a precocious boy, this autobiography brings to life the Jews who lived in Jerusalem in the 1930s and 1940s, including those who emigrated from Eastern Europe.  It is not told in chronological sequence and we keep returning to the boy's love for his mother, a beautiful and brilliant woman, who died as a result of severe depression before the boy was fully grown.  Occasionally, it is a little tedious.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I bought this book only because my book group selected it.  I expected very little and in fact dragged my feet until almost the last minute before reading it this weekend.  My fears were completely unfounded.  This book is scathingly honest, brutally candid, courageous, and well written to boot.  Cheryl Strayed puts it all out there - the good and the bad, the flattering and the frankly horrifying - and tells a life story that any one of us should be proud to claim as our own.  Long live the Queen of the PCT!
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was a great film; I'm surprised I didn't see more about it when it was in the theater!  There are a ton of hilarious quotes in the movie, and overall it was a fun watch!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Superb!  Very easy to use and gives a lot of useful information. Probably the most useful of all of these apps.
B00005JOHC|1.0|The language was not in english. I couldn't find the spoken language specified anywhere on the package.<br /><br />You have to plat the DVD to determine that language wasn't english.<br /><br />So ended up returning for refund.<br /><br />Beware of foreign language.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book was jam packed with interesting information about how the food industry is basically preying on us.  It made me scared to eat any kind of processed food!  While it is hard to completely get away from processed food in our society, the extra awareness that this book provided made me a bit more conscious of the food I buy.
B004XISI4A|1.0|An interminable rambling devoid of any plot! Inordinately repetitive, laborious reading with no end. Quite what the dance with dragons was escapes me entirely.
0307744434|5.0|\\"The Night Circus arrives without warning.\\" Ah, I have snuck my copy into a fellow booklover's home, where she will come upon it without warning. It was an interesting book, but dragged out past where I really think the story was really done.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|This was one of those reads that when you finish it and set it down you will scratch your head and say, &#34;did I really just read that?&#34;  The setting was believable and realistic, with just enough detail to make it vivid without being boring.
1594744769|5.0|While time warps are not new, the home for &#34;peculiar children&#34; being involved with time warps make this a fun book to read and share.<br />The author and his friends gathered strange pictures of children from flea markets, garage sales, etc. and then the author used some of them for the characters in this book.<br />The other members in my reading circle are now really enjoying Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&#34; as much as I did.
B005HGZV6U|3.0|Good producto but the animation its not adaptes to BD<br />I got a Samsung tv And the experience was not all I expected.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Easy to use, great interface, much better than Google Reader. Easy to find and add content. Very well-conceived app. Visuals are very good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this second book even more than the first. Can't wait to read the third one, Christen and Ana, oh what they endure, so spectacular, sexy, intriguing,
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A story that embraces the love of humanity, tastefully and beautifully executed.  This film did not employ trendy gimmicks, violence or special effects and instead employed excellent acting that focused on the telling of the story.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|You build towers out of little goo balls... What is there not to love about this game?! You are out to save as many semi-sentient goo balls as possible by using them to create a tower that the other goo balls climb to the vacuum tube at the top to get to the next level. There's a great sandbox area as well, and the more goo balls you save, the more you have to play with in the sandbox level. Another one of those wonderful games, you must purchase!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Pretty good book. Took me no time to read. Definitely worth reading over watching the movie. overall,I would recommend it to others.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Absolutely worth getting as Free app of the day. I highly recommend supporting the developer. It's a well thought out fun and interactive game. The learning curve is not too steep, and the graphics are quite pretty in the HD version. I couldn't enjoy them quite as much on my phone as the screen size was barely 3.5 inches.<br /><br />Buy this game!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My grandaughter loved it and now she has her own girlie leggos. I would not recommend it for small children.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan and have been in need of something new from Peter Jackson. So, thank you Mr. Jackson for movie as great as your 3 Lord of the Rings movies!! And if you're not a fan, it may go on about an hour too long (so says my husband).
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is by far the best free game I've seen. It runs great on my phone, kindle, and a d2 tablet from big lots. I like the fact that you can touch or tilt to steer. Graphics are good and it has a different course almost every race. So there's a lot of replayability. Awesome game!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Not sure if I will have alot of use<br />for this on my Kindle but you never<br />know when it will come in handy.<br />You just can lose with this.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I peg this as more of a YA offering.  It is a fairly easy read, but it has enough mystery to keep it interesting.  This a good start to series.  The author developed everything broadly enough that there are lots of options for how the story could go.  The characters heve been develop well for a YA offering.<br /><br />I am interesting in finding out what happens in the rest of the story.  The good news is that I think the next book is already out, so I won't have to wait to find out what will happen next.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun, easy, addictive. And lives regenerate in just the right amount of time. Great game! Wish the time lasted a bit longer though. Or there was an endless gameplay option
B009GEDP26|5.0|enjoyed the show came in on the end and had to see it from the beginning. funny, interesting, and interesting show
B000002AGN|4.0|After Dave Brubecks passing one had to have his best, in your CD collection, it was easily welcomed and enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with pinterest!!:) I love this app. Sometimes it shuts down but it's worth it! I can find some of the neatest things on here!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I can saveit all right here!!! And I can view it whenever I need to..<br />You'll want this for yourself.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great book by Colleen Hoover, I loved the slammed series and now I can't wait for &#34; Losing Hope&#34;. You will not be disappointied!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is just addictive, initially you get to think like is way to easy but then it gets ver challenging. love it!<br />My son loves it 2 and is getting very creative on this
B000021YQV|4.0|I'm a really big fan of SOAD, This is a really amazing album. This is my second favorite album from them. Just wished they would make new stuff like they used too.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I loved that you could conquer the rooms and have a since of accomplishment.<br />Not only was it fun and a good way to keep your brain young but it was something<br />that you can snuggle with your love one and do together. Can not wait for more rooms.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every time a character dies now I cry and when there is trouble brewing I think I am getting as uppity as any character living at Downton Abbey - it is a part of me now and I can hardly wait for Season Four!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The beginning of this book picked up immediately at the same point where the first left off.  The resolution of the matter that concluded the first book and which began this book did not feel genuine.  The erotic nature of the story became repetitive & unoriginal as did the dialogue.. I also fear that due to the success of the first book, the author demanded a \\"no edit\\" clause in her contract because the grammar, phrasing, & continuity were not nearly as well written as in the first book.  It distracted from the story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season Two continues the best story line I have ever watched and I am recommending these wonderful characters to anyone who will listen
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book had a &#34;meet cute&#34; start and a fascinating insight into the BDSM world for the new & uninitiated.The character of Christian Grey was intriguing and the erotic scenes were fairly well done.  It had a logical and appropriate ending.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|The only reason I don't like it is because if you don't go home it makes you play again.when you loose it pops up on the screen like 10 times
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The complexity of the character who so intrigues the reader in Book One virtually disappears by Book 3. The trilogy ends with a trite happy ending and the novelty of the author's erotic fantasies has become repetitive and dull.  Again the quality of the writing has deteriorated from Book One and distracts from the story..<br /><br />I wish I had stopped at Book One.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This might have been a good 120 minute movie but, for some reason, the director decided to extend it to an unbearable 170 minutes.  The dinner scene alone seemed to stretch on into an eternity.  Not every movie has to be an epic.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|The knife came and did surprise me a little as to size and weight.  It is what it is advertized tobe, however for practical use, i only gave it 4 stars as it has only a few functions as a knife.  As a chopper or splitter, it will be fine but you will NOT be filleting any fish with this knife.  Too heavy to use as a Machete so it will not replace that funtion either.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is a great film and I watched it with my four-year old grandson last week. It kept his attention for the entire movie.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|I think this is only a good documentary about the capture of UBL. On the other hand, Argo looks like a real movie.
B00122RFRQ|4.0|So often Prog Rock fans forget that the genre in general can be limiting for the musicians who desire to continue to grow musically. Yes, this was the beginning of the evolution of Genesis going commercial. But, on its own this is a very strong recording with the band learning to deliver their music in shorter more concise, often in a more impactful format.<br /><br />RUSH, YES, and so many others wanted the ability to still create in the studio and realized that the days of having freedom to do a 2112 or Tales from Topographic Oceans were gone in the late 70's. Genesis saw that they wanted to be a band touring and in the studio and that they wanted to work together as three. Hackett left as did Gabriel and evolved in numerous directions as well. They needed to grow and moved on.<br /><br />I love this album as it has great work and concise elements in each song. Mike Rutherford is no Steve Hackett and has proclaimed this often; however his lead work is simple yet profound. I hated the more Pop Genesis after this album, but see this recording as an excellent work.<br /><br />Loved it back in the day and still to this day.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Got these as a gift and they came right in time! Boyfriend loved them. They are built nice and sound good.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Really easy to learn, quick to get upgrades and fun graphics. Great way to take a break for a few minutes ... or an hour.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I love this movie because of the great music, the story is acceptable, but the music mash ups are awesome. I have seen it at least 8 times in the last 3 months
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I bought this App for my 2-1/2 year old niece and she absolutely loves it.  It gives me an opportunity to help her with her letters as well as her dexterity.  And when she wants to give up, it helps me to encourage her to keep trying until she gets it right.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|A truly inspiring band. They truly capture the minds and souls of their audience and express themselves with great finesse.
B005FISBTO|2.0|I got the discs in a timely manner but discs 1 & 2 were the same. So there basically no disc #2 so I'm totally lost without the who set.
B00C0OOV5O|5.0|Update 4/1/13 just finished the last episode of tombs season 3. I cant wait to see what happens next. Seeing Adnrea go, well really wont miss her<br />I have a feeling the now much larger group will be leaving the prison. Time for Rick and Crew to get their own town. How lucky you are if you have not seen the whole series and you can now watch 3 seasons straight through! This is one of the most popular shows on Tv for a reason if you are on the fence. Do not hesitate to buy all 3 seasons and watch them, I will for sure be rewatching the whole series again start to finish in the future.<br />If you like end of the world stuff then this is of course a top 5 ever series for you, if you are just curious jump in you will love it, most negative reviews are because of people saying amazon downloading not working. I have had no problems myself.<br />I am a zombie fan first off I must disclaim. Still even if I was not this show is awesome maybe even better then the comic which I also avidly read.<br />If you are a zombie fan and have not watched it I dont think you are a zombie fan. For all others the characters, plot and post apolyptic world will draw you in and make you crave the next episode. The best shows out there for me are Spartacus and Breaking Bad. This show is equally if not even better. Watch every episode and let it develop, I am hoping for several more seasons although will be hard to imagine the show getting better then right now since the Governor episodes are also the best in the comic book.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I gave This Is 40 the benefit of the doubt. Even after reading bad to worse reviews, I gave it a shot because I was in the mood for a comedy and I thought even if this is not great it'll still be OK. I was wrong. This was just awful. It lacked a solid plot and despite moments that did make me laugh it just seemed like a sketch comedy experiment that went horribly wrong and dragged on about 90 mins too long.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is not my usual reading but it was highly recommended to me. It immediately drew me in to all the different characters and I cared about their lives. In an enjoyable format, it gave me some interesting facts about WWI history that I never knew. It also helped to understand how we get drawn into wars we really don't want to fight. I just wish humanity would learn more from the past wars instead of the continued fighting. Couldn't put the book down and also made for some interesting discussions with others.  It shows no matter what the nationalities, rich or poor,  we are all in the same boat when it comes to the love of our family and friends and our needs. I'm now reading the second book in the Trilogy and was disappointed to find out that I have to wait a while for the Third.
0811879542|5.0|This book is amazingly simple, yet so unbelievably creative.  I love that you and your child can read and experience it together, instead of just reading a book &#34;at&#34; your child.  It has become an new favorite of ours!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This is a &#34;hot&#34; season. Henry and Anne are well suited, however, she oversteps. I will miss her in the following episodes.
081243238X|5.0|What an adorable story. I had never heard of this book until I was invited to my future sister in laws baby shower and we were asked to bring a book instead of a card. This was his favorite book as a child. We hope it's hers too!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The scenery, the acting, and the wardrobes are wonderful. I can get no work done and I am sleep deprived because of watching this show.
B007L96SI6|5.0|This has to be one of the most under rated artists. Songs are original and catchy, love singing along to this on the way to work.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|I really love this movie and the songs in it!  Brings me back to the 80's!  I can watch this movie over and over.
0385333846|2.0|Slaughterhouse Five is a little book with big ideas, unfortunately none of them are very good. While reading this book, I couldn't help but think that the theme of anti-war was just a bi-product of a far more insidious philosophy. The combination of time travel, Billy Pilgram's ineptitude to cope with anything in his life, the inability of any character in this book to have any meaningful control over their own fate, and the patronizing Tralfamadorians who see time in its entirety (from beginning to end as opposed to the petty humans who only see time as a constant moving forward) all combine into a series of questions leading up to one question.<br /><br />What may start as a question to the validity of war, ends as a question to the validity of life. If one is not in control of their own fate, and if death will happen anyway, if time is introduced in its entirety - with a beginning and an end that we all know will happen, then the question does not become \\"What is the point of wars?\\". Instead, such premises have led me to a more horrifying one: \\"What is the point of living?\\".<br /><br />Slaughterhouse Five is not a book that questions the purpose of war. It is a book  that questions the purpose of any action that we take in our lives. Why try to change your life for the better? Why lose weight? Why study to have a good career? Why do you want to earn more money? Why should we care about religion? Why should we care about art? Why should we care about our future? Why should we care about life?<br /><br />The answer Slaughterhouse Five is nudging towards, but never fully reveals to the reader is that we shouldn't care about any of these things. We should just live our lives out as total and complete zeroes, without a care to improve our circumstances, because we live and we die, and that is life. What happens in between just doesn't matter (in the grand scheme of the universe).<br /><br />The tragedy here is that Mr. Vonnegut seems to profess that life is somethingthat we don't have much control over; that it is merely given to us. We arrive on this world, we live out our lives, and then we die. But I whole-heartedly disagree with this statement. In fact, I disagree with it so much that I would be willing to give my own life (in a war) to stamp it out. I'd do this, because life is a gift, and it is worth living to the absolute fullest. Anyone who professes otherwise, ought to be disregarded as trash (which is exactly where this book ended up after I finished it).<br /><br />I give this book two stars because it did provide some entertainment and made me laugh quite a few times while reading it. That and the fact that it was quick and relatively painless reading, which is something my life has been lacking for the past few months.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I have read 4 of DeMille's books and thoroughly enjoyed them with the exception of Plum Island. I think the story dragged mid- way to the end of the book.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I didn't expect too much from this flick, but was pleasantly surprised that it was very, very good.  Thumbs up!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I can't believe this product is free. It's a savior in today's world of a million websites and apps, each with different passwords. The notes section is also helpful and you can organize all of your passwords into folders. The best part is accessing your password vault from anywhere there is an internet connection. And I feel completely secure with LastPass.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I liked the app, but when I used it for my math home work it doesn't do fractions, so for that part it doesn't do well, but besides that it worked just fine .
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a beautifully written and very educational book.  I learned so much about both significant scientific developments and the ethical issues entailed, all against a historical backdrop that our public education often skims over.  I highly recommend this book.  It was enjoyable to read and the personal story woven in made it all the more compelling.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|This explains a lot about others I've known who were addicted.<br />HOPE THEY FOUND THE WAY OUT TOO!  HOPE you know you<br />ARE LOVED :)
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I am a patient person, and I like young adult fantasy. So I was willing to forgive some inaccuracies in spelling, ignorance of basic physics and cliche descriptions of her new world. But now that I am well into the fourth book, I am ready to throw in the towel.  After all her hints of ominous portent, could we please have the plot move forward?! This agonizingly slow pace has killed any desire to know what happens next. Why don't we just kill off the main characters and be done with it. They were shallow characters to begin with, and I just don't care about them anymore. Better yet, why doesn't Morgan Rice stick with vampire stories? I could write much better than this. I suggest you don't get started.

B002KDSBGA|5.0|I rented this to watch with my son after he (and I) read the book for an assignment.  This has always been a favorite movie of mine.  But after reading the book, the movie was even better.  I encourage anyone to read the book, as well as, watch this movie.  I also learned a little bit about the author, and that makes the story that much better.  Well worth your time.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|If you like Dave Matthews and Mumford and Sons you will love this CD!  Phillips sounds alot like both, but has his own unique sound too.  Well worth the money!
B000GCFO0S|5.0|This movie looks great in HD. I have not seen the movie in awhile but It's as good as I remember seeing it. only thing that bugs me about the blu-ray release is there is no special features that DVD has like making of the movie and such. I still enjoy my purchases. If you want to see the extra stuff then also get the DVD copy as you can also get those very cheap.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I expected the book to be much more entertaining.  I did not enjoy the humor.  My book club is reviewing the book and I will be interested to see other comments.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen.  It is the story of a drunken pilot, who while drunk, saves a plane from a situation that no sober pilot can when they ry to reproduce the accident on simulators(Doesn't say much for sober pilots..).  After spending most of the movie getting other characters to cover for his drunkeness, the pilot shows up drunk to his hearing and gets sent to jail.  One of the stupidest movies I've seen.
030758836X|3.0|I liked it. At least, I think I liked it, which is the point. Right? :) Very mysterious, very misleading. Who is the bad guy? Who deserves to be punished? Who deserves to live happily ever after? Does anyone? Does everyone?<br /><br />At first I thought this book was pretty shallow and dumb, but the more I think about it, the more I realized Flynn's messing with us. It took me a bit to realize it and to get into it. Once I got rolling, it was good. If you're stuck in the first quarter of the book, keep going. It will pick up. Give it a chance. Wait until Part 2 when everything is flipped on it's head. If it still doesn't catch you, don't bother finishing. Not a waste. I would probably read Flynn again.
B007SGM084|4.0|Wow!!! From the beginning to the end my emotions were hot to cold and laughing to sobbing. I felt each characters emotions as if the were my own and I was part of the story. I definite Good Read!

B006LSZECO|5.0|The review was originally posted at Library cat book blog.    [...]    Amy and Nick are celebrating the fifth anniversary of their marriage. Every year they play a game. Amy leaves traces and riddles, hints that lead to each subsequent trace. Each riddle is a reminder of the beautiful moments spent together. But this time, she's gone. Amy disappears. Without a trace, without a clue. While the police are looking for her, her husband is unexpectedly peaceful.    Little by little, the real story comes out. What it was supposed to be a perfect marriage in general, wasn't perfect at all. The husband had a mistress and the wife was not happy in the marriage.    What actually happened?    Did Nick kill his rich wife to get rid of her and keep her money?    Did Amy find her marriage life boring and decided to leave?    Is Amy kidnapped? In the past she had possessive boyfriend who followed her months after she terminated the relationship. In high school her friend was obsessed with her. Amy's parents were famous writers who created the famous children's series Amazing Amy. Lately, they lacked of money, and Amy had too much.    Where is Amy?    The story is told from two points of view: the one of Amy and the one of Nick. Two parallel stories, two views of five years of living together. After the story I was left speechless. \\"Is this possible?\\" How twisted can human mind be? It turns out that Amy is not Amazing Amy at all, and Nick is far from perfect husband. Nothing looks like as it seems.    Now I can see why this book is a bestseller. The author goes deep into the human psyche, in twisted human mind. Nick and Amy, two characters who are perfectly fit, two opposites that are basically same. This story makes you wonder what is the limit of human's sick mind? Do we really know the people around us?    This book left me speechless. I could not leave until I finished. I recommend to all who like psychological thrillers.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|I listened to this song like 30 times in a row! I'm so glad Amazon had it. Pretty good quality too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is great &amp; really fun .. really enjoyable! it feels like I have a real life horse ..
0062238868|5.0|This book was better than I expected.  I'm not a big reader but this book definitely kept my interest.  It's a shame that this amazing American lost his life the way he did.  Luckily he was able to get this book out in his own words.  Definitely would recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|We had heard so much controversy about this film, and are huge fans of the books, so were skeptical.  But the additions are wonderful, and the visuals are spectacular!  We loved it, and watched it twice during the 48 hour rental.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Lots of fun! Space invaderish. Some glitching on my RAZR, but actually added to the experience. You're going to beat the game with a little work, but it is ultimately satisfying.

B008GODP04|5.0|This book was the subject of review at our church.  I found the story very interesting and thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B0032JTV74|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed the singing and mixing of current music, the teenage drama wasn't expected, and we continued with the 2nd season for the singing as well
B009KEN87O|5.0|lt reminds me of space invader game which I played as first video game at 1979. But much advanced than at that time.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|It was fantastic.  Looking forward to getting the third season when it becomes available.  Also, thanks so much for the $5.00 rebate you gave me to match what other retailers were selling the second season for - much appreciated!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Good game but sometimes it is hard to manuvere around which stops me from going to another level. Maybe smaller and young hands can work it.
B007SGM084|5.0|The wife and I both finished the trilogy very quickly. We took these books everywhere. They were the talk of the town!!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|The ages of people in my family that has already paid this game is 7-60 yrs old. Needless to say our 7 yrs old great grandson was the first to score over 2million. Maybe I need to change my title since I have not broke the 2million mark yet.<br />Fun to play and I can be intense withit sometimes.
0767821629|5.0|Excellent! The video story was portrayed in an easy to understand format, and fits in well with the philosophy of Stephen Davis, author of BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE TO FLY, which I just finished studying. Anyone interested in that philosophy will enjoy this book immensely.
B00BF11STU|3.0|While it is something every American should see given what we went through with 9/11, it dragged a bit at times and they also spent a bit too much time on the torture aspect.
1609611543|3.0|It has more information on wheat than most people would want to know. Has very technical spots that are beyond my<br />understanding. However, it does explain why most people shouldn't eat wheat & what foods contain it even beyond the<br />obvious. I see now why there are so many &#34;Readers Digest&#34; versions on the market.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|An excellent film that keep both my husband and me on the edges of our seats.  We were on pins and needles every step of the way when those guys were getting out of there at the end.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Met all my requirements and expectations.  One of the best products out there for the cost and expectations for use.

B00280LYHS|5.0|WOW! This was one of the best series I've ever read! Im sad its over though. I can't wait to start the next series by Rick Riordan to see the next big adventure Percy and his friends go on!
0765325950|5.0|This book was amazing. The entire series is amazing. If you have been following Jordan's books from the start then you probably have already purchased this. If you are new to the wheel of time, you have probably experienced one heck of a ride up to this point. Hold onto your hats, ready your weaves or stances and get set for the ride's epic conclusion. Brandon Sanderson delivers it all and you will find yourself, like me, wishing that the wheel would keep on turning and that the ages would continue to come and pass.
1612680011|5.0|So far such a great read! And I don't read books often. Dive into this and become financially literate. A must read!!!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one of those books you want to read over and over. I read it several times as a child and just wanted to read it again.  Love this book!
B009G41CG2|3.0|It is an ok Mahjong.  Don't play it very much, because it sometimes hard to see and II like when they shuffle themselves.
B008Y6SA36|5.0|This is the best movie to watch if you live walking dead or zombie movies. Love the story line. Now I can watch it anywhere anytime I want.
B000I14UTS|3.0|I only was able to watch part of it, just couldn't get into the movie.  What I did watch was okay.
B009GRMH7C|5.0|Have always been a fan of Resident Evil. This is a good sequel. Loved it. So Happy I could buy and download to my Kindle Fire HD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is one of the best games I ever played. once I started I couldn't finish. I love this game!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery Manor invites you in to explore and that is what you want to do!  The game is quite engaging.  There is always some type of room to explore with objects to find and add to your collections.  There are also character quests to read about and carry out which makes MM much more interactive and fun.  The game does take some time though but that's the point (instead of just finding objects over and over again) and it's worth it.  I do think MM should give player diamonds as they play just like it gives coins because the majority of in game purchases have to be made with diamonds.  Graphics are very good also--seems as if you're standing right in the room!
B006LSZECO|4.0|More twists and turns here, even when you think you know what's going on.  Found it a bit slow going at first and then it suddenly changes and it's off and the twists and turns keep you guessing  - even when you think you know what's going on.  The ending felt a bit like the author couldn't decide which way to go.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Is missing some scenes from the commercials but great movie shows how married couples act when no ones looking lol
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Amazing writing, unexpected twists and turns. Flynn is right up there with my favorites of Eisler, Crais, Child, and Box!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I'll make this simple. I heartily enjoy this movie.<br />When &#34;Aliens&#34; came out, I was perhaps too young to note whether or not people simply complained it wasn't &#34;scary&#34; like the original &#34;Alien&#34;. I saw both when I was younger and &#34;Aliens&#34; was an action flick with some scare and &#34;Alien&#34; made me curious what was around the corner.<br />In as much as &#34;Alien&#34; isn't &#34;Aliens&#34;, neither is &#34;Prometheus&#34; either of these two films. For me, &#34;Prometheus&#34; is a beatifully filmed prequel that leaves just as many questions as the original did. There are holes in the movie that have us wonder what else could be. It is this sticking point that I believe turned many off, and I have grown to accept that.<br />In this modern age many of us seem to want answers handed to us. Maybe in the simplest we just want some cookie for our commitment. I cannot completely disregard this. It's part of the human process. &#34;Prometheus&#34; however gave that to me by delivering an interesting tale that, to me, was about those questions.<br />This film is not perfect and this flaw is most observed in the plot. That aside however, the audio and visual of the movie is top notch. If you're on the fence about this movie I would suggest disregarding EVERYTHING people tell you, including the majority of my views. Go out and rent this movie. See for yourself. Does it matter that this is or isn't a prequel? You should watch it to determine how you feel about that.<br />For me, I had to watch it for myself and I enjoyed it so much I picked it up on Bluray. I only own a few movies on Bluray. -Adam
B00A3K2PZA|3.0|KILLER JOE is a killer of a film: watching it makes you want to shower at movie's end just to get the slimy residue out of eyes and ears. It is difficult to believe that this was a stage play - the gore and brutality would be difficult to reproduce without  CGI. But then it comes courtesy of William Friedkin who has never been know for subtlety.<br /><br />The story is not terribly unique: a drug dealing kid Chris(Emile Hirsch) needs money to pay off a bad gambling losses and hires a  hit man who happens to also be a cop and a detective and is known only by Joe (Matthew McConaughey)  to kill his degenerate mother for her life insurance money which is to go to the woman's daughter Dottie (Juno Temple) who lives with Chris' and her dad (Thomas Haden Church) and her new sleaze bucket mother (Gina Gershon). Of course it all goes terrible wrong with beatings and broken promises and retainer deals, but the whole ugly family gets it in the end with a family dinner  that is unlike any ever seen in film endings. KFC chicken legs will never seem the same!<br /><br />Oddly enough the cast is so fine that it makes the entire grisly mess watchable. All five leads give spot on performances, so if it is acting skills for which you hunger, spend and evening with this showcase of talent who make these despicable characters just loony and foul enough to watch.  Grady Harp, March 13
B00BF123WG|4.0|This movie was basically a documentary with some obvious drama added to make a good movie.  Was very interesting, would be good to know how much was factual and how much was added for sake of movie.  Never the less is well worth watching.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|As a huge \\"Les Miz\\" fan, having seen the stage version probably 10 times, I was eagerly anticipating the film.  After Hugh Jackman's Oscar nomination and Anne Hathaway's win, I was certain it would be a fabulous experience. Had I never seen the Broadway productions, I may have been entranced, and so there is bias in this review.  Those who have never seen a performance on stage may be happy with the acting and the abbreviated snippets of song as well as the portrayals of the various characters.  So, here are the pros and cons from my viewpoint:<br />Pros:  Hugh Jackman manages to capture Jean Valjean's character, his fundamental decency, his heart.  He does a good job vocally, and he engages the audience even through the stilted, sung dialog.  You have to care about Jean Valjean, and thanks to Jackman, the audience does so.<br />  Eddie Redmayne is a perfect Marius!  This British actor is not well-known to American audiences but his is a breakthrough performance, and we are sure to see a lot more of him.  And--surprisingly--he's not only good looking (in a typically English way) but by golly, he can sing!<br />  Anne Hathaway deserved her Oscar. 'Nuff said.<br />  Cosette was well-done also, although she struggled a bit with the vocals.  Her looks--perfect!<br />  As others have mentioned, the script did manage to portray the Christian message of love as salvation, carried out through forgiveness, compassion, caring for others, humility, and grace.  Its all there, and it isn't overdone.<br /><br />Cons:  I assume the songs had to be truncated to economize on the length of the film, but sadly, this sacrifice felt to me like throwing away the popcorn and eating the box.  I very much missed the orchestra, and especially the musical themes that reappear throughout the score of the beloved stage show, interwoven with one another.  Some of the solos, like \\"Who Am I...Jean Valjean\\" really sacrificed a great deal emotionally because of being shortened and without the orchestration.  Ditto for Fantine's death solo.<br />  In most of the Broadway shows, the Innkeeper and his wife are portrayed very differently--more as buffoons, and less as slimy, lecherous harlequins.  When portrayed as rather doltish clowns, the Innkeeper's \\"Master of the House\\" number is a hilarious, audience-rousing, almost joyful highlight of the show.  It allows us to laugh a little at this couple's stupidity, greed, and self-deception.  Alas, that isnt the case in the movie version.  The scene comes off as grisly and distasteful instead, with the Innkeeper and his wife cast as outright sociopaths, rather than clueless victims themselves of poverty and illiteracy and their own limited life circumstances.<br />  What happened to The Pup?  He is so central to the final scenes of the Broadway version--an elfish, beguiling youngster, who just captures your heart.  That makes his songs at the barricade particularly engaging and his death heartbreaking.  This movie somehow misses the mark.  Another opportunity lost.<br />  Others have castigated Russell Crowe's performance of Inspector Javert.  I like Russell Crowe.  But he took on a script that made his character into a 2-dimensional, Snidely Whiplash character, and he wasn't up to the vocals.  What can I say. To appreciate his acting chops, check out \\"Master and Commander\\", in which he is every inch the British seacaptain.<br />  So, in the end, if you are looking for anything close to the stage performance, I'd save the bucks and buy another ticket to the real deal.  If you have never seen Les Miz and don't mind the Cliff Notes version, this could work for you.<br />But remember, you're getting a plain hamburger, not a Ruth Chris steak dinner :)
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|The Kindle Fire app mirrors the mobile app and web-based versions pretty accurately. it's one my most used apps. get it.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|I liked this movie since it came out oh so long ago. I think it has all the elements of a great action movie + great characters. James Cameron knows how to direct action movies!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It bogged down a little towards the middle of the book, but overall I would definitely recommend it; especially if you like survival stories.

B009FZFONO|1.0|This has become a soap opera more for 10 year olds with all their love of horror, blood, and gore. The first season was good, but from the second season on...it has sunk so low there is no saving it now. I've cancelled the rest of the season and won't be watching any further. What a disappointment for something that could have gone a whole nother way and been really great.
B004J5C2XA|5.0|I loved the Lowdown, I've seen most of the interviews that are on the CD but just wanted to have it in my George Michael CD collection. I love to listen to George's voice !!!!!  I can listen to this over and over again.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game. I play it after a long day at work. Very relaxing game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Much has been made about the accuracy/inaccuracy of details contained in the film.  The picture is not a documentary, so if they bent the rules here and there, who can really complain?  The first half is excruciatingly boring, as it creates a map of intertwining terrorist scum bags, some of whom are tortured to reveal info about Osama bin Laden.  The scenes are not always very pleasant but have a realistic edginess to them.  At about the halfway mark the film switches gears and finally becomes something like a docu-drama, with plenty of tension and action.  The film should have spent less time connecting terrorist dots, and more time on the team who would infiltrate Osama's little fortress and eliminate his life.  The malfeasance of the CIA was interesting, as was the many small errors made on the night of the raid.
B002VWNIAY|1.0|I have been unable to play the dvd on my player or computer as it appears to be using different protocols, probably for the American market. As I have opened the packaging I cannot return it. A complete waste of my money!!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This was an overly hyped 007 film.  It's a bit darker than the others, but, in my mind, dark does not mean automatically better.
1582406723|5.0|I really love the comics! I definetly recommend them for anyone who watches the show! It really helps clarify a lot o the stuff you see on the show.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I had to watch &#34;Prometheus&#34; twice before I felt like I understood 85-90% of what was happening in the plot.  The first time I watched it, I was disappointed.  I couldn't image Ridley Scott creating a film that was so utterly muddled and confusing.  The second viewing was better, but not quite redeeming.  Some profound ideas and subjects are introduced in the movie, but Scott seems to focus more on the horror elements.  Films with this ambition cannot help but be compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Unlike &#34;2001&#34; the characters do not behave like regular human beings facing a profound situation.  Instead, Scott has them running around, hurting each other, and acting as if they had escaped a &#34;B&#34; movie from the 50s.  I've given the film four stars because of its ambition and attempt to step beyond the ordinary disappointing sci fi film.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book id really awesome for kids especially kids that are 8-13 i love this book it is one of my favorites
0061122416|5.0|This story is an easy read, but very layered and profound. If you take the time to fully understand and analyze it, this book will change how you view your life and how close you are to realizing your full potential. If you think your life takes some unnecessary setbacks, if you feel like you are searching your Life's purpose (or as they call it, &#34;Personal Legend&#34;), or if you just need some reassurance that the world does want to you to succeed, READ THIS BOOK. It honestly changed my life and my outlook.
B007T99ENE|4.0|A dry book to start but gradually becomes totally engrossing. Not exactly a pleasure but wildly interesting! It's worth reading.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Never thought the movie could top the books, but the director of Game of Thrones did an excellent job, bringing this story to life. Even though not as &#34;bloody&#34; in its action scenes than the first season, the viewer can't stop watching, glued to the screen, one is almost disappointed when its over.<br />Loved every minute of it. Especially my favourite character - John Snow - keeps me addicted. Please publish the next DVD soon!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|The cases are interesting, most of the sub-plots are interesting and the characters are great.  Unlike a lot of shows it was good from episode one.  Enjoy!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was a fascinating book to read. I was very pleased with the work in this book. I would definitely give this book a five star rating. Children around the world's will absolutely love this book, I know I did. This book really tells a story of a young shy boy who becomes this brave and WONDERful young man. I recommend this book for everyone.
1476733953|1.0|I dont normally write bad reviews, but felt I needed to help prevent serious readers from wasting their time buying and reading this book.  I bought after reading in the Wall Street Journal and NY Times about what a publishing sensation this was - how it is the first book where the writer kept the ebook rights and only gave the physical book rights to a major publisher ( i think it was Random House but not sure).<br /><br />You can tell that it was meant to be a short story, then when the response turned out to be so positive, Howey kept going.  I can't blame him given how successful he has been, but clearly he did not have the talent nor the ideas to make it into a real book.  The science is laughably preposterous, even junior high school students should be able to see how his ideas don't work.  Read the excellent review by Karl below (he has the best one-starred review, much better than the book) to get a good idea of the problems with the book.  Also agree with him that it is a brazen ripoff of the City of Ember.  How people let this slide is a mystery.<br /><br />Whichever filmmaker actually decides to make this into a movie will be in for a catastrophic surprise.  If I am wrong about this then it is a testament to how PR can work miracles with total doodoo.

B007M45PMU|2.0|I thought if they had 2 good songs the others on the album would match. Not so. Some sound like me singing in the shower. Not fun. Some sound like my fraternity house at 3 AM on a Saturday night. I shoulda bought the 2 MP3s.

B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This one's definitely something different. Plenty of challenges, but not at a frenetic pace. The audio and visuals are all well done. It's a keeper.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have read this book four times over a period of twenty years.<br />Each time was as enjoyable as the first.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was such an appealing read that went into the depths of the relationships between slaves & landowners in early America. The characters were amazing and the events heartbreaking. A wonderful read.
0307887898|4.0|Changes your opinion on startups and influences thinking in a positive way.  Very interesting and Ries delivers a very professional and experienced perspective.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I'm one of those guys who LOVED the Lord of the Rings trilogy and saw the video of the Hobbit in elementary school.  So, I was eager to see what director Peter Jackson was going to do with the story.  he didn't disappoint.  Jackson sticks to the script and brings it to life with the help of Characters from the previous films such as, Ian McKellen.  I gave the film 4 stars.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I think this game is ok because it has great graphics in all but when ever I jump it does something else and that frustrates me but you should totally get it its a good FREE game cause if it wasn't i would deffenetly not get it but you should Denver its free.
B00BF123WG|3.0|After hearing all of the rave reviews and seeing the Oscars on television.  I decided to check out Zero Dark Thirty.  The film is about a CIA operative played by Jessica Chastain who ultimately tracks down the hated Osama Bin Laden.  Like Chastains character the movie is slow and methodical and leaves you, at the end, feeling tired and feeling like you need to retire with full honors from the CIA.  I gave the film 3 stars.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|This album was purely ahead of its time.  With interesting flows, and sick beats, Cudi manages to go through the Daydreams and Nightmares of his life and face them head on.  He has a wicked knack of wording and has guest appearances from group MGMT (which was a huge bonus in my book!!!)
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Simply put JT is doing his thang!  From a musicians standpoint.  This is Justin Timberlake's greatest work.  My favorite tunes from the album so far are:  Pusher Love girl, suit and tie, strawberry bubblegum and That Girl.  Production on the record is first class.  This is a joy to hear
B009Y4JGFI|5.0|Calvin Harris is a musical God who is able to turn a simple track into a dance masterpiece!!!  This is definately one of those cds where I can listen to the entire album straight through without changing a track.  One of the best albums I have ever purchased.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Ok the movie is amazing right so you'd expect a great amazing song........well you will not be disappointed. Even if your not a mariah  Carey fan (like myself) you will still love this song. Her vocals are simply perfection. I can picture myself being almost home just listening to her sing this beautiful song. Over the rainbow by Judy garland was a perfect match for wizard of oz and almost home is the perfect match for oz the great and powerful. Watch the movie listen to the song and. E swept over the rainbow.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Loved the story...more realistic then a megalomaniac trying to take over the whole world and great insight into Bon's life.  Certainly sets up the next movie!  can't wait to see it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|from beginning to end ,an insightful,suspenseful movie that excites the mind and visceral senses.I highly recommend even for movie phobes like myself.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|Greatest version of the Shakespearean classic! A must see 4 shakespeare fans! Kenneth Branagh is amazing, perfectly walks the line as Hamlet, between madness and genius!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just wish it would have been a smidge longer expanding on her decision after reading the letter but it was still a wonderful page turner!
B008Q0AZVK|3.0|Ok movie, beautiful film. worth watching just to see the cinema photography. Acting is well done, passion and hatred abound, but the real treat is the juxtaposition between the color and beauty of the scenes in the film and the deep darkness and ugly truth of the class system of that time.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is one of the movies I went to see last summer on opening night and loved it. It was just like batman Begins it had a plot, unlike The Dark Knight. I liked the Dark Knight, but who needed a plot when you had the introduction of the best performance of Heath Ledger, as The Joker. He made that movie and it is unfortunate he is gone now, may he RIP. I believe if it would have not been for him as The Joker it would have been a total flop. Thankfully it wasn't and The sequel The Dark Knight Rises was a great come back. I believe we will have a 4th and The Introduction of Robin will come into play, I hope so. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves superhero's especially Batman. It is a great comeback and I have a suspicion this will not end as a trilogy :D.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B002R5LKOQ|4.0|Good end of the 20th century flick, slightly cheesy acting at times but a good movie to watch bored or trying to fall asleep
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A very moving story with great photography. Good for all audiences. At times the audio was difficult to understand but we did not find this distracting.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written. Sick characters. Author must have some experience  or knowledge of psychos. Not sure if I recommend this book to Any one with any problems. Not a happy thought in there. I WAS<br />intrigued and anxious to see where book was going. Disappointed in ending.  Sick sick sick
B003H4I4JU|4.0|It was a very different book from Enders Game,but still very good. I have heard good things about xenocide,but i think this story is imperative to understand Xenocide,
0345529057|5.0|I'll admit it, I came to read the books as an aftermath of seeing the television series. Purists shame away. George R.R. Martin is a literary artist, using a variance of both broad and articulate verbal strokes on the canvas of each page. There are honestly times that I had to stop just to imagine his visualizations and how fantastic they truly are.<br /><br />I recommend the series to all readers; from those looking for the next great series to fall in love with, down to those such as myself, who found themselves hooked upon the television series.
B007S3S8HO|3.0|While this toy looks like a pretty good hybrid for angry birds and K'Nex lovers, you'll spend more time cleaning it up and setting it up then playing with it.  The beauty of Angry Birds is that you can destroy without the consequences of cleaning up after yourself.  This toy has me sympathizing with the pigs, all of that work just to be toppled by three birds or less.  As the mom of two kids who enjoy K'Nex and lego, I am used to picking up and stepping on tiny little pieces of similar sets regularly.  But the effort on this toy far exceeds the enjoyment you experience by using it. It made 176 pieces feel like a thousand. My kids also really didn't develop the knack for the launching or the re-building, so it doesn't allow for much independent play.  Even though they love angry birds, and they enjoy K'Nex, they gave up on this one fairly quickly.
B0016K40KO|5.0|My younger brother liked this movie because of the whistling.  He could never catch it with his DVR, so I bought it for him.  He loved it.  good wholesome fun for the entire family.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome book, I liked it better than Harry potter, maybe.<br />I am going to read the other books by the author
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This was a complicated tale.  The hero and the heroine are trying to make ammends for their respective pasts.  When they meet and the spark kindles those deep driving feelings they must ignore them to protect themselves from their sordid secrets.<br /><br />This author did a great job of presenting society and handled the dialogue quite well.
B003PIUALI|4.0|I would have never heard of this movie if it hadn't aired on cable constantly back in the 80s.  Great for any young kid that likes video games.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Hey not much to say, works, and it allows you to install and backup APK files. Since the amazon store doesn't have all the apps sometimes you need to do that to get apps loaded on a kindle. This sort of program should not be needed, it should be a default part of the OS but sadly apple made simple things like this unpopular so I guess everyone follows.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Super fun game, can't stop playing it.  My favorite game.  Never freezes or has any issues.  You will like this game!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's Google no need to say anymore. Easy to use and it is very accurate. A must for anyone who loves to surf.
145150506X|5.0|i just love this book..he was so creative and i just love that it so complete no other books to buy
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Boring until the last quarter. Then grrm sets the hook for the next book.<br />Thank you ser may I have another.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie but wish this instant movie was in wide format instead of letter box in 4;3 format.  So not good for 16:9 TVs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As with the 1st book, I could not put this one down either. It had so many shocking twists and turns. I loved it and I know that I will not be able to stop reading the next one. Can't wait. Such a good book.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|classic star crossed lovers story. I enjoy a good romance and throw in some fantasy,mystical tales, and sword fighting and what could be better. Michelle Pfiffer is beautiful..rutger haur is rugged and a yound matthew broderick is naive and heartfelt funny. I introduced this story to my 11 year old son and even he said &#34; i liked it alot more than I thought i would&#34;. A film that you can actually watch the the entire family.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Love Gilmour. With this quality is like having him playing in my room. I highly recomend it. Hope he brings new material
B00BFTV09K|4.0|An interesting and well documented book on the rise of the processed-food behemoths. I'm coming out out the book even gladder than I was before about living in France (on that front anyway): We are a country obsessed with what we eat, its origin and the base products that are its sources, so we are resisting the onslaught of processed food a bit better than elsewhere.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|There's no ending. This was a waste of time. It floors me that this movie was even available to buy.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|We watched this movie as soon as it was available here and just love it. Such a great movie. Can't wait to watch it again!
B00418NVMQ|5.0|If your a fan this is a must, dvd is sic! This is a great band! Lizzy and the boys bring it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This felt different in a good way. I felt more included with the rest of the realm and enjoyed the quick pace compared to previous books.
B008I34XX6|5.0|This movie is based on a great novel. Peter O'Toole gave one of his best performances, along with a fine supporting cast.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|my sister plays this game and i didnt think id like it but now i cant put it down. It's now one of my favorites to play.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|such a great book. fell in love with it! truley sad but also somehow full with life. one of the best books
6305692572|5.0|Love this movie. I showed it to one of my parenting groups for women in recovery and they also enjoyed it. Love the acting and the story and I would definitely recommend this to other therapists who work with individuals in recovery that are trying to learn about how addiction impacts relationships of all kinds.
B001QFZADA|5.0|I am not quite through with this book but have learned what my love languages are and am still trying to figure out the love language of my significant other.  Great reading for singles!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is really well done. The graphics and sounds are great, no major issues with intrusive advertisements (all ads go into a small mailbox you get in the game), and there's a lot to work towards. I've been playing it about a month and still haven't gotten bored with it. It good for both players who want to play all day ever day or those who can only check in on their park so often.  You aren't penalized if you miss playing it one day. You gain coins and XP quickly in the game, but still gives you lots to work towards.<br /><br />You start out with an empty park and go from there. You clear land, find amber and research it to discover dino DNA. You then save up enough money to place the dinosaurs. You also place buildings, decorations and roads. Tourists come through your park and video everything, earning your exhibits money. You'll run into interesting side missions along the way, and usually have several going at the same time. So you don't get bored with working on just one goal.<br /><br />After a month of playing, I still have a long way to go, but also still feel like I've accomplished quite a bit in the game. Most games are interesting for about 2 days, then get repetitive, boring or require money to get to any of the better features. There are a few games that will always keep you coming back. This is one of them. Great gameplay with lots to do. I love it!
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Don't know why writers have to pick on Christianity so bad to build a story line but its common now. Regardless he write a good tale that is interesting and keeps you reading way later than you should!  Lee I dare you to make a Christian pastor a hero in one of your books. In your research you might find the path to eternal life!  Reacher definitely needs it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book so much the ending was great and I'm happy we find out what happens in the years to come and flash back to what Christian right about Anna was very good :)
B009M4KTEM|5.0|Very happy with this album.  It's a bit tough to find the JGB albums so I'm happy a new one got released.  Great Show!  Good set list.  And EXCELLENT audio quality.  I'd recommend!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After the first few chapters you get used to the author's style.  You are not sure where he is going until you get into things.  Having read Game of Thrones recently I would say Sanderson does a good job creating original material without stepping on too many toes.  It seems hard to be a fantasy writer these days without copying Tolkien or Martin.  Pick this up and enjoy!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I've been a Trekkie from the beginning, I am an avid sci-fi fan. This was the best Star Trek yet.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was born in 1954 and became a Kennedy History Buff and conspiracy theorist. After reading this and Killing Kennedy I'm ready to settle into the plain truth.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|Absolutely loved the movie since it is in line with his previous works. Can't go wrong with Sasha Baron Cohen. A+ all the way.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|When I saw the 3 star rating this movie was sporting on the Roku's Amazon app, I almost thought twice about ordering it, but I'm glad I did. It was a lot of fun to watch a story I read as a child coming to life on the screen. I especially enjoyed the singing. Tolkien wrote music to go along with the book, but how would we ever have heard it if it were't included in the film? I mention this because I saw a review complaining about this aspect of the film and calling it a musical. I like that there were humorous elements added to the movie. I like it even more that the humor didn't overpower the seriousness of the story.<br /><br />Least favorite scenes: 1) While the fighting rock giants were cool to watch, the scene felt like it had been slipped in at the last moment for the wow factor. There was no lead-up. The viewer is just suddenly thrown into the action. 2) The big bird thing again. So predictable.<br /><br />Favorite scenes: The dwarf dinner party. The Gollum encounter.<br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to the next installment of The Hobbit, and so is my wife. I liked this so much I want to go out and buy a copy of the book to read again.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Three stellar performances bring to light a critical moment in British and world history: the unorthodox process by which King George found his voice and led his people.<br />What led me to have a second look at this film was the segment with the final speech. Set in a room away from everyone else save the King, Colin Firth, and his therapist, Geoffrey Rush, the speech, full of 'majestic' pauses, demonstrated that indeed, one can overcome stammering given proper support. The twining of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, 2nd Movement, interspersed with both the cadence of the speech, and the glimpses of King and King maker makes for a never forget moment.<br />I liked the history. It was not stuffy. The future, and current, Queen Elizabeth is portrayed with her sister Margaret, both as young girls, sitting on a floor playing with their dogs. Actually, all the women who were in this film were outstanding. Helena Bottam Carter, the present Queen, delightfully portrayed  both accessibility and regality, in turn. Even the small glimpses we see of the Queen Mother, provide insight into Royal life. And even Wallace Simpson was portrayed in a jazzy, self possessed light I had not thought of as her. Principals and support cast alike, all so well done.<br />Not soon forgotten.
0486278077|4.0|Dorian Gray had never recognized his own beauty until it was pointed out by Lord Henry Wotton, a slightly acerbic character. As Lord Henry pointed out, flowers will continue to bloom and show their beauty, but at some point Dorian will lose his own. It is not until Dorian looks upon a portrait that artist Basil Hallward paints of him that he fully understands these implications. He says, \\"How sad it is...It will never be older than this particular day of June...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!\\"<br /><br />After this plea, life goes on for Dorian. Yet he finds that somehow his plea was not unheard, and it is the picture that takes on his age and his sins. Years go by, and Dorian stays the same outwardly, but ruin follows him--and people notice that whoever is close to him is somehow ruined as well.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book that focuses on inner versus outer beauty, vanity, and the question of whether it is better to gain beauty if one would lose his soul.<br /><br />While some of the dialogue is tedious, the plot is engaging.<br /><br />Note: Ivan Albright, an American painter, created the painting \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" which shows the portrait's portrayal of what Dorian would have looked like. It is rather gruesome but intriguing. It was hanging in the Art Institute of Chicago, and it is the main reason why I had always wanted to read the novel.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The biggest takeaway I learned from the book was that habits become automatic and creates a craving for that behavior. I was looking at habits completely wrong. My assumption was that it takes unending discipline to make a habit stick. Now I know that with the right rewards they become automatic.<br /><br />I never understood how I was able to wake up and work out at 5 am. When asked how I had no idea. There just wasn't any other choice. My alarm went off and I went to the gym without thinking about it. Now I realized I created a habit loop.<br /><br />This book reads like a novel by adding new story lines and then tying them back together. I couldn't put it down. Duhigg teases you into reading further to find out the conclusions. Towards the end of the book I was totally creeped out since I read the chapter about gambling on my flight back from Harrah's in Vegas. Why didn't I get to that chapter before blowing all my money ;)
B006LSZECO|3.0|Once again over-hyped and just an okay book-I liked it but expected so much more. It was basically the same crazy woman story told another time.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|A + + + + + + +  very great item ,,, recommended . A + + + + +
B00ATPVA78|4.0|So far so good. I don't like the way they beg for a review,though.  Looking like I'll probably buy it. What more to say?
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I love this old fashoned version of Robin Hood!  It's just as good no matter how many times I watch it.
B000002QWD|5.0|Brings back good memories of what Christmas is all about. Song by the only one who can do it. Great price.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 was even better than season 1.  I just downloaded season 3, and I can't wait to start watching it.
B0000024PC|5.0|Added to my collection. Acting was wonderful in this film. Love Ann Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman and loved the soundtrack.
B004IPPINW|4.0|I started this book during an international trip and flew threw it - helped the 16 hour trip go by quickly. The dialogue and style of writing is very fun to read.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Great.  Like. What I ordered.  Thank you. I am one person that. Don't go. For answering a bunch of questions
B000002VFW|3.0|After years of co-hosting children's show's in her native UK,Lisa Stansfield began her journey into recorded music as a member of the band Blue Zone in the late 80's. Shortly after their breakup she received a solo contract from their label Arista and began working on her debut album. In the final year of the 1980's there was a movement in England,pioneered by individuals such as Terence Trent D'arby,of the Brit soul movement looking to mid-late 70's cinematic disco-era soul/funk/dance records as the main inspiration for their sound. In retrospect you might say it was the early stirrings of what evolved into the neo soul sound over the course of the upcoming decade. For Stansfield here,her key inspirations were very much the style of Barry White with a good dose of Gamble & Huff. On the other hand,her debut album represents to me a creatively interesting twin legacy of the era in which it was recorded.<br /><br />  The album begins with her best known song \\"All Around The World. It's clear that across that,\\"This Is The Right Time\\",the title song,\\"Poison\\" and...almost every other song on the album she favored a sound that was based in slower paced funky rhythm with a lot of string orchestrations and pensive minor chord changes throughout the songs. On \\"What Did I Do To You?\\",\\"The Love In Me\\" and to some degree \\"Live Together\\" you hear the embodiment of the technoish house-disco/soul grooves that basically defined uptempo dance/club records for much of the 1990's and even into the beginning of the next century. \\"Lay Me Down\\" and the closer \\"The Way You Want It\\" look to bridge a gap in keeping with a than contemporary variation on the late 70's disco-dance/funk hybrid sound. The biggest stand out is Stansfield's pipes and songwriting; she's a bubbling soul crooner one moment and a throaty funky diva the next, often in the same song. Also her songwriting is both musically and lyrically reflective and romantic.<br /><br />  As for the reason why I give this album an atypically middling rating has to do with the instrumentation. I've always been an enormous defender of the electronic nature of music production in the 1980's that irritates the majority of music lovers. Especially when said sound was used in either an organic way or the synthesizers/computers were just allowed to be what they were. To me anyway the overall sound of this album's production suffers from the same syndrome that was very typical of most dance oriented soul/R&B/funk music of the new jack/house/hip-hop era of the late 80's/early 90's. While the focus is appropriately on the vocals,songwriting and orchestration the music backing her up doesn't fully come into focus. Every song on this album basically attempts to get a Barry White/Philly soul type instrumental sound from electronic keyboards as well as synthesized bass lines and horns that sound totally artificial. In fact,I'd even say sounding like an inexpensive Casio of that era. It has the flavor of music one might hear during 1990-91 on the video monitors shopping for clothes and shoes at the local mall. And for someone with her song writing and often extraordinary vocal abily Stansfield deserved a lot better than that.ically middling rating has to do with the instrumentation.

B000W4D94I|5.0|I watched this with my mom the first time and wow, It likes like the real thing, I have saw a lot of twisters and this movie looks real.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Well written and had a good plot.  Even though I could figure out the ending early on, it was nice to see how it unfolded. I enjoyed this book very much!
B000005RXH|5.0|This album has all the best elements you might expect from the group.  While it has no top 40 type hit material, it definitely fulfills the requirements in my book for getting the highest rating.  The songs are well written and the performance of each band member is outstanding.  I would rate nearly every Supertramp album with a four or five star rating, but this one is one of my favorites.  My list would go like this:  #1) Breakfast in America  #2) Even in the Quietest Moments  #3) Crime of the Century  #4) Indelibly Stamped  #5) Famous Last Words  #6) Supertramp  #7) Crisis? What Crisis?  and all others after that...
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I should know better than to believe Reviews from Amazon/friends of authors etc.  This book was nothing like I thought it would be.  It had an ok beginning and the writer was great in the mind of a high school student but really the story held no weight.  Holder, what a name ended up living in the same neighborhood, shopping at the same store and then they end up running together.  Please!  The story just got<br />more trit from there. The circle was too close and the likelyhood of this or anything like really happening is slim.  I need to get recommondation from friends not from people amazon pays to write reviews so I end up spending my hard earned money/time on books that are worth the time and energy.
0385040253|5.0|bought this for a friends b-day and he loves it. Great wealth of information about knot tying. Can't go wrong.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Movie was a bit long, could have been easily edited to be shorter, especially in the beginning.  Overall, considering all the hype, was kind of disappointed.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I really enjoyed seeing the characters of the first book affecting the story of their off springs and the out come of their journeys.  Often when a good book ends, I never really feel a closure but with Mr.  Follett's stories, I did feel complete<br />closure and a big sigh of pleasure.  BC
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Loved the LOTR trilogy but because of high expectations, I was a little disappointed but still enjoyed it. Lot of great scenes and lot a bad scenes. This is the Phantom Menace of LOTR.<br /><br />Personal Pros:<br />- Best Blu Ray 3D movie ever made. Even better than Avatar and Titanic.<br />- Great sound if you have surround sound hooked up.<br />- Character CGI was great for the most part.<br />- Some nice actions scenes.<br />- Loved seeing some familiar faces, places, and items returning.<br />- Actor Martin Freeman did a fantastic job as Bilbo.<br /><br />Personal Cons:<br />- Most of the CGI backround settings around the actors were just horrible looking and fake. Didn't mesh well. Was very spoiled by the many real buildings and backrounds made from the scratch from the original LOTR movies.<br />- Interaction and scenes from the Trolls was just plain stupid and dumb. Worst thing is that they talked. Was annoying.<br />- Love Gollum. However, the scene was dragging on way way too long. Ended up being very stupid and boring. I just wanted it to end. Went nowhere.<br />- Didn't like the Goblin King. Was just plain annoying and stupid. Shouldn't have made him talk in english. Just use to the main baddies from the other LOTR movies were fearful and badass.<br />- Way too many dwarfs to keep track of. No room for any character development. I don't remember most of their names. If one was missing, I wouldn't miss any.<br />- Felt like a they made a kid's version of a LOTR movie like the Phantom Menace.<br />- Don't know what was wrong with the audio on the 3D disc. I got the music, sound, and effects. The audio from all of the talking was muted or cut in and out most of the time. Exchanged it and same result. Tried everything in my PS3 settings. The sound worked fine for my other new released movies I just watched. I had to turn off my receiver and watch the rest of the movie just in stereo sound from my TV. Too bad cause the backround sound is great in Digital Surround Sound. Have to watch it again in 2D.ound Sound. Have to watch it again in 2D.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|obvious knockoff of the original but still just as fun. Would have been 5 stars if had the butterflies from the original game.
B005IZNM0W|5.0|My grandson lost his Max and it was a gold star for me, to be able to replace it.  I was unable to find one in any of the local stores.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I finally rented this movie at a Redbox a few days ago (I know, I waited 5 years to see it), and (surprise!) it is now my favorite movie!<br />I really loved Roberty Downy Jr. in Sherlock Holmes, and he only makes himself more likeable in the Iron Man movies.  It's definitely worth a few bucks to own this one!<br />If you like any of the following qualities in a movie, you'll like Iron Man:<br />-Lots of action<br />-Funny lines<br />-Good acting<br />-Everything else that a good movie has to offer;)<br />So . . . yeah that's pretty much it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|These characters are very twisted and I could not wait to find out what they would do next to each other.
B00138H876|5.0|Classic songs when a great song was TRULY a great song. Dylan was so prolific, but he had a lot to say. Even when what he was singing about seemed inconsequential, his way of saying it made it matter.
B00B1C39AY|3.0|Why on earth would DM open an album with such a weak, slow, sleepy song. The b-side however is great, even has a bit of Black Celebration bits. Hoping for some better tracks on the rest of the album.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|After an update, facebook would not open properly.<br /><br />I only downloaded again to clear the lock-up.  It worked.<br /><br />I'm not a huge facebook fan.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Good flick, easy to keep up with, must see for mathew fans. Although not a lot of ah-ha moments. But still a decent movie.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This was a present for the wife at Christmas.<br /><br />It is amazing how much mun it is to have your own BBT marathon.<br /><br />Prompt shipping.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Worth the money! Love listening to wings while I play basketball! His lyrics are truly poetic! Shark face gang. Buy it!

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|You will love this game and will want to play it all the time it will only let you play for 15min. on each world and then you will have to make a new world but other than that it is great.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|marvelous portrayal of solution to a seemingly insoluable problem, brought on by fate, but ameliorated by kindness and sophistication of several concerned caregivers of various ssorts.

B00B49L7JY|5.0|Wish I could have watched it but amazon came up with some reason for an upgrade and I couldn't watch it eventhough I paid for it.  I'll go to blockbusters.  I advise the  same.
